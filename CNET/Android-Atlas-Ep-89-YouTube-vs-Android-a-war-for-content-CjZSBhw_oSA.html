really and Google fails to entertain all
that more in this week's episode of Wow
welcome to android Alice 4 March 14th pi
day 2012 I am Justin a house along side
jmark VV hello hello and special guest
Jessica Doyle court hello glad to be
back welcome as always we're glad to
have you so let's start out with you
there I hear I hear things about samsung
galaxy s2 a solid phone coming to us l
yer tell us more um well uh actually
this phone came out almost a year ago or
a little bit more than a year ago that's
when it first came out and it's on every
carrier except for Eisen in some sort of
iteration it's okay that it's not on
verizon because it's on AT&amp;amp;T twice in
two different sizes and one of them is
the lte-enabled skyrocket or galaxy s2
skyrocket anyway so it has come to u.s
cellular and although it is sort of the
priciest phone on US cellular's lineup
it's also easily their best one so US
cellular is the nation six largest
carrier and right now but it's also
national so we're here in San Francisco
actually outside of their like home
footprint so it roams while you're here
so I tested out roaming and you know
there are all these fancy flashy new
phones I saw some quad core phones at
Mobile World Congress and I have to say
you know you put this phone back in my
hand and I still like it it is a really
good phone and I think it's one that is
definitely gonna last do you really want
to pay with its 229 after one hundred
dollar rebate right a year old phone
listen well if you are a loyal US
cellular customer then yea well you have
choices but
but you know I think it is the best
phone that they have on offer and US
cellular has several programs that are
perks for consumers their customers to
keep them from traveling off to other
carriers and offering a good phone will
be one way to do it another way to look
at it is a well for example you know
they've got well they've got some plans
but anyway um it just seems very it's
it's odd to from a you know certainly
we're leading edge people here but
thinking about like I'm going to buy a
year old 3g phone for two hundred and
thirty dollars at a time when verizon
has have didn't they commit to only
releasing LTE phones 4g phones for the
rest of the year it's it's true but
perhaps that's why US cellular is number
six and not number three I mean they
trail behind metropcs at number five
metropcs offers i mean frankly I would
rather buy this phone than anything on
metropcs so it's it's not trying to be a
top to your carrier but it is trying to
be a carrier of value angeling sorry
good so for all the loyal US cellular
folks out there all 24 of them this is
there certainly there one of their best
choice yeah they're saying right yeah US
cellular doesn't have a lot of markets I
would have to confirm this but I think
it's somewhere like 24 markets or 26
markets there are they like a niche
carrier where some markets it's only
u.s. cellular that has good service or
something like that I mean there's
there's always going to be some corner
of the u.s. that only operates on one
carrier my sister lives in the mountains
like at the top of a mountain and she
only gets AT&amp;amp;T she has a choice of one
makes it really easy though right yeah
all right well if you want to read the
review of the galaxy s2 on US cellular
it's on our site you want me to read it
right now I'm review yes let's just it's
a we should do that audio review Oh God
just maybe if J bar uses his radio voice
that i use my radio voice what's up
everybody so you brought one more thing
with you which is your google pins from
over
Congress I did I will attempt to do tion
I do show my hands and put them up in
front the camera I should have had this
ready so Google had this kind of cool
system where you have to go to different
Google then partners booths to get these
pins you couldn't there's 86 of them I
think you said and so you had to go from
partner depart or listening to their
pitch to get more and more pins and so
yeah exactly was it Mobile World
Congress the second year they've really
done this like so Blues Brothers guy
yeah I like it too it's sort of like a
barter system and I actually took
pictures of their booth as well I this
was last year yeah it was really fun
they basically had like their booth was
just crazy and decked out they were
giving away actual android ice cream
sandwiches like with chocolate cookie
and vanilla ice cream on the inside I
have a picture of me biting into one of
those two they had a smoothie bar they
had a dry head they had a dry it slide
they had an android tablet controlling
one of those claw machines um and you
get a stuffed flushy uh that's your
prize it was really cool I mean I went
on the last day and oh they also had
like a robot making back covers it
almost looked like bedazzling that's the
robot right now if you're watching the
video that are sort of like picking up
gems and then like gluing them on to the
back of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus back
cover and you could you could win it so
you have to draw you know win the
drawing and then win it I'm everything
that could be googled out was there was
sort of like this lazy river of all of
the phones all of the android phones
that they had ever released oh it was
just insane and I went on the last day
and it's a ghost town everywhere except
the Google booth how was the slide I
didn't go on the slide so I didn't get
my pen the wine was too long and unlike
some people I had real work that I still
had to do but um I mean it was amazing I
went because I'm like okay finally I'll
be able to actually check this out but
the lines were still really long and it
was it was great so it's this genius
barter system where yeah you have to go
to the partners you can't just get them
and in order to get yours from the
google
if you have to go down the slide get a
photo of yourself taken and go pick up
the photo and then you get your google
pin and like people were walking around
and it was like a drug deal you know
like hey hey you're trading any pins you
trading pins what do you got here's what
I've got you know opening up the jacket
but you had lanyard and some of the
badge holder basically lanyard
absolutely full pin like that you know
that guy in the end never brokered a
deal because he was looking for
something very very specific but you
have some people who manage to get their
hands on multiples and so they would
maybe keep one and then trade their
multiples for something else wow they're
all on ebay now it's just insane they
might be it's like there's no prize
except bragging rights and being like
look at all my cool pins we're so cool
we should get some Android avila's pins
made it they are really cool we'll get
on that yeah uh will give us will have a
secret word each episode and then you
have two and four that somewhere it's
one of him so word today is radio voice
ah so that is a very clever and
entertaining strategy then I really hope
they do it at Google i/o actually we
shall see but you know we're cool has
failed to create a lasting entertainment
strategy is in there YouTube and Android
world's ecosystems you will yes if I had
a drink today I would drink so there's
actually a pretty interesting article by
her own Greg Sandoval about Google's
entertainment strategy and he calls it
in disarray and the premise here
basically is that you know with the
Google Play announcements they have sort
of I almost say killed google music
they've sort of folded in to something
else in Google TV he calls an
embarrassment his word not mine youtube
may lose music videos today through
their deal with VEVO fifo may go to
facebook and you know the premise is i
think that you have YouTube pursuing
their entertainment strategy around
music and movie rentals
and you have Android pursuing it so you
have sort of two separate groups you
know led by two separate people Andy
Rubin is leading negotiations with these
entertainment companies on one side and
you have I kinkle i think is the other
guys on kinkel yeah right the YouTube is
that how you pronounce it I was like kim
Phil I don't know I just we met will get
email uh-huh we just mispronounced
things on purpose to piss people off
because otherwise we'd get no email and
you know we're gonna I gotta get it
somehow anyway they're pursuing two
different strategies right and we were
talking about this before you were like
hey I'd rented a movie on my android
tablet with google play and that was
pretty cool experience I was like it's
kind of cool but then what happens when
I want to go home and I want to watch
out on my TV like maybe if I am one of
the five people who ask Google TV I
could do that but assume that I don't
and I have one of the actual popular
devices like Roku or Samsung connected
TV or me say it xbox or Apple TV which
all have YouTube apps why can i watches
a new tube also from google why yeah
yeah i mean i-i rented a movie for a
quarter it was on sale and i was able to
watch it on all my devices and on my
computer through the google play site
but like you said I could not watch it
through YouTube which means I would not
be able to watch it on my TV through any
of those devices and that was kind of
saddening ya know it it definitely is um
you know I think it really they have
created it's a funny word to use in here
but we're using all over and read
they've created a fragmented content
marketplace in addition to their sort of
fragmented hardware market place we have
fragmentation on top of fragmentation is
is disappointing you know what consumers
want in my opinion is just a seamless
ecosystem where your content works on
any
device you know I think to some extent
Apple has created this within the apple
ecosystem of course amazon has done this
somewhat well you know even netflix if
you think about you can just go to any
device and you can access all your
netflix content it's easy and you just
don't even think about it it's so easy
so I guess the question is where do
these roads converge where where does
Google Play meet you tube down the road
you know I mean is YouTube going to be
folded into my plans went to the google
music launch like I covered that for CNN
Busta Rhymes right yeah he was there and
it was it's just one of those things you
know like Google music launch number
it's like ok ok Google music so I I have
to say for my perspective like it is a
little shocking and it seems jarring and
it does seem like they don't know what
they're doing by having it merged so
suddenly and then it was weird that
Google Music had nothing to do with
YouTube music and youtube vevo which was
is a hugely popular service right right
and I mean when Google first bought
YouTube there was sort of at least this
implicit promise that they were going to
operate you know sort of semi
independently but we were wondering ok
everybody loves you too but how is
Google good at Google Phi YouTube and I
haven't really seen that you know the
first thing I saw I only just saw like a
commercial that had YouTube in it sort
of like find out more information by
going on youtube or like find out what
happens next in the story by going on
YouTube there was no Google branding on
it whatsoever so I think in order to
merge you tube into the experience
there's going to have to be Google
branding on it they're going to have to
change their minds about what YouTube is
and what it means to Google right i mean
it kind of seems like these guys aren't
talking right they have like Google
YouTube offices are like in san bruno
just sort of off segregated just
physically from everyone else so that
googolplex is very impressive and takes
over like several side streets like it
takes over basically like a little
neighborhood in mountain view but I'm
sure just that physical distance creates
it seems like they're just too
world two different teams two different
companies and Mo yes exactly they need
to go to counseling is what I'm saying
here I think you might be great maybe
the you know Andy Rubin and kinkel can
come into the studio and we could you
know mediate for them and maybe we could
just cry it out yes exactly so we invite
you come on next week we'll all hold
hands and we'll create a better cuckoo
ecosystem for all of us let's talk about
nokia i love to talk about nokia it's
it's a funny thing to talk about on our
android show here for sure but they have
something new what are they doing
interesting tell us jamer well they they
have had this Nokia Maps service which
has been available through a through a
site through through browsers basically
on all mobile phones you can go to em
Maps nokia don't calm and it's basically
just been a google maps knock off until
now i guess they they now offer
turn-by-turn voice guided navigation
through that browser based service which
means that iphone users who kind of
don't have that will get turn-by-turn
navigation the way that android users
have always had through google maps fix
accept that that turn-by-turn navigation
is only for walking and that's really
the big sticking point i don't know why
it's only for walking but I guess it's
it's a step if you will in in the right
direction yeah but so any user who can
access mobile web so i phone Android
webos right i mean android users would
never use this because you google my
mate maybe they like nokia better maybe
they maybe they live on Vinland and no
he just has better maps for them right
what do you think about that I think
that's not the case but but iphone users
definitely if they are walking around
and they need some some turn-by-turn
navigation if they may be want to put
their phone in their hat and listen to
it as they're walking rather than
holding it in front of them
while they're walking and then they can
definitely do that now what what I'm
guessing is that maybe there's one thing
we haven't seen we have seen the belt
holsters we have never seen like a hat
holster so you can hear the turn-by-turn
navigation we can always wear your
headphones yeah you could just you could
actually just slip the phone in between
your ear and the headphones right what I
do is I just put my phone here and then
I duct tape around here so that I can
always that's the way to do I have one
of those beer helmets actually put a
bigger here and I put my phone over here
what happens when you drink from the
wrong straw we gotta get a picture oh
nothing it's fine I get jelly beans yea
I'm guessing that they're just kind of
testing the waters and they hopefully
release driving navigation right I mean
I like this because i like competition
because as cool as google navigation he
is on android there are certainly things
that annoy me for example a lot of i
want an easy way like yesterday was
driving up from the doctor to work and i
was like oh I need gas I need coffee and
I'm like all right find a gas station
but then it's finding gas stations
behind me that aren't on my route to
work and I want something that's like
here is the least destructive to the
current path you're taking gas station
there's no easy way to do that
especially without getting into an
accident so you like competition so what
you might do is pull these things up on
different services and then see what you
guys think about ways ways kind of
offers this more like real time promise
right I how do you what do you think
well I don't stub you easy to be a ze I
don't have a car right now right in San
Francisco because that doesn't make
sense but I mean I wonder if going on
the bus and on bart would kind of screw
that up yeah but the basic premise is
that you're in your vehicle and its
collecting real-time information and if
you want to help it out you can also
send alerts like if there's a traffic
jam or an accident or something like
that so it kind of hopes to answer that
question and solve that problem of ok
I'm looking at my map that does it
really know you know if this is the best
route to take right now right it sounds
better than the
app we talked about last week where the
traffic information was powered by
Twitter but damn it maybe on the corner
dropped a donut slow yes slow down
traffic it's weird let's continue
talking about apps here South by
Southwest it ends like Monday or Tuesday
there are a lot of interesting apps that
came out of there around two main themes
or one main theme and a couple
stragglers yeah yeah so I mean the
biggest thing that that everybody's been
talking about it south by as everyone
calls it is um highlight which is I
guess what they call a people discovery
app and it's kind of a newish category i
guess to the public mostly but there
there are tons of these people discovery
apps popping up the biggest ones
highlight not available for android yet
i I said yet just based on my own
speculation not I'm based not based on
any facts but but not if we don't have
to enroll facts in the show never that's
our policy never involved facts but
glancy is another one sonar there are a
few of these popping up and basically
they they show you who's around you you
know using your geolocation and they
show you what you might have in common
with that person based on your facebook
profile based on what you've entered in
that app specific profile it's a little
bit creepy but it's also very
interesting it's to aid stalkers
basically yes I use it all the time
let's go I don't know I like the concept
I don't think of myself as a stalker and
I don't know that I would actually like
go up I would never call myself a
stalker but some of my best friends
might yes Kanye West Madonna these guys
yeah I don't know there's a reason what
if I wat don't like me hanging outside
their window with the boom box on my
shoulder
oh john cusack reference uh so
highlights is to the biggest buzz one
glance see is yeah overjoyed I've
actually used it the interface is not as
nice as highlights in my opinion but I
booted it up and you know it told me
that just a couple hundred yards away
from me was you know the CEO of this
company the VP of biz dev of this
company this freelance scared freelance
designer and then gave me the option to
add this person I guess to a list or to
reach out to them in some way it's it's
really fun just kind of scrolling
through these things but if I were on
the other side if someone contacted me
through it I don't know how I'd feel you
know depending on with you real fighter
should like some kind of mixer and
you're using you know there's like some
tech meetup or something like that and
there were hundreds of people there and
you're like oh okay i just want to see
who's at this event right because
there's no pre-registration and figure
out who do I want to talk to it like
like a South by Southwest right maybe I
don't know I just don't like
location-based services yeah I don't
disagree with you there I'll be a
privacy fiend I don't know so there's
also sonar was another one that's
available for Android right yeah kismet
can't believe you guys have glanced over
angry birds space or just talking about
people discovery now so angry birds
space we don't that's like discovery of
the final frontier so we watch the video
preview do we know more than the video
preview I don't really know more than
the video mode there in space and they
have to deal with zero gravity that
could be kinda cool i like so physical
event they did do a demo that's how by
southwest is that what yeah they had a
hands-on they were showing it off on the
samsung galaxy note which as a reminder
is the large smartphone with the stylus
at a 5.3 inch HD screen phablet right i
refuse to use that word except a mockery
and jeff so the other app that is uh
interesting i guess if you like to give
into popular trends instagram so tell me
if you've heard this one before
is coming soon to android anyone
instagram the founders Kevin and Mike
showed off theoretically a demo so it
wasn't like a demo right it was just
like hey here it is on my phone it is
it's a screenshot of the iphone version
just on android yeah and then they said
after that it actually wasn't ready for
a full demo oh like a full public demo
which is why they just kind of flashed
it bright but they also said in some
ways it is better than Iowa the iOS app
it's crazy that's what they said give
you crazy it's crazy it has two new
filters oh I made that part up but their
outrage was real um yeah okay instagram
I don't know it's it's it's a craze it's
kind of cool I don't know it's it's
really cool i'm excited for android
users to get instagram Oh think it is a
lot of fun and it's basically just like
I can't believe it's taken so long I
know yeah it's taking along I was just
saying like the funny thing about this
is it's the filters aren't that there's
they're all available in Android like I
use a camera this app called camera 360
which has way more filters I think most
of the ones that instagram has on a
bunch more but it doesn't have like its
own social network which i guess is
maybe the missing piece here that's the
thing i mean you could use you could use
filters on other apps anywhere you want
photoshop do anything you want with your
pictures but the cool thing about
Instagram is it's the social network and
you know it's just like a photo stream
of all your friends cool photos that
they take yeah I mean there's 27 million
users right yeah which is really hard to
read yeah well that's really exciting we
are going to take a break at that IM
told us here and and i'm gonna duck out
and uh thank you you're gonna go check
on when Instagrammer to get instagram i
have to go back to my desk and play
angry birds space okay a black hole and
we're going to sit here and wait for
instagram to come out and once it does
we'll be right back after this short
short break
boy
welcome back you know it's awesome tell
me android tablets right who does not
love android tablets I'll tell you who
iPad users don't I've had users I don't
want anyone to think that we don't love
android tablets and that we agree with
IDC who says that I Android tablets will
overtake the iPad in sales by 2015 yeah
they've already overtaken them in
awesomeness and 2015 is not that far
away folks I try to the interesting
thing here I mean so apple shipped 15.4
million iPads in the fourth quarter of
2011 up from 11 million in the third
quarter but their market share dropped
from 60 1.5% 250 four-point-seven
percent so it's I guess they don't
exactly say what the market share of
Android tablets overall are but it seems
like three years or so to lose 42
something percent market share seems
like it's a it could happen sooner than
that right all right that's what I'm
thinking here they're being conservative
right and I mean even though it doesn't
say here I think we can safely assume
that most of that drop was because of
Android tablets I mean what else is
there there's blackberry playbook webos
yeah there's jokes don't know that's
what else there is right you know there
is some so Android tablets yes one thing
that I DC isn't it says isn't going to
necessarily change as quickly as revenue
they say that iOS will remain the market
leader revenue wise through 2016 and I
think and again details aren't spelled
out in this story specifically that a
lot of that comes from the ecosystem
right right where homes and yeah yeah
exactly just what we talked about right
right or Google Play is just not cutting
it on the revenue side and apples making
billion well I mean Google Play is only
three weeks old at least the name is
only well how about the services
previously known as other stuff but are
now wrapped up in Google Play are not
generating in that much revenue perhaps
that was because of the branding yeah
I'm sure that was the biggest problem
right there as soon as they solve that
but the kindle fire is second right in
terms of market share yeah for for a
manufacturer right with 628 percent and
they just started shipping and two last
year yeah quite easy in samsung uh in q3
her sorry q4 had five point five percent
of the market and yeah bay and then they
grew to 5.0 yeah it's just sort of a
negligible change there but I think we
can attribute a lot of apple's ipad loss
and market share to the amazon kindle
fire at least that's what i'm assuming i
think you're right because they're
killing it you know what else is going
to help power this overtaking of the
fruity giant i don't but i think you're
going to tell me I will tell you there
are various reports the latest from
DigiTimes one of our favorite rumor
sources that Google is going to release
a nexus tablet in conjunction with a
sous they will release a 7-inch
co-branded tablet as early as May with
price tag of 199 to 249 I'm excited
about this are you gonna buy this I'm
not going to buy this I'm going to play
with this when when it gets here but you
know I'm not so sure about like the
seven-inch seven-inch footprint but just
a vanilla Android tablet sounds sounds
great to me I'm excited yeah 7 inch 1280
x 800 these are all rumor everything is
rumor here right a quad-core Tegra 3
processor with ice cream sandwich of
course potentially shipping at
may eight through 10th that is not too
far off and and it's also rumored to be
sort I guess positioned as a kindle fire
killer right i mean if you have this
like super powerful tablet for 199 where
you can by the way get the kindle app
right why would you buy a kindle tell me
that I probably wouldn't if they're the
same price Steven toe i would definitely
not get the kindle i would get this over
the kindle because it seems like it's
more durable you can do a lot more with
it right way more powerful and not
locked down has the full sort of android
market yeah google play market Google
Play App Store what is it called the
play store that I mean really what a lot
of people in it's called the Play Store
yeah a lot of people are making jokes
but that's what it's called yeah i mean
i guess i would get the kindle fire if I
were you know a devout amazon ecosystem
fan boy Arthur amazon fanboy huh I i
gotta assume there are i gotta assume
there are so some of the chat room does
point out that i guess amazon streaming
is only available on the kindle uh
that's true and is a bummer because I
would like to stream it on my phone on
like your prime stuff yeah yeah yeah
maybe that'll change I mean I don't know
I mean I think Amazon is really just
about getting you to buy their content
more than their hardware maybe they like
the hard work because I locks you into
their content but you know maybe feel
like that's more of the strategy and
maybe they'll think about opening it up
and creating an app that's available
right to stream amazon content on other
android devices because it is already
available on other it's all available
i'm like roku and samsung devices and a
bunch of connected tvs so they're not
just Walt amazon make a TV so I guess
they couldn't just lock it down anyway
look for that potentially at CTA which
will have full coverage of in May all
right are you looking for new phone me
mm-hmm I am yeah I am and I do have a
half
the amount of money he didn't put down
well that is good because I have a phone
from for you it is from the watchmaker
how do we say you pronounce the tog
Hoyer talk we're best known for their
watches is coming out with a phone let
me just tell you the features first and
then you could tell me maybe how much
you would pay on me all right so listen
to this this phone has no plastic this
is not a cheap phone its carbon fiber
and titanium protected by a shockproof
rubber chassis it has four buttons on
the front it's going to come with the
latest Ice Cream Sandwich a new
customizable 3d user interface that is
customized to the needs of each owner
Wow it is due out in July and let me let
me just read you one tagline and please
them it has unparalleled torsion and
strength to weight ratio oh my god I've
been looking for a phone that has
unparalleled torsion to strength ratio
we're looking at the incredible video
alright how much would you pay for this
phone I'm $1,000 10,000 already sold
just give me the price tag I'm ordering
at 3617 1670 dollars i'm not buying this
phone why do you want to pay your rent
indeed I would like to listen someday ah
yeah this phone is crazy if anybody out
there knows what unparalleled torsion
and strength to weight ratio please
chime in send us an email because that
makes no sense to me to us I'm assuming
uh yes but I like to say it mm-hmm
anyway so this is just a really fancy
unlocked phone that you can use on any
any carrier
yeah does it I don't think it says the
carrier anywhere in here I don't think
so i think i think this phone transcends
carriers yes exactly i think so it will
work anywhere anytime wherever you want
all right that's our news for this week
but we have some email and voicemail
right let's see let's start with our
voicemails this one about chrome yeah
potentially yeah all right let's take
listen hello you guys when is Robert
California call a couple weeks ago about
facebook I was having difficulties we
implement friends I gotta fix it my own
is calling it and just reinstalling it
again but anyways I moved over to an
unlocked Galaxy Nexus I'm loving it that
one question I just gotta the chrome
browser every time I do voice search
let's say I just thought even if I
google Galaxy Nexus if I should the
stock browser in a searches right away
no usually results in Google but if I
choose a chrome browser it just could
just puts whatever I search for this URL
in the search bar and I still have a
press search I'm a big google search
user and I use a lot of voice search
voice man I mean it's a big issue for me
I'm just wondering am I missing a steady
or if it's uh maybe because i'm running
a custom rom but I notices with three
wrong during thoughts of the anagen nine
and also on Felicia was another Roma was
running and I ran into an issue I'm just
wondering if I missing something here
thanks love the show looking forward to
the show so i have a galaxy nexus and i
tried this with the I don't what you
call it's like the little Google search
widget to just on your home screen here
it actually works fine for me I'm not it
could be custom rom but then it seemed
like you're saying it happen with stock
rom as well you could check your
settings make sure you have sort of the
browser set as your default browser in
all of
the various settings for that other than
that you know I'd love to hear if our
listeners have any ideas on that but
again it did does work for me I don't
think it's anything specific to the
Chrome browser and there was a update
that came out of the last couple days so
maybe give that a try and yes that was
Robert California from the office let's
move on to some long emails all right so
let's see this one is from will lea
listening to broadcast yesterday this
was last week's and by the way i like
the little more involvement steven
Beechman has been adding he's funny and
brings a lot to be a well and would love
to see you guys let him loose I'm Andrew
Dallas as well but that's a different
topic we would love me let him leave Wow
first he needs get an android phone
though can you fix that a chat room how
about it's either on me I'd be happy to
use an android phone I have no problem
switching over aside from here I've just
had an iphone since the iphone once it's
like the first week the iphone came out
so I mean I'm just kind of always been
in that world you're losing points here
you know I know I'm losing points I
don't care hate me send me emails in
reference to the email about android
tablet apps it was a situation you were
both right and wrong the emailer was
right in the fact that there are a lot
more tablet-optimized apps then what do
you know I guess he's saying what we
thought but Justin was right in fact
that Google does a horrible job of
centralizing them and they goes on to
point out that there was an Android app
actually called tableau fide market HD
which looks like Gia Mars is looking at
right now that does a pretty good job of
pointing out tablet apps so i don't know
i have not used this app nor have i but
i did download it but there it is so
tableau 5.com if you want to check it
out yeah i'll definitely check it out
anyway thanks love the show and how GM
are coming into his own wow and getting
closer to the mic heated
well thank you very much shame probably
meant that all right this next one is
from Powell Powell p pal just a pal hi
this is the first time I am writing to
you I've been listening to your show for
a couple of weeks now and I really
enjoyed it in the last episode 88 you
mentioned several times that you do not
want to pay for applications that you
use on your phone come on guys do not
bite the hand that feeds you if you want
to have a high quality software on your
phone you should sometimes support the
effort of developers and pay for the
application every now and then you often
review cool I android apps on your show
after all where do you think these apps
come from and boasting about blocking
the internet access in order to prevent
ads from displaying on your screens and
your free apps this is not what I would
expect from journals that among other
things right and speak and you chose
about Android ecosystem all right let me
just stop here what are you talking
about do we first of all I don't do we
ever say we block ads from Android apps
no no but I think we mentioned that we
don't see ads we just kind of ignore
them great which i think is just a human
tendency that it's a pretty different
thing you can't really you can't really
tell us not to get you that so we have
mental box right this is not a
technological solution right and I don't
think we said I think we just said like
we tend not to there's not that many
apps we buy not that we avoid by naps
but in the android market there's so
many free versions that our ad-supported
that we tend to flock towards that yeah
I specifically went through a couple
apps that i had bought but if there's a
free ad-supported version then you know
it's the same reason why i'm watching
broadcast TV and not necessarily paying
for hulu plus or something well even
that has ads right right but I I mean I
do agree that what this person says
about you know supporting developers who
do put paid versions of their apps on
their you know I mean right if I don't
know free version free for like if they
have ads in there that's driving revenue
to them yeah right um it's not like for
stealing or yeah sorry anyway there are
many decent applications that were not
print
on my phone or their way better than
stock counterparts that he has bought
greader pro for are so sweet reading
read it later Brian's read it later the
free at spoiler game uh when I'm smart
Keyboard yeah I'm in how you swiftkey
which I bought because there's no free
version that right yeah it's a lot
supported the hand that was feeding you
is what you're saying good yes and the
last show you asked who buys apps anyway
will I do if I like the application I do
not meant mind spending a couple bucks
on it best regards paul i agree on the
screen or on the same page all right
