underwriters laboratory's in Northbrook
Illinois taking a look at their new
testing procedures for hoverboards
hoverboards are a cool toy but they also
pose a series of safety risks from the
battery to the circuitry and more so
underwriters laboratories has actually
developed a new test standard to test
the device from the ground up to make
sure the model you buy is actually safe
hoverboards are something that have been
on the market for a while but the fact
is we know that there have been some
fires and some issues with hoverboards
so ul has come up with a set of
requirements that would be applicable to
hoverboards we will test the batteries
the battery pack and the charger this is
where most of the issues could arise
from because the battery pack carries a
lot of energy in a small package the
battery pack is something that when one
of the cell's faults it could involve
the others that's a domino effect that
because the players that we might have
seen ul plans to conduct blunt nail
tests projectile tests drop tests and
even locked rotor tests where they stick
the wheel in a vise for seven hours and
watch it struggle so when you see the UL
seal of approval on your hoverboards box
then you know that it meets US safety
standards for any product that carries a
UL mark we test it from the ground up
including the basic materials that go
into the products the insulating
materials the enclosure materials to the
various components to the overall
product itself and that's true with
hoverboards we will look at the motors
the wire the circuit boards the switches
all of that will be tested by ul so
even though hoverboards aren't quite out
of the woods yet this new certification
that you should be able to find straight
on the box should clue you in and let
you know that the model is actually safe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
