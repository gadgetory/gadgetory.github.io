it evolved to think about how we can get
a job here it's a different country
different culture she knows you know a
ton of programming languages and was a
programmer for eight years in Syria she
wanted to get out of Syria for her baby
but as soon as she got here she started
looking for a job right away she
eventually after about six months is
connected to sink accelerator it's the
company run by yon angstrom to help
connect refugees two jobs and her CV was
so impressive that she was networking as
a computer programmer here in Sweden
obviously is well on her way to
establishing herself as a member of
Swedish society
one into unemployed people here in
Sweden are refugees so it's a
challenging situation for everyone
especially those who are concerned about
getting refugees integrated into the
culture and the economy here the Chinese
peasant admit what they spoke linkedin
but it's so hard to get a location
Marhaba this gnarly mother who either
masculine male linked and we Monticello
also Tramel afriqiyah welcome talent
odyssey is a microsite that house for
two things for you so for the refugees
it helps with support with information
around how can you expose your your
experience your skills to the job market
and the opposite for companies so it
helps you to post an internship for free
or a job opportunity tech is a huge part
of the economy here in Stockholm and
technically skilled people are very
valuable and so trying to help
immigrants essentially start a new life
integrate into the economy become part
of the workforce transition people away
from seeing immigrants as charity cases
and moving towards seeing them as
valuable members of society
