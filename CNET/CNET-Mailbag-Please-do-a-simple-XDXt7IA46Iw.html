to the cnet mailbag the show where we
take your feedback and answer your
questions about the stuff we're doing
here at seen it so I got a little
confused last week about our HD download
rollout it turns out that some of the
downloads people got in HD we're not
supposed to be available in HD because
we weren't really starting our HD
downloads until this week so if you went
looking for some and you didn't find
them haha my bad and speaking of HD
Peter from Norway wrote in to say hi
guys I totally love you but hey what's
up with the HD it's maybe a good thing
but think user perspective I'm not quite
sure but I think that a lot of people
watching seen at TV directly from itunes
on their computers there is no need for
HD in there especially for those with
old computers like me having trouble
viewing your podcast since my computer
can't handle it it's a terrible disaster
watching those video is in itunes and
even if VLC works fine that's out range
or even those who are seen at TV on
their ipods what the heck do those
people need HD for please do it simple
just make a RSS feed for cnet TV without
the HD quality and with HD quality and
we could save a lot of troubles and a
lot of download time I still love you as
long well Peter you can keep on loving
us because that's the plan HD video is
not supported on a lot of computers or
on ipods or the ipod touch or the iphone
or Apple TV we got a lot of email about
this and I am happy to say that yes we
will be delivering a standard definition
feed and a high-definition feed so you
can pick your poison because we aim to
please sorry about the confusion there
maybe you should email Apple don't tell
them to support some higher resolutions
Tom from Sweden had a note for our Tom
about some of our recent changes to Tom
Merritt ok that's it I just watched the
scene at top 5 most popular search terms
from 827 I can live with the new
graphics and the changed intro music but
dude you just walked in from the right
not okay any new CBS rules preventing
the classic entering from below tom
sweden yes i just noticed that you also
did it on the 731
just a rehearsal for the new rules okay
guys come on a redesign like cnet just
pulled off that takes like a year or
more of planning you really think CBS
bought us redesigned us in a month and
then made Tom walk in from the right no
no no no but they did give us new email
addresses that was exciting okay
speaking of complaints David from
Florida said if I see that freaking cell
phone talk one more time I think I will
explode or stop watching cnet whichever
comes first I am majoring in advertising
and I tell you that I have had enough of
that monotonous annoying ad thank you
and I enjoy your content just please
give us a different ad I know I'm sorry
we try I swear maybe CBS can help us fix
that one moving along Helios wrote in
and he does not love our new redesign
but he does have some funny thoughts
about Mark lesya loaded mark is awesome
I hope you get something to do in front
of the camera when Natalie gets back
just not loaded you picked up way too
many gestures and mannerisms from
Natalie and there can only be one
Natalie love the shows a lot of people
pointed out that mark has some of
Natalie's moves so we did a little side
by side comparison and uh its cameras on
logically like almond George's in the
manual Apple the ocean and players on
the way screeching engine it's Wednesday
August 27 there it's time to get loaded
wiki's out of a two point oh this means
that they always do Wow maybe they were
separated at birth and now for the
nicest email ever hey Molly just wanted
to give a virtual pat on the back for
the great work you do and to say thank
you my fiance Elizabeth and I have
enjoyed listening and watching you over
the years the fun you bring to the cnet
content allows me to hear Elizabeth's
laugh even more than usual nothing makes
me happier than when I hear the joyful
laughs of someone I care about thanks
for making that happen keep up the great
work please pass along a virtual pat on
the back to the rest of cnet crew for
their hard work cheers kev
I totally teared up a little bit the
first timer in that so sweet and finally
last week Chris asked if we could make
brian Tong do the running man while
texting on his phone Chris hold on to
your hat and that's it for this week
everyone keep that feedback come and

postcard to 35 second street san
