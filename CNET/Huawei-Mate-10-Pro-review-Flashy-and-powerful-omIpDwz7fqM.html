know is that the huawei mate 10 Pro is a
big beautiful device whose camera
quality and zippy speed definitely stand
up to other high-end devices like the
note 8 the LGB 30 and Apple's newest
iPhone the second thing you're gonna
want to know is that the price is right
up there - this isn't the phone that you
buy if you're trying to save some cash
it's the phone you buy because you want
a smooth reading experience in a flashy
package you definitely get some slick
hardware here like that six inch screen
it's got a really high resolution
there's also a sleek build there's large
battery in here and six gigabytes of RAM
which is always welcome the phone is
waterproof - it's got those slim bezels
that are on trend right now and a fast
accurate fingerprint reader on the back
Huawei is definitely known for those and
of course it runs with Android 8.0 Oreo
what you don't get compared to those
other phones is the note eight stylus
the LGV 30s extra video software and the
iPhone tens fancy face unlocking but
Huawei wants to make its own mark with
its dual camera and that is Co
engineered with a respected camera brand
like a-- like a bunch of the huawei
phones before so we know that we're
getting some consistency here there's a
12 megapixel lens and a 20 megapixel
lens that only shoots in black-and-white
the camera has a dedicated monochrome
mode that takes striking shots all in
its own but this second lens also adds
layers of detail to your regular color
photos you're gonna find a portrait mode
on here and in fact you can even take
selfie portraits that's something a lot
of phones don't do you can take photos
also with just that wide-angle camera
and you can dive into Pro Tools so you
can fine-tune your shots
one interesting addition for the camera
is what Huawei calls its AI processor
and that automatically recognizes your
scene and adjusts the settings so you
point the lens at food and bam you're on
food mode same with taking shots of
landscape or of text like the back of my
business card the idea is that you'll
save time setting up an editing shot
there are other two things I kind of
like from the lock screen you can double
press the volume button to launch the
camera and double press again to take a
quick pic you can also get rid of those
three typical Android navigation buttons
and replace them with one on-screen
button that you can drag around and use
for everything so it can save space if
you want to use more of the screen the
10 mate Pro comes in two colors a
titanium ish black grey shade and a
shiny brown color that is actually
really nice even though it sounds kind
of boring it's not the phone isn't
available everywhere in the world like
in the US so you will need to check
Huawei's website or your local retailer
for availability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
