to the cnet mailbag the show where we
read your feedback answer your questions
and even open your sketchy snail mail
packages but let's get to your email
shall we I've got a good stack of them
here they go I would like a sticker
please can I have a sticker give me a
sticker could have four stickers for me
and all my family seeking cnet stickers
see what I'm saying we better not do
that sticker thing again cuz we got
about 500 of those and this show is only
as good as your email anyway we're going
to send stickers to about the first 300
people who asked for them because that's
all the stickers that I have right now
and also i'm sarah and i are getting
carpal tunnel from addressing all these
envelopes but i think the stickers might
be available soon in the cnet store and
i will let them know when you can buy
them yourselves and don't worry they're
not that expensive also one thing I want
to warn you about because a lot of you
seem to want to put these on your
laptops they don't come off that easily
so just keep that in mind okay here is
some of the other non sticker related
email I received this week this
Valentine's Day say it all with ipod
touch that one's from Apple hey mail bag
check out my facebook page and need to
send big email campaign we can help no
more stickers alright moving on from
stickers and spam here are some birthday
wishes to loaded which had its one-year
anniversary last week Marshall ray says
Natalie happy birthday to your show it's
been a pleasure watching your technology
reports the past year they're always
very interesting and often entertaining
you've done a fine job at cnet and CBS
both although I don't know when your
birthday is probably not yet this year
I'll wish you a happy b day in advance
that's very nice Marshall moving on dan
has a question about cnet TV streaming
whenever I click the watch in HD link
under the video or whenever watching any
HD video it gets choppy I'm wondering is
it my computer or is it Firefox I have
four gigabytes of ram and a two and a
half gigahertz processor vista well then
it could actually be your bandwidth to
run HD video you need at least a two and
a half megabit per second connection
your computer probably has enough ram
but a three gigahertz processor is
recommended for our HD streaming one
trick though for those slower computers
actually try going to fullscreen the
computer and the video card actually
optimize better for the bigger image
even though I know that sounds sort of
counterintuitive also try upgrading to
flash 10 let me know if that helps then
good luck and finally some hilarious
hater mail I guess from a balloon 2009
who says something must be done to
conceal ms Woods arms they are
freakishly long and those elbows look
lethal can't watch the video she is just
too distracting that is a new one to me
all right sleeves it is and that's it
for this week send me your nan sticker

mailbag at cnet com or send your snail
mail to 235 second street san francisco
