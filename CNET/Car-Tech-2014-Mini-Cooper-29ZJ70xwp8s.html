Mini Cooper is here so let's check the
tech and motor the Mini Cooper model
launched in 2000 by BMW proves so
popular the company only made minor
changes throughout the last decade now
we have a totally new generation of the
model this is a new platform new cabin
tech new engines - actually four and a
half inches longer - 1.7 inches wider
that leads to a little more room in the
cabin you'll see a larger air intake up
front a single exhaust in the rear for
the Mini Cooper for the Mini Cooper S
you still have dual exhaust down the
middle in the back this cabin definitely
has a premium feel really like these
seats I think this is fake leather here
but they're very comfortable there well
bolstered sport seats look like
distressed wood here or something
obviously it's not real wood we've got
some interesting cues in here that kind
of deviate from past minis for example
we have a full speedometer in front of
the driver instead of on this dinner
plate in this center plate here we have
a large LCD screen that's where we get
all our cabin tech features we have an
engine start toggle switch down here
that's actually an option and we have
this armrest here in the center which I
believe is optional and I kind of hate
just kind of like gets in your way to
really show that this has BMW DNA in the
cabin tech they don't call it I Drive in
mini but we've got this centre dial here
we have a touchpad on top of this dial
so I can trace in letters or move around
on the map or move through menus and we
have four buttons media radio telephone
nap that's all
straight out of BMWs playbook nice thing
about this map it shows a lot of good
detail traffic information traffic flow
information traffic jams things like
that
I also get 3d rendered buildings in
certain areas that they can serve as
landmarks if you're driving around
now in typical BMW style now mini style
we have a split screen here so right now
I've got my map on the left my music
information stereo information on the
right right now I've got a USB port down
here I've got my iPhone plugged into it
via the white cable I can also put a USB
Drive in there bluetooth streaming for
audio don't seem to have a CD player I
guess that's something that they got rid
of for this generation you can get a six
disc CD changer if you want of course
I've got my hands-free telephone where I
can go through my contacts in my phone
book that are on my phone that are
synced with the car actually voice
command is very good in the sky recovers
a lot of the functions but what I really
like about the cabin tech in this car is
the mini connected app so for example
I've got web radio which lets me find
radio stations from around the world any
radio station from around the world that
broadcasts on the Internet I can find it
here
I have online search so this actually
enacts a Google search which integrates
with navigation so I can say the name of
any business or anything like that
program that in as a destination so
other apps in here
they have Facebook and Twitter now that
may seem distracting but they're mainly
using that for location information so
if you want to tell your friends that
you're about to show up at a destination
you've got programmed into the
navigation you can post a canned tweet
or Facebook update that'll give your ETA
to a dentist destination so that that's
that's pretty helpful
now one thing they have is help Mission
Control this is kind of fun one voice
this female British accent voice is sort
of your car and it gives you information
it says hi stuff like that another
British male voice is your engine
supposedly so when your revenging it
says oh let's go stuff like that dynamic
music is another interesting one that
they have programmed in here so this has
some tracks you can download the change
as you're driving when you accelerate
they pick up the beat when you turn on
the turn signals I would say mini has
the most fun with their app integration
of any automaker I've seen now finally
we have a Harman Kardon premium audio
upgrade in this car 10 speakers 480
watts sounds really good that's
definitely an upgrade I would get in
this car
one thing mini coopers have always been
lauded for is there but they call
go-kart like handling put it into its
sport mode drop the transmission over to
sport program and see how it does it's
kind of fun but it's not quite as sharp
as the previous generation brakes are
low disturbing cuz they're not that
grabby lark modulate they don't give me
a lot of stopping power in this car
definitely lets you play a bit with the
handling it may not be a super track
star I think it's something you can have
a lot of fun with on the weekends Wow
so this has an entirely new engine this
is actually a three cylinder engine but
before you let that scare you it's
actually a 1.5 liter with direct
injection twin turbo charger that's
let's BMWs two-stage turbo charging one
scroll for lighter power and a bigger
school for higher power horsepower in
this car is 140 more of a torque monster
168 pound-feet of torque this is
actually a lot more powerful than
outgoing Cooper so I'm actually
impressed
there's no adaptive suspension here it's
all just a fixed suspension 29 miles per
gallon city 41 miles per gallon highway
when I'm driving this in San Francisco
the the mileage just plummets goes way
down we're talking that down to 20 miles
per gallon these smaller displacement
engines like this one they do great when
they're just humming along with no stops
but as soon as you introduce a lot of
stopping and starting that kills it so
let's price out our 2014 Mini Cooper
base price comes the 20,000 $450
automatic transmission is 1250 but we'll
leave that off and just stick with
6-speed manual to do it up scheanette
style will add what many calls the fully
loaded package that gets us navigation
Bluetooth Harman Kardon sound and LED
headlights for $4,750 the wired upgrade
package adds a heads-up display for 1350
and in adaptive suspension is only $500
so that's a no-brainer all in for 27,000
dollars for a very dynamic very tech
forward Mini Cooper leaving the Mini
Cooper S out of the question entirely
this new MINI Cooper is a big
improvement over the previous one I
really enjoyed the handling even though
it's not quite the same as the previous
model but most important the mini
faithful are going to love the continued
retro styling of the Mini Cooper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
