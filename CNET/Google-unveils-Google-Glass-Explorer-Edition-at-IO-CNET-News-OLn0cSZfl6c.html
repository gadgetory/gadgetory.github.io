announce the Google glass Explorer
edition the devices that we used we're
Google glass prototypes and has a
display so I can see visual information
right now images video it has a camera
to capture picture and video also has a
processor a pretty powerful processor to
process information and a lot of memory
to store information in order to
interact with this device we have a
touchpad on the side we also have a
little button here so I'd like to take a
picture of you right now which I just
did we have microphones so you can
collect all your information we also
have a small speaker so I can receive
all your information the device also has
a number of sensors so we have
gyroscopes accelerometers and compass so
it's aware of its location with respect
to my body and it's also aware of its
location in the broader physical world
and lastly and very importantly it has
multiple radios for data communication
so we created glass so that you can
interact with the virtual world without
distracting you from the real world and
one clear example of this is that we
decided to actually position the display
above your eye and glass as a whole is
designed to be close to your senses but
not blocking them and this picture shows
so clearly how we don't want technology
to get in the way the baby looks into
the moms eyes they connect and while
doing that she can capture this
beautiful moment without any
distractions and whether it's with
family or friends we want to empower
people to use technology naturally I'm
sure many of you in the audience like
myself are parents and many many times
you've asked and wished that oh I wish I
had a camera with me right now to
capture this unique moment with my
when you have glass you can actually
capture those moments and have those
memories forever recorded for you this
is pretty important actually</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
