3d vision kit at the time it was the
only real 3d choice for 3d PC gaming but
there are a few problems with the
crushing darkness and the crosstalk hi
I'm Eric Franklin and today I'll take a
first look at the Nvidia 3d vision 2
glasses
my first impression were that they look
kind of more like goggles and glasses
comic book nerds will get this remember
when Catwoman got that redesign a few
years back and started wearing goggles
for some reason they remind me of those
but thicker brim blocks out more ambient
light and the lenses are actually larger
as well they also use a softer plastic
than the first gen have these rubber
cushions at the end of each handle this
makes them much more comfortable to wear
as a result now I tested the performance
of the glasses using the Asus vg2 78 H
basically the shutters all should make
more precisely where both shutters are
never closed at the same time in between
each frame the monitor turns off its
backlight for a split second well this
is supposed to do is produce a brighter
image that has less crosstalk and for
the most part this was indeed the case
in both games and movies there were a
few games however where crosstalk was
still noticeable the 3d vision 2 glasses
are better designed and fit more
comfortably than the first gen pair did
however the performance improvements
come from light boosts which works just
as well with the first gen glasses also
in order to take advantage of light
boosts you'll need a compatible monitor
the Asus BG 278 H comes with the 3d
glasses as well as a built-in emitter
and is available for about 650 bucks
there's a more expensive Acer model as
well as a BenQ that's actually really
hard to find in the states from major
retailers if you already have the first
gen vision kit these glasses will only
make a difference in comfort and their
ability to block out ambient light those
advantages may not be worth 85 dollars
in costs however 3d vision to what light
booths is the best 3d solution for 3d
game
now we just need to see more monitors
that take advantage of the technology
once again this is Eric Franklin and
this has been a first look at the Nvidia
3d vision 2 glasses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
