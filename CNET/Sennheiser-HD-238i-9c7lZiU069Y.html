for cnet.com and I'm going to give you a
quick tour of the Sennheiser 238 I
headphones that several of us here at
scenic consider one of the better values
in the headphones market these are on
ear headphones in the eye on their name
refers to smartphone friendly features
like a microphone and an inline remote
that's designed to work with Apple's iOS
devices but isn't fully functional with
many Android smartphones or tablets in a
lot of cases on your headphones would
sit flush against your ears aren't all
that comfortable however these
Sennheiser's are quite comfortable with
nicely padded ear cups and in a
lightweight design of all they seem well
built and fold flat for storage and come
with a very basic canvas traveling case
if you're looking for downsides some
people may find the court a little thin
and it doesn't detach from the ear cup
like the court on bose is more expensive
OE two headphones it's also worth
mentioning that court terminates in a
vertical plug rather than an l-shaped
plug which tends to be a little bit more
durable in reviewing bose is similarly
styled OE to I headphones I noted that
they sound more natural and don't suffer
from Bose bloat a term coined for its
obtrusive bass boost the sennheisers
exhibit similarly detailed sound an
ample but not bloated base their touch
on the warm side and will appeal to
listeners perform more laid-back less
aggressive headphones with edgier
trouble keep in mind that you shouldn't
expect quite the same sound from these
San hydras as you would higher-end
models with retail prices of around two
hundred dollars the point here is that
while the 238 eyes don't offer great
sound they do deliver very solid
performance for their price no they
aren't quite as compact as the Bose OE
tues and they don't still way into a
small carrying case but they do cost a
hundred dollars less and offer
comparable sound quality in my book that
makes the Sennheiser HD I 238 eyes one
of the better bargains in this class of
headphones i'm david carr noi thanks for
watching
