motorola's droid 2 goes global google
chrome Briggs websites to the web
shopping apps for you to tap and the
Samsung Nexus gets its s kicked it's all
coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech and offer some unique tech
wisdom in the form of the bottom line
let's start with the good the motorola
droid was the phone that pretty much
launched Android into the serious
contender category but it had a few
drawbacks and along came the droid 2 to
fix some of those problems like the
slowest processor in the awkward
keyboard but droid 2 wasn't perfect
either and it sure wasn't a world phone
enter the droid 2 global is it the
perfect little slider droid let's have a
look hey everyone I'm Bonnie toss senior
editor at cnet com and today I've got
your first look at the motorola droid 2
global this is a lot like the droid 2
which was released in mid-august but as
you might have guessed from the name
this is a world phone the droid two uses
dual mode technology so when you're
using the phone in states it will
operate on verizon's network like usual
but when you travel overseas it will
detect and automatically switch over to
the GSM network so you can continue to
make and receive calls using the same
number Verizon ships the phone with a
sim card but they will unlock it as long
as you've been a customer for at least
60 days and are in good financial
standing so you can swap it out for say
a prepaid SIM you buy overseas there are
also some other great features for
business users the droid two runs
android 2.2 and can be used as a mobile
hotspot for up to five devices the
smartphone also ships with a VPN client
and the Quick Office suite so you can
create view and edit Office documents
and of course you can hook up your
exchange account and sync your calendar
and contacts there's some fun to be had
to the music player is the stock Android
player which isn't very sexy but it gets
the job done the joy to features a
slightly more powerful 1.2 gigahertz
processor which kept the phone running
smoothly my only concern is battery life
with moderate use it lasted about a day
but if you're using the multimedia
features or web frequently the battery
can dream pretty quickly as far as the
design is on a lot like the droid 2 in
front you get a 3.7 inch WVGA touch
screen that's nice and sharp by sliding
it
bleh to the right you get access to the
smartphone's full qwerty keyboard unlike
the original droid motorola got rid of
the d-pad so it's much more comfortable
to hold and use the buttons also have a
slight bump to them so they're easier to
press it's not the best keyboard out
there though I'd say the same sound epic
4g and t-mobile g2 both have better
keyboards but if you're coming from the
joy is definitely an improvement
currently verizon's only other world
phone running android is the motorola
droid pro has more security features
that might attract some enterprise users
but i'd say the droid 2 global is the
better device overall since you're
getting a bigger sharper screen room
your keyboard and a slightly faster
processor motorola droid 2 global is
available now in either black or white
for 1 99 99 with a 2-year contract I'm
Bonnie Tom this has been your first look
at the motorola droid 2 global for
Verizon Wireless alright so pretty good
plus it comes in white white even the
iPhone hasn't cracked that nut speaking
of nuts that's what I thought Google was
when I heard they were announcing a web
app store that would turn websites into
apps that run in the browser just like
websites do yeah I was confused too but
then Seth Rosenblatt got a look at some
of these better than website web app and
I have to admit some look pretty slick
hi I'm sucker Rosenblatt frisina and
today we're at the Google Chrome OS
event where google debuted the Chrome OS
for the first time unfortunately nobody
was able to get a hold of a notebook to
use we're gonna do that later this week
but for right now we do have some really
exciting Google Chrome Web Apps to show
you the kind of like phone apps but in
your browser let's go take a look this
web app that we're looking at is called
aviary aviary is already existing html5
based image editing suite on the web
and even though they're already on the
web they've gone ahead and created a
Chrome web app for people to check out
one of the nice things about it is that
you don't have to sign in you don't have
to log on like you do with the standard
aviary app you just jump in and start
editing your image right away and you
see it has controls like rotate crop you
can maintain proportions if you want
choose preset sizes there quite a bit of
neat things you can do here and it's all
within the browser we're here at the
Sports Illustrated web app where you can
explore your favorite sports teams your
favorite scores read sports
illustrated's well-known articles and
the killer feature i think is checking
out their Chrome Web App photo gallery
which you can see extremely large photos
load very very fast and these things are
just beautiful I mean look at the
resolution on those that the colors pop
yeah it's easily the best thing about
the app and even if you're not into
sports this is something you're gonna
want to check out so we're here at the
EA games in the Chrome Web Store and
what's really neat about this is that
not only are ea's games based in html5
but they've also got some flash based
games that run incredibly quickly and as
you can see here we have fancy pants
well done in the app store that was
flash I can't believe that was flashed I
was incredibly fast even though flashes
an older technology it's really really
neat to see how these games can just
blaze right through loading and gameplay
and before you know it you've sucked
away an entire hour playing these time
wasters it's a lot of fun so that was a
quick tour of the Chrome Web Store and
some of the apps that you can load in
your browser keep an eye out later this
week for the Chrome OS first look video
for Cena I'm stuff Rossum
wasting an hour on games huh I wonder
how long's death actually spent at that
EA display now in case the masses of
decorations the Jingle Bell type songs
on the radio and the constant coupons
and shopping deals haven't tipped you
off yet it's holiday shopping season and
here are the good that means good deals
first our favorite desktop in a long
time get it while it lasts and a darn
cheap laptop after that hi I'm rich
brown senior editor for cnet.com today
we're going to take a look at the
velocity micro vector holiday edition so
this 999 PC is an editor's choice system
and that's because it's one of the best
deals we've ever seen for that 999 you
get a blu-ray drive wireless networking
an overclocked core i5 cpu a terabyte
hard drive for gigs of ram and a fast
nvidia graphics card basically the
system has more features than we've ever
seen in a PC for under thousand dollars
it's faster than systems that cost two
or three hundred dollars more and it
comes in a fantastic-looking well-built
case now velocity micro says they're
going to offer the system until at least
January first so you have a month to
pick it up and we highly recommend that
you do if you're at all interested in a
a performance-oriented mainstream
desktop if it's popular enough that may
extend it into a winter edition but we
obviously have no guarantees you can see
there's a pretty clean front side here
there's an SD card slot it's got a
couple formats on it so let's a blu-ray
drive up here on the side there's a
couple USB ports as well as firewire and
audio jacks now onto the back you can
see all the connectivity ports back here
and there's a lot of great options here
thanks to the motherboard for data
connections you get 6 usb2 ports a
couple of USB 3 Jack's as well as
firewire and East SATA inputs that array
of ports lets you connect pretty much
any external devices on the market right
now for a vjax you get an optical
digital audio output as well as standard
7.1 outs down to the video card you get
a couple DVI jacks as well as a mini
HDMI output this is no living room
system but it's still nice to have the
option as clean design is pretty typical
of velocity of micros desktops all the
cables are bound and tied out of the way
makes upgrades or moving parts very easy
you can see there's a lot of room for
hard drive
over here you've got one drive installed
the terabyte drive as well as room for
five additional drives you can plug in
now here's one of the more impressive
features about this PC there's a core i5
CPU underneath that fan right there now
that's a quad-core CPU that ships at 2.8
gigs but velocity micro is overclocked
head to 3.6 overclocking is impressive
for a few reasons it gives you better
performance that's pretty obvious but
velocity micro also managed to do it
with a stock fans that means you'll have
to pay for liquid cooling or some other
feature that would add to the price of
this PC also we found that the
overclocking is rock solid stable and we
know that's because it had no problems
on our stability test so you can see the
nvidia geforce gtx 460 graphics card
here that's a nice fast mid-range card
it should play pretty much any game out
there at decent resolution and image
quality if you want more graphics
performance so the system does have room
for a second graphics card down here as
well as a 600 watt power supply that
should be all support a second mid-range
card we probably wouldn't try to add two
high-end cards to this system but two
upper mid-range cards should be totally
fine now there are two PCI slots on the
motherboard but one of them is currently
occupied by the wireless card but if
you're going to add a second graphics
card to the system you'd want to take
the wireless card from where it is now
and move it to the higher spot to make
room so given all those features its
build quality and it's impressive 999
price the system is easy to recommend as
an editor's choice so I'm rich brown
this is the velocity micro vector
holidays
i'm dan ackerman and we are here taking
a look at the acer aspire AS 7741 z that
mouthful actually kind of caught my eye
because this is pretty much the least
expensive desktop replacement 17 inch
laptop that I have seen for the holiday
season 2010 you can actually find this
guy in retail exclusively at Walmart
although there are there similar
versions you may be able to find it
other retailers and the reason why they
can cram this big 17.3 inch screen into
a system that's under five hundred
dollars is because inside it's actually
pretty much the same as a lot of these
super inexpensive 14 and 15 this laptops
are going to find usually but the 17
inch models get more powerful processors
bigger hard drives more bells and
whistles what they've really done here
is take one of those super low-end
midsize laptops that use the dual core
intel pentium p 6100 cpu and just given
it essentially a bigger screen and a
separate number pad and dress it up in a
body that's mostly plastic it's got some
kind of plastic that looks like brushed
metal right here the construction a
little bit again on the plastic side the
keyboard too much flex for me right
there in the middle but it's not a
terrible keyboard I do get an hdmi
output for outputting high-definition
videos to a big-screen TV if you feel
like doing that the screen itself is
actually got a 1600 x 900 resolution we
were a little afraid when we first saw
this based on the price that it was
going to be a 1366 x 768 screen
fortunately that is not the case though
you know for under five hundred dollars
in the 17 inch laptop I guess that's
about as good a resolution as you're
going to find it's got three gigs around
again it's got that very basic intel
dual core cpu which means it's good for
web surfing and email and we were able
to play you know high-definition video
files back without a problem and watch
some online streaming video you're not
going to be able to do a heck of a lot
more than that maybe set this up in the
corner of like your Danner dorm room is
like a little low power media center of
course the key thing to remember 498
bucks if you want a big screen don't
spend big money pretty much the only
thing that we've seen this holiday
season i'm dan ackerman and that is the
H or aspire ASM
741 Z can you believe we've gotten to
the point where a quad-core desktop is
under a thousand bucks and a 17 inch
laptop is under 500 these are crazy
times people and while you ponder those
deep thoughts let's take a little break
shall we but don't wander off because
we'll be right back with more tech
review right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV now
let's get to the back now I'm one of
those people who loves the holidays and
holiday shopping but I know some of you
think it's a chore like Arielle who
would apparently rather have a daily
appendectomy than shop for presents I
also know he's not alone luckily there's
an app or three for that if you're
anything like me you hate Christmas
shopping and you haven't even started
yet I mariela nunez for cnet.com and i'm
here to show you a few apps that can
help you with your holiday shopping this
season now better Christmas list is a
good starting point you can list
everyone you need to shop for divide
them into categories set budgets and
track spending there's also an archive
feature so you can remember what you got
people when you have to do this all over
again next year now if you just don't
know what to get someone gift Meister
can help this app lets you search for
gifts ideas according to gender age
price range and lifestyle your results
will pop up and voila no thinking
necessary to find deals in your area
check out yowza this app uses your
iphones GPS to find coupons for stores
in your current location no coupon
printing necessary just show your phone
directly to the cashier and yeah also
keeps track of how much money you've
saved and when you're out in the malls
fighting the crowds amazoncom can help
you get home as soon as possible so you
can just order your gifts online use the
scanning feature and amazon will search
its database you can even order directly
from your phone so hopefully this will
ease your holiday insanity so you can
focus on the more important things of
this season eggnog I mariela nunez for
cnet com happy holidays
I mean I don't think Christmas shopping
is the worst thing I do all here but i
guess i would also like to get right to
the eggnog okay moving on in the bad
this next one might surprise you it's
google's flagship new phone the nexus s
see why it's down here in the doldrums
hi I'm Kent charming senior editor here
at cnet com today we take a first look
at the samsung nexus s now this is one
of the most anticipated android phones
of the autumn season that's because it's
the follow-up to the nexus one this
phone offers largely the same concept it
is have a different sales model you can
buy it at bestbuy so you can actually go
into the store it's also sold for
t-mobile and it's sold without t-mobile
contract and but like the previous phone
both phones are unlocked so that's a
great thing but there is a catch and of
course there's always a catch it is
compatible only with t-mobile's 3g
network at least here in the united
states you can use it on AT&amp;amp;T voice
network so you can make a call and send
message text messages but you can't use
it on AT&amp;amp;T 3g another thing you need to
be aware of it doesn't work with
t-mobile's hspa+ network so they say
it's 4g it's not really 4g but it's not
compatible that really high speed
network and that's really disappointing
considering just an anticipated device
it has almost everything else you'd want
so we don't really understand why they
didn't do that just described in the
design you can see it as a simple candy
bar phone it looks a lot like some of
the get samsung galaxy s devices so it's
very thin it's pretty light it is a
super amoled display so it has about 16
million colors a great pixel resolution
everything looks really good I'll
compare it here with the nexus one to
show you there's some is somewhat
similar as far as the candy bar shape
goes but certainly the Nexus X is a
little slicker it just has a little more
futuristic feel suddenly the nexus one
feels a little weightier a couple things
to note about the nexus s design it does
have a contour display and so what
that's supposed to be is the display is
supposed to be curbed it actually is
it's very slight you have to look at it
very closely I'm not sure I see that at
all I mean I don't notice the difference
when I hold it against my head and I
think if you really wanted to match it
you'd have a pretty small head it has a
front-facing vga camera in addition to
the camera on the back and there's also
a flash in the back also has an NFC chip
now that's the technology the
doesn't use much here in the United
States yet but it would allow you to
actually use your phone as a wallet and
buy certain things and deduct money from
a mobile account not a lot of merchants
are really caught on to that technology
so we'll see that development but it
does have the capability also you'll be
able to do VoIP calling and it is the
first android phone with Gingerbread
which is the latest version of the
Android operating system now gingerbread
brings a few things will shall show a
couple to a couple of them to you does
bring a different keyboard so the
virtual keyboard that doesn't look that
much different and also the cut and
paste this a little easier to do now in
Gingerbread you can actually select only
the word that you're touching if you
have a block of text so if you just want
to select one thing that you can do also
gingerbread gives you new little arrows
that allow you to move the block of text
to which you'd like to copy back and
forth easier it's just a little better
than having to move the line with your
fingers you did before and now you get a
little arrow so it's nice I really like
it gingerbread also makes a wallpapers a
little different and it offers had a few
other features but that cut and copy
paste is one of the biggest and one
you'll probably notice right away one an
important thing to point out with the
Nexus S is it does not have a micro SD
card slot now it does have 16 gigs of
internal memory so that's a lot of space
of course even if you want to use more
than 16 gigs and there's probably some
of you out there you won't have that
option so that's disappointing one other
thing that's missing is an hdmi out slot
so we're hoping that this phone had a
little more features than it does
compared with the nexus one as I said a
lot of the features are similar does add
some new things of course gingerbreads a
huge one but at the end of the day the
phone isn't that much of an advancement
over its predecessor so that's a bit
disappointing but it does offer that
unfiltered access right to Google
applications you'd expect so if you're a
real hard core android fan probably a
decent phone for you as I said you can't
get it unlocked you can't get it for 529
and that's without any kind of contract
or you can get it 199 with a tmobile to
your contract but the phone is that
phone is also unlocked as well so that's
a good thing I'm Ken German is the
Samsung Nexus S
man I gotta say that phone is a bit of a
letdown I mean I think the front facing
camera is a must-have but there are so
many phones coming out early next year I
just don't think this phone is a
must-have which is a bummer because I
really wanted to love it ok now the
Nexus S is a little bit of a letdown but
that is nothing compared to say that may
long m150 tablet which is hilariously
bad so let's just win Donald up and
watch him go hey I'm Donald bell today
we're taking a first look at the mail on
m150 android tablet also known as the
$99 walgreens tablet in full disclosure
we paid closer to 130 dollars but really
this thing is a bad value no matter what
you pay for it it may look like an
offspring of the iPad and the galaxy tab
but this unfortunate thing is a bait and
switch in every possible way the button
on the front looks like a home button
but it's actually a back key the app
market on the menu takes you to a
clearinghouse of free apps that no one
wants the clunky resistive display on
the front is covered with a worked
plastic and if you want to get anything
done you're best off using the included
stylus all of the icons for the stock
android 1.6 apps have been given a
pointless makeover just two ugh things
up and if you want to sync this back to
your computer good luck the port on the
bottom here that looks like a dock
connector is actually there to work with
this included adapter which adds two USB
ports and a feature we've all been
asking for an Ethernet port that's right
you get an Ethernet port but you don't
actually have a way to USB sync this
over to your computer and transfer
content instead the best you get is a
microSD card slot that allows you to add
media also on the bottom you'll find
speakers a headphone jack and the power
adapter socket that works with the
included wall wart just don't lose it
because we'll be recharging this every
few hours even if you're just doing some
light web browsing the bottom line is
that this thing's more trouble than it's
worth and it's also a case study and how
these kinds of budget android tablets
can be disappointing if you're shopping
around there's a hundred-dollar to two
hundred dollar price range a newer
use ipod touch is going to deliver an
infinitely better experience though with
a smaller screen so there you go that's
the walgreens tablet demystified if you
spot one in the wild or something like
it I would steer clear no matter how
good a bargain see she was calm I'm
Donald Bell man I don't even know what's
my favorite part there the disdain with
which he pronounces stylus or his shock
and awe over the Ethernet port well now
you know you get what you pay for and
with that let's get to the bottom line
shall we the electric car has arrived
well the Nissan Leaf SLE has arrived in
our garage anyway and Brian coolies got
to look at whether this little electric
is the one to go mainstream never mind
the Chevy Volt for a minute the nissan
leaf looks like it has the best chance
of being the next prius let's jump into
a freshly minted 2011's l ii and check
the very extensive tech
avoid of any General Motors baggage or
powertrain definitions that dog the Volt
the leaf is in arguably electric and it
hails from a respected brand of modern
and often efficient cars being Japanese
just a bit quirky and priced right as
long as the feds stay in the tax credit
game don't hurt either but is all that
enough to overcome the big one range
anxiety now the most innovative part of
the leaf of course is what moves it
around here's the motor which looks a
lot like an engine I wonder if they
styled it that way just so it wouldn't
look so odd because that has like the
look of a of a cam cover but there's no
cam so I'm not sure what's under there
but anyway this is an electric motor 80
kilowatt is the power it's about 107
horsepower 207 foot-pounds of torque
notice lots of torque compared to the
horsepower that's an electric thing that
goes out to a one speed transmission
it's really just a reduction gear there
is no gear changing no CVT nothing like
that now the interesting part this whole
powertrain delivers some freshly
published EPA numbers I just happened to
have right here 99 mpg equivalent that's
comparing the electric power to the
hundred and 15,000 btus of energy in a
gallon of gas it's a little convoluted
for the average consumer but it gives
you some idea how stunningly efficient
this car is that said look at the range
not the 100 Nissan said 73 miles is the
real range the EPA estimates and again
that will vary depending on your terrain
time of year use of accessories never
seen these numbers before zero
greenhouse gases that's rather clean and
check out the annual energy costs
normally a cars 1500 to 2500 dollars a
year to run average number of miles
driven look at this guy 561 that's a
very low cost to drive this car the
average miles through the course of a
year but where does that juice come from
down here the other hood this little
rather oddly placed door is where the
charging ports are the orange ones the
one you're going to use most typically
that's where a 220 can
ngozi with a special cable they've got
this included with the car and that'll
get you a charge from flat in seven or
eight hours this is the sweet spot you
can also plug into 110 but pack a lunch
because that's going to be 14 to 16
hours to charge this guy 110 is really
more for trickle and then if you go for
an optional charging adapter built into
your premises you can use this guy the
really cool one the 480 that'll charge
this car in about a half an hour okay
inside the leaf you're not gonna forget
you're in a leaf no one's gonna say Mel
tomorrow Sentra it's a completely
different cabin than any other nissan
you've got the eyebrow design and then
the main LCD screen notice not a single
wagging needle in the entire IP no
gauges all displays let's take him in
order up on the eyebrow there you've got
some energy information your speed time
temperature a lot of the basics now down
here in the main display things get
really interesting on the left is your
battery temperature the nearest thing to
an engine temperature across the top
that row of rings that's not an Audi
logo gone nuts that is your region or
power dispersal thing so it's telling
you if you're recapturing energy to the
left of that break where the little blue
circular arrows are or how much power
you're discharging the farther you go to
the right just a stylized way of showing
what could be done with a needle and
then on the rights the one you're going
to be looking at all the time with
nervousness and a roiling gut that is
your level of charge and next to that is
your projected remaining miles now
that's a guesstimate I find that doesn't
always seem to agree with the battery
charge level but I'm not the expert the
computer in the car is this little blue
button here and the one on the steering
wheel their unique to the leaf the one
over here on the right takes you to the
leaf master menu all kinds of good stuff
here driving range tells you like you
might imagine how far you can go and
where there are charging stations within
that range of how far you can go there's
also a shortcut to that exact menu right
here on the wheel it's the old button
when you just looked up and realized I
got about a bar or two left and I got a
long way to go you hit this guy and
it'll take you to the nearer
and your sack bomber arranged map now
the last thing on leaf 101 is how to
drive this thing you've got the usual
pedals down on the floor this is a
steering wheel you've seen one of these
before that's not standard that's the
goofy of shifter ever made so what you
do with that guy according to this map
right here is you slide it over kind of
pre us like and up for reverse which
seems a little bit odd wouldn't you
slide it over and back for reverse and
then to go and drive you do yes exactly
the wrong thing you pull it over and go
back to go forward either swap those
house they drove the leaf which I did
rather little I started to really feel
the pain of real-world range anxiety as
opposed to I'm a reviewer I can't wait
to drive it except driven the leaf
several times so it wasn't like I had to
experience it for the first time on this
visit with it I didn't drive it much
because already been there done that and
everything I had to do over the last few
days I had range issues so I started to
feel like a normal non reviewer consumer
who's gonna say enough can't hit the
leaf there yeah shouldn't take the leaf
there cuz I don't want to worry about
being on the fringe of range
a 2011 leaf SLE will run you about 33
grand just like we saw it now deduct a
federal tax credit that is currently
maxing out at 7,500 bucks but that's not
a rebate or cash it's a credit to reduce
the amount of tax you owe the feds in
the year you buy the leaf if you
normally get a rebate at tax time then
there's no tax bill to apply the credit
to and you just pay for the leaf
yourself and that tax credit cannot take
you into a refund in an of itself so you
want to buy this car in coordination
with your accountant and not take tax
advice from me the bottom line this week
it's not easy being green saving the
earth isn't always convenient sometimes
it's downright terrifying and funny
looking but hey it's tough being an
early adopter you can see the rest of
that leaf video over at cnet TV and
that's it for this episode but come back
next week when we'll have a brand new
edition of the CNN tech review until
then there are tons of great videos
available every day at cnet TV com see
you next time and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
