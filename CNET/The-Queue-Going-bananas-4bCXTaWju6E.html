queue hey there are much demure with
seen a TV in New York City so it turns
out you need an itunes account if you
want to use your iPhone that news
leaving many to question apples
rationale incidentally they're the same
people the surprise to find out you need
peanut butter to make up PB&amp;amp;J onto your
eye candy awesome video wall advertising
a Canadian company called sidetrack
delivering moving messages inside subway
tunnels the ads are made up of hundreds
of individually lit up poster boards
inside a moving train car the images
blend together for an animated message
lasting about 15 seconds microsoft
target tropicana and lexus just a few of
the advertisers doing the flip book
inspired video walls widgets are an
increasingly popular way to express
ourselves on web pages and blogs there
are nearly a hundred and eighty million
of them circulating out there now we
know the most popular ones all this
thanks to comscore's widget metrics
photo related widgets dominating the top
ten embedded on sites slide is the top
widget provider followed by rock you top
non-photo widgets include bunny hero
labs interactive cyber pets you adopt
pock bum flash toys graphics and games
and music playlists from project
playlist expect to see more goodies with
Bluetooth built-in now that the
consortium behind the technology has
gobbled up Nokia's competing short-range
wireless called why brie there are plans
for dozens of devices with Bluetooth
including sports watches that measure
performance and report back to your PC
health monitoring equipment that keeps
wireless tabs on you and various other
toys why brie was designed as a
complement to bluetooth and uses a tiny
bit of power compared to its new big
brother if you grew up as a kid in the
80s mr. wizard's world was a fixture of
your Saturday morning with the news of
Don Herbert's passing I just wanted to
say thanks for the early science lessons
surely they set the foundation for a
lifetime love of science and technology
for kids around the globe myself
included mr. wizard was almost 90 Oh
remember him is the guy who had random
neighborhood kids over to his house to
perform cool science experiments there's
even a DVD
if you want to relive those lessons and
who didn't want to be a kid helper on
the show maybe they never got my letters
finally for the first time since World
War two i'm happy to report Twinkies are
back in banana banana cream the original
filling flavor for the snack cake but it
was replaced with vanilla after a banana
shortage in the 1940s that must've been
back when they actually used real
flavorings before the company used to
only go bananas once in a while for a
limited time but due to customer demand
they'll be available from here on out
and according to the company its urban
legend that Twinkies last forever they
say the shelf life is really only about
three weeks more than this show can say
I'm richest a mural with cnet TV in New
York City now go do great things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
