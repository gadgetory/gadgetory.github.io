joined by senior managing editor kent
german to talk about the latest iphone 5
rumors all right Kent so we've already
covered a bigger screen possibly a
smaller pin connector but this week's
rumors include possibly a smaller sim
card is that right sure the first iPad
Apple moved to a micro sim which is a
smaller sim card than we're used to and
then the iphones that came after it also
had a micro sim so this might even be a
smaller sim card no it means nothing to
you as far as the way the phone
functions it still makes calls still
gets data but it does allow for a
possibly bigger battery that's right
because there's now more room for a
bigger battery and along with that
smaller dock connector that was more
room inside the phone so bigger battery
obviously translates to a longer battery
life let's hope and that's going to be
important especially we have that bigger
screen like we've heard a bigger screen
sucks up more in battery or data or
color more vibrancy so you're going to
need something that's going to last
longer absolutely bigger screen means
more movies to watch absolutely and
there's also a little more information
about the release date tell us about
that well we've heard for a while now
the actual announcement date might be
September 12 so that's probably one will
see an apple event ok use what happens
is the release date so when you actually
get it comes a week later and so we're
hearing that it's going to be September
21st which would be nine days later and
so that makes sense sexually that's
usually about the time that we expect
next week and then maybe two more days
ok so the announcement on the 12 in
pre-orders could start on the 12 yes
you'll be able to order them and then
your hot little phone and your hot
little hands just the lines would be the
next week at the apple store ok great
well I know the news is ever-changing so
we look forward to the next update yep
great there you'll see thank you so much
