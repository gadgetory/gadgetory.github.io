glass Explorer edition of CNN update as
a Google glass Explorer I'll be testing
out different uses for this wearable
computer with a camera above the eye the
glass becomes an easy way to record
hands-free video and it's a cool way to
capture sports from an athletes
perspective but what can you do with
glass that you can't do already with a
GoPro well you can video chat on a
Google+ Hangout so I wondered could I
hang out with a coach virtually to get
tips in real time I channeled my inner
Katniss Everdeen and took glass to
pro-line archery lanes in New York I
reached out to coach up comm to find a
coach and they connected me with MJ
Rogers an archery coach in South Dakota
who has worked with Olympic and
Paralympic athletes I'm a beginner at
archery so I hope coach Rogers could
give me tips from the glass point of
view well it took a little bit of
playing around but I finally have coach
MJ on my Google glass here and a hangout
all right so what can I show you here
once we connected I could see coach
Rogers talking to me from his webcam but
I had a hard time hearing him that's
because the glass speaker touches your
head and rest behind your ear it's a
little echoey in here and your volume is
so low and I can just volume my hair so
I have to really pay attention to hear
you so with people talking around me the
audio from the speaker wasn't loud
enough okay I can hear you if I really
focus Google glass project director
Steve Lee tells me that audio is
something the glass team is working to
improve but while at the range
archers around me stop talking so I
could hear with the camera right above
my eye you don't exactly see what I'm
seeing
but coach Rogers said this was still a
helpful perspective to judge how I'm
holding the bow yeah it actually is a
very interesting perspective because I
then can see what you're looking at as
far as the sight picture I'll just pull
back yes
well at least it got on the paper this
time although it still would help to
have a coach be there in person what you
can't see
away your feed on the fact that the
foundation needs to be straight that
your body needs to be straight that
you're not you're not bending over
trying to get someone to learn archery
or any other sport it's missing you have
to be able to see all of that if there
was another camera off to the side that
the person could see your placement
where it's going and see your position
then it would work off to the side we'll
continue to bring you glass experiences
as we spend more time with it if you
have ideas on what else I should try
with glass send an email to update it
see Netcom or find me on Twitter I'm
