coming but there's a chance it may
actually arrive this year author george
RR martin has given a bit of a
wishy-washy sound an update to win he
will release the long-awaited sixth book
in his fantasy series song of ice and
fire which inspired the HBO series Game
of Thrones Anna wishy-washy update is
more than fans usually get because
getting Martin to answer a question
about the book the winds of winter is
like getting tire and Lannister to go an
episode without a drink it just doesn't
happen a fan coax Martin in a comment on
his livejournal blog yes he has a
livejournal the fan wrote that he
doesn't want to rush the author but it's
been a year since fans have been updated
on his progress and he should give the
world another update or else continue to
be pestered by fans like a Targaryen on
a dragon in swoops Martin with an
unexpected reply Martin said not done
yet but I've made progress but not as
much as I hoped a year ago when I
thought to be done by now I think it'll
be out this year but hey I thought the
same thing last year ah so fans will
just have to hold on to hope we're used
to doing plenty of that already readers
of the series have been in limbo waiting
for more than five years for the winds
of winter to publish the first book of
the series came out in 1996 and the past
three books each took about five years
for Martin to write and there's still
another book to go after the winds of
winter it's got diehard fans swearing by
the old gods and the new Martin has
taken so long that HBO has had to move
on in the show and continue the plot
without depending on the books a girl
has no patience and plans to watch
season 7 on HBO this summer I'm Bridget
Carey you can keep up with all the news
in this world and in Westeros at cnet
