hey blacks for cummins good I'm glad to
be special guest yeah yeah yeah thanks
for having us so we have Scott on today
because what the main story that we're
going to talk about today is Super Mario
run and Scott is one of the rare few
people in the world that has actually
tested it out so far it doesn't come out
publicly until next week till next
Wednesday well our seem to be talking
about a story that I wrote about Amazon
dashing some rumors that it's actually
planning on opening thousands of new
stores so don't expect that to happen
anytime soon as always send in your
questions and comments Brian will get to
them at the end of the podcast in
between nursing this massive hangover
right yeah we had the CBS I holiday
party yesterday so some of us are still
partying some of us some of us are a
little slower megami party not me I have
a million children so I can never a
drink hundra gun I'm sure look beautiful
all right all right without further ado
let the magic begin all right we'll
start the recording in three two the
hand welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox
Rubin I'm Alfred Aang and with us today
is legendary reviewer Scott Stein hi I
almost did you just myself that's but I
never do that hey your hip great to be
here yeah Nintendo's much-anticipated
mobile games Super Mario run is coming
out next thursday Scott you had a chance
to play and review the game what did you
think well i only got to play it for
first of all the first two worlds of
what are going to be six worlds and like
for only a handful of minutes but you
know I I love Mario games I feel like
this is definitely if you played mobile
games if you ever play like Rayman run
there's a game that you would be
something made it's like that but it's
super mario and it totally looks like a
mario game like a desert ver marvel like
a mario it does but it's like it feels
like a mario game were like one of those
like you had a special level where Mario
was just always running and you had to
just use one button because sometimes
Mario
do get weird there are a few that there
are courses that have always felt like
that but it's like if all the levels
were like that so you can't control him
to move around and you could also be
like other characters too but I didn't
get a chance to be other characters yeah
um it's it's fun my question is having
played it for as much as I did is it
worth the ten-dollar unlock which is a
high price in mobile or a mobile game
it's harmony Rio game it's not a high
price yeah that's not that standard
though we're like their games are gonna
be this price you know just kind of
easing people into it if anything so
it's interesting i spoke with speaking
of that I spoke to Nintendo's president
Reggie fils-aime a and he suggested that
each game they're releasing is going to
have its own monetization decisions okay
so may not necessarily said each one is
gonna be different he even hinted that
fire emblem he says I'm at the game
design and the monetization are gonna be
linked somehow I don't know if that
means but um he was suggesting like in
this one you wouldn't want to like keep
stopping the game super mario stop and
reaching your wallet and pay more money
but i think it's just a way of
explaining that for them you're probably
right it's both I'm sure Nintendo's
testing what the ten dollar threshold
will be and I bet they're gonna keep
testing in the next few games as they
work their way around you know this
becomes a smash success and sells tons
of ten dollars that's it that's the
question that I have for for the both of
you Alfred I know you haven't tried the
game out yet but you know this is a
super mario game so there's there's a
lot of expectation around it I want to
throw to both of you guys what do you
think like as far as is this is this a
huge hit in the waiting or oh for sure
it looks so simple that like everyone's
just going to download it i mean it
reminded me a lot of other mobile games
like subway surfers mmm where is it's
it's like a runner game i was worried
that it be too similar to that because
that game gets really boring but from
the different platforms on like
different modes that I've seen it looks
really interesting I think people want
to keep playing it for a bit the level
design looks great is great like or some
levels are more like puzzles that felt
like more like those you know you'd go
through different rooms and try to solve
their way through so it's not always a
race and there's another mode called so
it's like you these 24 levels which are
like your standard Mario game then you
have this mode called I think it's
called toad rally where you basically
are challenging you can invite any
friends or people from facebook or
twitter in
to like your leader personal leaderboard
yes it sounds I also liked a kingdom
builder where it reminds me a lot of
Super Mario maker it is admitted yeah i
like it just kind of more like animal
crossing it's like a little landmarks
yeah I'm curious about how deep that'll
because I almost got seen out of that
and toad rally is like 60 seconds you've
got to do a lot of scores and fancy
moves and you get coins and like toad
followers and that like that's like your
status and that enables you to buy stuff
in the Mushroom Kingdom part so you can
that unlock things with the coins which
and like the followers lie to buy stuff
with the coins it's so the chance to get
like badges and metals but it also means
you you'll always be playing these games
to get scores according to Nintendo so
there's like a competitive nature to
every level if that's super addictive
then it's worth it but if you go through
all 24 levels and you're like I'm done
then that's the question or is that
enough for for ten dollars yeah I gotta
retarget with a little bit of time we
have I wrote a story yesterday that
Amazon finally decided to throw cold
water cold water all over rumors that
it's planning to open two thousand
stores not even close as what they said
you guys kind of said about this at kind
of a big rumor you just throw around two
or a huge number 3000 you know how many
trader joes there are I look this up
yesterday no 500 why it'll be four times
the number of Trader Joe's it's like
there are no Killian trader joes that's
what you would think but now I've no
contact of numbers yeah exactly thousand
two thousand we don't know it's a 10,000
2500 I think it would be kind of cool if
it did exist at that number but um
they're not I think they're still
playing around with the concept so many
animals go to store what's that I'm okay
with it not being a physical store at
all but yeah so anyway we're at a time
if you want to read more about these
stories check us out on cnet I'm Ben Fox
Rubin I'm Alfred aying I'm Scott's died
thanks for listening
you
okay I've ruined the intro and the egg
next row extra after your own outro be
its outro outro extra rows in a terrible
horror movie from the 80s that's what
that's what I'd rather than that also as
my mic still weird extra weird there
mike is always weird yeah that's cuz
your voice is weird yeah that's a bee
why I blame her microphone I'm a lot
cooler in real life guys yeah I rlm just
a jihadi already my body is ready hang
on hang on hang on I got it I got it
there you go yup just gonna leave this
up for the rest of the podcast not
really sure with Reggie's gonna be
watching this and just watering oh
they're never getting interviews in fact
with that this our peoples ingress is
this like yes Boise good where's this
come from where did that come from I
don't know you Reggie Alfred you're the
meme expert um it was like back around
like III when he'd make announcements
for like you know much hyped games
people would just say like my body's
ready then they put it over him for some
reason that's true there's be awesome it
wasn't something I can almost set a 23 I
don't even know it's like as your body
said it he said it before he played a
hungry box in a game of a super smash
brothers at one point oh cool so it says
it works oh my god i really like it i
think you might even find that funny
he's got a very good sense of humor yes
he does alright let's picture to the
question i'm a speaker I'm happens
Matthew wants to know how long is the
delay for the Android release Greg
Martin coming out in 2017 isn't it yup
which one the Android release yeah 2017
and also yeah it's only iOS next
Thursday that's absolutely right yeah
it's an exclusivity window like you see
with with a lot of console games and
then next year they did say that the
next to Nintendo games are coming out by
end of fiscal year which would be what
March the reversed for Nintendo the end
of the first end of this fiscal year
which would be march 31st I think 2017
which would be animal crossing and Fire
Emblem Animal Crossing is gonna kill
Abel yes sir they are coming that was in
the interview piece I wrote though he
like you basically said that so um keep
your eye out for those what's what's uh
what's data consumption going to be like
on these can you play offline for super
mario run yeah yeah I think it's a the
main game is all offline unless you do
the challenge
if you got a challenge against actually
I don't know you might be able to play
that offline too because all of that is
asynchronous it's like ghosts runs
basically you know you're not playing
someone live you're playing there
against their high score so if you have
that score cached I may not be surprised
to see that they could be playable too
but a lot of it should be playable
offline and before I move forward pitch
out to the chat is it Mario or Mario
it's Mario it's supposed to be Mario
I've lived too long he says his own name
as much to say Mario I'd like he's his
disrespect how's that in the face of a
time we call him Mario because he goes
it's a me mario and you're pronouncing
my name wrong what good I'm from I'm
from Philadelphia we also pronounced why
he's from Italy water water when he's
not from Italy Orioles Super Mario or
water for water Super Mario what along
sorry I'm super mario water you come get
a glass in REO ice water in my car all
right all right all right I shots more
question and then our numbers are
dwindling words they are when does
pokemon go come to Apple watch I don't
know this is the question of the you
must be Ben now by the end of the year
watch that'll come out like in three
days didn't even know that was gonna be
a thing yeah they did say by the Nazca
they now sit during when they announced
he off from 70 right of course ok no one
cared though because oh there was all
this other cool stuff going on so yeah I
said phone jacks it's like that in the
end air pods are both still mi wonder
hair pots coming out right when the
Pokemon app comes out I'll be with
nobody i know has air buds i have air
buds we show them but yeah I
pre-production earpods everyone who got
at the venue was able to review them got
the a set of these that they said or not
or find a review but are not the
technically the final version so here
they are they're like they're coming
like a unicorn now they're a thing yeah
they're a thing I'll get them closer
together right I actually like them I
don't love them but I use them all time
you better love them for 159 dollars I
don't love room for 159 dollars but i
love how small they are and i like that
the battery life has not ever been a
problem for me and I think nice
all is what I'm surprised you haven't
lost them yet I'm a little afraid every
day of my life of losing them I feel
like it's just gonna happen like a child
yeah you know just like gone with the
wind yeah and then I'll be gone they've
never fallen out of my ears though never
um now watch they'll out of my ear at
some actually no it's not true they
fellow mirrors went up when I put a bag
strap over my shoulder and I went and I
like popped see that's how you could
look nice lung might easily I pulled a
bag strap off in it like clip my ear
it's usually what happens with my
glasses I do that and then my glasses
fly across the room I just can't wait
till the the news headlines of you know
Apple earpods get stolen on train like
somebody just somebody in the driver by
york subway just grab somebody's here
it's not even that it's him like super
villain that just has a giant magnet
that just like possible okay we've
gotten to this point man we're probably
do that you bring the magnets up into
the yank amend everyone's ears we're
devastatingly off topic and I want to
get back into the show and I just want
to come I just like this comment amazon
opening stores it's like wiping before
you poop it doesn't make any sense I
agree with that nothing about the Wi-Fi
energy but I think they're taking a step
backwards by like opening a physical
store look I never want to walk anywhere
or talk to anybody again just let me go
I'm like look at rental is our future
right here and a comment or after my own
heart by the way thank you very much for
the camera let me say first like
sometimes you just want to wipe to feel
refreshed so oh my god let's not go off
topic already well I'm just gonna think
about that analogy um but then going
into the second bar ever invited back on
this podcast why payment for your
problems i'm thinking about it now the
causality of it i think it probably i
think amazon stores make more sense than
wiping before you poop i know a little
bit a little a little bit you don't make
any money for wiping before you buy
before you poop is crazy tan by getting
100 stores either yeah they could i
would get like a candy bar and a bottle
of water from an amazon store it's just
it's it's such a weird step backwards
it's like if Nintendo decided to start
like selling cards again they could do
that they could well it's just they do
my parts they make those lame cards they
make a meebo know it would be like if HP
decided they wanted to start building
typewriters yeah both of the things are
gonna start happy
why you like this prototype right its
twenty it's almost 2017 gang what
physical store shouldn't exist anymore
alpha is pissed about this I want to
leave my house but we're still physical
alright everything should be in the
cloud ok so it's visual always exists
important to remember in the coming
millennial comments yeah ninety percent
of physical or sorry ninety percent of
us retail is still in the physical space
so Amazon and online are growing much
much faster than physical retail however
most of what we do and most of what we
buy and we as in the United States of
America is still very much in malls in
neighborhood supermarkets different
stuff like that so it's then that's
going to continue to exist for the
foreseeable future like food maybe
amazon just have a pizza parlor yeah get
a slice like this license amazon basic
me I just need a slice and I put and
some chicken but of course the slices
brought your table I drone right so
Scott Matthew wants you to stack up your
experience playing a super mario run
against the original super mario land on
gameboy oh that's a really good one so
super online a gameboy I liked a lot
that was like super simple though it
graphically um but I actually the level
design the Super Mario run is more
advanced I think there's more there's a
lot more like you're used to like
finding hidden things and they also have
it in each love light and says in the
podcast but there are three different
challenges so if you're used to
collecting like coins or you know stars
or hidden things there's there are five
pink coins at first you have to try to
get and if you get through those and you
have try to get I think it's the Red
Coins and then it's the black coin so
it's like three challenge runs within
the level besides just finishing the
level so I mean I'm sure like you would
beat that and then you'd say okay I'm
done but they're so there is like some
depth whereas like back in the Super
Mario Land days you didn't even have
that yeah you have extra challenges just
you were happy with what you got here's
an interesting interesting thought is if
they were able to apply the taptic
engine to create new game experience how
would that work out it would be good
except there's so little you're doing
then touch in that that but I mean like
could you in
Oh more pressure for higher jump or
something like that so you can't hold
longer to jump higher and then you can
double tap to just spin jump to in the
game but I think that you could I think
it might be more I think taptic really
interesting for it is interesting that
for virtual buttons and at some point if
you have a scheme like like Reggie once
again had asked him about classic NES it
has a good tangent but classic NES games
on the iphone why not I mean no we can
get the NES mini but he was like well
it's about the control and input I keep
thinking well there were tons of games
that do that but if you have haptics in
those buttons maybe it helps you find
those buttons more easily like when you
have two or three buttons so that's a
good point yeah or at least know what
you're doing when you're pressing the
screen maybe the buttons just appear
where you press that's a long answer for
like yes but I don't know for a
one-button game I think the problem also
with haptics is is that they only exist
on the iphone 6s and then later models
after that so you are losing a little
bit okay well wait a minute is it on the
SE or not um not this no not the same
way okay it's a vibrator you are you are
losing some of your um like I'm ordering
it yeah all of them just doing haptics
all those games even way back could like
buzz when something happens is like it
buzzes the buzzer and your your phone
then it went to like more advanced
optics and then new iPhones like so
subtle that it can just give you like a
gentle little tap some games like um
actually it's really cool like alters
adventure if you if you play that like
the assassin's creed altaf no no it's
the one where you're skiing I love that
game it's an endless skier I love that
game that game and now when you're
playing it there's like a really
satisfying like if you're jumping on
stuff there's like a little gentle thud
when you get certain things like it's
like a little little tap on your
shoulder I think we're looking at my
body is ready not the whole time that I
thought I had my haptics are ready
that's cool I don't feel try that yeah
it's good it's not like um sometimes
that's better than others but you could
see where that's that's really not a bad
idea it's like a nice bonus and phones
going forward and one last to close it
out do we know when the new pokemon
features are going to roll out new
Pokemon go then anybody then do no idea
okay like the new pokemon themselves and
also the
the sprint stuff yeah yeah god we talked
about that earlier this week I have so
lost track of Pokemon goes down dates I
don't even add it it is another comment
um it's coming coming soon I don't know
off the top of my head yeah I haven't
seen a date either yeah but so we just
write about it this week so it should be
expected Priya there's the starbucks
news earlier today to that they're
partnering with them for pokki sob how
do ya who can i say saying in a relation
to Super Mario rungis more please I'm
going to ask a question that nobody
asked what about updates to Super Mario
Ryan I'll answer that question but we
don't really know they said that unlike
welcome hon go I like to ask my own
questions and it was good let's all just
leave a lift Scott talked to himself the
Pokemon go things is free to play so
they're always having updates try to get
you in they said that Super Mario run is
going to be you know pay once and unlock
everything you need thank you yeah so
it's good although there are like
there's like little tickety things you
earned do challenges and it wasn't clear
whether you would have to pay for more
tickets or earned them or and you get a
certain amount with the unlock and I was
like what's that all about they also
mentioned the fact that like if this is
a huge hit and it takes off they could
create something like a super mario run
to right where is it built in hunstanton
updates or whatever right so but they
did say that there will be extra
surprises to keep you coming back and
playing mmm I was like what is that and
they were like well they'll be it's an
psychos you'll be surprised I was like
what does that just mean like extra
modes or maybe like extra characters or
maybe like the extra characters yeah
come on did you play like a gimmick a
long holiday game I would maybe like the
idea Dukey Super Mario I would like the
idea that it would actually be a game
that you play and it's over and then you
get the next version you know that's how
I that's how it is in consoles right and
in mobile gaming it's just they put you
on a hamster wheel and it's this
constant repetition and that's how they
you know keep getting more money out of
you so I do like this idea of going back
to the old school the old ways yeah
thank you let's go back to the old ways
let's go to one of the two thousand
amazon stores yeah that are not gonna be
out there that's right and pick it up
always the old and the new alright
that's a good place to stop ok alright
