internet explorer I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update if you use
Internet Explorer pay close attention
Microsoft is warning everyone about a
serious security problem with its
browser the flaw makes it easy for a
hacker to take total control of your
computer and all it takes is for you to
accidentally click on a malicious link
in your email or an instant message and
it will take you to a website that
automatically install software that can
hijack your machine from there hackers
have the power to install programs and
snoop into your accounts they have
access to everything and you may not
even realize it's happening that's why
this is extra creepy the best solution
is to stop using Internet Explorer until
Microsoft patches the problem Firefox
and Chrome they're safe from the threat
but if you need to use Internet Explorer
there are a few things you can do to
raise your shields the newest versions
of internet explorer IE 10 and 11 they
have something called enhanced protected
mode you should enable that setting you
can also set your browser security to
hide the bug also gets in using Adobe
Flash so you could disable flash to
avoid infection but there's more bad
news if you have an AOL account you need
to change your password now AOL is
urging tens of millions of email users
to change passwords and security
questions after two percent of its
accounts were compromised by hackers you
may have noticed a few of your AOL
friends sending spam recently but this
goes beyond annoying spam hackers were
able to see passwords and personal
profile info like your home mailing
address and answers to security
questions contacts from address books
were also compromised AOL is emailing
everyone affected by the hack and let's
move on from the doom and gloom there's
actually some good news out there take
for instance skype the video chat
service now has free group calling
before you had to pay ten dollars a
month for skype premium to group chat
but it didn't make much sense for
Microsoft to charge when Google Offers
group chats for free on hangouts the
free skype group calls will first roll
out to windows and mac desktops and the
xbox one
speaking of Xbox if there wasn't enough
video to watch these days Microsoft will
broadcast its own original TV shows to
Xbox owners beginning in june you may
already know about the Halo series being
produced by Steven Spielberg but there
will be also 11 other programs Microsoft
is not confirming if you need to pay for
an xbox live account to watch all the
shows all we know is that it can be
viewed on the xbox 360 the new xbox one
and other Microsoft devices they should
really clear that up soon that's your
tech news update you can head to
cnet.com for more details from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
