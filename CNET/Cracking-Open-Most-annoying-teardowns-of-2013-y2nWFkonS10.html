first wearable we've cracked open a lot
of tech this year and as we do at the
end of each year it's time to take a
look back but this time with a little
twist I'm Bill Detweiler
and during this special episode of
cracking open I'm counting down my top 5
most annoying tear downs of 2013 the
number 5 spot on our list goes to
Apple's 2013 MacBook Air now don't get
me wrong it's a great laptop I use one
on a daily basis but it's special
pentalobe screws make the case difficult
to open and once you're inside there's
really not much you can do as most of
the components are soldered to the
motherboard at number 4 is another Apple
creation well actually two of them the
iPhone 5s and 5c aren't much more
difficult to crack open than their
predecessors but thanks to their
external pentalobe screws variety of
internal screw sizes and all the
components that are glued to the case
the iPhones are still a pain to repair
coming in at number three is the last
Apple device on our list the iPad air
now as with previous iPads the front
panel is glued to the tablet's metal
body and you'll need to heat the panel
to open the case now even after
separating the panel in the case you
can't remove it without removing the
display throw in that the battery and
most other internal components are glued
in place and this tablet definitely
isn't repair friendly now in the second
spot on our list is the first wearable
device that we've ever cracked open the
Google glass Explorer edition the camera
and eyepiece assemblies cover came off
relatively easily
but despite prying poking even heating
the main and rear modules nothing worked
and since I didn't want to destroy the
device I had to give up only halfway
into the teardown well we've reached the
end of our list and standing above all
the others or maybe below depending on
how you look at it is the king of
annoying 2013 tear downs the Microsoft
Surface 2 now unlike the Google glass I
was actually able to dissect the serve
- but it was a miserable two-hour ordeal
why well for starters the front panel
adhesive is incredibly strong and
heating the front panel is difficult as
some of the tablets internal components
and external trim pieces are made from
plastic which will warp if overheated I
know I did it there are also more than
60 screws inside the case of all
different sizes the battery is glued in
place and most of the motherboard
connectors are extremely fragile and
easily broken the surface 2 is
definitely an improvement over last
year's model when it comes to hardware
specs and performance but it is the most
difficult to crack open tablet I've ever
worked on well that does it for our
countdown of the most annoying cracking
open tear downs of 2013 now to find
links to each teardown on the list go to
TechRepublic comm forward slash cracking
open and keep watching in 2014 as i'll
be cracking open even more of the latest
tech i'm build my list thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
