you know I'm not a huge fan of 3d
building rendering to me it's like it's
not quite enough his little matchstick
buildings or they look like kind of
what's really out there but not really
look I go out I candy to me but that may
be changing check out this new system
from Audi which they call their 3d
navigation system in the sense that it
is fully rendered as you drive in a way
that has much more reality than we've
seen on navigation systems before look
at these buildings now assuming that
that was the city that you know those
have enough detail in them enough
surface rendering that you should be
able to actually recognize them not kind
of recognize it which to me is just
distracting I want this or I want
nothing when it comes to building
rendering here I think I really could
get an idea of where I am especially in
a strange city I've not been to before I
could look around say oh there are those
buildings I know where I am notice this
off ramp here check that out they've
rented it so precisely you can see
little kinks in the turn so you really
can get an idea are you in the exact
same place that you think you're
supposed to be it really just adds a lot
more visual depth and accuracy that you
can work with now let me show you
another technology they're working on
that I've often been on head-up display
this head up display mocked up here for
display purposes of course you wouldn't
have this in your car is an augmented
reality technology really laying things
out in the world out the windshield not
just right here like some sort of a
fixed projection let's take a look okay
check this out at the bottom you see
information like you've seen on a
head-up display before that's not
revolutionary but look at those lane
lines and look at that navigational
arrow coming up this is augmented
reality it's actually placed in three
dimensions out in the road in front of
you so you get a sense of where things
were supposed to happen not just that
they're supposed to happen you also get
some nice
convenience for the focal length of your
eyes instead of always looking back and
focusing on a plane two feet in front of
you you're basically looking out at the
road like you always would less eye
strain less refocusing makes driving
safer and makes the information as you
can see here a lot more relevant it's
integrated into the world you're looking
at out the windshield and finally Audi
is getting very close to putting in a
full digital video instrument panel like
you see here and this sort of thing
allows your instrument panel you can see
the gauges are kind of moving out of the
way right now to make room for other
information it allows the real estate to
be flexible so that the thing can be
contextually emphasizing what matters at
that moment now some of these are
farther in the future than others that
fly over 3d building rendering is not
far away they say neither is the video
instrument panel that augmented reality
heads up there might be a few years down
the road but you can see where things
were going to finally get the inside of
the car to catch up with a lot of
consumer electronics we're already is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
