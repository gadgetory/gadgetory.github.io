today we're going to be talking about
certain features that you may find in a
front load washer for our example today
because it's a pretty representative one
we're going to be looking at the Samsung
WF four five seven washer this is a
pretty standard looking front load
washer as far as they go it's got a very
sleek appearance and that kind of
fishbowl feel that you get from looking
through that clear window on the front
of the drum you'll first notice that
it's sitting flat on the floor which may
be different in certain models you've
seen most front load washers are sold
separately from pedestals others come
with them but you can always buy a
pedestal most of which include drawers
to set this up upon it'll elevate the
washer about a foot and a half in height
and also give you extra storage space
you may prefer this extra height as it
makes it easier to get in and out of the
washer front load washers operate almost
exactly the same is your top loading
washers you're going to open the door
and put your clothes in and shut it the
same as you would it's the top drum
cover on a top loading washer this
particular model is a 4.5 cubic foot
washer that means it's got an
extra-large drum it can handle
comforters and according to Samsung 2.4
laundry baskets worth of clothes there
are a lot of smart loading washers with
similar capacities on the market this
also makes it a more efficient machine
in addition to being able to wash larger
quantity items such as blankets
comforters pillows it also means that
because you can wash more clothing at
one time you're washing less frequently
which saves time on your part and energy
on the part of your home one of the
things that separate front load washers
from traditional top load washers are
how the detergent is put into the
machine with front load washers there is
a drawer that pulls out that has all of
the compartments for fabric softener
bleach and detergent that are really
easily labeled and you just pour in the
top smart technology is kind of a buzz
concept right now particularly in the
appliance world and a lot of different
manufacturers are trying to get a piece
of that pie Samsung is an example of how
manufacturers are adding touchscreens to
their washers and dryers although they
are adding them to a lot of other
appliances as well you may have noticed
the lack of dials and buttons on this
that may currently exist on your washer
at home it does include a power button
and a stop button but aside from that
all controls are done through the use of
the touch screen many smart washing
machines also include corresponding
smart phone apps where you can check on
the progress of a wash or run
Diagnostics if your machine is not
working properly the washing machine is
one of those appliances that is
certainly evolved over the last couple
of years it used to be that you could
wash and are just a couple of cycles
delicates permanent press and you had
very little control over what
temperature of water was used during the
cycles your choices were hot or cold but
a lot of washers particularly front load
washers although they are bringing this
technology to more traditional top
loading washers as well include a lot of
different options for example this one
has 21 different functions from which
you can choose some functions boasted by
front load washers are baby clothes
sanitizing functions cycles that can
almost replace dry cleaning or so gentle
on your clothes and with the addition of
more high power Jets and rinsing cycle
through even some heavier duty programs
that are really gained at athletic
equipment or clothing that has been
taken through the mud by your children
or your athletes alike this particular
model is an Energy Star approved washer
most of your front loading washing
models now are high efficiency and
therefore receive the Energy Star Seal
of Approval this means that they require
less power and water to run but are just
as effective and
these machines are designed by their
very nature to save energy and run more
efficiently but some of them include
delayed start options that do this even
more effectively for example you can
delay your wash to run during non-peak
energy hours like in the middle of the
night or if you want your washer to run
when you're not at home you can program
that as well so this has been a general
overview of front load washers but in
the rest of this sign guide you discuss
top-load washers compact washers laundry
centers in a variety of features and
more specific details pertaining to all
of these so be sure to check that out
and be sure to check out the review for
this washer as well as many other
