Mobile World Congress pulled in more
than seventy two thousand attendees a
new record all in Barcelona to see the
latest in phones tablets mobile services
apps and trends all right we're here at
huawei this is jeff's first hands-on
with a phablet it is it is not just any
phablet this is the the ascend mate and
it is gigantic it was announced at CES
made a huge splash and it's a huge so to
speak trev's i think it most bigger
phone definitely I mean do I look stupid
oh well it's not for that yeah stop
pretending the phones are for talking

more than this this is the next big
thing
because it's really about it's a large
thing everybody's getting in that 7-inch
tablet game yes lots of these around
these parts another big trend in mobile
phone development China these
manufacturers that you're just starting
to hear a huawei and also up-and-comer
ZTE are starting to make some very cool
phones expect them to be sort of the
next generations samsung remember how
they came out of nowhere and now they
own it stay in ZTE this grand memo and
some of their other announcements at the
show looking pretty good oh it's so easy
as a very nice keyboard though that's
what it is
traditional audio devices have been on
the market for years what we have done
is we've integrated a display on the
front I'm video a and there's a menu in
the upper right Wow the galaxy note a
point was super nice it's a good size
too that was a really good idea that
Apple had to build a 7-inch tablet
that's actually an 8-inch tablet yet
another 7 inch tablet this one from
Yahweh is she a media pad 7 light which
is kind of an ironic name when you
consider it's not very lightweight
compared to all the other ones we've
been seeing it's the least impressive of
the seven inches I've seen at the show
so far it's big and thick and clunky and
it's only got android 4.0 on it no jelly
bean here color me unimpressed and of
course there were new gadgets galore

announcements from barsa
