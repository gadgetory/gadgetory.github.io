us Holograms to make it up to us I'm
Raja Carrie and this is your CNET update
Microsoft revealed new details about the
Windows 10 operating system it showed us
a new web browser that works with
Cortana and announced that you can cross
play Xbox games with Windows 10 it
introduced a new digital whiteboard for
the office and then just blew all that
away with Holograms Microsoft is putting
Google glass to shame with a new type of
headset called hololens it projects
images on these see-through lenses that
you wear so computer images appear to
float in front of you it's smart enough
to know your environment to note there's
a table in front of you or a wall
Microsoft calls it a hologram but this
isn't a Princess Leia Star Wars style
hologram no one can see it but the
person wearing the glasses the tech is
called augmented reality and with it you
can play games in your living room use
it as a teaching tool or collaborate on
projects it runs completely wireless
with several sensors that process
terabytes of information on Windows 10
you can build your own holograms with a
program called hollow studio think of it
as the Microsoft paint of the future
Microsoft demonstrated live how to
create a quad copter using a finger as a
mouse and voice commands to change
settings we don't have a specific date
when hololens is going to come up for
consumers but hey looks like the movie
Back to the Future 2 which is set in
2015 was onto something here Windows 10
just seems so boring to talk about after
Holograms but here's what you need to
know it's going to be a free update for
Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 users but we
don't know what day it's going to come
out and this whole Windows 10 experience
is going to be the same across PCs
tablets and your smartphone the design
is what Windows 8 should have been it
gives you a desktop mode with a Start
menu even your Xbox one is tied into
Windows 10 games on your Xbox one can be
streamed to your Windows 10 computer and
you can play xbox live across devices so
a Windows 10 user can jump into a game
with a friend that's play
on Xbox one Cortana is going to be a big
selling feature of Windows 10 because
this voice controlled assistant is
coming to the PC Cortana is also in a
new internet browser called Project
Spartan
this is different from Internet Explorer
it lets you make notations on a website
by typing or drawing and you can share
it to someone through email Facebook or
Twitter this is also coming to Windows
Phone and businesses may be interested
in the surface hub it's a new type of
whiteboard that runs Windows 10 this
84-inch 4k screen has built-in sensors
and cameras Wi-Fi Bluetooth NFC all
sorts of tools to make meetings easier
that's your quick Windows 10 a wrap up
update but you can find more details

York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
