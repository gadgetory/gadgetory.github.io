iPhone and iPad every year like
clockwork but some of their products
haven't seen a refresh in a while
Donald Bell in this top 5 I'm kind down
the 5 Apple products that need some
attention starting off at number 5 the
Mac Pro Apple's super-powered waste
paper basket came out in December of
2013
pull off the impossible task of getting
people actually excited about a desktop
computer that's why it's a little
surprising the Apple is leaving this
little guy alone I mean at least give us
a gold version to coordinate with our
Apple watch number 4 the iPod helped the
iPod there would be no iPhone no iPad no
Apple as we know it but at this point
the iPod is sort of like that awkward
uncle you feel obligated to invite over
for Thanksgiving they haven't offered a
major update since 2012 and in the
meantime they killed off the poor old
iPod Classic but maybe now with the
beats acquisition there could be a new
fresh iPod that could capture our
attention again or maybe we're just all
supposed to buy Apple watches now coming
in at number 3 Apple TV here's another
one that just hasn't seen a major update
since 2012 meanwhile Amazon Google Roku
Nvidia they've all been chipping away at
that video streamer market it's time for
Apple of take the reins back and deliver
a 4k compatible Apple TV and give cord
cutters a subscription TV service that
will make Comcast and Time Warner cringe
I'm number 2 the Apple Thunderbolt
Display Apple makes one of the most
beautiful computer monitors money can
buy and that Thunderbolt integration
allows video and graphics professionals
to easily daisy chain multiple screens
together unfortunately the current
version has been on the market since
2011 and it's not even 4k seems like an
easy update to make especially for all
those Mac Pro users out there but the
number one Apple product that spent the
longest on the Shelf is the magic
had a lot of people scratch their heads
at this thing when it came out in 2010
but five years later more and more of us
have come to rely on the trackpad
gestures for multitasking granted the
current Magic Trackpad
as is is a great tool for those of us
who dock our laptops at our desk but now
with apples forced touch and their
haptic feedback features the Magic
Trackpad could be even better so there
you go five Apple products that are
looking a little stale I wouldn't be
surprised if a few of these were updated
this year especially the Apple TV for
all the latest Apple rumors and news
