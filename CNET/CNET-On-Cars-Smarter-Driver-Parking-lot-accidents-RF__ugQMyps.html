car accidents take place in parking lots
according to our partners over at State
Farm now the majority of these are
obviously not terribly serious but if
they involve a pedestrian they certainly
can be lucky is a lot of new car
technology on the market much of it
being built in by manufacturers that
lets you avoid these low-speed accidents
that are either very serious or at least
very embarrassing clear cameras are the
most obvious and I especially like the
new wide-angle mode some cameras have
when you're in the parking lot like
we've seen recently on the Acura RLX
some cameras have really good markings
for distance and trajectory others don't
tell you much at all other than showing
you a picture of what's back there so
look for the more informative kind if
you're buying a new car some big BMWs
and Bentley's are among the cars with
front cameras kind of wall-eyed
apparatus that looks 90 degrees sideways
great for nosing out of a garage onto a
sidewalk or in traffic a round view
cameras which I first saw Infiniti
popularized wrap up a little of all the
above in giving you a sort of bird's eye
view of your car stitched together
between cameras sometimes the biggest
challenge is just taking it all in now a
cousin of blind spot detection
technology is cross traffic alert it's
found on many Chrysler and Ford cars
uses radar sensors that look sideways to
let you know if you're about to get
t-boned while backing out of a spot Land
Rover has a new wrinkle they're using
sensors that look up and down the
vehicle and they call it flank guard
lets you know when you're about to
scrape the side of your expensive SUV
wall parking and if you do happen to
scrape someone's car in a parking lot
you can do the right thing of course and
leave a note but that's so old-fashioned
instead there is of course an app for
that the bumped Network allowing you to
message anyone by their license plate if
they're signed up of which I am NOT
