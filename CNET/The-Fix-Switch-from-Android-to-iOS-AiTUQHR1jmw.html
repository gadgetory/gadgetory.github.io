screens have a lot of people interested
in upgrading to the iPhone 6 and iPhone
6 plus even some Android users have
taken notice if you're one of those
people who are ready to take the plunge
to Apple from Android you're in luck
it used to be a huge pain to switch from
one mobile platform to the other but
it's now easier than ever to transfer
all of your old data from Android to
your new iPhone syncing your mail
contacts and calendar with your new
device is simple Google will
automatically backup all of your
information to your Gmail account from
your new iPhone head to settings scroll
down to mail contacts calendar tap Add
Account and select Google enter your
gmail credentials and click Next make
sure everything you would like to sync
over to your new iPhone is checked off
and then click Save
your contacts calendar and email will
now be synced up but one thing is still
missing and that's your photos the
easiest way to get your photos over to
your new iPhone would be to use a
cross-platform cloud service such as
Google+ photos Amazon Cloud Drive
Dropbox or a similar app that's
available on both Android and iOS you
can also upload your photos to your
computer and manually transfer them to
your iPhone to do this start by
connecting your Android device to your
computer if you're on Windows you can
simply drag and drop files on a map you
must download a free program from Google
called Android file transfer once it has
been installed open it click on the DCIM
folder followed by camera you can then
drag and drop all of your photos or
specific ones to your computer I
recommend creating a new folder and
placing the photos in it this will make
it easier to sync with them with your
iPhone later on to get those photos over
to your new device simply connect your
iPhone to your computer open iTunes and
choose to sync photos from that same
folder for everything else Google has a
ton of apps available for free on the
apple's app store is google play books
movies music and newsstand for all of
your content the must-haves for any
Android user has to be Google Maps and
the Google Search app which will show
you all those cool predictive Google
Mail cards and that's all it takes to
bring the world of Google
your iPhone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
