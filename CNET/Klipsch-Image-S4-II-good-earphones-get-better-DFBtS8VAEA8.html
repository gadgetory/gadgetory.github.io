cnet.com and I'm here with the Klipsch
s4i twos these are in ear headphones and
they are very popular in ear headphones
and they've been highly rated by CNET in
the past
clips really hasn't done much to change
them but the one big difference is the
core design clips has gone to a flat
core design the earlier model has some
complaints about durability especially
for some of the sporting activities the
cord didn't hold up so well was very
thin this one is a flat cord tangle
resistant and other than that clips
really hasn't changed anything the sound
these had very good sound for the money
these are sub $100 earphones this model
here the s4 eye has a built-in inline
remote with the microphone that's $99
and the step-down model the simply the
s4 2 has no inline remote and that's $79
from a performance standpoint what's
interesting about these clips earphones
is that one of the keys to them is the
ear tip itself and also the design of
the earphone it just is a comfortable
earphone and it really gets a tight seal
in your ear and clips has some of the
best ear tips in the business they're
just more conical shape and that really
helps with the sound particularly the
bass I personally don't think these are
that much better than compute models
they're very they sound very good
but what happens with these clip shows
is since you get such a nice tight seal
they really do deliver the best sound
for what they can do so again the key
design change here is that flat core
design everything else is the same
including the sound so Klipsch is
basically made a very good earphone even
better I will say this if you are
interested in doing sporting activities
with these clips also makes the rugged
s4 I that's a sports model and that has
a sweat resistant design and that is
probably a better choice if you are
using these at the gym or for running
I'm David Carr noise and those are the
clips s4 i2 in your headphones thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
