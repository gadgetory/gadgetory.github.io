adorned android TV box is one of the
most powerful streaming devices
available and it should be because at
two hundred bucks it cost more than
twice as much as a Roku or an apple TV
there's also a $300 version called the
shield pro that increases the storage
capacity from 16 to 500 gigs so what do
you get for that extra money the first
thing as you'd expect from gaming
specialist nvidia is improved graphics
power the shield can access an array of
optimized titles including half-life 2
Borderlands the pre-sequel and telltale
games Game of Thrones the ones that I
played on the system looked very good
and since it comes with a controller
they're much easier to play that
standard games on Android TV the
downside is that you don't get access to
first run a list titles like you would
on a real console like ps4 or Xbox one
shield can deliver pc games by an nvidia
equipped computer in your home however
it can also access in videos grid
streaming service beyond games the
shield's other main appeal is 4k it can
stream netflix is 4k videos to a
compatible 4k TV as well as 4k youtube
videos the shield's connectivity
outclasses any other streamer 2 with a
pair of USB ports and ethernet jack and
an SD card slot for expanded storage it
can also connect to external hard drives
and USB drives as well as the cloud to
put photo video and music files on your
entertainment system the shield still
falls a bit short of our favorite
streaming devices however mainly because
Android TV still lacks many must-have
apps there's no HBO Go amazon instant
video watch ESPN or Spotify for example
you can get around those limitations by
using cast where your android phone or
Chrome browser can send content to the
shield but it's less convenient than
using a native app in its favor Android
TV is adding new apps regularly
including sling TV and Fox voodoo and
epics are coming soon like other Android
TV devices the shield offers voice
search from either the included
controller or the optional $50 remote in
the end the powerful expensive shield
has less appeal than other streamers or
full-fledged video game consoles but for
some 4k TV owners or file hoarders it's
worth the extra money I'm David Katz
