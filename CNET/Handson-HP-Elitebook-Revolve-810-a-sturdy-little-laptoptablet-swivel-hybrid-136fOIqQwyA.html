buying a laptop at this point you might
want to wonder can it turn into a tablet
well also are there laptops that you
want to look at that aren't necessarily
in the area of consumer laptops that
might be worth buying sometimes there
are gems out there that are business
targeted laptops the HP EliteBook
revolve 810 was one of those ones I saw
back at CES and you thought maybe this
could be a contender because that's an
11.6 inch laptop that also happens to
convert into a tablet it has a swivel
screen flips around like this boom pop
down and it's a tablet and it's not
really a tablet in the sense of like a
thin tablet that you might be used to
this is point eight inches thick it's
three pounds it's okay in one hand but
this is really a laptop and it's got a
sort of an old-fashioned swivel screen
design that existed before Windows 8 but
now this has been reinvented in a
multi-touch capacitive design it's a lot
like the ThinkPad twist which debuted
last year from Lenovo but HP's iteration
is really nice it's got a magnesium
chassis it's got a backlit keyboard
that's very comfortable this excels in
the details it's got a really nice
trackpad here it's small but it's
clickable and comfortable and the screen
looks really crisp although it's only
1366 by 768 so what's the drawback well
one the price it starts at 12:49
and this goes up to 1400 ish for this
configuration with a core i5 processor
and that brings up the second drawback
which is battery life because this
doesn't run the latest Haswell level
core iSeries processors this is yet to
upgrade to that so the battery life was
ok it's just not as great certainly as
the levels that we've been starting to
see in things like the MacBook Air and
you're getting a whole new level of
expectation then maybe this with those
next-gen processors you could be onto
something but you're also getting some
features and specs here that are really
meant for pro users v pro you've got
DisplayPort in the back as opposed to
HDMI so you know if you care for a SIM
card slot you want to have a broadband
capable laptop this might be for you but
the sturdy semi rugged design here it's
got a splash resistant keyboard and it's
designed to take a little bit of a
beating
some people might go for that but I
think this is really like if it's
available in your IT department and you
might want to upgrade to this it's a
nice laptop but you're going to regret
that the battery life isn't just a
little bit better if I saw this back in
January I would have really loved it but
mid summer kind of feels like it needs a
bit of an upgrade already
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
HP EliteBook revolve 8</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
