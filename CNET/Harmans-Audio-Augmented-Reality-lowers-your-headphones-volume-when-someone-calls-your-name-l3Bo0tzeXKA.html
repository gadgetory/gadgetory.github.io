brand-new audio augmented reality
technology this will someday come to JBL
headphones and it can detect outside
noises such as a car horn or a dog
barking or even someone calling your
name and will lower the volume of
whatever you're listening to so you
could hear those alerts they'll even
give you a little warning so you can
hear and not miss anything to make sure
you stay safe when you're walking around
the city listening to music
Harmons gonna launch an IndieGoGo
campaign later this year to get a
temperature on how many people want this
technology what they really want out of
it and all the funds raised will go
towards research and development the
goal is to have this as a software
update for JBL's Everest line of
headphones and it'll be pushed out
sometime in the next year maybe in 2017
the software will have a database of
noises common noises that you'll hear
all throughout the world and you'll also
be able to program your own noises
through an app the technology is still
in its early stages but we should see a
final product by next CEO</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
