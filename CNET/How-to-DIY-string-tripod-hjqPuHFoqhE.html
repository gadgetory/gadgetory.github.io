and if you need to take photos in a
low-light setting or need to use a long
exposure for any other reason a tripod
usually comes in handy the thing is
they're so bulky and heavy you can't
count on them being there with you all
the time so today I'll show you how to
make a tripod out of a bolt and some
strength to study your shots to get
started you'll need an eyebolt that's
1/4 inch in width and some string or
cord the thicker the better in this
situation but today I'm just using some
regular old string you're gonna want it
out of lengths about three times your
height so just get a rough measurement
like so then tie the two ends together
now all you have to do is put it through
the eye of the bolt to create a loop
knot when you're done with that your
tripod is ready to go to use your tripod
or string pod as I like to call it just
screw it into the hole where the tripod
would usually go in the camera this is a
standard size so 1/4 inch will fit for
all cameras once it's screwed in tightly
you're ready to use your tripod so turn
on your camera and set it to the
settings that you'd like whether it's a
long exposure or a long shutter speed to
position the camera where you want it
step onto the string with two feet and
ignore all the weird glances you get
while you do this and pull up on the
camera to study your shot as you can see
I'm using tension to study the camera
another useful tip is to keep your
elbows and arms at your side that'll
make for an extra study shot you can
also set the self-timer so that the
press of the shutter doesn't shake your
camera I tested this setup last night
where a long shutter speed was useful
and as you can see here's the difference
between a shot that was taken without
the string pod
and a shot that was taking with the
string pod it's a lot clearer the string
pod won't replace a traditional tripod
but if you need a pack light or you're
traveling this setup will come in handy
for steady shots if you have any
questions hit me up on Twitter and
