and today we're going to take a look at
the Teac aah oh one this is a compact
stereo integrated amplifier that's
currently selling for around four
hundred and fifty dollars the Teac is a
good-looking amp in a small package with
a brush metal front and a plastic
cabinet compared to a full sized AV
receiver the front panel is dead simple
with just the volume knob a headphone
jack source selector and a power button
well it's not quite as small as the
NuForce dia or quite as pretty as the
Peachtree audio deco 65 the TX strikes a
good balance between the two and it's
certainly going to look nice in your TV
cabinet the included remote is it nearly
as nice it has the annoying bubble like
buttons that are usually found on
cheaper devices and they just don't
respond consistently to button presses
so you're left hitting some buttons over
and over again you also notice that
there's no power button on the remote so
the only way to turn it on and off is
via the front panel button that means if
you're using it in your living room with
the universal remote you'll probably
want to leave the TI powered on which
isn't ideal there are four inputs on the
back to digital audio inputs including
one optical in one coaxial and two
stereo analog inputs what's neat about
the optical input is that it makes it
easy to use the Teac as an AV receiver
replacement at a much much smaller size
just connect all your HDMI sources to
your TV and connect the TV's optical
audio output to the Teac and the TF will
be able to amplify all your living room
devices as long as you're okay sticking
with stereo sound another perk is that
the a HL one has a dedicated subwoofer
output which is lacking on many of its
competitors while you can often still
use a subwoofer with those other amps
using speaker level inputs the dedicated
output is more convenient and leads to
less wire clutter there's also a USB
port on the back that you can connect
directly to a computer which not only
lets you play back your mp3 collection
but also allows you to playback high
resolution audio files as long as you
have the right software what you won't
find on the aho one is any kind of
wireless capabilities such as Wi-Fi
airplay or Bluetooth that's not a huge
loss
as you can always add that later with an
Apple TV or a Bluetooth receiver
although it's worth pointing out that
the excellent na dhih dhih 3020 has
Bluetooth built in for about the same
price with a compact amp like this a lot
of people might be skeptical about how
it sounds but we found it to have
excellent sound quality resident
audiophile Steve Guttenberg gave it a
listen with the wide range of speakers
from pioneers budget SPFs 52 tower
speakers to PSBs image t sixes and the
TX sounded excellent no matter what we
match it up with there's also no reason
to worry about power with the little amp
as the aho one got plenty loud in our
medium-sized room with all the speakers
we test it Steve even compared the TX
paired up with pioneers tower speakers
to the similarly priced Harman Kardon
sound bar and as you'd expect the
separate speaker sounded much better
especially with music so if you're
looking for a simple sound bar
alternative that performs a lot better
the tak ha1 can deliver with affordable
speakers the big question to ask
yourself is whether it's worth getting
the Teac versus some of the stiff
competition Sony's STR DN 840 is a
full-size AV receiver they cost about
the same but supports 7.2 channels has
six HDMI inputs and built-in airplay
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi if you don't mind
the size it's hard to argue that it's
not a better value for livingroom use if
you want to stick with the smaller
integrated amp na DS d30 20 is a little
more expensive but I'd say it's worth
the extra cost with a nicer remote
sleeker design and built-in Bluetooth so
altogether while we really liked a lot
of what the T Ike had to offer it has a
few flaws that keeping from being as
recomendable as a similar NAD 3020
I'm Matthew moscovia and this is the T
ech aho one
