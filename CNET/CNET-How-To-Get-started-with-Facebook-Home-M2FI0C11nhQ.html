but it does change your phone enough to
make you relearn what you know about
using Android it still needs some work
but if you want to get facebook home a
shot here are five tips to help you
navigate this new interface the Facebook
home comes a new set of gestures you'll
use to navigate the system let's start
at the main screen the cover feed when
you wake your phone up notifications
will be stacked here you can swipe away
a notification like this or if you have
a bunch tap and hold one then swipe them
all away chat heads are controlled with
similar gestures by now you probably
know you can move them around the screen
but to get rid of a chat head tap and
hold then drag it down to the X you can
also do this for multiple chat heads now
in the cover feed you'll notice that
photos are cropped you never see the
entire picture as you browse around to
see the full crop of a photo just tap
and hold it to make life easier facebook
home combines your texts and your
facebook messages into one central place
here's how it works grab your profile
pic and swipe left to get to messenger
to send a new facebook message or an SMS
tap the plus button as i type someone's
name i have the option here to send them
a facebook message but if i want to send
a text i'll choose their name in this
list down here if you're texting
Facebook home will use whatever photo
you uploaded to their contact info on
your phone in the chat head cover feat
is great but when it's plastered all
over your lockscreen it can be a little
overkill thankfully there's an easy way
to get your regular android lock screen
back from home tap the Menu button hit
settings and uncheck this option here
exit that lock your phone and you're
welcome you got your lock screen back in
that same settings window there are a
couple more things worth adjusting first
know that you have the option here to
show or hide the android status bar if
you hide it you can still access it by
swiping down from
the top at any time but you won't always
have a quick view of your phone status
and the time most important though is
this data use in image quality setting
these options high medium and low let
you control the image quality on the
cover feed but it also determines the
amount of data you use the high setting
for example will pull more data
refreshing the cover feed often and
delivering high quality photos so if
you're worried about saving on data
choose the medium or low option the best
thing about facebook home is that it's
not your operating system since it's a
launcher you can enable and disable it
whenever you want back in settings turn
off facebook home and confirm now when
you hit your phone's HOME button you'll
get this warning basically your phone is
asking you if you want to use the
Facebook home interface or the regular
Android one tap launcher the Android one
hit always and Facebook home will
disappear when you're ready to enable it
again just launch facebook home but
choose home as the option when you get
this message here the most important
thing to remember about facebook home is
that it's brand new so as time goes on
expect to see updates to this interface
and hopefully some extra options for
customizing it until then hit me up on
