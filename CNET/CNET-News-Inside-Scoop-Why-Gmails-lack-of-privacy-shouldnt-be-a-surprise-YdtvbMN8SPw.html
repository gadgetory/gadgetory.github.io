Dobson joining me is senior writer for
cnet Seth Rosenblatt for being with us
thank you okay so a couple days ago we
found out that shock gmail is actually a
rather Google is looking through our
gmail messages um should this have come
as a surprise not really Google's been
serving ads to US based on keywords that
they have detected in the emails for a
couple years now this isn't really
anything new I think what was really so
unusual about it was that the court case
that they cited it was fairly blunt
about what their intentions are and is
that why people are kind of up in arms
about it why so much outrage this time I
think that's really the reason there was
one group that sort of put out a press
release about this legal case it turns
out the case came about or the filing
was filed geez I think June hey it's
been a few months it's been out for a
long time this isn't really anything new
and even privacy experts privacy
attorneys I've spoken to everybody is
saying that this really isn't all that
okay and if you are using gmail folks
who are considering switching to yahoo
or hotmail is that going to be a better
situation no between gmail and yahoo and
whatever microsoft mail service are
using hotmail outlook.com whatever it is
now we're talking about over 1 billion
webmail accounts between those three
services alone there's currently only
around 2.5 billion people on the
internet maybe even a little less so
you're talking about a vast vast
majority of people who use it the
internet who use webmail are on one of
those three services right and if you
really don't want your email read you
stand if this really irks you mm-hmm
what are the options paid paid email
services not really um are they they're
scanning emails too well either they're
scanning emails or they're gonna wind up
getting subpoenaed by the government and
they're going to have to put in a back
door there's a lot of stuff out there
right now that's unclear one person I
spoke to when when privacy attorney told
me
if you're using an encrypted service
that's actually a flag to the government
so they may not actually have access to
your email but they're going to keep the
digital files of it until they do get
the encryption unencrypted so uh I don't
know chisel and stone maybe he's gonna
say snail mail yeah yes postal service
should be capitalized I think they
really should and one of the interesting
things is is that you know even though
the US Postal Service is run by the
government it has a you know 200 plus
year history of more or less privacy in
physical mail communications and the
laws that govern electronic mail don't
have those uh those regulations in place
so if you're really really concerned and
you must do things electronically talk
to your congressional representative
right and go stock up on some stamps
maybe Oh lot of stamps set thanks so
much thank you for inside scoop I'm semi
does thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
