flagship g4 but your budget doesn't
quite stretch that far you may want to
cast your eyes over is little brother
than g4c from the outside is easy to
spot the family resemblance it has the
same gently curving screen the volume
and power buttons are on the back
beneath the camera and it comes with the
same metallic Diamondback sadly though
the luxurious leather option from the
flagship g4 is not available on the g4
c.width is lower price comes a lower
list of specs it's smaller 5-inch
display has a 720p resolution which is
about adequate to make text and images
look crisp and its colors aren't bad
either it's running on a 1.2 gigahertz
quad-core processor which is a huge step
down from the flagship and it does show
demanding games like grand theft auto
san andreas are sluggish to the point of
being unplayable and even navigating the
Android interface can be frustratingly
slow speaking of Android you'll find a
version 5.0 point 1 lollipop on board
over which LG has slapped its own custom
interface while I quite like LG's clean
easy to use software it's big graphical
overhaul of Android seems to have taken
its toll on the processors performance
around the back of the phone is an 8
megapixel camera which is perfectly
capable of helping you jazz up your
Facebook feed with photos of your food
and there's a 5 megapixel camera on the
front for all of those embarrassing
selfies
although the g4c may share the curved
display of its flagship brother its
sluggish performance means its
similarities are only skin-deep
even with its reasonable asking price
you should think carefully before opting
for the g4 see Motorola's new moto g
provides a much better all-round
experience and cuts even less I'm Andrew
Coyle for CNET and this is the LG g4 see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
