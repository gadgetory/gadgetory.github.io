have arrived fresh off the delivery
truck here at cnet so we thought we'd do
an unboxing for you right now so let's
not waste any more time let's get
cracking and straight into the product
so we have a brand-new fresh in plastic
here crack it open at the back we have a
free live case voucher that customized
that sim card on verizon let's pull it
out let's see we've got the pixel or the
XL looks like we have the XL the 5.5 and
32 gigs storage we quite black as
opposed to very silver or that limited
edition it really blue okay let's let's
slide it open nice and slow there we go
nicely packaged in a white box and it's
a very simple presentation the phone is
right there once you open the flap pull
it out see the personal Google assistant
a highlight of their pixel phones take
that plastic packaging off that's a very
satisfying sound it makes when it pops
off
and there we go that is the 5.5 inch
pixel XL fingerprint scanner at the back
that glass and aluminium finish and we
have the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
at the top we have the USBC connector at
the bottom plus speakers let's see what
else is in this box so now we have the
phone already see we have some
documentation so I'm getting started we
have our little sim card key right there
everything is nice and white we have our
us DC cable right here we also have our
little adapter here USB see to us be
smaller okay power adapter like so oh I
think this is there we go this isn't
even longer USBC tus bc there we go like
so
I see that is the remainder of the box
that was a very quick unboxing is not
much in here maybe there's something
secret underneath nope no there's
nothing secret under there it's just the
box well there you have it pixel XL if
