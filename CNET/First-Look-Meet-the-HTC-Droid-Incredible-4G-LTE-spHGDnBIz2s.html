and we are at ctia 2012 and you are
taking a look at the HTC droid
incredible 4G LTE for verizon and this
phone is basically a follow-up to the
droid incredible 2 but now it has ice
cream sandwich also has HTC's latest
version of sense for which is much
lighter than the original version we
also have HSE wat which is there you
know content movie store we also have a
lot of the you know things you'd expect
in the app tray from an HTC device but
all in all this this phone looks to be
very similar to the HTC One S and HTC
One X 1 is available on t-mobile the
other one is on AT&amp;amp;T but if you can see
on the back it also has a ridged
treatment hear that a lot of the
incredible devices have had you know and
underneath I believe it has that red
paint job as well so it's it's a very
strong device that is in line with the
droid incredible franchise so the HTC
droid incredible 4G LTE was announced
today at ctia wireless 2012 and this
device is going to be available on
verizon still no price yet but hopefully
will be available in the next few weeks
and we hope to have a full review soon
so check back at cnet com
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
