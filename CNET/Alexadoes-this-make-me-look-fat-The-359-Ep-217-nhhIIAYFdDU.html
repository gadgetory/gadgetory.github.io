time for Episode two 17 of the 359
podcast I'm BVG and in the house today
we got Bridget Carey and Ben Fox Ruben
whoo and we're talking about creepy
stuff
yeah sorry we're a little late today
because hot off the presses Amazon just
dropped it's got a new device coming out
called the echo look so we're going to
be talking mostly about that it's
basically got a built-in camera built-in
LED light so you can take photos and
videos with just your voice maybe you're
really excited about it I don't know
we'll talk about that it's $200 are you
excited about it breaded Oh could you
not tell them my face well we'll save
that for we'll save that for the podcast
itself also if we have time we had to
drop some stuff today we'll talk about
Twitter's earnings and also Sergey
Brin's
secret airship but the echo look I think
is going to be the top of the mine today
so send in your questions and comments
we'll get to as many as we can at the
end of the show all right hang out we'll
be back to take your comments and
questions in the chat in 3 minutes and
59 seconds from 3 to welcome to the 359
I'm Ben Fox Ruben and I'm Bridget Carey
so Amazon just dropped news of a new
device called the echo look it's a $200
device that allows people to take photos
and videos using just their voice the
company also introduced a new service
called style check that uses machine
learning to offer customer style
recommendations so this is like a
fashion play right like they want people
to use Amazon and think about Amazon
when you're buying clothes I mean like
that's what I'm thinking right yeah it
my first reaction to seeing this in
hearing about there's gonna be software
that what I go Alexa does this make me
look fat like is that what I get to like
get out of this that is usually what I
I'm okay I'm not a fashionista so I
kinda had a check the day that this
wasn't April 1st because it seems so but
so many people were asking me on Twitter
they were like is this a joke I mean
okay what does it eliminate the need to
take a picture of yourself in front of
the mirror and hold your camera up if
you're trying to get a picture of this
is my outfit today right and I am not
that kind of person but then I started
getting into this discussion with my
colleague ashley Esqueda
in LA who says this is amazing product
because this is great for the fashion
industry you can take pictures of what
you're wearing and share it without
having to bother someone else in the
house and take a picture of you I'm
going I'll get it and then I go well why
do you need a computer tell you how if
you look good or not and she's like well
because you could always use another I
always use a second opinion and I'm okay
okay
very excited glad I get out the door
with two shoes that are the same in the
morning so what for me I've used
different shoes I've put on with two
different shoes and now Alexa is gonna
get mad at me about that you know all
these companies wanted to put a camera
in the in the smart home hub and for
heaven's sakes
Amazon did it with the fashion twist but
it's a camera right that is a smart home
hub so there's other uses there there
are other applications they just made
the fashion the focus here so that's
that's a really good point actually
because Apple has been rumored that
they're going to come out with an echo
eventually like an echo competitor
eventually and we actually wrote a story
quite a while ago that Apple was
considering adding a camera into that
device so again these are all rumors but
like we were wondering if that was going
to be a security feature or that was
going to be a way for them to actually
recognize different users this is
different this is this is a much simpler
and maybe a little bit friendlier way of
actually introducing a camera into the
home right so like by focusing just on
fashion you're not gonna be creeped out
by like oh it knows wind Ben's home and
when his wife's home and it knows our
faces you know so that way and you're
fully in control of it you turn it on
with your voice as far as saying you
know take a photo or take a video this
also includes a built-in camera built-in
LED lights so and and the price by the
way $200 it's only $20 more than a
regular echo it's only $200 more than
the phone I already have it as a camera
on it that is that is true by the way
it's also invite-only in the u.s. only
and I talked to Amazon about this they
said that it's going to be providing it
rolling invites to customers so I
actually asked like when can we get a
review in and they said well you're
gonna have to ask for an invite like
every time huh maybe we can buy one I
don't pay if we have they don't want
dorky tech guys to be reviewing this
thing that's for the fashion industry
because they don't want to get very good
you know everyone like you know
trash-talking it so are people gonna buy
this thing I guess I don't understand
the fashion industry enough but I think
those people you have to ask because
this is what it's targeted to and for me
it's not my cup of tea I don't need that
200 hour camera just to do that but yeah
I don't know we're let's we've got like
25 seconds left let me see if I can cram
one more story in here Google co-founder
Sergey Brin is reportedly building a
giant airship did I just get that right
what is with this podcast today this is
some weird stuff going on you know if
you're a tech billionaire you're side
hobby must be learning and investing in
ways on how to fly a car because there's
you know if you can't have Larry Page in
his flying car startup it might as well
just build your own blimp yeah that's
what Sergey is doing so that's according
to Bloomberg it's just a rumor or just a
report I should say but they talk to
four people involved in the matter and
he has told Bloomberg I have nothing to
say about this right now but yeah it's a
it's over ten minutes away from the
Google campus in it at a NASA you know
hangar yeah so we'll have to see about
that too thanks for listening everybody
if you want to read more about these
stories check us out on CNET I'm Ben Fox
Ruben I'm Bridget Gary thanks for
listening all right buckle up the chats
on fire oh my god because they love
Bridget Bridget you are very excited
about this
well III really sound a little bit a
little bit negative but there's there's
I mean I was thinking though this is a
joke and when I started talking to
Ashley she was like we're asking me it
was in the show real I posted this like
like as quickly as I could to Twitter to
say here's the YouTube video this is
what it is the immediate reaction from a
bunch of folks wise is this a joke this
can't actually be real because it seems
strange to care so much about what
you're wearing for the day to spend 200
on a camera and software to tell you if
you're trendy it's it's weird it's at a
touch reveal who aren't really into
fashion and we know that Amazon has a
really big focus in the fashion they
have their own show every night just
about was that the style code live you
know it there you go
I don't watch it but they're really do i
but there's that and they sell their own
fashion line and so you know they're
looking at this going you know what
clearly there's a market here or the
other way is like hey how do we get a
camera in why don't we just focus on one
market yeah I mean it makes a lot of
sense to include a camera if somehow
this can get your dimensions and then
make it easier for you to buy like pants
or jeans on Amazon because that's that's
like a big problem that I think for them
is as far as making fashion purchases
especially like for pants not shirts or
dresses how exactly you're going to know
that it fits right if you have a camera
there and it's Amazon's camera is that
eventually going to enable them to say
like yes this 95% of the time er this
100% of the time is actually going to
fit you because we just took a picture
of you and know the exact dimensions no
way it depends what you're standing if
it's flattering it's a mix of a bigger
rhythm it's just a desert so like are
you gonna experts Manning the like Oh
input okay Sally just updated her photo
you know is it look right um you know
looks a little frumpy here maybe but it
depends how you stand and usually girls
all right we all know this secret your
shirt is not fitting you you're just
gonna do one of these and suddenly it
looks like a fits you you know so what
is this computer gonna do it's great
let's go let's go let's go to the
questions you said those chats on fire
right let's go for it for the record
they do love Bridget yes second really -
we're gonna have to have you on a lot
more we apologize in advance for all the
echoes that we're gonna set off in the
conversation today for those who have it
on in the background yes uh them on mute
please Mike and Danny in the chat point
out like is there a market really for
for fashion geek fashion geek studs is
that I'm just gonna have to find out
that's a great question is that Danny
Green the other way a Danny Green or
what's up Danny Green at time though
like is it the echo dot isn't catered to
geeks yes it's tech yes it's a little
nerdy but it's become so much part of
the nomenclature that it's just that you
don't have to be a geek to have smart
homes stuff not that it's true it was
true in fact those girls don't look
geeky in the promo video right they did
throw a guy or two in there - they were
like this is for you - guys there was a
guy like opening up a closet but they
knew that primarily the fashion plays
are usually targeted at women I mean
like that's where most of the money is
made as far as fashion is concerned
mm-hmm man this shirt I bought in 2000
there's proof there's lots of great
thoughts being passed around in the chat
right now Mike Mike Leo D big brother is
watching and then he says will this push
to retailers to offer their products on
Amazon if they don't already right cuz
that's that question that's the minute
is selling off the customer images I
mean not just you their images as a good
point to that you can't get stuff from
the gap on Amazon I mean like the gap
Banana Republic old Navy
they don't sell on Amazon is this
somehow going to start convincing them
to do that I don't know but at the very
least it at least tries to draw more
people into Amazon that are more
fashionistas or recommendations that
when I upload that photo it's you know
what also would look good in that color
this this skirt from Amazon was these
pair of shoes rumors that you may be
also interested in the following and so
it's it's a way for the push more
product right primarily the way Amazon
works is that it's an ecosystem play I
mean like just like Google just like a
lot of the major companies just like
Apple where if they can actually
convince you to spend more time with
them you're more likely to buy more
stuff with them so is this a way for
them to do that
maybe I mean like at the very least some
people that don't have an echo might
want to buy an echo look because of this
additional feature but I don't know this
is there Amazon's like white whale can
we be the master of fashion it's true
yeah but like it's really hard to like a
new angle this is interesting and fresh
we have not seen this before yeah yeah
and Google a conversation kiss tingle
has actually shown Google has shown that
you don't actually need a camera to have
multiple users speakers it just doesn't
someone like me i buy my clothes a at a
merch table at a show and be reorder the
same pair of pants I have for the last
12 years
right so they fed yeah wait let's look
at all the tech billionaires Zuckerberg
has a hoodie every day that's the same I
mean every everyone is like you know on
stage like looking the same all the time
you even Tim Cook so what you're saying
is you're not on fleek right they're not
on fleek they don't get it
Amazon I guess is trying to get it I
hate myself for saying that out loud I'm
sorry I don't yeah yeah yeah leave leave
me be so before we get back into the
intended application this let's talk
about some of the speculated other
applications of this device because not
only is Amazon always listening now it's
always watching why can't it be a
security cam exactly that's coming up
again and again and again in the chat
how could it be applied possibly as a
security camera done camera
that was that that's another way so this
was actually rumored initially last
month somebody actually found like a
leaked photo on amazon.com was like
scraping amazon.com and found a photo of
this and that was the initial thought
was that this is a security camera
because nest is already out there the
assumption was is that if you're going
to include a camera on one of these
devices of course it's a security camera
so this is a much more targeted and
specific usage yeah then I think we were
expecting but I think if you just sell
security camera people start going when
is it on and when is it off and I guess
there's a few funny feelings you get
from that I was on a roll with these
weird unit askers between Spotify is
true alleged headsets that just play
music and now a camera that just tells
you what to wear so Amazon's also
backwards and technology from the phone
that does everything
however Amazon is being at least a
little bit smart about this by doing
invite-only in the US only so they can
at least try to gauge demand by the
numbers invite wasn't echo at first
invite only that's correct
so for quite some time too yeah until
they actually made it available publicly
but they made it invite only for long
enough to actually know what the size of
the market was how many they needed to
build so by the time they came out with
the dot and kept adding more and more to
the echo family they had a pretty good
idea of what was actually what what
people really wanted out of it
I can imagine just the incredible
YouTube blogs to be coming out of this
just definitely Tralee right but like
could you live stream on YouTube using
this camera well yeah it is a game at
Jeffrey's asking can you take a remote
picture from the Alexa app and then just
keep it I guess
remote picture like you're at work and
you take a picture from home I guess off
your home that's creepy yeah that's a
sound a bit can a scam if they've
connects to your home Wi-Fi you could do
that tentatively I mean type yet Grennan
we've known about this thing for all of
40 minutes so that's true it's true and
good for Amazon for constantly never
warning me about anything I literally
was preparing for the five gasp and they
were like guess what we have a nude
surprise they and they've been doing
this too with like their grocery pickup
thing which had been had been rumored
for months and they said mean it's funny
when you surprise like this what happens
you get that first reaction of like is
this a joke because there's no time to
really think about wait is there a
market for should we talk to some
industry experts and see if there's no
they don't want to do that they just
want to like go out because they know so
much so many people in the tech press
are I'm sorry
nerdy dudes so I am a nerdy dude I mean
look at me I'm not a fashionista myself
so I don't know I'm not gonna connect
with this and maybe I don't want us to
dive in deep well amazon knows that it
doesn't really have to pre briefed
reporters on this kind of stuff there's
also more of a potential of that getting
leaked out if they do that so they're
just gonna come out with it really like
all at once and let people go wild with
it and there's a very very strong chance
that some of the some of the fashion
magazines and will will glom onto this
and say hey this is this is tech but
this is also really interesting for our
industry why not use just a camera on
your laptop yes sure or your phone I
mean the 360 thing does have something
of an appealing weasel to it not
absolutely you're 16 oh it doesn't know
I thought there were three six you know
is its absence and then like and then it
generates and then you you you can like
look back at the replay like you look
like from behind yeah it's just a video
oh it's like I can spin around in a
circle and it'll shoot the video of it I
don't know what if I a mirror right the
point of the depth-sensing camera by the
way from the video was that light so the
background is fuzzy so you're whatever
you're wearing pops in the image so it's
actually creating a focal point yeah
again it's it's a unitasker type of
thing like exactly what you had said
before there are definitely more than a
few people that are resistant to this
brian says an amazon camera giving
fashion advice is a disaster in the
making what's to stop amazon from
shoving the products down people's
throats yeah obviously the point if you
got this your tear down with you know
amazon soda it doesn't faze you yeah
it's an opt-in they're not putting these
in everybody's home mandarin yeah not
imagine that um yeah and and it's worth
remembering that there is this thing
called what is it the Amazon tap or the
echo tap that it's
it's another echo device that you have
to press the button for the most part I
think now you can actually do
voice-activated but for the longest time
you had to push a button on it it was
mobile and I don't think those have been
selling well at all so there is a
possibility so they did really well with
the dot they did really well with the
original echo but though there is this
other echo product out there that didn't
really sell all that well so this meant
for taken to the beach though tunes
right are you going to the park or the
playground or a picnic what else if
you're gonna invest you're gonna do that
sucking or not gonna do that first right
so so the possibility of the look
becoming another tap is also a
possibility but they want to keep
testing out different echo styles and
looks there's another rumor that's been
floating for quite some time now that
they're looking at an echo with with
like a screen on it which granted you
can get Alexa on your fire tablet so I
don't know why they would use I mean
yeah I don't know I don't know you're
having it in your kitchen countertop and
it's just sitting there but it's got a
it's got like a decent cellphone sized
screen on it so if you need recipes you
can watch it down down video as you go
Alexa tell me how to make a hot toddy
right and then they and then they
provide like a video or something yeah I
think the idea for them is is that like
they know the echo is really popular and
if they can create an echo literally for
everybody they will so that's what's
happening I don't I don't know that this
is gonna work you know
I don't I think like a lot of people as
you said are resistant but um they're
they're gonna keep riding this echo wave
as long as they I mean there's gonna be
a camera for your fridge to tell you for
milk is out so Amazon fresh can come by
and deliver you some we are so close to
that actually happening there are smart
fridges out there that basically do that
but you still have to manually trigger
it yeah it's just like put a little
sensor in the fridge a new milk yeah so
let's get a couple more questions in
before we wrap it up for the day
Matthews asking so it's Amazon going to
take a page from Google's playbook but
instead of recognizing my voice it'll
recognize my face maybe well thanks
that's what Apple's rumored to be doing
and that's the best idea for when you're
talking to it at least it knows my
settings when I walk in the door versus
my husband settings when he walks in the
door I think the problem there is is
that I think people are a little bit
more comfortable with voice as opposed
to visual so yeah people figures a
little bit more intrusive
Xbox member when that when that was a
requirement people freaked out yeah
people don't like I'm sorry Dave
imagine soggy and Brian are on the same
page so imagine saw he's asking so the
pictures be permanently stored in the
Amazon Cloud and will they Facebook and
try to sell them off that's that's meant
adding I should imagine psyches question
and then Brian asked you know or
comments that I see a whole lot of
leaked videos coming out of this oh yeah
oh my god out a doubt this yeah the next
I mean like that that does those are
both very good points and they there
there is a messages oh hey I privilege
just said not funny and they're images
in fact al 9000 yes I mean like when you
when you add a camera into your bedroom
obviously that creates the potential for
problems but at the same time
I mean people with nest cameras already
do that well wasn't there like an issue
with like some of these always on
assistants catching people talking you
know and and even if they don't intend
to say hey Alexa or whatever it would
just kind of pick up so yes already it
sorry the issue of like its hearing my
conversations and now it's just another
element of that yeah yeah I mean it's I
don't remember I was gonna say I mean
like I'm just I'm like literally still
digesting this so it's good to do the
podcast now too because like we
literally just found out about this yeah
I gotta bikes just like tech from that
movie clueless or something oh my god
that would fit perfectly in that movie
oh they would have that's inevitable
they're probably gonna do a clueless
reboot right yeah that'll happen
and they'll include them include this I
need augmented production but I meant my
fashion on don't make it snippy or
something kind of bratty and it'll be a
character in itself like my robot is
this is a baby step probably - yeah yeah
point your camera tell me what I should
wear
right or like the echo home they'll just
make a house for you it'll be pre-built
you'll walk in Alexa will be we're
finally getting that smart home horror
film though I forgot the title of it but
I saw that it's coming down the line I
think I sent that to you the other day
it's speculated about it I'm glad it's
finally coming to be because it's
happening in real life anyways excellent
chat today keep the conversation going
let us know what you think about this
silly s camera happening in your home
that is your opinion
and before we wrap it up Assad is asking
me specifically that about the image
behind you Ben there's a poster that I
keep I keep around and says
inspirational quote JP G and I got to
tell you the reason I have that here is
because I get so destitute and depressed
about the idea of having terrible
cameras watching everything I do at all
times that I just need some beautiful
imagery to keep me going throughout the
day so thank you absolutely yeah well
