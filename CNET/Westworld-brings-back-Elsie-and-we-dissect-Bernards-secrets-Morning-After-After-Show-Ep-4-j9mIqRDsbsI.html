after after show I'm Patrick I'm Caitlin
I'm Lin and we're CNET editors who loved
the show Westworld
today on our show we get to talk with
actor Jimmy Simpson who plays the
character William and I'm going to make
a really simple cocktail and we're gonna
recap season 2 episode 4 the rid of the
Sphinx and if you don't like spoilers
you should walk away now because we're
gonna go deep into it because the woman
is the daughter I couldn't hold it I
didn't super call it but it was the
episode before when she was just like
surviving and shooting everybody I was
like damn this girl's resourceful I was
like what is this like this world's
woman in black yeah I've been team Emily
the whole time and I didn't know her
name was Emily so I was like oh she's
kind of like the woman in khaki because
he's in khaki
she's his exact opposite we have him in
the black she's all in the white and the
khaki oh yeah you ain't going on there
exactly
there's gonna be two halves of the same
whole fighting too like they burn it
down destroy the park I thought she
wanted to save it though cuz she's like
I don't want to leave this place she
doesn't want to leave I thought the same
thing I thought she was kind of like
good it'd be like the antidote to his
poison you know it just seems like she
says in the scene with the ghost nation
a lot of people ignore their narrative
and I don't like other people yeah so
what did that mean I like when she said
I didn't kind of I was like I think it
means it's just that she spent time with
the ghost nation she learned their
language she's the first person we've
ever seen who knows how to speak their
language I know at first I was like how
is she's not that quick of a learner and
I was like how did she learn in that
time being captive but but if that means
that she likes the hosts then doesn't
that mean she wants to save them well
maybe she thinks that they have you know
transcended into actual consciousness
and she wants to save them by
alleviating their pain by killing them
there's a lot of what-ifs there but also
I think the fact that now we have the
man in back who's playing
obviously against Ford
is he is here like a an allied with him
is she an obstacle is had she been
manipulated by Ford to play against them
but you know what my mouth's a little
dry right now and I think before we
continue let's wet our whistle with a
little Caitlyn cocktail corner so for
this episode where we learn a lot of new
information about papadelis we decided
to make a whiskey nothing fancy it's
exactly what it sounds like
we're gonna use some scotch whiskey this
time since the man who plays dillos
Peter Mullan is Scottish I know and
we're gonna pour that over ice that's it
like I said nothing fancy
oh holy smokes
literally holy smokes there's a bonfire
and my mouth is it's a really good PD
scotch all right now that we're gonna
okay now that we have had our drinks
let's get talking about Westworld again
so as I mentioned in my cocktail corner
a lot of this episode dealt with
papadelis as we call him lovingly played
by peter mullan and we really get to the
meat of who he is who it he's a Rolling
Stone fan definitely Rolling Stone fan
which I appreciate I really enjoy but we
really see his relationship with William
will kind of grow and develop literally
over the years we have young Jimmy
Simpson than old graying Jimmy Simpson
who still looks really young who still
and then we have Ed Harris who papadelis
doesn't actually even recognize when he
first comes in right yeah makes you
think there's obviously a lot of time
that's passed something also right the
beginning that first shot it reminded me
like wow we're in a Wes Anderson movie
now we got the Rolling Stones playing we
got like the crazy geometric shape
playing and the one tracking shot and it
was just really like disorienting in a
really great way like what is going on
the tone was different you feel that the
opening was different than all the other
episodes I really appreciate that about
this season this episode was the first
one that Lisa joy has ever directed I
really liked that we jumped around and
that's one of the timelines is what we
see with papadelis
him in this little cubby apartment what
do we commissioned yeah this fishbowl a
beautiful modern furniture if it was in
San Francisco that's like a five million
dollar place right at least at least
five ok burn like $5 and then burn him
like Gattaca style like that's fine but
I don't know why you have to take away
the furniture and all those vinyls well
I would bet that they don't know what
was affecting him so I can't take any
chances right cuz they say that he's
Duvall vineet I'm so the Rolling Stones
is what's making it evolve so that's the
one timeline
another timeline we see is also with the
man
you know we were talking alright so with
the older man in black he's doing this
other timeline with lawrence / alo'so
but in this timeline is lawrence and
he's basically i love this because it
starts with a scene that is familiar
with the first season where they set him
across from his old boy they're sitting
across the table in his old town he's
taking out his bullets and we've seen
this scene before where he's mastered
this level he even knows how many
bullets he needs to use but he actually
gets kind of knocked off on his feet by
the Confederate oohs and in the end the
Confederate oohs basically just take
this village hostage for their weapons
and the man in black saves lawrence his
wife and his kid because of all these
flashbacks that you see of him seeing
his wife suicide in real life and it's
just kind of funny because the man in
black actually killed his wife and kids
the season before it so now he's
narratives yeah lawrence last season he
killed his wife and kids Lawrence's oh
my kids so many times he didn't even
care about it anymore and then now he's
like oh maybe I shouldn't but then Lord
calls him out it's like just because you
did one nice thing doesn't mean I forget
who you were oh man that moment is so
creepy awesome because like this that
little girl basically and she comes up
to him and there's definitely a Robert
Ford tone versus when he goes back to
the family it's her accent - she doesn't
have an accent
Texas Ford absolutely she switches into
Papa and a little but so we were
speaking of like things were seeing
outside we interview the actress last
week Shannon Woodward and we were all
joking like man we haven't seen her in
any episodes of season are they just
messing with us is it just like hey
she's back but she's back we got to see
I like I like her character she was the
only one who's like something screwy's
going on in Della's and she was just
like I'm just gonna go down there in
this dark basement and figure it out but
she also had a lot of reverence for the
host - which I appreciate it like she
didn't treat them like meat or she
wasn't really super scared of that last
season yeah even with Bernard like I
mean she's definitely pissed off at him
but then she takes care of him keeps him
at arm's distance literally but I think
that's interesting and she feels like
probably the
most human of the human characters at
least we've seen this season so at least
the most human that I want to identify
or yeah she's on screen I feel a little
bit safe like okay things can't you know
she's not a super evil person you know I
hope and then so whenever she's on
screen um it's like someone she's
basically kind of us but more capable
and smarter we really she's been in this
cave for a while now because she didn't
even know that Ford has been killed the
timeline is very screwy it seems like
she was taken there by Bernard when she
went down into that basement
she was taken there right then more or
less you through some protein bars in
there yeah which could have been
conceivably just a few days or maybe a
day before the party in the uprising
right and now we are at least 12 days
past the uprising so she may have been
there for two weeks it's a lot of
protein bars a lot of water needed to
wait and then my other question she
drank yeah she's a scientist she could
probably figure out a way to do it God I
survived you just gotta do what you
gotta do she was changed you couldn't go
in you know I
yeah and there's nothing but like and
then Bernard comes along opens this door
to the back door and she's like what the
 I've been here for like 12 days I
didn't know it looks like a hotel
elevator looks so nice and like shiny
the little moment before that there
actually was something it's not a big
moment it was badass no either see
Clementine doing her thing
each I want to drag someone you get
Clementine man but is it this
coincidental that he was dropped off at
this cave or do you think that
Clementine knew that LC was in there
well he said that Ford kind of put him
here he Ford wanted me to see this and
through Clementine he was she was
probably I mean for like Clementine was
probably instructed by Ford to drag him
there drop them off and but what's he
basing that on me oh I don't know well
I'm basing it on right Bernard saying
that yeah I think Bernard believes that
I think he believes that this is
entirely Ford's game and that Ford
coated everything and it's all just
madness and everybody's super off their
rails but to really think Ford did it I
don't know and and it's one of the
things I don't know if we need to know
it
but it is even if it's like a very like
Shakespeare and coincidence like hey I
just happened to be here and here's the
person that I put here and she hates me
and she but at the same time out of
anyone to be discovered there that's
probably the person Barnard needs most
to get back on his feet and they get
like the cortical fluid and all that
stuff there is a poignant scene where
he's kind of talking to Elsie and
convincing her to help him where he's
like everything I've done has been not
under my control but this is the first
time I'm making my own decision so
please help me so he half knows that
Ward is pulling some strings but he's
also realizing that for the first time
ever he's kind of doing things on his
own and you feel bad for him because
she's like I I don't trust you yet and
he's like me neither I wanted trust me
for now please trust me and I'm sorry
for choking you out before oh man and
Geoffrey right again I just as
performance is just so vulnerable and
beautiful I just I love this character
level playing this character and then
great but so we literally have now we
have another human and host team if you
have Bernard and Elsie now we have buddy
cop but then we have Maeve and Simon man
in black and Lauren man in black and
Laurence Dolores doesn't have a house I
mean a human yeah so again we have these
humans pairing up a post technology and
humanity and speaking of that we got to
talk to the actor Jimmy Simpson who
plays William about technology and
humanity as well as some other
interesting things in Westworld
I love I love as mom I love the guys who
have been kind of telling the future for
a while and burger is one of them you
Mary Shelley is kind of one of them and
it's like it's just uh we were right now
in that spot before humanity makes a
decision on a request Blade Runner or
you know are we going to find create an
actual like utopian like the only way we
can do it is in my opinion is by
evolving first of all America as this
you know capitalist you you try to grab
a smash-and-grab which is what America
was based on smash grab your properties
ask yours and then we've never really
straight from that and so there's
there's just an element of grand empathy
that's going to need to occur and it
here hearing the voices of many and
feeling ourselves even more and it just
needs to find in our civilization
because right now we really are in like
a king of a hill situation and if we
perpetuate that I believe yeah well
we'll head towards West World II Blade
Runner re-type existence unfortunately
but because it's like you know when
there is so much technology it's a pool
I know there's going to be wizards evil
wizards and good witches and we just
want to keep the good witches with more
of the control or you know place give it
to to them it right now it's not green
we need witches what are we doing when
do we lose ourselves when uh you know
you see the shift from the importance in
someone's life from what they've
experienced a book they read a tree they
walked beneath whether it's pharaoh or
some millennial versus the existence
they have now on Facebook and like why
did this person respond or like my thing
and brother though and it's this
alternate reality that that people are
really cool with jumping in on and
feeling like feeling the feelings of
reality through these artificial mediums
and I think
if we continue to gratify ourselves in
that way and we keep shedding each other
out on a more personal level I think we
are bound to just extinction so the
hands down hands down it would be this
role I played named soldier and the
Sundance show happened Leonard
he was the onion wild man I've ever
played and he was he would have just
torn it up the best possible way he
would've a look like um I bet he would
have just had a ball in a way that I
couldn't even fathom myself having but
it's like he's the kind of man the place
is built for um think they um Lisa has
been really great about sharing because
it was such a shift and I was a little
you know I would ask for any information
and Lisa was was kind to just at least
give me give me context for the scene
like because the story is larger than
they give it to us in pieces and I think
it's by design and by a pretty beautiful
design um they they kind of keep us as
actors giving the performances um
necessary to kind of see their vision
through and she yeah I don't know the
entire story Willie but like I wish I
wish I knew a little bit more but I feel
like I was given enough to know what the
stakes were of each game to know where
he was when we picked up with him and
how he felt about you know the park and
specifically like Dolores the last time
he saw them so I had I had enough to
before I started to play like what was
happening but still each thing comes
with each script so it wasn't like this
is what's happening for this season it
was this was what's happening now my
favorite one is that it's like in space
and the earth is actually long exploded
that there are people I think there I
read somewhere so even though human
don't know that their world they're on
its fabricated so it's like layers and
layers layers like a like plant cells
but it's also pretty cool all right so
you just heard Jimmy Simpson talking
about his favorite theory it's that you
know we've destroyed everything or we've
gone to another planet - kind of a
variation it's that we ruined the earth
so much that mother nature like kicked
us off we did ball it like abandon it
and we tried to make a life make living
and another planet something like that
we terraformed another area of the
universe I buy it it's better as long as
it's not it was all a dream ah yeah that
would be lame yeah so it did again deals
with death and destruction much like a
lot of this episode dealt with mortality
yeah a big theme in this episode is
mortality we could see it in the title
the riddle of the Sphinx we're not gonna
explain it you could google it it's
really popular it's kind of like it's
not a really great riddle I don't think
maybe because there's no play on words
or maybe it is but it's because it's in
Greek but it just look it up it's about
Oedipus and yeah it's like boring but
anyways riddle the Sphinx mortality huge
theme and you can see it in one of the
my favorite quotes that man in black
sizes everyone's not meant to live
forever people aren't meant to live
forever
and I'm gonna use a anime reference so
don't judge me like a anime reference
morning anime reference morning but in
Ex there was the same question was posed
like why should people live forever and
it's like no people don't live forever
because that's what makes life important
is because when people die it makes
their life important if people live
forever nothing is important and you can
really see that with Delos and he's um
he's like trying to hold on to his
legacy trying to hold on to what he
thinks is he's losing through death and
man in black is like no yeah you're
gonna die well you are also talking
about how man in black is kind of when
he's talking to Craddock he's well you
know you haven't met death yet yeah and
because the one thing is if the host can
be turned off by being shot or injured
but they go back online they get off
line and go back on line but obviously
humans can't do that now mana black is
truly
fighting for his mortality and I think
it's interesting that he's reflecting on
the mortality of papadelis who tried to
extend his mortality past death and it
keeps on ending up literally in a
dumpster fire and it just gonna make you
a question like if you upload your
memories if they kind of build your body
and duplicate it and have all your
memories and your dreams and personality
is that really you we know that it's not
really him because he's aware he's a
robot he's like oh I guess I didn't make
it that's why he breaks down you know
but you know would you if that was an
option would you guys want to do that I
don't know I feel like it's and not
taking nor the question completely but
it feels like those ones where people
freeze like their heads and hope that
science will someday catch up to put
their brain into that psyche yeah and
like Ted Williams the baseball player
but it feels like a teep but also like
who are you to be the one to say that
hey I deserve to come back I'm so
important I've come back but I don't
know I don't think I would I think I
would just enjoy getting old I always
think of the play as you like it
Shakespeare has that great speech jQuery
says where all the world's a stage and
we go through the seven stages of life
going from a baby
growing into a man falling in love and
then turning but I don't think I would
you that's actually part of Peter
Abernathy's past narrative just as we're
discussing later later he was the
professor who actually taught a new
Shakespeare and that was his you know
his that was what he taught was
Shakespeare as the professor as one of
his narratives underneath there and so
it's really interesting that you say
that because seems like maybe Peter
Abernathy is gonna come back one of the
larger theories out there is that James
dello says brain or his you know control
unit as we saw Bernard kind of slip into
his pocket he's in Peter Abernathy and
that's what was encrypted in his brain
that's why it was so huge that's why he
had such a thinly veiled narrative over
it that's why they wanted him out of the
park is that the same thing than what
arnold bernhard i mmm Bernard all to
kind of grab this a little red light
bulb that's what we think but is it
that's just a few wait and then why
would they want his memories back why
would they want Delos back that's I'm
saying like what what is the advantage
very valued as Delos have I think part
of it plays into how we've seen him kind
of evolve from the first time we saw him
talking to William in the episode he was
three days in he kind of learned he was
a robot he just shut down right and that
was the first time there to burn it down
the next time we see him he lasted seven
days okay the next time we see him with
Ed Harris
it's the 149th trial billed yeah thank
you and 35 days 35 days so he's getting
further and further from the point of
consciousness and still surviving
theoretically the idea being that if
they can keep him at a stable level they
will have achieved that immortality that
we're talking about and as they're doing
this we learned that Bernard has slipped
someone else's control unit their brains
in effect into his pocket and walked out
with it is it Delos is it a whole new
person all right board I thought it was
born I thought it was for two but then I
I'm sorry good you saw this board yeah
why is fort more valuable though oh
because he's them he's the guy behind it
he's building it he's coding it Delos is
just like the investor he's just
concerned of his legacy and that's why
he wants to live forever because she was
like you're gonna take the company I
built - William men in black he was like
you're gonna be with my family all this
stuff it's like yeah because people died
it's okay that's why people inherit
things and that's why you sign a bunch
of wills and get have a bunch of lawyers
but he's like no I want to keep my
company forever yep yeah and it's like
he's like the the Hair Club for Men
where's like I'm not only owner I'm also
a member it's like I'm not only not only
did I buy our product to live forever
I'm actually proof that it works that
would be an impressive sale but who has
the money to do that because I keep I'm
thinking about this a long every
Westworld goes on is it cost so much
money to go to this park and then out of
that let's say they're in the top 5% is
there like a one person's like I want to
live forever and again do we want those
people to live forever yes
guess one of the theories I also heard
was that the reason why they're getting
DNA and all these information is that
all the super rich people who can afford
to go to West world wants to may be
either clone themselves or maybe are
unwillingly being cloned so do we want
the top 1% 2d clone I don't know I don't
think so like you said not always the
best group of humans we see that example
of that in this episode with the humans
that ghost nation has taken yeah that is
that was a much more touching scene than
I thought it could not be that was no it
was beautiful because they were showing
that the there are hosts that have
restraints yeah but now you pointed out
the one of the ghosts nature members
we've already seen them before yeah
Zane McLaren on the one who whispers and
Stubbs's ear he was actually one of the
who was the man who was giving Logan the
pitch for Argus initiative and he looked
badass by the way went huge you're like
who is that guy he's got power
yeah and a seat that he comes up and he
had one of my favorite lines you only
live as long as the last person who
remembers you and so going back to
papadelis going back to William it seems
like William is the last person who
remembers papadelis womp-womp who cares
I really like about what Everson because
yes ELLs Lee said a really good line
she's like I'm gonna die just to some
rich guy lives forever and I totally get
that because it's like all these people
are suffering because some rich dude was
like I want to live forever and he's sad
that you know people are forgetting but
but don't you think about like your
relatives make grandparents or
great-grandparents like we're all here
because of other people who most of
which we've not met and yet it's such a
fleeting thing if we don't think about
them and we try to like remember things
to pictures he tried to run things for
video now but most of the people who
brought us here didn't have those
advantages to be remembered by what if
the legacy of the future is your host if
there is only a modern thing where I
could upload my identity every day every
moment constantly for people to judge on
I just don't think it's a year of me
right like I don't want the zanga
livejournal version
me being uploaded in middle school I
want like maybe now I don't want that
kind of version of me grow wait what if
tea could be like yeah I want middle
school in and I want 25 year old blue
hey that's the other thing like
papadelis being that age or like i would
be i if i was remade into a robot I'd be
25 year old me yeah I think most people
maybe they had a dichotomy between his
like you know we're all like oh I wish I
knew when I was 12 what I know now or
whatever maybe that's the problem they
put him in a pre sickness body trying to
make him younger or better and that's
what caused him to devolve so let's talk
very quickly a favorite moment slam what
was your favorite moment my favorite
moment was when William gives papadelis
the transcript of what they were just
saying one because I kind of called it
and then I was like oh I bet it's what
exactly they were saying and two cuz it
kind of reminded me of a thirty rock
scene where it's Liz Lemon and Jack and
they actually hand each other what the
other person's got to say but only
because they're really good friends but
not because one's a robot and the other
ones trying to cure him or anything make
you mention three rock was on now the
amount of material they would have like
a wealth of parents social media oh my
god what are you what is your favorite
Kevin kind of the whole episode it's the
amount of information we learned here
about Delos as a company about what they
want to do they answered so many
questions in this episode and open the
door to a bajillion more in such a great
way what's your favorite okay this is
such a nerdy thing I like how they did
the we seem flashback to before us and
especially in the first episode of
season 2 but I liked how we had Bernard
trying to remember how they did those
cuts where he'd be in a room and they
had the flicker and then it was him in
the room and it's earlier or later or
whenever and he's not sure I hadn't seen
that style in the show before and that
