fox rubin yeah but then fox rubin
welcome Ben you have nothing to say I
don't know I'm just eager your charisma
is electric I just want to sit back and
write on huh it's pretty impressive
pretty crazy it's pretty good as you
drugs will do to you been alive and
clearly we're live and we're here to
wrap up the week over a few drinks and
only drinks our wow that's not the
prompter the way we practiced we are
definitely live we are oh there I am
again there you are there's been marking
we're going to drink a little bit we're
going to answer your questions and the
way you get your questions into the the
blood of the show is by typing them in
the chat room whether or not you're
watching a live stream on YouTube Joe
Kaminski's in the back who knows what
he's doing with the prompter because
he's not sure as hell not working it
he'll be watching the shower room mining
for questions and comments send them all
in and we will read a smaller percentage
of that to you okay all the best rises
to the top so how you guys doing you
guys great and goods like are already
finding this hilarious yeah you're
having a good time very good i'll be
that's open tab I've ever been on so
right good I messed up like at least
twice already and it's been a delight
it's fantastic it's already been better
than delight you guys are part of a new
pockets that we've started this year yes
called the 359 first thing I want you to
do is tell me a little bit about it I've
had the great pleasure being on a couple
times tell me about what the 359 is and
I simply it's Albany as you need to know
in four minutes for less mmm daily
digest Sally by Jack news just a break
down a little bit of riffing between Ben
and I
awkwardness some analysis I know if I
want to call it awkward yeah it's part
of the brand at this point yeah it was a
very awkward for the first we actually
at the beginning yeah okay hey what is
it you show me a relationship me a
relationship that I smooth out of the
gate doesn't happen so or ends badly
yeah the joke of it though is that we've
been trying to get it canceled for a
hundred episodes and somehow we made it
to our one successful yes that's right
are failing our way Ryder bandhas yeah
you are a little big congratulations on
100 episodes that all not an easy thing
to do people think all you hundred has
nothing no that's not how it works
making it to a hundred is a way bigger
deal than making it to 200 to be honest
those first hundred getting them out of
the gate well done gentlemen thank you
good stuff ah now you guys are on a
little bit of like a hiatus with that
yeah yeah yeah just just a couple weeks
or what how did that come out I had that
configured after 100 hundreds good round
number I'm hit pause I'm all right
heading out of town next week for a
trade show in berlin eva and so bring
it's a good time we're gonna start right
back up in a early September right
before the iphone events okay just in
time for that the purple is a good time
yeah yeah to start it up against the dog
days of summer why not take advantage of
it come on right right I things
happening nothing's happening tell ya
guys yeah this is nothing doing there
you go let's segue into our first
segment I want to talk a little bit
about consoles game consoles these are
video games they get played on TVs okay
hmm this week what are those what you'll
learn Ben Fox Rubin this week Sony
announced that PlayStation al which is a
well in ok service they offer on
playstation 4 and vita and a few other
platforms i think they just announced at
that service which streams games to a
device and lets you play over the
internet offloads all the processing I
guess I'm like a mothership somewhere
where they have like render farms under
you've already lost me you could never
see what I'm saying it's fine my toes
are spaceships and aliens involved very
awesome brain you upload the virus to
them so you pay twenty dollars a month
it's sort of like Netflix you pay you
pay 20
there's a month and you're able to
stream what feels like a four hundred or
so number of titles on PlayStation 3 so
that's how they sort of solve the
playstation 3 backwards compatibility
void that was there they said okay we're
gonna not let you put the discs in the
thing in the console we're gonna let you
stream all those ps3 games that's how
they do it how good is the streaming
it's a great question yeah because
you'll get a stream you can stream like
a movie lickety so one way street right
right yeah it's a one-way street this is
a two-way street there's data going up
yeah most of that is coming down but
there is some data coming up and now
those are the inputs that you do on your
controller it's not the best but it's
not the worst it started out real bad it
started out not good at all I was my
first initial impressions of PlayStation
now which was poop there's a poop out of
5 now it's a little better and now is if
I poop plus 1 yeah it's like yeah like
three and a half poops out of flavor
five it's not bad we're still in poop
tart it's lon a boob scale all right
yeah you know guys like bugging the
booty all right let's go yeah a lot of
crap out there so it works a little
better than how it started but I think
for twenty dollars a month it's still
may be too much to end yeah in terms of
the whole backwards compatibility I mean
xbox the games are frit I mean if you
have the games they work and it's free
watch your feet right I feel a little I
feel a little chipped if it was like
this was the only way I'd be able to
play my back catalogue of ps3 game
because you will you're one hundred
percent right that's you know there's a
lot of games on ps3 that I personally
didn't get around to playing and you
know there's games that I own like there
you know I've one of the games heavy
rain took me a while to play that I what
happened you know now I can't just pop
this in I guess I could hook up my
console again but who wants to do that
who wants to do that nonsense everyone's
thrown there's out anyway so this is an
ok solution 20 months a lot of money but
I think they're almost there they're
almost at the spot where streaming games
is a thing you do need a really good
internet connection yeah just don't
wanna like dink Rinkitink why I have the
low end k board yes okay you can have
that entry-level fios five and five
operas you gotta get back 50 50 I think
it's I think the minimum is 25 in my at
home I have 75 and that does it as good
as it's gonna get ranked oh but that's a
pretty high end it is hot on the higher
end yeah sure yeah that's too much I
mean 50 50 and that's fees yeah that's
that's pretty pricey fifty-fifty you're
gonna do okay but you're gonna spend
some money so I don't know do you what
do you think cloud gaming has a future I
mean yeah I mean like I'm a fan of steam
in terms of the using their service but
I don't but a lotta that's not really
clown stuff rightly yeah I guess there
is stored the games or career saves or
stored in the cloud but you have to
physically download the game yes that's
true yeah in terms of like actually like
Netflix type service yeah that seems to
be kind of a pain because you know if
you live the family of more than full
too yeah they're all using the Internet
that's it starts to put a strain on
definitely that pipe that whole idea of
having fifty-fifty connection yeah that
only works if you're the only one using
that correction if someone else is
streaming netflix or playing video games
elsewhere that's I mean that's gonna be
a crap experience right yeah they all
you know drink your milkshake a little
bit when it comes down to that what are
you your I know Ben you're not the
biggest gamer mmm you stole a bunch of
games for me use a nikon d60 it's mine
now i paid for dude to bite off two of
his victim in the same room I didn't
give him as a time I gave him my entire
catalog you gotta think that like this
twenty dollars a month thing but doesn't
it seem overpriced to you like shouldn't
it be ten dollar like everybody likes
ten dollars a month for streaming sure
yeah okay that seems to be pretty
regular video whether it is it the
different category right music and video
or wise are their old games that's the
old catalog they had already squeezed
out all the money they were gonna get
from nobody how much more i agree I know
that I all we should do and you're not
wrong what they should do is they should
offer people who have a PlayStation Plus
subscription a discounted rate for it
and I should do that number one number
two I think
the starting rate should be if you want
to do twenty dollars a month fine give
me a discount for during the year they
had a temporary one it was like a
hundred dollars a year and I believe
three months is $45 which it's way
better than twenty bucks allowable that
is so that's the move like I don't know
who these people are paying per month
like I don't know who does that anybody
was like I'm gonna pay another twenty
dollars again and not get like the 35 do
you have even a hardcore gamer you only
have so much time the day consuming
you're spending your time on ps4 games
so how do they justify paying that extra
twenty dollars for old games right like
and what like so you have you need to
have a ps4 to access this right you need
to have a certain sort of device like
where's the where's the balance right I
don't know but but that's sort of the
deal with PlayStation now now it's
coming to pc so you'll be able to plug
in a dualshock 4 into your computer and
play that service on your computer's is
that a big deal is that important
because I'm another piece yeah it opens
it up to people who don't on a
Playstation 4 right like it anybody can
play the games right in your computer
wait a minute wait a minute it's only
ps3 games right yes yeah yeah oh yeah
yeah he says it all look good but there
is i mean there's a library of pretty
good game for sure for sure i means
pretty stock library it's there and they
offer i would agree it's still expensive
it's still a lot i'm i just tried you're
talking about only so much money yes I
don't have sold catalog yeah are they
what is their last gen their last gen
though they're not like you know this
these aren't ps1 games I don't know
obviously they already made the money
off of it though they already did the
budget can make more money people like
it always make more money the matter
with you but I know it's like stop
giving them money me like no no this
could be even more lucrative yeah yeah
yeah I look I can't say I disagree but
that's the situation where right now I
think playing them on pc is there is a
special sort of thing about that because
everyone has a computer and you don't
need a super high and compete
could you just streaming stuff
essentially so I think it opens it up to
a different audience who maybe doesn't
have a PlayStation as it is and now they
can do that so yeah that's just that's
the story PlayStation out all right
let's move on to cloud services yeah and
stuff like that loud do you so we talked
a little bit about steam is there any
service you use that's heavily
cloud-based that you can't live without
besides netflix right yeah obvious one
yeah besides that one well drop box I
mean that's use Dropbox yeah I don't he
does i guess i'm a big drop box i was
looking at you yeah i don't use it but i
know a lot of people who do use made it
sort of my it's sort of my nice failsafe
so you pay for it no i don't i mean it's
free i mean i believe how much do they
give you for free uh not for me to store
all my rent documents gotcha right you
can't store media files but movies or
photos but I mean that's a writer tits
like invaluable to have that's right
right I don't hear anything I only read
them no no but it's a great place to
secure your file somewhere else right
are you working on a novel or something
yeah they are we all were right right
I'll have a book deal come on ya know
everyone really we all y'all have book
deals mom not me yeah you're behind the
curve okay oh okay what about you been I
got I got this that's all you need
that's the only cloud you need me right
quad speaking of which what is your sort
of end all cloud service thing like for
me Google Docs is a huge part of my
course work like in my personal life
yeah is are you guys attached by the hip
with that now well yeah I use Google
Docs constantly you know that's that's
definitely helpful I've started looking
into this service through amazon if
you're a prime member you can download
you can put in the cloud an unlimited
number of photos Chris yes yes so I
actually try to take photos yeah google
for screws the problem this is what you
do Amazon because I don't know I'm cos
do they compress the files I don't know
that's not but the Google compression is
not it's not terribly it's like I still
think it's like eight megapixels like
it's yeah yeah this SLR quality phone
yeah
yeah yeah needless to say when I tried
to take apparently I have 17,000 photos
that I have stored on my laptop can I
tried to move them onto the cloud and my
computer basically were just like I
don't feel like it you're like hey I
ain't happening it's like yeah look look
I'm the mid-2010 model you think I'm
working that hard I'm not gonna do I got
simulated I got a four more weeks on the
clock and I get my have to go is
creative throw me in a dumpster yeah you
know I'm gonna get recycled so it didn't
work so i really like this idea of
backing out at night look you asked me y
ashley the question so it didn't work
did you google photos i could try to use
google photos but I feel like it's gonna
take up all over me like 10 days to
upload all my photos with them in
batches no I just had running for 10
days straight wow you got to set it up
for like at least the weekend and you
get unlimited with some women okay do it
it's ready so you'll be sorry AB picks
up for your photos but whatever its yeah
yeah yeah cuz at this point in my life I
got baby pics I got you know all sorts
of important O's food photos so you need
are these food guess what coupon we're
sending you will you believe me be very
we'd be very upset if we lost the photos
these are very important course so we're
not gonna lose it you don't rely photos
no I'm saying that I want to store them
in the clouds I want to have that backup
so there was a cloud phone that you saw
yes the next next bit Robin what the
what is that next bit Robin is this
crazy phone it was a Kickstarter project
okay started off as a as this kind of
crowd-sourced thing it uses the cloud
for storage so it's got about like 32
gigs I might be correct I'm gonna be
wrong on that 36 in a 32 gig on a heart
or hardware so moco itself yeah yeah but
once you exceed that point it starts to
offload stuff and automatically offloads
apps photos things that it knows that
you don't actually use that often your
sex in the cloud is a little suspect
it's very interesting cuz they they've
offloaded like I saw them offload
Spotify right and then as soon as you it
sort of gets greyed out on the phone you
tap on it and it sort of read downloads
really quick
we all the settings are saved
everything's logged in you don't have
like re log into anything it's as if you
never really deleted it so what does it
run on runs on android and they've
worked their technology so the reason
why next we've got a bunch of hype was
because the the key founders are all
part of the original Android team so
they know Andrew they like they have the
institutional knowledge of Android so
they know how to kind of work the
operating system and really maximize its
potential and they kind of use this
cloud architecture as the big selling
point so how's it doing idea it's not
it's not how it's a it's about a year
old at this point you know I came in to
kick char it was got ton of hype people
really pretty fun too and it is a really
nice and nice looking up okay I mean I
think it's done well for what it was but
it's a very niche product I mean there's
going after people who are like super
super hardcore about Android because
this is like basically a pure Android
experience with cloud that it's you know
it's a it's done okay for what it is but
it Roger it is totally on each product
not a face are you getting on the cloud
I look at Arizona on their class I'm not
gonna care about a thing we a lot as a
lot more than you can cram onto him in
the huge mass space it wasn't okay well
a full terabyte it was a massive amount
of space that's still that at least
justifies the concept of the product
right well if you're gonna get like 200
buddy cosmetics get is a reviewer trend
like I was you know talking to Jessica
review the product it's tough to review
a phone that like you've got to like
intentionally crammed up yeah you're
like confuse it and like put it through
its BS so it's I mean it's and it works
okay but the thing of it is is
especially if you've got like 32 gigs of
storage it's hard for you to fill up
that stores yeah really like after her
like a one month or even like a two-week
review period it says that sounds like
one of those weird bridge products where
it's like yeah this makes sense but like
we're just not totally I mean I do think
that that's sort of where things are
going I think phones eventually will
start for sure cloud like as a default
but we're our network connections aren't
there yet right you know if you're
outside of your connections body and you
like you need to download that crucial
app that's in the cloud somewhere and
it's like busy signal yes it's you're
gonna be pissed right you're going to
they're gonna do that how is Apple's
supposed to price gouge us right how's
that gonna work you know like you gotta
think about that first I don't know they
could they could do the same thing
though right think I guess yours like a
charge of this huge project twenty
dollars a pop for the privilege of our
cloud services they're fine yes all
right I guess want to leave it at that
thank you gentlemen for joining us today
to commemorate your 100 episodes of the
359 we would like to introduce a special
new beverage a brainchild of the cnet
step today we premiere the official cnet

well thank you to joining us live on
YouTube and live stream we're going to
take a quick breather we're just going
to drink more and we'll be back with
more cool stuff to check in with you
we'll see what you're writing will
answer some questions but for now why
don't we headed over to Vanessa and
Sharon in our San Francisco office to
put the brand new samsung galaxy note 7
to the test keep this tab open you get
it we'll be right back this is more
nerve-racking for me than the phone may
be all right three two one yes Evan edge
has one of the best screens we've seen
in a phone but the ample real estate and
sexy curves mean it's also one of the
most fragile incomes the note 7 same
dimensions and curved AMOLED screen but
with what's perhaps a sturdier glass
it's the first phone sporting corning's
Gorilla Glass 5 so does this make it a
stir to your phone that's why we're here
so you wanted to be honest I'll go for
right I'm going at about two feet okay
here we go Oh three two one okay it has
chalk all over it my beautiful bullseye
would it totally survived hey here it is
two feet my knees yeah my knee high just
about okay one bullseye too whoa that
sounded so bad oh we got a winner we got
a winner next up we're dropping it from
pocket height here we go Oh 320 and it
landed screen up so we know it survives
yes all right little little note 7 let's
do this pocket height a little bit
higher higher yep there yep three two
one oh it also landed face first Oh face
arson that I select over belly-up 1.6
meters is what Corning says that gorilla
glass five can withstand when it's not
altered so that's why we're going to
this height not because we take selfies
but okay here we go you should take
yourself all right three two one wow
you're good wolf guy oh wow wow nothing
no not nothing
this is more nerve-racking for me than
the phone may be all right three two one
perfect landing okay moment of truth
moment of truth oh oh look at this it's
very dramatic it's got chalk all over it
but it's still rolling still perfectly
fine now that we know it can survive
face first both bones it's time to test
the edge so we're going to go pocket
height which is probably the most common
place it gets dropped on the edge in
three two one oh I'm on the edge not
really but should we do it again yeah
maybe do it like oh i like it i were to
drop my head so we're going to test out
the note 7 from pocket level on the side
3 2 1 0 we're gonna do a selfie level
1.6 meters from the side all right so
three two one moment of truth all right
is there a crack on the back no it's
still good going no you're right there
is a crowd there's a crack so it did
break but just a little bit in the
corner and in the back so we're gonna
keep going and I'm going to drop it with
a crack facing up three two one whoa
spill good good it well let's see the
back the back oh oh the back is Oh
spider webs everywhere take a look at
that
or maybe so after multiple drops in
different angles the back of this is
completely destroyed but the front is
intact it's perfect which is what you
really care about yeah unlike this phone
where the front is destroyed but the
back is perfect so if I had a choice no7
note 7 baby 3 2 1
haha we should do a signal that way
anyway hey welcome back to open tab
that's pretty cool we just have a show
where we just break stuff now I like
that I wish they were a little more
straightforward with the title though
welcome back to the second half of open
tab that's no longer Roger Cheng now Joe
comincia welcome to the show by raj you
guys had a little too much that I've
seen that red ball I asked me Roger it
apparently was a sparkle in it yeah this
is this is nothing but fireball and
energy ok I won't tell efficient um Joe
is bringing along with himself a
brand-new segment that we like to debut
on open tab ok yeah it's call oh you
want to introduce you know I detect that
we get to see so many things is not
always time to cover it yeah but maybe
if we can kind of slip it in at the tail
end I thought it was a good idea i'm
gonna spend and brian help me slip it in
ok uh anyway don't read too much it ok
don't think that here's the segment
we're gonna call joe and tell look at
this oh looks good Joe what do you have
for us today it looks like some weird
steampunk lizard what is this this is
called this is what you sure this isn't
kindergarten what the hell is this this
is called the Gecko ba it's up just like
a few urgent pieces ok you build it and
I built this therapist with my man Brian
Van Gelder and um how much time in the
day Brian probably doesn't sleep for god
sakes Brian doesn't go home and be cocky
drinks and making little lizards and
check it out here's a here's a time
lapse of youth poor people doing this
when do they make these videos this is
amazing these guys are so much more
productive Oh than I've ever been so
basically I look at it go oh that's a
good video
and look at that you know in eagerness
or I guess our suberin suis started
cutting tubes a little prematurely so
I'm digging may be that some of them may
be a little short and it's not getting
quite all the oxygen it needs to defeat
so basically what this can do it has it
has a motor okay so it can not only walk
Oh on a flat surface oh it gets not only
work on a flat surface like steps but
when build properly yeah it's supposed
to be able to scale oh whoa again cuz
the well yeah you can see it's a gecko
like you liked it like so I think
sometimes gineering issues on mine in
Bryant Park which is why I'm pretty bad
he's got a very loud he's kind of like a
gimped Godzilla you would allow this guy
forever he's my friends arm but what is
this made out of connect so it's like
small plastic pieces and the joints are
held together by these little orange
pushpins so the tubes really have so
this air there ya there there's air
being pumped to the suctions and it
keeps foot I see Wow um you can make
seven different creations from the one
set you can make like a really you can
make like a phone holder a suction phone
holder like a suction gun in it and our
inchworm and a couple other things what
is the set if it connects it's Lego it's
called gecko bot okay Koba come on where
it's not available arently drunks it
will be available later this month at
michael's amazon really cold and toys r
us sort of hobby an old objects well i
thought yeah i thought it'd be cool a
kid my initial goal was to probably and
probably would have worked yes i was
going to build it with my son but i had
that little stretch where i was sick and
it just didn't happen so Brian and I had
to kind of get it built second son Brian
Van Gelder excited oh my secondary all
done your bearded Santa's right my Robin
Hood very cool all right and what is
this gonna go forward you say I'm 4995
it should be available it should be
available later this month it's i mean
i've i've stuck it on glass it's stuck I
pulled it I've dropped it um the only
thing that I'm a little concerned about
is once you make this particular
configuration because the hose comes in
one piece
right I'm not certain if you can make
all the others once you cut down the
piece and I see because i'm not sure i'm
not sure the length of hose you need for
each individual built that's the one
thing i didn't find out but i'm very
cool man when the stickers you could
were two choices advise that but these
eyes are a little friendlier so yeah
these are yeah you're nice guy did you
want to hold it oh please so and I mean
if you look can we get a gonna look
through the camera like if you look
there's little like um see the little
air pockets right here so we do so
basically this one sucks air from this
one when it releases from there it's
actually pretty genius um I think it's
something cool for like a father son or
father daughter or a mother daughter
mother son to do it of course anybody
here parent and kids yeah even it's
great or just kids or just parents well
it says 48 year-old eight-year-olds 8
and up um I think maybe I was a little
too far up yeah that's why we're all in
that up category Oh Walker if I don't
use the hoses at all it just means the
suctions won't exactly okay he's all
right I got it it looks pretty nice how
long did this take um Robbie like I've
made me maybe like an hour oh oh it may
have been longer because you know when
you're just sitting there around
um like I said we got a little premature
with cutting the hose so like I noticed
that I like you know there may not be
may be some air restriction going to a
couple it's okay couple of movies hey if
anyone it's special because it's on what
anyone who get to just the measure out
the hose also we had that you know we
translated from centimeters doing to you
that's that's immediately ok Joe so Joe
you're here to not only show us the
Gecko bot but you wanted to share maybe
some of the calm did we have any
comments and questions there was one
question from a comment or ma TN he
wanted to know this is back to the
streaming do you think that is the
future of gaming mmm that's the hump
that's the million-dollar question I
don't know right now I'm not convinced
but that doesn't mean it can't be the
future I just don't think we're there
yet I think it is the future but you
know we don't know what the timeline is
going to be so eventually it is going to
be that and to me that seems pretty
obvious like it's all going to be
cloud-based once you I've internet fast
enough once you get processors fast
enough blah blah blah but we don't know
if that's ten years from now 15
years from now or what have you or
that's what I would what for next month
well I think where they can where they
could probably get some momentum is if
instead of looking at older catalogs if
maybe you give people earlier views at
things that are up-and-coming like like
like like an early stream of like an
early upcoming demo or made it like kind
of like what they do with the
PlayStation Plus where they give you
earlier just a beta testing right like
that hard you even more for that I'm
saying but if you can get something
sooner via cloud right but here's the
thing like we just got finished saying
how that it's not there yet so that's
not necessarily a platform that they
would want to utilize with I like that
point you know I'm saying like if I'm
getting to play the brand new ps4 game I
want that to be the best possible
examiner forward without way I think
after well I think that's also where
comes to like the Internet service
providers because I mean we're very
fortunate to have a very fast connection
here and I think what happens and even
even for me at home because I have time
on a cable at home you have that influx
because like one minute you can be
hitting like 200 megs the next minute
maybe your neighbors on the internet
because that next amount of people want
to know and you're losing bandwidth
maybe for people like with fios of that
constant connection it may be a better
experience but for like people like me
with the time warner cable account would
just fluctuates yeah that's where the
experience does vary all right very good
I think we're gonna have to call it at
that I think we should you think we
should think we should you want to go
home well no I want I didn't get my red
ball it's kind of good I almost want
finished my right I mean it's okay thank
