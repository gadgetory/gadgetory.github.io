smartphone these will fit the
description both ways they're desirable
and they spew radiation
I'm Brian Cooley with a scene at top 5
this time we're ranking smartphones
based on their SAR or specific
absorption rate which tells you the
watts of power absorbed per kilogram of
tissue
now there's never been a clear
connection made between a phone's SAR
rating and dying but for me I'm gonna
play it safe and look for a low number
until they figure this out anyway here
are the high numbers number five is the
t-mobile - 3G with a SAR of one point
four seven not too far from the US
government limit of one point six nice
keyboard slick design GPS two megapixel
camera and it's not on AT&amp;amp;T so it's got
that going for it number four is the
palm pixi plus also at a toasty 1.47 SAR
one of the sleekest smart phone designs
ever and it runs the much-loved Palm
webOS but HP just bought palm and their
CEO Mark Hurd recently made it clear
they didn't do it to be in the phone
business so this might not be a great
pic unless you like buying your phones
on eBay number three is the Motorola
Droid at a SAR rating of one point four
nine no phone has done so much to propel
the Android operating system as this
squared off little bacon fryer great
touchscreen power to really run Android
well and it has access to the only
collection of apps that ever causes
Apple to lose at least a little bit of
sleep just bring a foil hat number two
is the BlackBerry Bold 9000 with a SAR
rating of 1.5 won this guy
revolutionized blackberry display and
interface quality supports fast HSDPA
data connections just not for me and was
the first blackberry that could at least
pronounce multimedia the latest version
the 9700 loses the annoying little pearl
ball that always seems to get food stuck
in it which is kind of handy because you
can
get by just making a call before we get
to the number one dirtiest smartphone
what about the iPhone well thus are on
that model varies by which iPhone you
have the 3G is the dirtiest at one point
three eight the very first iPhone the
original much cleaner at point nine
seven and the 3GS is the best at point
seven eight Steve wants you around of
buy more apps at number one is another
blackberry the ubiquitous curve eighty
three thirty with a SAR rating of one
point five for hard up against the limit
guys don't leave this one in your lap if
you like getting Father's Day cards
curves are everywhere because they're on
multiple carriers and there's always a
pricing promotion that pretty much makes
them free this little pocket Chernobyl
is arguably the most successful
smartphone ever because it has so many
variants everyone loves the keyboard and
let's face it your company will probably
make you carry one at some point but
it's a crappy web device and not a good
choice unless you like your bacon crisp
that's it for this edition of seen that
top five use a headset
I'm Brian Cooley see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
