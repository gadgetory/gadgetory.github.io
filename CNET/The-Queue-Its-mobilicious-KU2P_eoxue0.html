give em a try American is expected to
spend nearly 260 billion dollars online
this year almost twenty percent more

spending it that's your quick ways
excluding travel which category rakes in
the most online sales is it computer
hardware and software autos &amp;amp; parts home
furnishings or apparel accessories and

Seinfeld big believers and you can get
the full story by checking out my
segment the new edge 2 point 0 virtually
