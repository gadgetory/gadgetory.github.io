Conte and it's time to get loaded google
does not want to hand over the data it
accidentally collected when it's Street
View trucks went around capturing
neighborhood images this fragmentary
data includes email messages browser
history and private Wi-Fi network names
Germany has asked them to turn that data
over and google says that it cannot due
to privacy laws Google is facing similar
requests in Hong Kong and eight other
countries have asked the company to keep
this data as evidence in future possible
legal proceedings Microsoft's motion
gaming platform the tall could cost as
low as a hundred and fifty dollars when
it launches in October that is less
money than I expected but you have to
remember that you need an xbox to use
this which is at least two hundred
dollars and YouTube has added the
ability to have moderated conversations
around videos this means the owner of
the channel can decide what it wants
viewers to discuss or vote on and then
viewers can interact in a productive way
which is not always the case in YouTube
viewer comments for instance if you have
a video where you tap dance you could
create a poll and let viewers vote on
how well you taught dance or something
there's a new feature in google buzz
that lets you rebus someone's buzz it's
a lot like retweeting a tweet except
Google doesn't call it Reba's or retweet
they call it reshare and it lets you
repost someone else's information to
your followers with your own commentary
if you'd like those are all your
headlines for now I will see you in the
morning with more thank you for watching
I'm Natali del Conte we've seen at
and you've just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
