first look at the Philips a5 Pro
headphones so the interesting thing
about these is that they're kind of a
crossover headphone Philips markets them
for DJs and have things like swiveling
ear cups and replaceable parts that DJ's
will appreciate but I think that anyone
that likes great sounding comfortable
and durable headphones will get into
them so to start off
it does seem right to describe the
design of these headphones it's over
built you can see that the headband is a
little wider with a lot of soft padding
underneath to take the pressure off your
head but there's also a layer of
aluminum around the steel strip
underneath to lighten the weight now
that being said they also have a half to
them that some DJ's might not like they
weigh twice as much as the v-moda m100
that's another DJ headphone that got
great reviews on SEANET and those are
worth checking out as well so getting
back to the a5 though you'll see that
the headphones fold down into themselves
for easy transport in this bag that
Philips gives you as well and the ear
cups rotate back and forth if you only
want to listen in one ear the headphones
come with two cables that you can plug
into either side of the ear cups which
by the way have really big left and
right markings on them so you know how
to put them on you can either use the
straight wire that has smart phone
controls and a microphone on it or you
can swap it with the coiled wire that
extends 215 feet if you're using them to
DJ another really cool feature is that
the included cables actually lock into
the ear cuffs with a simple twisting
motion to keep them from getting yanked
out of your ears you can get even more
options with the three different sized
ear pads that come in the box in my
experience I actually prefer the big
oval memory foam pads the most for
everyday use but DJs might prefer these
smaller circular leather earpads that
form a tighter seal around your ears to
keep sound out it's really easy to
change them out whenever you feel like
it you just twist and clip them into
place so in terms of sound quality this
is really where the a5 set themselves
apart from other DJ specific headphones
most of those that I've tested boosts
the bass way up so it drowns out all the
other instruments and it just doesn't
seem like they're tuned for situations
where you have the volume set at a
normal level the a5 s on the other hand
mix the base into the mid-range and
treble sections and smooths it all out
so you get an even amount of everything
at once the result is a lot more
pleasant on the ears especially if
you're listening for
hours at a time I don't want to give the
impression though that these don't have
a lot of base to them because they do
it's just not an overwhelming amount if
you're really into deep bass booms where
you can feel those vibrations in your
ear this probably isn't the right
headset for you if that's the case I do
recommend checking out the v-moda m100
you can check out all the details in my
full review on CNET but that's gonna do
it for me I'm Justin you you just took a
first look at the Phillips 85 pro
