of an Amazon echo speaker as we do with
these kinds of lists we talked with C
net smart home experts Andrew peekaboo
get part and Rui El Presidente Crist for
their insight by the way we'll try our
hardest to avoid the default activation
word did you just bleep D let's get to
it
and number five is messaging / intercom
an echo device can double as a
speakerphone you sync up your contacts
from the app and you'll be able to call
other folks who have the app or echo
speakers if you've got multiple echo
devices around your home you can also
use a drop in feature as an intercom and
number for early prime day access Amazon
Prime days the company's big day which
features deals on all kinds of things
for Amazon Prime members think of it as
a Black Friday like event well if you've
got an echo you get access a bit earlier
than the rest of humanity this year
prime date deals started two hours
before the regular time if you shop
using an echo device at number 3 sales
because Amazon loves selling you stuff
you can just ask your device device name
what are your deals then your speaker
will let you know what's available on a
discount it's actually pretty handy I've
managed to pick up a Photoshop Elements
bundle for around half price and number
two cheap music everybody has some kind
of music service Amazon actually has two
one comes with prime and the other is
called Amazon music unlimited normally
music unlimited costs a whopping eight
dollars per month for Prime members
however there's a lower-cost plan that
gives you Amazon music unlimited but
it's linked to a single echo device and
it cost about four bucks per month and
at number one it can read Kindle books
you probably knew you could listen to
audible books on an Amazon speaker but
did you know that the echo can read
certain Kindle books using
text-to-speech you go to the smartphone
app then music video and books scroll to
the bottom and you'll see Kindle as an
option there you will see all the books
from your Kindle collection that can be
read aloud to you not all books are
supported but it's a great little
feature you're still here great I'd like
to tell you about my favorite Amazon
skills I'm a big fan of playing jeopardy
on the echo and getting subway reports
using the
conductor skill if you've got a harmony
remote the harmony skill is excellent to
control your home theater anyway we've
got a full list at cnet.com MI as that
colonel see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
