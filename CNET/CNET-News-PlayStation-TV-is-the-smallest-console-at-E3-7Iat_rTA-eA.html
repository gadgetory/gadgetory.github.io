the smallest of the consoles announced
at the show the PlayStation TV now this
actually existed before as the Vita TV
but it's been redesigned internally in
terms of what it can do this is a
PlayStation now vehicle it's a micro
console that we'll be debuting for $99
this fall and it is the size of a deck
of playing cards what it does is it's
like a ps4 accessory it connects in your
home for Remote Play to stream
PlayStation 4 games to it and it
connects with DualShock 3 or Dualshock 4
controllers 2 at a time but it also is a
full Vita micro console so you can put
Vita memory cards in here or download
PlayStation Vita games or anything else
from the for the PSN store that works on
Vita and play it on the PlayStation TV
and the third thing it can do is it's a
bridge to the PlayStation now streaming
gaming service which is not here yet but
it's going to enable streaming of
PlayStation 3 games and other cloud
storage streaming games and that's going
to be a way that you can get on board
for 99 dollars and not have to buy a
Playstation 4 or get a Sony branded
television which is the other way that
you can get PlayStation now two-player
games streaming games locally streaming
ps4 and the Vita and you'll also be able
to get a bundle for 139 which is going
to come with a DualShock 3 controller 8
gig memory card and a download code for
the lego movie videogame on Vita so
competition with y amazon firetv maybe
an apple TV sony's in the business not
just for big consoles and portables at
the micro console market - I'm Scott
Stein here with a little look at the
PlayStation TV 80 through 2014</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
