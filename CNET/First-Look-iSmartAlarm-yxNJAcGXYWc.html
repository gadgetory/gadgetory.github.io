here with the eye smart alarm which we
saw at CES this year and on Kickstarter
now the eye smart alarm is a clever
do-it-yourself alternative to more
expensive home security options the eye
smart alarm comes in packages starting
at 199 dollars and those won't come with
any contracts or subscription fees
although come with our what you see here
you've got the cube one which is sort of
the mothership of the whole set it's
going to connect to your router and talk
to all the other devices and kind of
organize them into one system you get a
motion detector here that works up to 30
feet and you get to remote tags these
are little keychain attachments you can
use to control the system and you'll get
two of these contact sensors that you
can stick anywhere and these will detect
on a door opens or closes by detecting
when they separated and come back
together for 150 dollars more you can
add in the eye camera now this is a
camera that will take a picture of
intruder during a break-in in theory
however we found that it didn't work
that well it was kind of finicky to set
up and we had the same problem on
multiple network so with lag and it was
tough to get it to work when we wanted
to so not the most reliable thing I
wouldn't recommend getting the camera at
this time now you'll control all of this
with the eye smart alarm app and this
apps available in iOS right now but it's
coming soon to Android 2 the app is easy
to use and intuitive and it's got a lot
of information packaged into it that was
helpful so we thought it was a really
strong feature of the system in the app
you can arm or disarm the device you can
tell if at your home or you can activate
the panic function to have the sirens
started sounding it's pretty loud for
you to probably get free to free
i snort alarming rosary compositionally
aside for you low price is the fact that
it is a do-it-yourself system and that
doesn't just mean setting it up yourself
and managing it yourself what that means
is that if someone intrudes in your
house and you learn goes off you'll get
a phone call or a text automated from a
smart alarm not a live person and
they'll have you call the cops
they won't call the police for you they
won't call emergency services for you
you have to do that now some people
might actually like this they don't want
the police to be called every time
there's a false alarm but other people
might want the security of knowing that
if something happens the police will be
called automatically so if that's what
you want this might not be the system
for you that said I was very impressed
with the system myself and testing it
the contact sensors worked perfectly the
motion detector was very nice everything
just worked the way it should with the
exception of the eye camera and the $199
option all of this to me is a great
value and as someone who just moved into
a one-bedroom apartment on the first
floor of a building I'm kind of
considering getting it for myself if
you're looking for a do-it-yourself home
security option and you're looking to
save some money to the eye smart alarm
might be the perfect fit for you thanks
