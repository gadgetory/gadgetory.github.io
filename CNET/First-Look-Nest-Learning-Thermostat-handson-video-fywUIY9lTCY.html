Learning Thermostat which I'm going to
take out of the box right now so we can
see what's in there a very pretty box
pretty beautiful looks like an eye
nice and heavy it feels solid this part
swivels and that's really the only
moving part pretty much everything that
you absolutely need to install a
thermostat and included screwdriver and
you take the top off for all the bits
there's a built-in level so that you
make sure it's level on the wall
concierge service in case you don't feel
like doing the installation yourself
depending on the kind of wall you have
and the damage that's left from your old
thermostat you may want to use one of
these kits and paint them to match your
wall color you can also mount the
thermostats straight onto your wall okay
we just finished taking the thermostat
out of the box and now we're gonna see
how easy it is to install but first we
have to take off the old thermostat the
first thing you want to do is turn off
the power either on a breaker box or in
this case I have a switch right above my
thermostat which is nice
most thermostats just pull right off the
top of the thermostat okay I'm labeling
the wires as they come off with these
handy labels that came in the
installation guide there's the RH here's
the W nest suggest that if you can you
put the thermostat straight on your wall
because it would look nicer and it sure
would but I don't have time to repaint
my wall right now so I'm gonna use one
of their mounting kits now we have to
drill some holes in the wall because the
holes I had for my old thermostat are
not the same place as the holes for this
mount
now I'm gonna put on the trim plate and
the base once I have the wire through
and everything snapped together you use
this handy built-in level it looks like
my drill holes are level
okay now the hardest part is done and
I'm gonna connect the wires
thanks to these handy labels I remember
where they're supposed to go and you
just push back this toggle and insert
the wire we're ready for the exciting
part putting the nest onto the base I'm
just gonna snap it on the promise of
nest is that it's going to learn what
our patterns are and then automatically
adjust itself to make us comfortable
when we're home and to save energy when
we're away so I'm gonna come back in a
couple of days and find out whether nest
has learned what we like one of the
great things about the Nest Learning
Thermostat is that it's connected to the
Internet and nest has created a few apps
one for iPad one for iPhone and one for
Android to help you control your
thermostat from afar and also to view
what's going on in your house so there's
this little house and there's an
indicator to show what's going on with
your thermostats so right now my
thermostat is set to away I'm not at
home so the thermostats not on I click
this say that right now my house is 65
degrees I'm gonna go ahead tap on that
and end a way I want to come home in a
few hours and have it be nice and toasty
I can turn up the thermostat right here
and now my heaters on when I get home
should be 69 degrees in 55 minutes so
far over the last four days since I
installed nest nest has learned that
it's gonna take 55 minutes to get my
house up to 69 degrees you click on the
schedule tab you can see the patterns
that nest is learning for my family's
preferences and this is all been learned
from the daily actions that we've made
so when we've turned up and down the
thermostat nest is remembered and
started to set a pattern for each day of
the week you can see that we like it to
be warm in the afternoon I get really
cold at about 8 o'clock and then when we
go to bed we turn it down to 64 Nest has
been learning our patterns for about 4
days now and I
think it's gonna get a little bit more
sophisticated once we've been doing it
for a week I've noticed that for
instance NIST hasn't noticed our
mourning patterns for the whole week yet
you definitely have to be patient with
nest it's not going to instantly know
what you like and what you don't like
but I'm really happy with this now and I
particularly love checking in on my
house while I'm away it's really fun to
see what's going on at home even if it's
just one little peek into the
temperature at my house this is Lindsay
