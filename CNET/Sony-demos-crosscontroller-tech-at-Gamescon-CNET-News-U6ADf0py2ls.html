control pack for littlebigplanet 2 which
launches later this year so what is
cross control we'll put simply cross
control is the ability to use the Vita
as a controller for the PlayStation 3
why is this kill well it's killed
because as well as having dual analog
sticks and buttons on the Vita it also
has front and rear touch and importantly
it has its own screen so you can have
dual screen gaming on the PlayStation 3
in this little big planet DLC pack will
not only give you the levels playable
vehicross control but we also allow you
to make cross control games yourselves
in the demo today will cease at boy
hurtling through space in his latest
adventure now cross control is best
played in front of a big TV with a Vita
in your hands and this TV looks
fantastic for that so I want to move
down there in front of the big screen
and now I think of it that TVs the same
as the TV and Michael dennys bedroom and
that's fantastic for playing
littlebigplanet apparently ok so now
you'll see I'm controlling SAT boy on
the Vita I can run and jump using the
Vita controls with sat boy on the
PlayStation 3 but more importantly I can
use the visa as an extra screen and I
can use all of the Vita's functionality
as well so this section just looks like
a normal platform in section of gameplay
my high tech assistance just saw me will
need to go through it to rescue the
princess so let's go oh ok so clearly
there's more to this than meets the eye
if you look at the vita screen you'll
see we've got some level some areas
which amarte this deadly which I can now
jump over them so this means that I've
got a unique view of the action from the
vita which is killing the single player
but it's really good in the multiplayer
and then I'm in our pack we've got
four-player multiplayer with four
players on the PlayStation 3 and 1
player on the Vita oops so not up just
need to concentrate and if the place if
the player on the PlayStation Vita has a
different viewpoint it means they can
see things that the other players can't
see so when you play a multiplayer this
opens up lots of gameplay opportunities
ok so now I've got to trigger the switch
to get past this door which is closed on
PlayStation 3 I would jump and grab that
block well clearly I can't do that
because it's too high on Vita however i
can pick up the block using touch move
it over
concept I get straight I have to say
here no sup boys were harmed in the
making of this demo so now mano left i'm
going to use touch again just to simply
turn this cog and there you go it's as
simple as that now this section looks
the same as a previous section however
i'm going to have to be much more
careful because oops the walls are
electrified and this show is just how
precise you can be if you're any good at
the game using the touchpad on the Vita
and I'm through
okay and obviously as with all good
little big planet games you can run and
jump and grab and swing now I've got a
gap that's too big to jump and if a try
i'm going to get fragged by this laser
so it looks like I should push this
platform into the screen and the via
touch is perfect for that some I just
use the rear touch if I can just watch
squeeze late come all the way across and
then push the platforms into the screen
and jump straight across and you can
also use the front touch just for moving
objects and jumping stop by around it's
really easy to do just grab it block
fire it up and this makes it really easy
and intuitive to play the game and
that's something what we always strive
to do with little big planet great so I
found the princess but it looks like
there's some kind of puzzle that I need
to work out so I'm going to use the Vita
as an x-ray scanner tool around the
level there you can see some boy if I
look up here this looks like some kind
of clue blue purple green so let's go
over to the princess I'll input this pad
using touch blue purple and green great
the princess is free okay so let's go
and use this rocket to escape oh but
unfortunately it looks like there's a
problem with the rocket don't worry
princess I'll save you so I'm going to
jump down this pipe and now you'll see
suck boy has jumped from the PlayStation
3 on to the PlayStation Vita and I'm
controlling in the normal way on the
Vita now having an extra screen gives
you extra not just gives you an extra
viewpoint but it gives you different
roles and different control methods and
we think this is really exciting
potential for social gaming and for
local multiplayer as well but I can run
jump and grab like the PlayStation 3 i'm
going to grab this but a sponge and
using the gyros let's give it a shake
and there you go afraid the rocket I'm
going to jump in the rocket looks like
the princess is in I'm going to pull
down the rocket and blast off from the
Vita onto the playstation 3 and I wilt
into space to escape with the princess
so once again sat boy saves the day and
gets the girl well done sup boy oh but
oh no it's a trap so this is just a
small section of the dlc part 4 little
big planet but importantly it's just a
glimpse of what's possible of cross
control and PlayStation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
