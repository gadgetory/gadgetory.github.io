met your match with Rosaline new Co
drone these are little toy drones but
they're actually a whole lot more than
that they started a Kickstarter campaign
just this week for their little drones
they start at 119 bucks and you might
think this is just kind of a basic toy
but these drones actually offer a whole
lot more they are designed for people
who are interested in coding trying out
programming for the first time and the
coolest part is that they claim that
someone as young as a 5th grader can do
this by themselves and then you just
watch their tutorials online and after
five minutes and then ten more minutes
of programming you'd be able to tell
these drones to come to you or drive
around because they actually have
convertible wheels if you want them to
Rove around your your room or your house
it's a pretty cool interactive thing for
your kids or really anyone who isn't too
familiar with coding but wants to get in
on it and see how it actually works in
person so I'm gonna try this out I've
never flown a drone before and I know
nothing about coding but I'm told that
if I push this button
whoo all right and there it goes this
one just flew right at me and I actually
caught it so that's pretty great well
you can control them manually but you
can also program them yourselves as you
see here the guys behind me from Robo
link programmed all of these themselves
they said it took them just five minutes
so I'm not super convinced since I don't
know anything about coding but I'll hold
them to it
it's basically programming using an
Arduino compatible circuit board which
is a open-source thing you can download
for free so if you're interested in Robo
links Khodro and you might want to check
out their kickstarter campaign as this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
