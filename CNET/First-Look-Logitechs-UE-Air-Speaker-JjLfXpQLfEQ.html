sounds from your iOS devices and have a
little extra cash to burn this speaker
should be your next big purchase I'm
just a new editor here at C net and this
is a video review of the Logitech UE air
speaker this speaker does have a dock on
the bottom that you can plug in your
iPhone or iPad into but the big seller
of this speaker and what makes it 399
bucks is the airplay feature airplay is
Apple's streaming media platform that
captures wireless music from iOS devices
and iTunes and you might be asking okay
how is this different from Bluetooth
well Apple AirPlay actually allows
uncompressed music to stream wirelessly
so you don't get any sacrificed in sound
for the wireless connection the
connection process is foolproof as well
just start by seating your iPod iPhone
or iPad into the dock down below here
and it'll prompt you to download the UE
air app that will guide you through the
rest of the Wi-Fi pairing process
obviously your iPhone and the UE air
speaker need to be on the same wireless
network but there's an Ethernet
connection on the back if you do find
that your Wi-Fi connection is dropping
once you have the app downloaded and
paired up you'll be able to scroll
through all your music and fine tune
them using simple equalizer functions
like bass and treble if you do decide to
just put your device in the dock and
play music you'll find that the hardware
is a little complicated the connector
sits on a spring that rocks back and
forth ostensibly to fit a bunch of
different case sizes and thickness but
the rotating hinge actually makes it a
little hard to properly seat and it
definitely requires some finessing to
get it to work so what if you don't have
an iOS device well the instruction
booklet also details a slightly more
complicated method to connect a non
airplay device that involves navigating
your computer to an IP config page
selecting your network and entering the
password it's definitely a little more
tedious than just downloading the app on
your phone but once the UE air reboots
you should be then hooked up within 10
minutes or so like I said earlier the
lower price of Bluetooth speakers
reflects their diminished sound quality
compared to this one those are maybe a
little better for individual listening
experiences while this UE air is really
the speaker you want at a house
party or a dinner gathering the unit is
capable of playing at really loud
volumes and the dual tweeters in front
as well as the dual subwoofers out back
really do well to blast music at a good
distance with impressive audio
performance the logitech ue air is a
viable bookshelf speaker if you have 400
bucks to spend on this relatively new
technology on the other hand though if
you really can't swallow that price tag
a Bluetooth speaker like this super
toothed disco for example may fall
better within your reach you can read
more details in my full review on CNET
but that's gonna do it for me I'm Justin
you this is the Logitech UE err speaker
and that sounds good to me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
