we're going to do an unboxing of the
asuste transformer pad tf300 so i'm
assuming it is because i haven't opened
the box yet but i'm going to do that
right now all right let me try to be
careful and not cut anything that's in
the Box didn't try to be quick about
this all right this here we go and here
we go with that all right they'll need
this box either all right so this is the
keyboard for the tf300 and this is the
tf300 looks like the box wasn't
shrink-wrapped when they sent it but
we're gonna open it anyway let's see
this right here so there's box take the
lid off here all right there it is here
it is in its plastic cover going to peel
that off power it on instructions power
USB cord you know the usual stuff well
that's powering I'm going to open up the
keyboard I call it keyboard they call it
the mobile doc but it's both really here
it is more plastic more arrows to tell
me which way to pull the plastic so
here's a keyboard dock here Z tablet
first impressions is that it feels about
is like maybe it's slightly heavier I'm
not sure it feels a little bit thicker
than the original transformer prime and
it doesn't have the aluminum unibody the
transformer prime had its feels plastic
now which should help it with GPS
performance because that was a problem
with the last transformer prime the
metal get in the way of the GPS
performance okay just connect that now
slide really easily right into there and
it just gave me a little chime that
probably means that the unboxing
is over it probably doesn't mean that
but I'm Eric Franklin that was the
unboxing of the sous transformer pad
