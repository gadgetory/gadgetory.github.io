a game on the go well the Nvidia shield
tablet is an alternative there's also
the PlayStation Vita and the Nintendo
3ds if you remember the Nvidia shield
from last year it was a handheld like
this with a 5-inch screen on top now
you've got a tablet it's an 8-inch
tablet with a Tegra k1 processor what do
you need to know about that it's
extremely powerful 192 core graphics
that theoretically could provide the
graphic capability of something like an
Xbox 360 but the gaming support right
now is limited to Android games that are
supporting the k1 how many of those are
there very few Nvidia has about maybe
eight over the course of the next few
months and the rest of the gaming
capabilities are basically about what
you can play on Google Play this is a an
Android 4.4 tablet it also has 16 gigs
of storage 2 gigs of RAM and it's got a
micro SD card slot for 128 gigs extra
but you can also pay for a 399 version
which has 32 gigs of storage and LTE not
badly priced for an 8 inch tablet 1900
by 1200 display but really what you're
looking for here is the gaming this can
connect and stream PC games with the
play on PCs that have certain levels of
Nvidia graphics you have to enable the
game streaming and boom you're playing
with a game controller and streaming a
limited set but a 100 plus PC games on
this but you got to buy this $60
controller otherwise it's gonna ask you
to connect it now it feels ok kind of
like an Xbox controller even as a
microphone and this thing supports
twitch now if you're a hardcore PC gamer
the idea is that you could stream games
to this tablet if you prop it up on a
table and play right here anywhere in
your house or you could connect it to
your TV with HDMI and play in any other
room now why would you not want to just
carry your PC into the other room well
maybe it's gigantic or maybe you just
don't feel like it
that's the ideas this is meant as a
other room streaming device but do you
want to connect the tablet really to
your TV or do you want to maybe use
something like a little roku type
connected streaming puck that who knows
might come in the future
work with the k1 processor to down the
road and maybe that's a better solution
and again you get this tablet for $2.99
but this cool attachable stand cover
that's $40 sold separately and the
controller $60 sold separately so it's
$100 here for pretty essential things to
prop your tablet up and play games on it
the Nvidia shield tablet is one of the
best performing Android 8-inch tablets
out there but the gaming stuff still
feels a little bit half-baked I'm Scotts
time with CNET looking at the Nvidia
shield tablet available now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
