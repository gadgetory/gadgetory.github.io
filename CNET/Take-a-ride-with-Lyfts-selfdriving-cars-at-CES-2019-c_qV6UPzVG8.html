at CES 2019 and ride-hailing service
lyft has been offering rides in
self-driving cars here in Las Vegas
since last May I opted in the second I
got off of the plane I had to try it out
but unfortunately I've only been paired
with human drivers so far that changes
now come on we're gonna go for a drive
so the car I'm getting into is a BMW
540i that lifts partner active just
bought off a lot and retrofitted with
cameras wide R and a whole mess of
sensors it even has an autonomous
license plate the state of Nevada each
autonomous vehicle has to have two
drivers one behind the wheel and a
safety operator who's kind of like a
co-pilot Aaron Vegas every ride starts
with manual mode and that is because
this is private property here in the
casino as soon as we get onto the public
road that's when we switch over to
autonomous mode one thing I noticed
thing is we're stopping and starting
here at the lights on the Las Vegas
Strip is how smooth the car is it just
feels like Vernon here is a very careful
driver a cards are just kind of cut in
front of us pretty quickly and we did
break but it felt smooth and you know we
didn't get too close to it honestly
sitting in the backseat if I were paying
attention at all I would have absolutely
no idea that we were it may seem at
first that there's not a lot for the
driver to do but they really have to pay
attention to the road and they've got to
really make sure that all of the turns
and all of the stops know the started
are actually safe is that the part is
performing as it's expected to the
driver also isn't just window dressing
you know there are manually starting the
car on private roads are helping to you
and they're interfacing between not just
the technology but the company and you
if you've got a problem there's a human
that you can talk to you're not just
trapped inside of a metal machine
here in the back we've got a screen and
this really I think will help engage the
passenger to show them exactly where
they're going so they've got that level
of confidence right now this is what
we're seeing but in the future we could
see a lot more information that explains
the technology
okay so this ride was pretty short and
to be honest it was a little bit boring
because nothing really happened but
that's good right because when you're a
passenger not much is supposed to happen
I got from point A to point B using the
same app it was really simple I think
there's an initial curiosity about
what's going on and then I think that
once people become used to it that
curiosity is gonna wear off and you're
gonna go back to spending your entire
lift ride either talking to the driver
or the not driver or looking at your
phone and still it was just really
exciting to be part of something that is
going to show tremendously change the
way that people get around this is the
future we're looking at right here if
