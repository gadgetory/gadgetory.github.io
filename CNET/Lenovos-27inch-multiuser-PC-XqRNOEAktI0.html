CES meeting with Lenovo and here we have
their brand new horizon table PC as you
can see this looks like a pretty
standard on one it's a nice big 27-inch
screen it's got a full touchscreen of
course and it's running Windows 8 but
you can run Lenovo's new aura interface
which is designed pretty much primarily
for multiple users to use the system so
you can lay it down flat and you can see
here there's a control wheel it gives
you access to launch all kinds of
different apps games music video etc you
can take things out and put them to the
screen pretty easily Lenovo's also put a
lot of effort into the game development
and other apps for the system so this is
a new game from Lenovo design for four
players at once and system actually
comes with these joysticks among other
accessories that he is you plug them
down to the screen and you can control
your guide and it actually works pretty
well on the other accessories is an air
hockey paddle right here and then this
one is actually pretty cool to die and
the idea is that you can roll it on the
screen and for again that supports it it
will recognize the dye input and you can
actually use it on any surface it
doesn't have to land on the screen in
order to register the back so lenovo has
put a lot of effort into the app store
for the system and it says it's going to
launch with over 3000 apps specifically
designed for multiple user input so one
thing that's actually pretty unique
about the system on top of the multi
user input and the various accessories
that lenovo has a couple different modes
in mind for the way you might use it so
here's one accessory set this might not
come out in the US it's all sorted to be
determined as you can see it's a table
interface or just designed to walk up
and use it you might also notice that
there's no power cable going into this
and that's because it has a battery now
the Nobel estimates the system will run
for about two hours of course you can
plug into the wall you need to but
lenovo has another idea in mind now this
is just a concept and it might not go on
sale at all but as you can see it's this
big table design and its really designed
to be more piece of furniture than an
actual system the pc folds down in there
and it really sir provides a unique
experience that we really never seen in
a computer before so this is not the
first new windows 8 all-in-one to use a
battery we've seen another from sony but
this is certainly the biggest it has the
same low-power parts in it to help
extend battery life and as you can see
from the side it's also actually pretty
thin now I don't imagine that you would
really use this as a tablet necessarily
and it's not maybe the most
mobile thing in terms of just walking
around your house but you can certainly
move it if you want to and overall this
relation is to be a pretty unique design
it's going to start at nine ninety-nine
in the US when it launches later this
year prices will scale up though as you
add higher-end cpus so I'm rich brown
this is the lenovo horizon table pc</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
