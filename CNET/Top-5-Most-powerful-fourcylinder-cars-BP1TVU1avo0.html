America at least it's the automotive
equivalent of government cheese just
getting by but we're in the golden age
of turbocharged direct-injected fours
that are now freakishly powerful
I'm Brian Cooley here to rank these guys
the way engine designers would by their
specific output that means the amount of
horsepower the engine generates per
liter of engine size or displacement
let's go number five is the Audi TTS
at 133 horse per liter now DS better
known for engines with a V shape and the
TT is often maligned as a kind of poser
sports car but the TTS need make no
apologies under the hood it's 2-liter
turbo 4 knocks out 265 horses nearly as
much as a number of v6 cars that are 3
liters number four is the Hyundai
Genesis Coupe 2.0 T pull up to someone
in a Hyundai any Hyundai and they're not
expecting much from yet but the Genesis
Coupe will change that with a turbo 2
liter 4 that delivers 274 horsepower and
in the r-spec model it has one of the
most dreaded six-speed manual out there
so their go-to MP stereotypes at once
number three the Alfa Romeo 4c 139 horse
for a leader the rarest car in our list
and the only one that is built largely
of carbon fiber this is basically a
pocket supercar it also has the smallest
engine in our set up 1.7 liters that's
it but still cranks out 237 horsepower
and they say it's going to grow an
output to closer to 300 down the road
number two mitsubishi lancer evo 146
horse per litre the lancer evo has been
showing what a well-engineered 4 can do
for years it's 2 liter turbo engine puts
out 291 horsepower and it's also our
number 2 car based on torque 300 pound
feet of the stuff a very impressive set
of numbers from a car that's kind of
been languishing in the shadows of late
before I get you to number one a couple
of cars I know you're going to ask about
the VW Golf R for example now once it
gets to the US it'll be a real contender
for this list but the u.s. spec isn't
locked in yet
not due till q1 2015 if we did take the
euro-spec car today though it'd be
buying for second against the lancer evo
and the new 2015 Mustang is on the way
it's going to have a turbo for for the
first time in ages in that car but its
numbers are also still in flux ford
promises at least 305 horsepower but
even at that level it would miss the cut
on specific output because it also has
the largest engine on our list ok our
number one amazing 4 is in the Mercedes
cla45 the AMG car at a hundred and
seventy eight horsepower per mere little
leader this isn't even close guys the
CLA 45 has a 2-liter engine that puts
out 355 horsepower to put that in
perspective that's 32 horsepower more
than Chevy gets out of the Camaro v6
which is roughly twice as large I think
we've made the case for for high tech
cars and modern driving that's what we
do over at C net on cars.com
