welcome to Google issues for all the
Google you can think of let's jump in
with an ARS technica report that gives
us the first look at Google's new
operating system now the OS is called
fuchsia and these are images of some of
its unfinished user interface fuchsia
ditches Linux and will be based on a
Google developed micro kernel called
magenta the project's documentation says
magenta is designed for modern phones
and modern personal computers with fast
processors and non-trivial amounts of
RAM with arbitrary peripherals doing
open-ended computation translation it's
for current gen phones and computers
moving forward now Kyle Bradshaw hotfix
net brings us a look at this super early
OS build in action now you can see some
of these basic UI elements where the
home screen is a vertical list the UI is
named armadillo and written with
Google's flutter SDK which was initially
designed to create cross-platform apps
for Android and iOS
again this is very early but it looks
like it focuses more on personal
information Google cards and recent apps
with quick settings found directly on
your profile image we'll keep watching
how this develops but it's a first look
at how Android is building its next OS
beyond Android and Chrome OS alright
Samsung and Apple have been the kings of
the u.s. smartphone market for years but
LG yes LG has solidified its spot as the
number three phone maker in the US
according to Strategy Analytics LG's
captured a record 20% of the US
smartphone market this quarter catching
up with Samsung's 24.6% while Apple is
at 34 point 5 now fourth place ZTE is at
six point seven percent even more
interesting LG's g6 was not included in
these numbers since it was released in
late April and LG's more affordable
smartphones including the b20 have been
the main drivers while the note 7
debacle helped as well next quarters
numbers could be more telling as they'll
include both the LG G 6 and the samsung
galaxy s 8 and s 8 plus alright oneplus
has confirmed to the verge that their
next gen phone
the oneplus 5 will arrive this summer it
will be the successor to the 1 + 3 + 3 T
but they are skipping the number four
because the number
or is considered bad luck in China now
you know you know what the best number
for good luck is in Chinese culture
eight so for all you people with yellow
fever you're welcome now we've seen
leaked images of the purported phone
like this rumors of a dual lens camera
are out there and even spec sheets
claiming it might come with a beast like
eight gigs of ram and in another
admission that really didn't need to
happen a number of one plus employees
our fans of basketballs Robert Horry aka
Big Shot Rob his jersey number was
number five and two paintings of Horry
even hang in one plus his Shenzhen
offices they said that also came into
play for naming the phone hey one plus
too much information and in my favorite
story this week if you love ways you've
been able to change the voice navigation
to voices like Stephen Colbert and Kevin
Hart but now the latest update will
allow you to record your own custom
direction prompts like you can access
the voice recorder in the way settings
under sounded voice you'll just record
all the basic navigation and phrases and
you're good to go so thank you ways this
is the best gift we could ever get from
you
alright that's going to do for this week
you can email me at Google issues at
Cena comm or tweet me at Brian Tong
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
y'all next time for some more of that
google issues
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
