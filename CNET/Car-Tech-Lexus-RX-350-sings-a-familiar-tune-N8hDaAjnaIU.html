to sum up Lexus's position with the 2015
rx 350
Lexus cassette the standard for the
luxury SUV with its rx model this car
remains a 5 passenger vehicle hatchback
plenty of cargo area body style hasn't
really changed much over the years
although Lexus has added a few tech
features for the 2015 model now we have
a head-up display LED headlights will be
available later this year but not much
else has changed now in the cabin of the
RX 350 here we have the navigation
option so that gives us an 8-inch screen
up here I control that screen with what
Lexus calls its remote touch controller
this little joystick like thing down
here I gotta hate this cuz it's often
hard to get exactly what you want on the
screen I've skipped over the menus many
times trying to get exactly what I want
they've got a button here to go straight
to the map which is nice because I like
having the map up when I'm driving this
only shows in a top-down view point
there's no perspective view on this map
so Lexus is a little bit behind the
curve of the other guys with that one
what I'm on my main menu here I can go
through destinations I've got my radio
and media they set that up differently
even though I go to this audio screen
and I can choose any of my audio sources
from this main audio screen I come back
to the menu but I can go to my phone
screen here I've got the normal phone
things I've got a dial pad and I also
have my contacts on my Bluetooth
connected phone but the most interesting
thing the thing I like most about the
system in the Lexus rx350 is the inform
app integration the only problem with it
is to get to it I have to first pull up
this info apps menu this informed system
is actually showing apps that are
running on my phone my phone is
connected by bluetooth to the car I've
got the app then form app running on my
phone so this is really powering what
I'm seeing on the screen here I've got
Bing search I've got I Heart Radio
I've got movie tickets calm I've got
open table Pandora Yelp
I even have Facebook Places on another
screen here and let's this can add more
features here more apps as they get them
ready I'll just show you a Bing search
really quick because this
the most useful thing to have in a car
these days just an open internet-based
local search for businesses so if I hit
this little microphone icon at the top
of the screen I can go into voice
command and enter any search term it's
been pretty accurate so far when I've
been using it or I can just go do a
keypad search here and enter in the
search term manually with this keyboard
voice is much safer to use while you're
on the road and I also like the Yelp
search on here too so for example I can
choose just choose the restaurant
category shows everything local to me
here and I get my list of restaurants I
can go down choose the one with the best
ratings will actually show me the
written reviews and less I'm stopped
it's a safety feature and then I can
choose to make that my destination of
navigation really quick and easy
internet search for finding destinations
while on the go let's move down to the
shifter here this is a six-speed
automatic transmission the only
condition available with the rx350 get
to the F Sport you get a seven speed but
we get the six speed with this one it's
got a sport mode if I bring it over to
the side here this isn't really a sporty
car this is really just a legacy of
every lexus transmission you can also
manually shift up 4 + down 4 - no paddle
shifters but you're really only going to
use this for going down a grade or
something when you want to keep yourself
in a specific gear now straight in front
of me I'm seeing my head up display this
is a monochrome display not quite as
good as some of the other ones we've
seen in other vehicles but gets the job
done it shows me the speed in digital
format and shows me some route guidance
directions as well
Alexis puts a lot of plastic under this
hood this is what we think of as no user
serviceable parts inside now this is
Alexis as a standard 3.5 liter v6 this
engine will get you 270 horsepower 248
pound-feet of torque you can see its
side saddled so that's a fun wheel drive
architecture but with this model they
run a drive shaft to the rear wheels to
get us all wheel drive now fuel economy
18 miles per gallon city 24 miles per
gallon highway
with the front wheel drivers and you
only gain one mile per gallon so might
as well get all-wheel drive
now one thing Lexus does really well
seeing it in this 2015 rx 350 and you
know their parent company quit is well
known for this - is building cars that
are not really drivers cars they're just
really basic transportation easy to
drive and that's really the hallmark of
this car you don't really have to think
about driving it a whole lot you know
you get in turn it on put it in Drive
and just go this 3.5 liter v6 is a
decent engine for this car can merge
pass not with any sort of bravado it
just just does what you needed to do
again it's not a driver's car the
suspension is OK for maneuvers for
handling but you know it's gonna wallow
a bit in the corners suspension does
give you a really smooth ride and that's
what I've been impressed about with the
suspension not an air suspension but
it's still very reasonably comfortable
it's probably one of the most
comfortable fixed suspensions I've ever
driven I'm looking ahead looking through
the windshield seen the head-up display
that's showing me my speed and digital
format I would also be showing route
guidance turn-by-turn directions if I
had route guidance on I've also got
blind spot monitoring so I'm get a
little icons lighting up in the side
view mirrors when there's a car in the
lane next to me and that tells me if
it's not safe to change lanes but I
don't have in this car is adaptive
cruise control or lane departure warning
or prevention any of that kind of stuff
alexis is a little bit behind the curve
on that that type of equipment
you know with their luxury competitors
so that's one area that's really kind of
like
okay so let's price out our 2015 lexus
rx350 base price for the all-wheel drive
model with destination is forty-three
thousand one hundred five dollars at a
dude up CNET style to get navigation
heated ventilated seats blind spot
monitor heads-up display and that one
package will cost you seven thousand
five hundred sixty three dollars for a
total of fifty thousand seven hundred
and fifty eight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
