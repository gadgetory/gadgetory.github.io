Morris and it's time to get loaded the
net neutrality bill is not going over so
easily the Federal Communications
Commission is fighting in court to stay
the course with the new rules and mobile
and cable providers are trying to stop
it
Verizon and metro pcs filed challenges
to the rules and the FCC has filed a
request to get rid of those challenges
it's kind of a mess and the rules are
not even in place yet but they are
expected to be soon Amazon may be
testing out a video streaming service to
compete with Netflix details are fuzzy
on this but it would seem that the
service is unlimited and free to anyone
who is an Amazon Prime customer Amazon
Prime is a yearly membership that
entitles you to free two-day shipping on
any product and apparently free movies
Amazon already does stream movies but
this would be a revamp of Amazon's video
on-demand
if it's true speaking of Amazon if you
haven't changed your password there now
is a good time to do that wired reports
that Amazon has a security flaw that
lets people log into accounts with
passwords that are closed but not
exactly correct for example if your
password was seen it
someone could log into your account with
CNET 1 2 3 which kind of defeats the
purpose of a password this appears to
affect old passwords that have not been
changed in a while so let's all change
our passwords today for good measure
new research shows that Google's Android
operating system is now the most popular
smartphone platform in the world taking
that title from Nokia nearly 33 million
Android phones were sold in 2010
compared to 31 million Nokia Symbian
phones Nokia held the top spot for 10
years and if you need another Angry
Birds Game one is on its way
Rovio the maker of Angry Birds is going
to make a new version of the game based
on the upcoming 20th Century Fox movie
called Rio it's an animated film the new
game will have 45 levels with more as an
upgrade of course and you can't wait
and Valentine's Day edition is on its
way example.com has been inexplicably
changed the site used to be a place
reserved for private testing of web
builds that isn't the case any longer
now it redirects itself to the internet
assigned numbers Authority it's not
clear why that's your news of the day if
you want more about any of our stories
