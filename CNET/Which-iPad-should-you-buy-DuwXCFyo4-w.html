lot of choices and a lot of prices right
now for Apple's iPad lineup small large
and extra extra-large
the iPad pro is the newest and the
biggest but are you interested in an
iPad you're curious what the differences
are it's easy to understand if you break
it down this way for kids or basic
reading and browsing pick an iPad Mini
it's the most affordable iPad line and
the 8 inch mini - formerly called the
iPad Mini with Retina display is the
cheapest still good came out back in
2013
it said price drops since then you get
the same resolution as the iPad air
shrunken there's an a7 processor which
is still good no touch ID if you want to
get a little bit more expensive go with
the iPad Mini 4 which has touch ID a
faster AAA processor and can handle
split-screen multitasking for supported
apps if you're looking for the best bang
for the buck
all-around tablet in Apple's lineup this
year it's still in my opinion the iPad
air 2 it's got the best size it's pretty
much the best for nearly everything the
basic person would need it still runs
faster than the iPad menu 4 and you get
it on sale for less than before if you
look around and holiday shopping the
larger nine point seven inch screen is
good for reading movies and it still
works great when paired with the
keyboard case like this one too right on
the go split-screen apps run perfectly
to Apple still sells the iPad air for
even less than the iPad air 2 but we
don't recommend that one it's got a
slower processor and basically for the
sales you can get right now
go for the air 2 because it also adds
split-screen apps now if you're an
artist or your laptop replacement
hopeful someone who wants the biggest
and best right now the iPad pro is the
one it's 12 point 9 inches though so
it's gigantic and it's expensive nearly
the cost of a laptop it loses some of
that portability but its biggest
advantages are the separately sold
pencil which turns the iPad pro into an
incredibly accurate versatile art bad
like nothing you've ever seen before
and that big screen and it stepped up
speakers do make for a fantastic movie
watching or
James and you can look at documents or
websites in greater detail just keep in
mind that the iPad pro doesn't have that
many optimized apps yet and if you're
interested in keyboards the keyboards
that connect to this still don't have
track pads and aren't all that much
better than what you could get on the
iPad air or air 2 so in conclusion for
most people
I recommend the iPad air 2 if you really
like to travel you like to read get the
mini and if you like something that's a
laptop replacement or you'd like to be
an early adopter save up for the pro
possibly and I wouldn't really consider
LTE unless somebody else is paying the
bill you can always pair one of these
over Wi-Fi with your phone and hotspot
mode for seeing it I'm Scott Steiner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
