really easy to live life in the cloud
and that starts by making all of your
files available on all of your devices
anywhere and to do that we built a
really nice web interface desktop sync
applications for Windows and for mac and
also a really really nice android app
but like with chrome we want drive to be
available on every platform and so today
I'm really excited to announce we're
making it available on iOS and on Chrome
OS so let me start here on on iOS here
on the iPad just going to zoom out a bit
and I'll just open up drive and you can
see the interface is really really fluid
it works just like you'd expect you can
browse through dozens and dozens of file
types here I'll pull up a photo it's a
bigger photo than I remember and
everything just works like you'd expect
but it's not just browsing that we made
available on the iOS experience we
brought a lot of the best features of
drive right to the mobile and tablet
experience so for example I'm going to
open up this folder of receipts here and
a big nerd I scan all of my receipts but
I was also too lazy to actually title
any of these but I know that somewhere
in here there's a receipt from the post
office with a tracking number so what I
can do here is just search and i'm going
to type certified mail i think that word
was in there somewhere and just like
that i can pull up the receipt
notice this isn't a text file there's no
text in here I haven't written anything
instead we used optical character
recognition technology to actually
extract the text from the scan index it
and then make it searchable now the cool
thing is that doesn't just work with
text that's pretty cool it doesn't just
work with text it works with photos to
let me show you what I mean so here I
have a big pile of photos I took a trip
with my wife through Africa last year
and I know somewhere in here are photos
of us at the pyramids but again I didn't
title my keeping my photos I didn't add
keywords but if i search for pyramids
just do a search up come the images rush
at the Baron
again we can actually use image
recognition technology to peer inside of
the images to actually understand the
content I don't have to do anything no
labels no metadata no nothing just works
so of course I don't always have an
internet connection and so drive makes
it really easy to just save things cast
them offline so here I'll just save this
manual offline so I can read it whenever
and of course at its core drive is about
enabling sharing and collaboration so i
can add users to collaborate in
documents with me right from the app so
here's i think a relevant document here
I haven't gotten very far but i'm going
to add brian right here he's now
backstage and we'll see if he has any
other ideas give him edit access I've
added him right there so we'll come back
to that in a second so that's google
drive on iOS to vail ipad iphone ipod
touch later today check it out you think
you'll like it
so if we can go over to the Chromebook
now I want to show you drive on Chrome
OS so of course drive does a lot more
than just sync your files to the cloud
it enables some amazing applications and
one of those is real-time collaboration
in the cloud with applications like
Google Docs so I'm going to open up this
document here there we go and I'm also
going to pull it up on my smartphone and
on my tablet and here's everything
synced across all of my devices right
keystroke by keystroke I can see these
edits everything just works now this
last point is an important one Google
Docs works great if you're connected to
the Internet but what if you're on a
plane or you don't have a connection
what about that we've been thinking
about that and we're really excited to
announce that today Google Documents
works for editing offline
so let me show you how this works so
what I'm going to do is we've turned off
wireless on the laptop here and I'm just
going to unplug the ethernet cable so
there it is it's unplugged and just to
prove to you that I am in fact offline
New York Times no connection but I can
just go back to my google doc and I can
keep editing just like I'm online all
the formatting still works and you'll
see that google docs it's just noticed
gracefully I'm offline all of mice ate
all my changes are just saved locally to
a local cache and I can keep on without
even thinking about it all just works
without me even noticing so what I'm
going to do now is I've made some
changes offline maybe my Brian and folks
backstage and making some more changes
I'm going to close this document all my
changes are saved I'm going to plug
ethernet back in and now watch what
happens when I open the document because
it's going to happen pretty quickly I'm
going to open it back up and drive and
like that it's going to be sink back to
the cloud and you'll see it across all
of my devices updated in real time so
let me open up the drive web interface
here it is I'm going to open up this
document and get ready because it
happens quick there is and there it is
everything everything just thanks
and once you've shown the feature move
on to the next thing so that's Google
Documents working offline it's available
today we're working on offline
presentations and spreadsheets those are
coming soon but if you're flying back
from google i/o and you don't have
internet on the plane try out google
docs it works great we think you really
love it so Google Docs offline</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
