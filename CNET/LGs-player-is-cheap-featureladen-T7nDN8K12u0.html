of the lg BP 530 now our people still
buying blu-ray players in 2013 if that's
you then you're probably looking to buy
something that's more than a blu-ray
player with streaming one of your
must-have features while it has the
all-important Netflix playback the lg BP
530 offers a number of other features
with the most intriguing being private
listening this enables you to couple the
player with your phone and lets you use
your headphones without sneaking a cable
across the living room it sounds like a
good idea but as the sound quality
doesn't scale down for slow connections
you need to have a really good wireless
connection or else you'll just hear mush
the LG is fairly standard looking for a
blu-ray player with a dark grey and
black appearance one gripe is that the
playback buttons on the front are the
same color as the rest of the player and
it's hard to tell them apart
the remote control is pretty well
organized but if you're typing a lot
they are a bit too squishy for comfort
meanwhile the menu system is a bit
strange with the my apps icon almost
completely useless
the only vaguely interesting extra is
Rhapsody which appears as a link below
my apps so you don't really need to
enter it at all what can I say about
Netflix though it works pretty well but
unfortunately it's a little slow to the
load up and about 35 seconds it takes
twice as long as the equivalent samsung
player blu-ray quality is very good
though a decent upscaling of DVDs and
only some minor judder when playing back
blu-rays the LG BP 530 is now available
online for about $90 and it's pretty
decent for that price but I'd still go
for the superior Samsung 5900 which is
also available for about 90 bucks this
