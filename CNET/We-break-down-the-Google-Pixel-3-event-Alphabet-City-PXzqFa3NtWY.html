show where we normally cover everything
related to alphabet today is a special
day it's pixel day so today we're gonna
stay and pics the park but it's super
freaking loud in here so we're gonna go
to another area
now pixel park was kind of loud so we
decided to move to a quieter section in
my hands right now though are the new
pixels one is that not pink color and
the other one is white now the biggest
difference between the two obviously is
the size and the big ol notch on the XL
this is the pixel 3 and this is the
pixel 3 XL
now what can we say about these devices
well we've seen them right you've seen
this online a lot I've seen it online a
lot so Google what they decided to do
was talk about how great the software is
on the 3 and the 3 XL you know we went
to pick up the phone anymore Google has
a call screening feature that allows the
device to listen to the call and then
respond with who is this and what do you
want essentially then you could say
scram if you want it's actually a pretty
cool idea it's a bit about helping to
use it because the software is the thing
that's gonna set these guys apart
because let's face it this you can make
any of these it's an app tracking a 45
processor some Ram and here is a battery
every phone is pretty much the same
Google software for the camera is
supposed to be freakin ridiculous that's
why there's only one camera on the rear
they claim that their software is so
good that in low light you will never
need to use a flash again now Google
pixel cameras have been really great
Google was so bold to say it's started
with the world's greatest camera and
then put it in a phone and let's face it
and that's what you want to use your
phone for that's great and since it's a
pixel that comes with unlimited storage
at original size quality so that's
another cool feature about the pixel the
software is the thing that separates
Google from everybody else and don't
forget this is Android from Google which
means you actually get updates right
away that's a real big big draw and
guess what that wasn't the only pixel
device Google showed off they happened
to introduce the pixel slave now I don't
know if I'm supposed to be picking this
up but I did so let's see if they
stopped me such
point three inch tablet running Chrome
OS very smartly they've included a
fingerprint sensor on the power button I
think that's pretty neat dual
front-facing speakers cameras situated
in the portrait mode
it weighs I don't know maybe a pound or
so and it's really sturdy I like it it's
got a nice camera on the back here comes
in a midnight blue I'm gonna turn it
around you can see the blue it's
exciting
this device starts at $5.99 it goes all
the way up to $15.99 that's a lot of
freaking money for a Chrome OS tablet
Google redesigned Chrome OS for a tablet
first experience with this device and
here's the thing if you want to use it
as a full laptop you're gonna shell out
another $200 this snazzy keyboard case
it's powered by the actual pixel slate
I'm gonna pop them together you saw that
and it's got this magnetic stand similar
to a Microsoft Surface kind of like an
iPad pearl kind of thing actually is on
both sides so it protects your device on
both sides I think that's pretty neat
but $200 is a very high price to pay I
tried out the keyboard earlier and I
will say the keyboard travels with a
nice the trackpad is really good and the
this thing is extremely responsive but
is it worth 600 to $1600 and that's
without keyboard I don't know that
there's also one more accessory there's
a pen accessory a stylus you know what I
found out today it doesn't work on the
pixel phone why not it's $100 why can't
this work together I would leave my note
they just would do this but no it's cost
an extra $100 so if you want the full
experience from six hundred plus two
hundred eight hundred and another you're
in for nine hundred bucks face for these
things there was one last pixel device
it's the pixel stand I know like where
is it well it kind of looks like this
oops
it kind of looks like this just the
thing that holds your phone this isn't
actually it that'd be silly right it
does that the $79 stand can charge a
device it actually puts your pixel in a
new mode where it's more like a Google
Home Hub speaking of that let's talk
about the hub the Google home hub leaked
really
he closed the actual event so we didn't
know a lot about it turns out to 7-inch
display it's a lot like a Google home
and the craziest thing about it I gotta
say it's it's only a hundred and forty
nine dollars it's not that much more
than getting a Google home so with this
we get a seven inch screen and you get
all this visual feedback when you're
looking for information it also has a
lot of smart features like turning off
at night acting as a photo frame no
camera on this device intentionally I
thought that was a really interesting
move for privacy they showed the use
case of the home hub as a bedside clock
and that makes a lot of sense for a
device that has no camera you put
something like an echo show there it's
got a camera on it a little bit creepy
now again $149 makes us almost an
impulse buy there's four colors if you
can see here there's a black this
seafoam green white and I don't know if
this is not pink or not but it's not
white let's go with that there's also a
physical mute switch which is always
excellent on the Google devices Google
also talks about tight integration with
nest devices you can see your
temperatures stuff from your actual
thermostats but also if you have one of
those smart doorbells the image of whose
ring your Bell will show up on your home
hub it's a nice cool feature NASA has
been a little lost in the past few years
it was an independent company under
alphabet but now it's within Google this
might be the right strategy because if
you're working with Smart Home stuff
shouldn't they all work together
why not the Google home hub lands on
October 22nd I think this is gonna be a
surprise hit guys I know we didn't cover
the death of Google Plus your comments
and that giant security breach but we'll
cover that in the next episode of
Alphabet City if you've enjoyed your
stay in Alphabet City please the like
and subscribe I'm Aya's Akhtar and I'll
see you online
I'm IAEA's after they then gonna take a
nap</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
