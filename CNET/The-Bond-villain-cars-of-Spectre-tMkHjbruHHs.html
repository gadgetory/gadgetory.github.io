Rover Sport SVR and the unicorn ish
Jaguar CX 75 hybrid hyper car all three
of them are in the new Bond film Spectre
and they've been prepped by Jaguar Land
Rovers very own special vehicle ops and
today for a very limited amount of time
I have the King's first the defender
Bigfoot it's like a defender but bigger
for example this one has 37 inch tires a
185 brake horsepower tuned engine and so
much more
that it's worth doing a big screen
overlay thing with all the details so
even though I've only got it for a short
amount of time and I can only drive it
at 30 miles an hour lest it get damaged
and jag your Land Rover find me in my
sleep and murder me it's quite a
wonderful thing everything's very
familiar it does feel like a defender
which means it's chunky it's big you can
grab everything everything feels quite
solid there are a few differences this
has a bit more power than a standard
carve-out 180 horsepower thanks to a
jazzy new turbo there's ropes over the
bonnet it's got its giant wheels which
don't off make a racket and they do make
the ride on tarmac a bit bumpy but don't
say snow I imagine they'd be ideal and
it looks
there's a cage in the back there's a
cage on the outside and there's a thing
I absolutely love it our only problem is
not only is the defender ending its life
you can't buy one anymore you almost
certainly can't buy one of these unless
you turn up to the SVO guys with a lot
of money and a very big smile on your
face batting your eyelids you're
probably not likely to be able to get
your mitts on one which is a crying
shame however this is only the start of
jlr specter offerings because there's a
couple more to play with and both have
very big very silly engines that I'll
probably also only be able to drive at
30 miles an hour but still it's enough
if the Bigfoot wasn't enough how's about
this the Range Rover Sport SVR it's 5
liter supercharged v8 engine produces
550 horses and kicks this thing from
nought to 62 in less than five seconds
this is the fastest production Range
Rover ever built and because it was
built in the first place by the SVO guys
they didn't really do much to get it
bond ready apart from some tires and the
brightest lights known to man as you can
probably see now I'm not allowed to
drive this particular car over 30 40
miles an hour but I have driven one of
these before and it's it's otherworldly
because it's massive and it's heavy but
it moves unlike something this size
really should it's unbelievably fast
nought to 60 happens in less than five
seconds its top speed somewhere north of
160 miles an hour it sounds absolutely
incredible
you never see an SUV making that kind of
noise it just sounds dirty it sounds a
bit like a NASCAR which as far as I'm
concerned is a brilliant thing because
you always see cars like there's going
quite quickly but you never really get
to hear them because it's not part of
the luxury experience and lifestyle
which tends to go hand-in-hand with them
but thanks to the magic of SVO and the
fact I think they're all secretly
hooligans they managed to make it sound
like the Chinese New Year which is
brilliant it corners brilliantly the
brakes work and then some they've been
specially modified to make sure this
thing does stop immensely well and it
handles beautifully but at the same time
it's very comfortable when you want it
to be quiet it will be and when you want
it to be a hooligan it'll be that as
well it is basically the every car in
the spec we have it in we've got bigger
wheels and tires lots of lights and
proper stealth blackout it's really cool
it's the kind of thing you could drive
through anywhere and unless you had the
noise button on so it was spitting out
all manner of dirty dirty angry noise no
one would really notice it would be like
a big Range Rover shaped shadow
squirreling through the background like
this this is good fun
finally the Jaguar CX 75 the car that
would have been up there with the
Ferrari laferrari McLaren p1 and Porsche
918 if it wasn't killed in his normal
trim the one we have it's a hybrid
petrol electric setup with nearly 1,000
brake horsepower now this and one of the
other hero cars from the film were
actually repainted versions of the
prototypes of what could have been
Jaguars halo hyper car I've driven this
exact car before this is prototype
number four when I add it it was silver
and it made me do this race five more
675 s were made for the film except they
were cars made to look like this with
well the famous 5 liter supercharged v8
with 550 horsepower in it now that's an
engine we know and love very very dearly
it is epic that's not what I've got
today I have the full fat hybrid hyper
car the car that could have been I've
been told there's been a lot of interest
in it since Jaguar started punting this
around with all the publicity for
Spectre now if you want a bit more of a
detail thing of what it's like to drive
there is our full film on the 675 but
this is what a 30 mile an hour stint in
a proper jag 675 hybrid hyper car is
like as you can no doubt hear it's quite
noisy but that's one point six liters of
power making lots and lots of noise
kicks out about 500 horsepower with all
the gubbins on it and then there's the
electric stuff that will push this thing
into the distance at a scary scary race
of not it is mammoth Leigh quick up to
30 of course it can go faster I've done
it I did 180 990 in one of these which
still remains the fastest I've ever
driven
Jaggi was chief test driver Mike cross
took me out in one and we did a shade
over 200 even though the speedo only
went to 198 why well because they never
thought they'd build a car that would do
more than that
who can blame them it's a silly speed
the gearbox really doesn't like going at
low speed and it's it's quite aggressive
so if we change down from fourth to
third wow there's a bit of a jolt and
when you change up again there we go
nice big proper proper job the steering
feels nice and light and the visibility
oddly is really good for a hyper car you
can see a little bit out the back of
mostly got spoiler at the moment the
wing mirrors provide plenty of this and
the interior itself is very pleasant I
love the way it looks it's a nice and
carbon fiber you could tell this bits of
jag everywhere I recognized that centre
console from an f-type and those dials
from the XE and those buttons from the
f-type but that doesn't matter because
this was never supposed to be a car for
the public this was going to be another
stage in this cars evolution I'll tell
you what it's a crying shame they didn't
build it because I bet you any money
they'd sell out like hotcakes
now full sure this thing sounds and
feels incredible but at low speed if the
gearbox was a little less angry well
it actually would be quite comfy round
town the ride isn't too bad it's lacking
a bit of NVH and sound deadening so you
can hear stones everything bouncing
round outside it but again it's a
prototype and you've got to forgive it
for that this thing even if 30 miles an
hour feels as special as it looks this
is a truly wonderful experience today I
am a very very lucky boy and I cannot
wait to see what this thing does inspect
it
I really can't so there we have it a
brief stint with the three bond bodied
cars from the short time I've had with
them they're all pretty good but let's
not forget what they're going up against
the aston martin db10 a v8 powered
custom-built supercar just for bond
himself I wonder how they'll fare
