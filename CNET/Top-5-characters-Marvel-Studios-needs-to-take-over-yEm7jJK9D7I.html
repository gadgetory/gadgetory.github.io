Comics characters are split between Fox
and Disney's Marvel Studios Fox has the
rights to everything related to the
Fantastic Four and the x-men Sony has
the rights of spider-man or worked out a
deal with Marvel Studios because Sony
spider-man reboot wasn't done for every
other hero
there's Marvel Studios some characters
might be better served at box and marble
started working together these are the
top five characters that Marvel Studios
needs to fix at number five Doctor Doom
your heroes are only as good as your
villains Doctor Doom was the right kind
of bad guy because he can cause a
constant stream of trouble he's also a
dictator of his own country needs a
storyline for Doom
maybe he could bug Captain America or
something at number four Wolverine okay
so Wolverine doesn't have the worst
stories made by Fox
I mean x-men origins Wolverine might be
the worst movie with a marble name
attached but the other solo movie was
pretty good Wolverine has history with
lots of other characters including
Captain America and even spider-man he'd
be a welcome addition to the Marvel
Cinematic Universe at number three
Galactus not familiar with Galactus he's
locked up by Fox right now he's known as
a devourer of worlds when you've got the
Marvel Cinematic Universe with the
Avengers you need huge threats it
doesn't get much huger than Galactus
Galactus did appear Fantastic Four rise
of the Silver Surfer but as a giant
cloud up cloud
forget the clouds I bet Marvel Studios
could figure out a way to make that
ridiculous helmet make sense at number
two Jean Grey every time we think we're
about to get the Phoenix saga done right
as a movie
we're served up with a big steaming pile
of nope now if only Jean Grey is alone
to Marvel Studios you can't really get a
Phoenix saga but maybe the character
will have a proper story arc and at
number one the Fantastic Four yeah this
is a giant cheat because it's four
characters but these four need Marvel's
Midas touch how on earth did Fox
continually mess up a Fantastic Four
movie need a blueprint to copy go watch
The Incredibles it rips off the
Fantastic Four's family dynamic
very well and if you're upset that have
chosen four characters instead of one
let's just pick one FF character this
way and that would be the one and only
that does it for this top 5 for more
