scooter you about 15 years ago well now
we have electric ones I'm Wayne
Cunningham here looking at the III
hundred ways or electric scooter and
I'll in law looking at the razor II one
hundred glow electric both of these
scooters have two lead acid batteries in
them which give them about forty minutes
of run time this e 300 has a top speed
of 15 miles per hour
it has a pneumatic tire a rear brake and
as a weight limit of about 220 pounds in
comparison the e 100 has a 120 pound
weight limit it front frames a solid
rear wheel and LED lights on the deck
the e 100 offers a pretty solid ride but
as you can hear it's actually really
loud and I could feel nearly every bump
on the ground underneath my seat in
addition it's also really hard to keep
the accelerator going on on max speed
without my hand getting sore after a
while the c300 is also pretty loud it's
got that chain drive an electric motor
so I'm here too all the time but it does
have a really comfortable ride because
of these two pneumatic tires and it
feels really stable because of the wide
deck as well the accelerator is a little
hard to modulate but I don't have a very
hard time keeping it on maximum throttle
at all times with lit acid batteries and
the chain drive these are pretty
primitive on the technology front and
they don't have any safety lighting
there's no front headlight or rear LED
taillight there's also no battery
indication so you have no idea how much
power you're running on while you're
riding these scooters so ultimately I
would say these things are kind of in
the toy category the pricing reflects
that the e 100 is only 130 dollars this
III hundred is two hundred and seventy
dollars I'm Wayne Cunningham I'm Lin LA
and we're here taking on the first look
at the razor II one hundred and razor
III hundred electric scooters
