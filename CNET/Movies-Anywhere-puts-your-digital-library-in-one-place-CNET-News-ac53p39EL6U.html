movies scattered across different apps
well Disney and four other Hollywood
Studios just teamed up to try and solve
that annoyance by launching a new
service called
movies anywhere it's really a simple
concept let's say you bought movies on
iTunes but you have a few also in Google
Play and you also downloaded some off
Amazon and Vudu this app will bring your
library together in one place and it
works in Reverse all the movies also
show up on your Amazon video app or
iTunes or your Google and Vudu libraries
there is one catch it's not for every
movie this app only links together 73
hundred movies from five studios it's
Disney Fox Sony Universal and Warner
Brothers paramount and Lionsgate are not
partners right now that means no Star
Trek no Hunger Games so you still have
to hop between apps for those titles now
it doesn't cost anything to use movies
anywhere and link up your accounts the
app is on roku amazon Android and Apple
devices so yes that means if you
purchased a movie on iTunes you can
watch it on a Roku or a chromecast or
Fire TV now if you're on a physical DVD
or blu-ray disc that is among the titles
available you can redeem your digital
code with the app Disney already use
this account linking magic with its own
app it was called Disney movies anywhere
and that service is gonna go away and be
replaced by this new app that stretches
across from more studios Disney is
leading this project to join up with
other Studios as a way to cut back on
the clutter of many apps and maybe when
things are less messy you'll be more
encouraged to buy more digital movies in
this one stop shop to entice you to
create an account movies anywhere offers
5 free titles to get you started
there's Ice Age the recent ghostbusters
big hero 6 Jason Bourne and the lego
movie I'm Bridget Carey for more
