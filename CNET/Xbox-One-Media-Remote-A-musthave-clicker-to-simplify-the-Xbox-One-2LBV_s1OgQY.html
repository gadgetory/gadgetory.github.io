living room experience I wrote that it
cried out for a dedicated remote as
Microsoft's vision of using voice
commands in the Kinect for everything
could get a little annoying and
surprisingly Microsoft apparently agreed
releasing the Xbox one media remote just
a few months after the launch of the
console
hey I'm Matthew moscovia from CNET and
if you're using your Xbox one to watch
TV and blu-rays you're going to want to
check out the $25 media remote it's a
small clicker that runs on to triple-a
batteries and it's covered in a soft
textured finish that feels nice to hold
the remote is backlit and it illuminates
as soon as you pick it up so it's easy
to see even in a dim living room the
buttons are unusually flat on the front
which is usually a bad sign for a remote
but Microsoft has added just enough
tactile cues that it's easy enough to
navigate without having to look at it
the buttons are well laid out and
labeled with the exception of the View
menu and one guide buttons it's not
immediately obvious what they do
especially for non gaming members of
your household the remote requires
almost no setup out of the box and it
works by sending traditional IR signals
to the Xbox one console and as long as
you've set up your Xbox one properly it
can also act like a universal remote as
the Kinect is capable of firing out ir
commands to your TV sound bar or AV
receiver it's actually a little
surprising that the remote uses IR since
newer devices like the Amazon fire TV
and Roku streaming stick have
transitioned to Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
direct but in practice I didn't run into
any major issues with the IR based media
remote using the media remote on a day
to day basis makes watching TV and
movies on your Xbox one a lot easier
voice commands for simple stuff like
volume up just aren't very convenient
and it's a lot more comfortable to kick
back with a small clicker than a clunky
game controller it also makes the Xbox
one a lot easier for non gamers often
are forced to use the console since it
takes over the whole TV experience so
the bottom line is the Xbox one media
remote solves one of the major problems
I had with Microsoft's living room
experience and it's especially
four households where everybody is in
the game room given the $100 premium
over the ps4 it feels like perhaps the
media remote should have been included
with the Xbox one but it's definitely
worth your $25 especially if you're
tired of using a controller or your
voice to watch TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
