takes on snapchat I am Bridget Carey and
this is your see net update Google is
growing its same day delivery shopping
service Google Express is expanding
beyond California and New York to three
new cities Chicago Boston and Washington
DC customers can shop from a total of 37
retailers including Walgreens and Target
but with the expansion Google is now
charging a fee to use it
membership to get same-day delivery is
$95 a year or $10 a month and if you
don't want to commit to a membership you
could pay as you go with a $5 shipping
charge per order Google is offering a
free three-month trial membership
Google's same-day shopping service
launched a year ago and it's competing
directly with eBay now and Amazon Prime
which also offers same-day delivery on
some items Google's service though is
cheaper than what Amazon Prime promises
and the expansion comes right in time
for the busy holiday shopping season
and speaking of tech challengers
Microsoft Skype is taking on snapchat
with a new type of video messaging
mobile app it's called Skype quick the
app lets you send 42 second videos to
your friends you can also pre record 12
short videos as quick replies for
expressing your mood we're starting to
see the shift in services that let you
send short video clips to send to your
friends Skype is trying something new
since it's not as popular on mobile
compared to using Apple's FaceTime or
Google's hangouts when you use Skype
quick you sign up with a phone number
not a user name which is a similar
approach to whatsapp the video messages
are square in shape like Instagram
videos and they disappear after two
weeks it's available on iOS Android and
of course Windows Phone now if you're
looking for new ways to communicate with
your friends but you don't want to take
a video you could say it with a sticker
Facebook is expanding those oh so cute
cartoon stickers into comments until now
they've only been in private messages so
now you can actually send someone a
thumbs down comment when you dislike
something there are tons of choices to
express yourself with drawings there's
even this
egg creature thing looking ahead this
month will bring a few new Android
phones of horizon says that its next
Motorola Droid phone will be shown off
on October 28th CNET was first report
that this month horizons going to come
out with a new fast charging droid this
is rumored to be called the Droid turbo
and a linked user manual says it has a
5.2 inch ultra high def display a 21
megapixel rear camera and three gigs of
RAM not only will it charge fast but
it'll have a large battery to last
longer than most phones that your tech
