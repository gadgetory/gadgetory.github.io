features and commands it's impossible to
include them all in one video but here
are seven of my favorite Google now tips
for starters instead of saying someone's
full name you can say things like text
my mom
or call my manager but first you'll have
to set up those relationships to do that
just say ok Google John Smith is my
brother hit add relationship so now I
can say ok Google call my brother
Google now can understand some pretty
complex commands so never hesitate to be
really specific for example you can say
ok Google what's the weather gonna be
like in Los Angeles next Sunday or you
can say something like ok Google set a
reminder to take out the trash when I
get home the reminder will be
location-based so as soon as I get home
I'll get an alert when you're texting or
emailing with Google now you can still
use punctuation x' and Smiley's just say
them for example ok Google text John
Smith hey comma how are you doing
question mark smiley face it's a little
awkward but it works if you ever want to
know what song is playing
Google now can figure it out like this
ok Google what song is playing
if I love CA by becoming poncho there it
is the fastest way to get driving
directions is to tell Google now that
you want them like this okay Google
give me driving directions to AT&amp;amp;T Park
in San Francisco this one's my favorite
because it means I can quickly set an
alarm when I'm tired and lazy at the end
of the day
okay Google set an alarm for 6:30 a.m.
if Google now ever misunderstands you
you don't have to repeat the entire
command instead just say no I said like
this
okay Google what's the weather like in
Santa no I said Santa Cruz so those are
just some of the many Google now
commands your phone can handle but if
you want to see a lot more check out my
