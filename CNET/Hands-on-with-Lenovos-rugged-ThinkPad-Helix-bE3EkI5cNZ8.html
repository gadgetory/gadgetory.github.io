a look at the Lenovo ThinkPad helix this
is another one of the many Windows 8
laptop tablet hybrids that we've seen
since the launch of Windows 8 late last
year in this particular version now you
have a pretty traditional clamshell
laptop and because it's a think pad it's
really solidly built and of course the
screens attached is you have a little
button right here and lifts right off
like this and unlike a lot of other
hybrids you can actually take the screen
use it by itself or you can plug it back
in backwards now why would you want to
do that that's because if you felt like
it you could turn it into sort of a
kiosk style display the Lenovo yoga also
works in a similar fashion flipping the
screen around this is more I think
Lenovo calls it a rip and flip screen
which just sounds like the kind of
sizzle up the the normally boring think
pad brand other than that it does look
and feel a lot like a pretty standard
think pad laptop the hinge is pretty
solid compared to a lot of the other
detachable screen ones that we've seen
it's still a little bit fiddly got a lot
of little teeth and hooks to grip into
here and you do get this sort of weird
little panel that folds over the the
back sort of hides the hinge works I
call it the helix modesty skirt now one
of the problems that we're having with
the system even though it's really well
made is that it's got Intel the last
generation of processors in it even
though it's just coming out now the new
generation the fourth generation of
course Erie's gives you excellent
battery life and for a tablet you'd
really want that I I would much rather
see this with the newer parts hopefully
that will be coming soon the second
issue is fairly standard configuration
here last generation Intel Core i5 4
gigs of ram 128 gig SSD you can pretty
much get those specs in any laptop for
eight hundred nine hundred dollars this
guy starts at sixteen seventy nine that
does seem like a lot for those parts
even with the really nice construction
and the cool hinge and the detachable
screen I find it hard to believe unless
your IT department is paying for it
you'd be willing to throw out that much
for for this particular configuration
I'm Dan Ackerman and that is the
pan helix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
