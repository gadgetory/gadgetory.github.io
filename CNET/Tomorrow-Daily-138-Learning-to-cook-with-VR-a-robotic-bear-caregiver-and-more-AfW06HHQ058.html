first pair of 3d printed jet engines
don't know how to cook don't worry cuz
VR is here to save the day oh love that
and robear is Japan's answer to taking
care of old folks and i don't mean
taking care of like in a bad way
actually taken care of tomorrow daily
greetings citizens to the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm your
co-host Ashley's gotta joining me hit
the kale sickle kale anonymous okay from
east coast east coast we got a problem
friend alright snowing me in cancel my
flights I don't like it when back who is
back in Los Angeles is good to see all
of you again can you see you again
instead of just a pile of snow I thought
we would actually just put a snowman
here for fun to freak you out a little
bit but that more charisma that's for
sure oh thanks yeah but no we've got sit
we've got something really really cool
today that we've been holding on to for
a long long time do we do it's in the
second half of the show with new
releases but so before we do that though
let's talk about our headlines okay i
just i love this this is the best right
here alright so we gonna talk about 3d
printed jet engines we've seen actually
3d printed rocket engines before but not
3d printed jet engine so this comes from
australia's Monash University ok and
this is a pair of 3d printed jet engines
they so what they did was that's it
right there they took an actual jet
engine that was sort of an auxiliary
engine that was being used they took it
out of service and scanned it to make 3d
models of every single part every single
part and then what they did was they
made they made these like 3d printed
copies of each part in two layers and
then put them all together to make sure
that everything assembled and fit
correctly and then once they figured out
like ok everything is exactly perfect
now we can make the metal ones so then
they went ahead and made metal replicas
of the old engine and and and there
that's what they ended up looking like
so these are like actual like they
potentially could be working jet engines
in the future we could 3d print but
they're not gonna try them out so they
can't try them out yet because obviously
jet engines you be in the sky be a
little bit dangerous right so they said
it'll take a couple years before they
can actually start testing them because
they want to be really really sure of
the safety of them and it took about it
so I really like this part which is it
took about
year to do and now after they had made
these 3d printed jet engines all of
these aerospace companies are like kind
of knocking at the door at Monash
University going like hey hey do you
think you could I could help us out
maybe you can make us some 3d printed
parts because this process takes weeks
from design to printing as opposed to an
actual machining process where you would
design things than machine them and go
back and machine them and go back and
machine them which could take months so
this is a much faster and less expensive
process all these aerospace companies
are very very interested in what they're
doing or imagine very curious all right
so not that it's like almost the
necklace just in almost but the fact
that they were able to these are the
world first like 3d printed jet engine
so that and I think that the thing is is
they they test the engine like they're
they work but they can't like test them
I can't like put them in a plane I'm
like flying right and be very expensive
to test out I would imagine that would
be an expensive test so they're they're
working on testing them in terms of like
making sure that they function but it's
not a hundred percent testing in the way
that we would think okay Oh car using
stuff I thought that was cool that we're
like 3d printing jet engines now weird
okay so uh so you want me to go okay
tell me how to not burn my food so then
you'll know how to cook elegant meals
all by yourself that's actually the end
of the story so let me let me start at
the beginning at in fact so let's assume
you don't know how to cook anything well
up some some people from a company
called oh my gut starship have created
this new at this new experience in
virtual reality that teaches you how to
cook so video even looks like me you'll
learn how to cook you learn how to cook
through this this app and then you bring
it to the actual to the actual table so
this is a hyper real cooking simulation
you basic it's basically made for the
samsung the the Samsung VR all the gears
right yeah so basically what's really
cool about this simulation is that it
takes place in real time so if you're
cooking and you're starting to burn it
it's going to burn in real time you like
okay five minutes it's going to burn and
you so there's a lot of things you have
to do you have to like pop it around you
have to add ingredients it's your life
right mm-hmm and it teaches you
techniques there's also a score at the
end the goal here the goal is to help
people who are maybe a little
overwhelmed by cooking to feel free to
experiment with things like expensive
ingredients virtually so that they can
take the more calculated risks in the
real kitchen that's true well so yeah
the thing is is like I can imagine this
would be very helpful for one of the
things i always get really worried about
is like let's say you want to make
lobster or something look at it some
more expensive item like or you want to
make some type of special fish or
whatever but it's really expensive yeah
yeah and it's like what if you mess it
up well I guess that's it I guess I
guess we're going to taco bell for
dinner yeah it's not like a macaroon
macaroni and cheese yeah it picks things
with multiple ingredients and they do
have multiple ingredients and recipes
from mundane things to like really
exotic things I don't know I went oh
nervous like cereal is the mundane one
necklace and here's how to make top
ramen that step this is dead level one
to your point there's certain things
like a souffle or whatever that that if
you know if you don't cook it right it
what you really have to be careful ya
know when it's in like even like the
simulation there it's like you could
burn some of your food if you're not
sure exactly either a how did how to
move the walk around or how to move your
pans around or or you know you don't
know how long to leave it on there you
don't know what you're done for like for
instance you know if you want to like
flip the food up yeah it's not about
lifting of the air it's about pulling
back so yeah so you learn technique
maybe you know maybe don't know if you
want to try this out if you have a
samsung gear vr it's already available
the demos already available you look for
cyber cook taster the most mobile
version of the app is called cyber cook
slice who so they're gonna do like a
little phone version at some point yes
so there you go you can learn how to how
to cook I like it Thank You VR thanks VR
um I gotta tell you about robear so
we've discussed this before Japan has
this aging population they're not having
there's not a lot of children being born
to replace those people so they're
having kind of a caretaker crisis for
the elder
in Japan and Japan's answer to this is
robots which i think is the greatest
thing ever so uh this is robear I know
we've seen other caretakers sort of
robots I love this video so much like he
just lift him up hey here we go um he's
adorable robear he's a freakin robot
with a cute little teddy bear face which
i think is the best this comes from a
research institute riken and they
decided i love how they decided on I
think that's like giving them a hug um I
love how they decided on what the face
should be they decided a polar bear cub
look was the best way to sort of show
off the robot strength geniality and
cleanliness so it was like if we make it
look like a polar bear cub we can show
people it's strong and it's clean and
it's friendly okay like I really like
that they absolutely want to
commercialize this rope yeah I'm not I'm
not as scared of a polar bear as i am
the other ones well they can think of
some dreary coca-cola classic or not so
big little polar bear cubs yeah that's
cute um this is actually the third
generation of robear and the nice thing
about this version of robear wow it is a
way lighter it's easier to maneuver it's
faster move smoother and hat is way more
precise and its predecessors so there
it's pretty much been improved all
across the board and it has a sensor in
it or a few sensors in it that kind of
let robear feel patients so it can tell
like it knows not to hurt them so if
it's tight like lifting some are holding
somebody and knows like pressure sensors
and different types of sensors to show
them like okay stop now like or you'll
hurt your patient so there's actual
sensors in there that'll help the robot
sort of feel it's it's patient nice yeah
pretty cool this is definitely one of
those mustn't like needed things so I
think so especially in Japan I mean this
is a really it's kind of a crisis so
it's kind of amazing that Japan's
answered like you and I would be like
okay well you know like any normal
person be like Oh we'll just bring in
some people from maybe China or you know
like let's bring handsome caretakers
from China or let's bring in caretakers
for another country like have them
immigrated in yeah robel robots your
pansies like that robots we got we got
this it's all good it's awesome I wish I
supposed to head out for different
animals but whatever
uh that actually brings to our hashtag
of the day TD robear this is your
hashtag of the day and we want you guys
to tell us what kind of caretaking robot
would you want and what's the one thing
you what's the weird like quirky comfort
thing that you would want it to do for
you on a daily basis like I would want
my robot to brush my hair every night
okay like it would be a nice like
comfort thing where I don't want to ask
like my husband to do it cuz that seems
weird and I'm not a five-year-old child
but I wasn't it does feel really nice of
your hairbrush like girls know like with
longer hair it feels really nice have
just someone brush your hair it's a nice
feeling so I would have a robot like
that it would make me feel nice and
squishy like happy I would have a robot
that stops me from doing stupid stuff
and gets me out of jams so like if I if
I man about to type something on
Facebook and it would just be like no no
don't kill that's stupid don't do it
it's mean or it's like you shouldn't
have that opinion or something like that
or that person does not look fat in that
picture don't type that I don't do those
things but I'm worried that some day
that maybe an inch or you need advice
about because I see a lot of stupid
things in my relationship just in
general I think we all do sometimes I
wanted to stop me from saying stupid
things you need to think robot where
you've you're seeing this online where
it says like is it thoughtful is it
helpful is it intelligent is it is it
whatever is it kind like it's like all
this like a list of things that spill
out think yeah you need the thing it's
like the anti jerk is what i need the
anti jerk robot the unzer they are the
internet like it here's to be that you
get home here you go Cale
congratulations you've been given the
under I like it I'm all too I'll take
three I need one for the internet one
for your girlfriend one for everybody
else yeah one for everybody else yes
perfect we're gonna take a quick break
we're gonna be right back with new
releases including our very special oh
yeah little little segment for you and
we also have your user feedback and of
course our phone tire for the day so
don't click wait it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show Kayla's thought
out a hundred percent thawed don't need
a jacket and accept the heart everything
else is good yes your cold dead heart
will never saw snore mille just yeah
that's re so we'll see well it's just
our cool thing it's Tuesday which means
we're gonna go through some new releases
oh so this is the other cool thing
alright yeah ok the cool thing is at the
end of this so we did we did w please
saying that you can't say it's gonna be
at the end of this it's gonna be
anything unless you release that's what
I'm saying okay so he'll diverse comes
out today for PlayStation 4 playstation
3 and playstation vita it's a really
interesting will kind of top-down
shooter kind of game you like fighting
in some aliens reminds me a little bit
of um like starship troopers kinda i
don't know i really i thought this
looked really cool and I have I was
really into this and I kind of want to
buy it like I think I might on ps4 but
it looks really neat and I'm into it
it's cyborgs and all sorts of Spacey
what kind of game is it a shooter yeah
well so it's almost like RTS almost it's
weird it's like kind of it so you see
like there's there are other people who
can play it's like multiplayer to you
can play with other people anyway
screamer I'd comes out for xbox one xbox
360 that's that's see that's that's a
hell divers that's the gameplay oh it's
also same like it's kind of weird it's
almost like Diablo it looks a little bit
like Diablo cuz it's at like three
quarter topic a top-down RPG type thing
kinda yeah so I just I thought this is
really cool like agonizing I'm into it
so um okay so screamer I'd comes out for
xbox one and xbox 360 I think the only
way for me to describe this is if you
loved rollercoaster tycoon but you
absolutely hate the park management
stuff and you just want to build roller
coasters and also demolish them you can
scream rides for you that's basically
what this game is you build roller
coasters that our death-defying and
terrifying is this is this actual game
player is this like a cinematic I think
this is a cinematic so you can make
stuff and then they have like these
crazy so I think that's more in game
okay so like SimCity where they're
showing you
the building process of everything but
yeah so you can have people ride it and
then like see you there you go just
flies right out yeah it looks like this
game is totally embracing you destroy
burning presale yeah I'm like a fun way
you're like your crash test dummies just
like destroy everything you've built
which just looks really fun make for
some pretty cool videos that come out of
it I think so it looks really fun um and
then in theaters this Friday chappie is
coming out neill blomkamp we're all
across in our fingers on this one guys
we don't know we don't know what do you
think he's had a head in a mess he's had
yeah district 9i love district nine yeah
a lot of district nine lesia did not
like a museum but you know to be fair he
actually did say like he he was like I
messed up elysium it like publicly about
a week ago I was like I messed it up
guys okay he used stronger language than
that but he was like yeah I totally
ruined Elysium okay so I don't know yeah
I'm really hoping that maybe he learned
his lessons only betcha I don't know
well well think about it yeah we're
hoping we're hoping because if he does
this even as well on this and we have
hope for the alien your alien yeah but
I'm excited I'm gonna see it yeah she's
happy I think I wanted to see you too so
our very last thing actually premieres
tomorrow night on CBS it's CSI cyber so
CSI cyber is obviously if you couldn't
tell from the name another franchise
show from the CSI procedural like drama
family so it's brand new it's got james
Van Der Beek Patricia Arquette Bow Wow I
mean just like a whole bunch of really
great actors and it is based on all of
the procedural so our story lines are
based on real-life cyber crime so this
woman we got to talk to she's in this
video that we're gonna show you in a
second but her name is Mary Aiken she's
a cyber psychologist and she was like
really interesting we talked to her for
how long like 20 minutes yeah she's like
one of the first cyber psychologist
because this is a brand new field that's
why it's so interesting is because cyber
crime they're just tapping into
everything that's happening that's
there's so many illegal things going on
on the internet and so we ended up
getting like mentally wrapped up in that
yeah and then we also were our complete
idiotic selves yeah there you go so what
this basically is we
to visit the set so check this out hey
guys Ashley and kale here on the set of
CSI cyber CBS's newest CSI show coming
out this spring because tomorrow Delia's
part of the CBS family we had a chance
to actually visit the set and talk to
some of the cast looks like these two
hacks are about to talk to some hackers
that's not even the right CSI
you want to intro this because of the
jackets same jacket the leather jacket
yes I go high-tech all right where's
Urkel james Van Der Beek we're gonna
talk a little bit about CSI cyber so
what can you tell us about this is basic
it's crime to point out when we started
the show they said you know we have CSI
new york and we've CSI las vegas now
we're not going to do a place we're
going to do CSI cyber command everywhere
I said for it but you are doing a place
you're doing cyberspace right anytime
you get ready to be a part of such a
franchise like this you have to be able
to get down with the lingo these scripts
these lines are next-level stuff the
most shocking thing about this one is
that a lot of times it's totally random
it's a group smelted gamer Julia
Allegheny great just gonna rage out okay
now I'm gonna keep asking me because
they see me doing this every day and I
found myself fixing their problems and
door decima could you by any chance give
us your mother's maiden name you're yeah
sure first dog your first name I give
you this kind of us for my social well
no I school mascot maybe a high school
mascot Rica that's all it's always those
are at those are all three one hundred
percent correct password for the
intersection between humans and
technology we deliver in size at the
interface what we call when humans and
technology collide my name is Charlie
Kunta i'm james van der beek on CSI
cyber from yours march forth and 10pm
and when I'm gonna working on this show
on watch
well sure you guys like it it's tomorrow
daily I'm watching tomorrow daily on
cnet to get all my news tech news I'm
watching tomorrow daily that's perfect
I've seen it I figure show so that was
our experience that were at the CSI
cyber set which I thought was great we
both agreed we weren't expecting james
Van Der Beek but he's so charming expect
him to know the show so well he watched
as he told me he watches it every day
every single second of every day when
he's not memorizing fighting crime and
memorizing lines it's not fighting
cybercrime eternal rhyme anyway so uh
yeah so basically we got to we got to
check that out thanks because we work
for CBS yeah and it was really cool and
so thank you to to all the folks over at
CSI cyber who actually allowed us onto
the set let us drags on to the set let's
see where else they'll send us yeah
what's up you might send us um so that
is a CSI cyber you can check it out it's
gonna be on tomorrow wednesday march
forth you can find it on your local CBS
affiliate and and thanks thanks again to
our our parent company CBS for letting
us DX i thought it was really cool
thanks mom and dad thanks mom and dad um
are you guys ready are you ready to talk
about everybody watching at home
everybody's thoughts his feelings james
Van Der Beek's watching so yeah let's
talk about right use a feedback hi James
I'm super bummed because you weren't
here yesterday and James actually sent
in some user feedback and so you missed
that but today I have user feedback from
other people okay maybe I mean you
weren't here so you'll never know you'll
never know um we asked everybody
yesterday we did a story about a
musician professor who is also a
musician and he was doing a duet with a
slime mold through like a bio-computer
okay so we asked everybody what their
weirdest do what would be like what's
the duet you want to hear and I said I
would want to hear Taylor Swift uh
featuring her stomach digesting a
sandwich oh cool I think that would be
like a fun thing yeah so everybody came
up with some really good ones hey-soos
wrote in and said how about 50 cent and
Pope Francis rapping about the Second
Vatican Council in Latin Pete hashtag p
0 p yeah that's a cool that's a cool
stage name
yo p uh Stacy wrote in and said justin
bieber and a beaver though I keep
imagining it sounding like the screaming
goats that's a really funny hashtag
screaming Bevers my question to you
Stacy is which one sounds like a
screaming goat the beaver or Bieber yes
exactly and then Neil wrote in and said
an epic rap battle between Kim
Kardashian and Paris Hilton about who is
the biggest waste of oxygen I thought
about that and I think if we made them
wrap long and hard enough they would run
out of air and die yeah obviously Paris
Hilton first apply the banners mission
accomplished um so what do you think
what would you want to hear what's it
what's the duet with the weird bizarre
duet that you need to hear um I want it
I want to see a Beyonce and I want to
see Beyonce and a pizza Beyonce no pizza
pizza being baked yeah thank you don't
say bubbling yes of the pit I like it
yeah I would want to see that that seems
like it but mostly for the pizza that
seems like an album that could win
beyoncé Grammy unlike yeah she wouldn't
lose the back yeah Kanye wouldn't have
to run up and interrupt give me that
pizza like uh huh you gotta like do that

but he was so excited about the hydrogen
explosion do not he was dying do not try
this at home ever unless you're like
jamie and adam from mythbusters maybe
just maybe even not even then maybe just
don't ever try that hey Ashley did you
know that our viewers had super powers
especially Alex are you know I know I
didn't know before but looks like he has
a little hydrogen bomb in his hands like
