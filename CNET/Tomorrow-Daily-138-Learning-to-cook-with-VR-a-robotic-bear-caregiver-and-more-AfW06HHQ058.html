first pair of 3d printed jet engines
don't know how to cook don't worry cuz
VR is here to save the day
oh love that and robear is Japan's
answer to taking care of old folks and I
don't mean taking care of like in a bad
way actually taken care of
tomorrow daily
greetings citizens to the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk-show in the known universe I'm your
co-host Ashley skele joining me hit the
kale sickle kale anonymous okay from
east coast east coast we got a problem
friend all right snowing me in canceled
my flights I don't like it when I'm back
back in Los Angeles it's good to see all
of you again
can you see you again instead of just a
pile of snow I thought we would actually
just put a snowman here for to freak you
out a little bit but that have more
charisma sure yeah but no we've got Syd
we've got something really really cool
today that we've been holding on to for
a long long time we do we do it's in the
second half of the show with new
releases but so before we do that though
let's talk about our headlines okay all
right so we gonna talk about 3d printed
jet engines we've seen actually 3d
printed rocket engines before but not 3d
printed jet engines so this comes from
Australia's Monash University okay and
this is a pair of 3d printed jet engines
they so what they did was that's it
right there they took an actual jet
engine that was sort of an auxilary
engine that was being used they took it
out of service and scanned it to make 3d
models of every single part every single
part and then what they did was they
made they made these like 3d printed
copies of each part in two layers and
then put them all together to make sure
that everything assembled and fit
correctly and then once they figured out
like okay everything is exactly perfect
now we can make the metal one so then
they went ahead and made metal replicas
of the old engine and and and there
that's what they ended up looking like
so these are like actual like they
potentially could be working jet engines
in the future we could 3d print but
they're not gonna try them out so they
can't try them out yet because obviously
jet engines you be in the sky be a
little bit dangerous so they said it'll
take a couple years before they can
actually start testing them because they
want to be really really sure of the
safety of them and it took about it so I
really like this part which is it took
about a year to do
and now after they had made these 3d
printed jet engines all of these
aerospace companies are like kind of
knocking at the door at Monash
University going like hey hey do you
think you could help us out maybe you
could make us some 3d printed parts
because this process takes weeks from
design to printing as opposed to an
actual machining process where you would
design things than machine them and go
back and machine them and go back and
machine them which could take months so
this is a much faster and less expensive
process so these aerospace companies are
very very interested in what they're
doing or imagine very curious all right
so it's like almost just in almost but
the fact that they were able to these
are the world-first like 3d printed jet
engine so and I think that the thing is
is they they test the engine like
they're they work but they can't like
test them I can't like put them in a
plane I'm like flying right and be very
expensive to test out and that would be
an expensive test so they're they're
working on testing them in terms of like
making sure that they function but it's
not a hundred percent testing in the way
that we would think okay okay think
stuff I thought that was cool that we're
like 3d printing jet engines now weird
okay so uh so you want me to go okay
tell me how to not burn my food so then
you'll know how to cook
elegant meals all by yourself that's
actually the end of the story so let me
let me start at the beginning so let's
assume you don't know how to cook
anything well some some people from a
company called oh my gut
Starship have created this new app this
new experience in virtual reality that
teaches you how to cook so video even
looks like me you'll learn how to cook
you learn how to cook through this this
app and then you bring it to the actual
to the actual table so this is a hyper
real cooking simulation you basic it's
basically made for the Samsung the
Samsung VR the gear yeah so basically
what's really cool about this simulation
is that it takes place in real time so
if you're cooking and you're starting to
burn it it's gonna burn in real time
you're like okay five minutes it's going
to
burn and and you so there's a lot of
things you have to do you have to like
pop it around you have to add
ingredients it's your life right mm-hmm
and it teaches you techniques there's
also a score at the end the goal here
the goal is to help people who are maybe
a little overwhelmed by cooking to feel
free to experiment with things like
expensive ingredients virtually so that
they can take the more calculated risks
in the real kitchen that's true well see
yeah the thing is is like I can imagine
this would be very helpful for one of
the things I always get really worried
about is like let's say you want to make
lobster or something you look at some
more expensive item like or you want to
make some type of special fish or
whatever but it's really expensive yeah
and it's like what if you mess it up
well I guess that's it I guess I guess
we're going to Taco Bell for dinner
yeah it's got like a macaroni macaroni
and cheese it picks things with multiple
ingredients and they do have multiple
ingredients and recipes from mundane
things to like really exotic things I
don't know I don't know if it's like
cereal is the mundane one listen here's
how to make Top Ramen that step this is
day level one to your point there's
certain things like a souffle or
whatever that that if you know if you
don't cook it right Italy you really
have to be careful ya know when it's and
like even like the simulation there it's
like you could burn some of your food if
you're not sure exactly either a how to
how to move the walk around or how to
move your pans around or or you know you
don't know how long to leave it on there
you don't know what your examine for
like for instance you know if you want
to like flip the food up it's not about
lifting of the air it's about pulling
back so yeah so you learn technique
maybe you know know if you want to try
this out if you have a Samsung gear VR
it's already available the demos already
available you'll look for cyber cook
taster the most mobile version of the
app is called cyber cook slice oh so
they're gonna do like a little foam
version at some point yes so there you
go you can learn how to how to cook I
like it Thank You VR thanks VR um I
gotta tell you about robear so we've
discussed this before japan has this
aging population they're not having
there's not a lot of children being born
to replace those people so they're
having kind of a caretaker crisis for
the elderly in Japan
and Japan's answer to this is robots
which i think is the greatest thing ever
so this is robear I know we've seen
other caretakers sort of robots I love
this video so much like he just lifts
him up Hey here you go
umm he's adorable robear he's a freaking
robot with a cute little teddy bear face
which i think is the best this comes
from Research Institute RIKEN and they
decided I love how they decided on its
like give him a hug um I love how they
decided on what the face should be they
decided a polar bear cub look was the
best way to sort of show off the robot
strength geniality and cleanliness so it
was like if we make it look like a polar
bear cub we could show people it's
strong and it's clean and it's friendly
okay like I really like that they
absolutely want to commercialize this
rope yeah I'm not I'm not as scared of a
polar bear as I am the other ones they
don't really coca-cola classic so the
little polar bear cubs yeah that's cute
um this is actually the third generation
of robear and the nice thing about this
version of robear wow it is way lighter
it's easier to maneuver it's faster move
smoother and hat is way more precise
than its predecessors so they're it's
pretty much been improved all across the
board and it has a sensor in it or such
a future in it that kind of let robear
feel patience so it can tell like it
knows not to hurt them so if it's tight
it's like lifting somewhere or holding
somebody and knows like pressure sensors
and different types of sensors to show
them like okay stop now like or you'll
hurt your patient so there's actual
sensors in there that'll help the robot
sort of feel it's its patient nice yeah
pretty cool this is definitely one of
those muscle like needed things so I
think so especially in Japan I mean this
is a really it's kind of a crisis so
it's kind of amazing that Japan's answer
like you and I would be like okay well
you know like any normal person be like
oh we'll just bring in some people from
maybe China or you know like let's
Branson caretakers from China or let's
bring in caretakers for another country
like have them emigrate in Romeo robots
your pansies like that robots we got we
got this it's all good it's awesome I
wish you might switch the head out for
different animals but whatever
uh that actually brings to our hashtag
of the day TD ro-bear this is your
hashtag of the day and we want you guys
to tell us what kind of caretaking robot
would you want and what's the one thing
you what's the weird like quirky comfort
thing that you would want it to do for
you on a daily basis like I would want
my robot to brush my hair every night
okay
like it would be a nice like comfort
thing where I don't want to ask like my
husband to do it cuz that seems weird
and I'm not a five-year-old child listen
it does feel really nice to have your
hairbrush like girls know like with
longer hair it feels really nice just
someone brush your hair it's a nice
feeling so I would have a robot like
that it would make me feel nice and
squishy like happy I would have a robot
that stops me from doing stupid stuff
and gets me out of jams so like if I if
I man about to type something on
Facebook and it would just be like no
that's stupid it's mean or it's like hey
you shouldn't have that opinion or
something like that or that person does
not look fat in that picture don't type
that I don't do those things but I'm
worried that someday that maybe an it or
you need advice around because I say a
lot of stupid things in my relationship
just in general I think we all do
sometimes I wanted to stop me from
saying stupid things you need to think
robot where you've you're seen this
online where it says like is it
thoughtful is it helpful is it
intelligent is it is it whatever is it
kind like it's like all this like a list
of things that spill out think yeah it's
like the anti jerk is what I need the
anti jerk robot the unsure kit here's to
be that you can hold here you go kale
congratulations even give the unsure I
like it I well - I'll take three I need
one for the internet one for your
girlfriend one for everybody else yeah
one for everybody else it's perfect
we're gonna take a quick break we're
gonna be right back with new releases
including our very special oh yeah a
little-little segment for you and we
also have your user feedback and of
course our phone tire for the day so
don't click away tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show Kailas thought
out 100% thawed jacket except the heart
everything else is good yes your cold
dead heart will never says normal is
this our cool thing it's Tuesday which
means we're gonna go through some new
releases oh so this is the other cool
thing all right yeah okay the cool thing
is at the end of this so that you can
say oh it's gonna be the end of this is
gonna be a mess
okay so Helldivers comes out today for
PlayStation 4 PlayStation 3 and
PlayStation Vita it's a really
interesting we'll kind of top-down
shooter kind of game you like fight
against some aliens it reminds me a
little bit of like Starship Troopers
kind of I don't know I really I thought
this looked really cool and I yeah I was
really into this and I kind of want to
buy it like I think I might on ps4 but
it looks really neat and I'm into it
it's cyborgs and all sorts of Spacey
what kind of game is it a shooter yeah
well so it's almost like a RTS so most
it's weird it's like kind of a so you
see like there's there are other people
who can play it's like multiplayer too
you can play with other people anyway
scream ride comes out for Xbox one Xbox
360 that's that see that's that's a
Helldivers that's the game playing oh so
so same like it's kinda weird it's
almost like Diablo it looks a little bit
like Diablo because it's that like 3/4
toppika top down RPG type thing kinda
yeah so I just I thought this was really
cool and I think I'm into it so um okay
so scream ride comes out for Xbox one
and Xbox 360 I think the only way for me
to describe this is if you loved
rollercoaster tycoon but you absolutely
hate the park management stuff and you
just want to build rollercoasters and
also demolish them you can scream rides
for you that's basically what this game
is you build rollercoasters that are
death-defying and terrifying is this is
this actual game player is this like a
cinematic I think this is a cinematic so
you can make stuff and then they have
like these crazy so I think that's more
in-game okay so like Sim City
you like the building process of
everything but yeah so you can have
people ride it and then like see there
you go just flies right yeah it looks
like this game is totally embracing you
destroy yeah fun way you like your crash
test dummies just like destroy
everything you've built which just looks
really fun make for some pretty cool
videos that come out of it I think so it
looks really fun um and then in theaters
this Friday chappie is coming out neill
blomkamp we're all across in our fingers
on this one guys we don't know we don't
know what do you think he's had a head
in a mess he's had yeah district 9 I
love district 9 yeah 9 Elysium did not
like a museum but you know to be fair he
actually did say like hehe was like I
messed up Elysium it's like publicly I
got a week ago he's like I messed it up
guys ok he used stronger language than
that but he was like yeah I totally
ruined Elysium ok so I don't know yeah
I'm really hoping that maybe he learned
his lessons and like I don't know well
think about it yeah we're hoping we're
hoping because if he does this even as
well on this and we have hope for the
alien alien but I'm excited I'm going to
see it yes happy I think I wanted to see
it too so our very last thing actually
premieres tomorrow night on CBS it's CSI
cyber
so CSI cyber is obviously if you
couldn't tell from the name another
franchise show from the CSI procedural
like drama family so it's brand-new it's
got james van der beek for sure sure are
ket bow-wow I mean just like a whole
bunch of really great actors and it is
based on all of the procedural sir
storylines are based on real-life
cybercrime so this woman we got to talk
to she's in this video that we're gonna
show you in a second but her name is
Mary Aiken she's a cyber psychologist
and she was like really interesting we
talked to refer how long like 20 minutes
yeah she's like one of the first cyber
psychologists because this is a brand
new field that's why it's so interesting
is because cybercrime they're just
tapping into everything that's happening
that's there's so many illegal things
going on on the internet and so we ended
up getting like mentally wrapped up in
that yeah and then we also were are
complete
idiotic selves yeah there you go so what
this basically is we got
to visit the set so check this out hey
guys Ashley you came here on the set of
CSI cyber CBS's newest CSI show coming
out this spring because tomorrow Delia's
part of the CBS family we had a chance
to actually visit the set and talk to
some of the cast looks like these two
hacks are about to talk to some hackers
that's not even the right CSI james van
der beek
we're gonna talk a little bit about CSI
cyber so what can you tell us about this
is basically I'm to point out when we
started the show they said you know we
have CSI in New York and we've CSI Las
Vegas now we're not going to do a place
we're going to do CSI Cyber Command
everywhere I said but you are doing a
place you're doing cyberspace right
anytime you get ready to be a part of
such a franchise like this you have to
be able to get down with the lingo of
these scripts these lines are next-level
stuff the most shocking thing about this
one is that a lot of times it's totally
random it's a gamer because they see me
doing this every day and I find myself
fixing their problems and doing that
could you by any chance give us your
mother's maiden name your first blog
your first name I give you the best for
my social school mascot maybe your high
school mascot are we good those are
those are all three 100% correct
passwords but the intersection between
humans and technology we deliver
at the interface what we call the humans
and technology collide my name is
Charlie Coon today i'm james van der
beek and CSI cyber from here's March 4th
at 10:00 p.m. and when I'm working on
this show I'm watching it's tomorrow
daily I'm watching tomorrow daily on
scene at my News News I'm watching
tomorrow daily that's perfect I've seen
it my favorite show
that was our experience over at the CSI
cyber set which I thought was great we
both agree we weren't expecting james
Van Der Beek
but he's so charming expect him to know
the show so well he watched as he told
me he watches it every day every single
second of every day when he's not
memorizing fighting crime and memorizing
lines it's not fighting cybercrime
eternal rhyme anyway so yeah so
basically we got to we got to check that
out thanks because we work for CBS yeah
and it was really cool and and so thank
you to to all the folks over at CSI
cyber who actually allowed us onto the
set let us drags on to the set let's see
where else they'll send us yeah it's off
might send us um so that is a CSI cyber
you can check it out it's gonna be on
tomorrow Wednesday March 4th you can
find it on your local CBS affiliate and
and thanks thanks again to our our
parent company CBS for letting us do X I
thought it was really cool thanks mom
and dad are you guys ready are you ready
to talk about everybody watching at home
everybody's thoughts or his feelings
james Van Der Beek's watching so yeah
let's talk about right use a feedback
hi James I'm super bummed because you
weren't here yesterday and James
actually sent in some user feedback and
so you missed that but today I have user
feedback from other people okay maybe I
mean you weren't here so you'll never
know
you'll never know we asked everybody
yesterday we did a story about a
musician professor who is also a
musician and he was doing a duet with a
slime mold through like a bio computer
okay so we asked everybody what their
weirdest duet would be like what's the
duet you want to hear and I said I would
want to hear Taylor Swift featuring her
stomach digesting a sandwich oh cool I
think that would be like a fun thing
yeah so everybody came up with some
really good ones hey soos wrote in and
said how about 50 cent and Pope Francis
rapping about the Second Vatican Council
in Latin Pete hashtag Bo Peep
that's a cool that's a cool stage name
Stacy wrote in and said Justin Bieber
and a beaver though I keep imagining it
sounding like the screaming goats
hashtag really funny
hashtag screaming Bevers my question to
you Stacy is which one sounds like a
screaming goat the beaver or Bieber yes
exactly and then Neil wrote in and said
an epic rap battle between Kim
Kardashian and Paris Hilton about who is
the biggest waste of oxygen I thought
about that and I think if we made them
rap long and hard enough they would run
out of air and die yeah obviously Paris
Hilton first but why the banners mission
accomplished so what do you think what
would you want to hear what's the what's
the duet what's the weird bizarre duet
that you need to hear I want it I want
to see Beyonce and I want to see Beyonce
and a pizza
Beyonce no pizza pizza being baked yeah
bubbling yes of the piece I like it yeah
I would want to see that that seems like
it but mostly for the pizza that seems
like an album that could win Beyonce
Grammy
unlike yes she wouldn't lose to Beck
yeah Kanye wouldn't have to run up and
interrupt give me that pizza like you
gotta like do that we got to get a fan
we got a fan blowing our hair like
cheese bless

day I'm gonna read you this pic this
caption the way that I read it in my
mind when I see it so are you ready yes
this is from Alex he took this with his
iPhone 4 and this is the caption hi this
is a hydrogen explosion in my hands
taken with an iPhone 4 thanks hope you
like it but he was so excited about the
hydrogen explosion do not do you must
die do not try this at home ever unless
you're like jamie and adam from
mythbusters maybe just maybe even not
even then maybe just don't ever try that
hey Ashley did you know that our viewers
had super powers especially Alex oh yeah
I know I didn't know before but it looks
like he has a little hydrogen bomb in
his hands like he can just control look
it's even affecting your hair this
channeling that hydrogen changed kales
hair and just like blew up your hair
like crazy I don't even know what
happened you're talking about this is
it's been sane doesn't happen yeah looks
really careful Alex please oh yeah be
really careful with that kind of stuff
you don't know you could hurt somebody
with that hydrogen power okay it looks
not different at all but if you want to
submit your phone tog Rafi to be
considered on the show to be featured
