this one here is the robot 3d printer
from the UK now not only that Rams are
also quite different from my normal
opening and that's because this printer
here is no normal 3d printer first it
has no control no buttons no touchscreen
and that means the only way you can use
it is to connect it to a computer you
cannot print from an SD card or a thumb
drive either secondly is prin Harrier
has two nozzle meaning it's a dual
extruder but unlike any dual extruder
printer on the market it can only print
for now from one source of filament
right here now that's quite confusing
because there's actually two filming in
tech number one and number two turns out
that's written for everything now one
nozzle is you to print by details and
the other is to print larger detail and
that means the printer here can bring a
lot faster compared to other printers
that use a single nozzle to print all
parts of a 3d object the printer here
use smart spool smart Rico it tells the
printer what type of filaments being
used and how much is left the good news
is when the filmin runs out you can
actually make you out spoon using third
party filaments in this case you will
lose the smart element but the printer
will still work during a print job the
printer pulled the plastic string form
the spoon melted using the printhead
here and then extrude onto the print
platform underneath to form the three
object the print platform can be pulled
out very easily if you want to clean it
the printer can automatically level the
platform but you do have to manually
calibrate the distance as well as the
level of material output now this is a
very tricky process mid trickier by the
wording of the instruction for example
over here say that you have to open the
nozzle so that the material can flow out
but flow can be anything really
is it like via tap or is it when you
want to apply eye drop and over here for
getting a distance between the nozzle
above and the bring platform below you
have to make sure that it's just enough
for a piece of paper to move around
freely now free can be understood quite
differently in different parts of the
world
for example folks in North Korea who
have no idea how to make it work
the thing is calibration is a very
important process that determine the
success and also the quality of the
print I learned that the hard way take a
look at this have to make this and a
bunch of this before I can make this now
it took me quite some time really a few
days to get things right and that means
you'll take you longer for now the robot
is a very interesting printer some are
going to love it for its fast print
speed and the level of customization
other might have a problem getting it up
and running and for all of us is very
expensive at $1,500 for more on this one
check out my full review a sitcom and to
answer the question a lot of you have
been asking me know this printer cannot
bring you a girlfriend or a boyfriend
but it can bring you this to make a
bunch of these and give out to random
people every day even gets up and I'm
not talking from experience and that's
because I'm don't know what this has
been the first look at the robotics 3d
printer hey take it you need it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
