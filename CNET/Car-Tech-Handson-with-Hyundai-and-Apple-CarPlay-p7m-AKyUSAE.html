on the floor at the 2014 New York Auto
Show behind the wheel of a 2015 Hyundai
Sonata and we're about to look at some
really cool dashboard tech that we've
seen previously in a Ferrari how's it
going Antoine so I'm here to talk about
apple carplay in the Hyundai Sonata I'm
really excited to to talk about this
feature today and let's go ahead and
dive right into it I'm so as you can see
here when we're in car play we see that
the that the interface is really really
familiar and it was designed to look
pretty much just like your iOS device so
that you don't even have to think about
what different features do you already
know you're already familiar with it we
choose the applications of phone music
maps and messages as well as some
third-party audio because this is what
makes the most sense to use while you're
inside of the vehicle and in addition to
that Siri is a super critical component
to most of all these apps because when
you're driving the voice commands that
Siri gives you or that is the ideal way
to be to be interacting with your device
while you're driving so let's get into
it let's go let's go ahead make a phone
call who would you like to call Brian
Delaney calling Ryan Delaney so we use
Siri to make a phone call and we'll go
through just normal we actually won't
have them pick up you still in a meeting
so we won't bug them but because all
this information is coming from your
cell phone all of the favorites of the
recents and all the contacts they just
come straight over from your phone we
can even do on the accelerated scrolling
to jump quickly to a name or just use
Siri like we like like we just did
addition to phone every great road trip
needs a needs a great soundtrack right
so music is a great way to handle this
in music we have not only our iTunes
radio but also all the music that would
be on your phone anyway
so within iTunes radio we can say oh we
play a little bit
um or we can go back and take a look at
you know your genius playlists your
standard playlists or your artists as
well so all of your music is there
available to you aside from music we
have to know where we're going so Maps
is a great way to figure out where we're
going and I love our version of maps in
car play not only do you get the very
familiar Apple Maps experience but also
you get real-time traffic see traffic's
a little rough in New York today what I
also love is all the work we've done and
trying to predict where you might be
going so right now it says this hotel
down here because I've been searching
for it a lot today and it says hey do
you want to be going here in addition to
that if we tap destinations this list
gets populated with things I've searched
for but also addresses from my calendar
and addresses pulled from my text
messages or from my emails as well so we
can see that this list is pretty full of
all sorts of different things text
messages and emails calendars and past
searches we want to look for something
brand new we can go ahead and just hit
Search where would you like to go find
some coffee
I found 12 coffee shops pretty close to
you so we can go ahead and tap on these
coffee places and start using our charm
turning route to cupcake caf√© turn
right onto 12th Avenue so passing by the
New York International Auto Show going
right up by the Hudson um so it's pretty
cool
in addition to maps messages are a great
way to stay in touch with people and
messages have sometimes been difficult
to do during certain situations and so
you can probably guess Siri makes a
really really big impact on being able
to use messages correctly to whom shall
I send miss Leslie Gill okay what do you
want to say till as we go let's get
lunch later your message to Leslie Gill
says let's get lunch later ready to send
it yeah send it okay I'll send it so we
do a whole text message interaction
using only voice viously some of our
past conversations but we'll never have
the text because we don't want you
driving and reading at the same time so
I'm noticing that like on the phone when
you use Siri usually get some sort of
text readout of what serious saying and
that's not here in the car because
presumably you want people to keep their
eyes on the road while they're doing
absolutely right um so that's messages
in addition we have some third-party
audio that we talked about at Geneva so
we had some stitcher and I heart and
Spotify have done some work and you can
see that they've brought their content
into the car play interface I personally
I love podcasts I listened to a lot of
podcasts while I'm while I'm on the road
I listened to a lot radio lab actually
and we can start one of
the more because there's sometimes being
replaced and taken up um and I'm really
excited about this carplay integration
in the Hyundai because of how well
integrated how well they work together
so we tap the Hyundai and we can pop out
to their UI we see even this is kind of
their home screen that we have the album
art coming from the podcast that we
already had you know we know that's
coming from apple carplay we see the the
text in the title we have the apple
carplay logo that hops right into the
apps right into the to the car play mode
we also have their navigation that's
that's hanging on the left and it really
gives the user a lot of choice and
freedom to use whichever system they
want the Apple system the Hyundai
navigation system
whichever way to go all right a couple
of questions sure is this if you say
that you give users a choice between
using the Apple system in the Hyundai
system would there be like an
implementation where you don't have
Hyundai's navigation and apple's carplay
is the primary one that you use um
sure so you would have to ask the
Hyundai guys about which actual trim
models support hardware will support car
play at the end of the year but but yeah
the car play can work irregardless of
whether or not there is an onboard
navigation system right and I'm also
noticing if I can pop back into the car
play interface that I'm presuming that
there's some sort of a system for
deciding which apps are Safety's in the
car and which one are how does that
certification process work so right now
the apps that are available through
carplay are fun music maps and messages
and the only third-party apps currently
our third-party audio video like this
makes a lot of sense to use in the car
sounds good so this car play system is
going to be available in cars coming
from Ferrari from Volvo and if the 2015
Hyundai Sonata it's actually it's pretty
interesting looking I like the way that
the interface just pretty much mirrors
what you've already see on an iPhone or
an iPad and it's very familiar well I've
been Antoine Goodwin and we are sitting
behind the wheel or in the front seat of
a 2015 Hyundai Sonata taking a look at
apple's carplay integration we're going
to see this in the Hyundai Sonata
sometime after its launch later this
year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
