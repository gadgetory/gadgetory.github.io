makeup like the pros
YouTube's got you covered with hundreds
of tutorials to choose from but
following along can be tricky and messy
Google Home Hub wants to help hey Google
show me at Sephora contouring video okay
showing Sephora contouring videos the
big draw
being that you can pause replay or skip
ahead without putting your phone or
laptop at risk now I'm gonna highlight
face the chin do you want to highlight
either side of the nose so four videos
are easy to follow and the Google Voice
assistant doesn't skip a beat but is it
worth your time while the partnership
puts a forest content front and center
you can choose to call up any tutorial
that's where the home hub really shines
and Google is hoping you'll notice
according to the tech giant there were
over 81 million how-to related searches
on YouTube in 2018 that's a lot of
traffic for now this feels like a
marketing strategy more than anything
else a way to say hey here did another
thing you can do with the Google home
hub that you can't do with the Amazon
echo shell you can watch youtube videos
on the echo show but without a built-in
player it's kind of a pain and most
important you won't get the voice
control with this Google's making a play
for a prime spot on your vanity and so
far at least when it comes to contouring
it does come in handy but because it
takes Google Assistant a couple of
seconds to do what you ask you'll end up
having to rewind a lot honestly though
you're probably doing a lot of that
anyway as force' Forest part in this
while the content is great I was a bit
disappointed with their skin care
assistant hey Google let me talk to
Sephora sure getting Sephora she's got
some tips to share different once every
day if you give her your zip code she
can find the closest store she can even
recommend products based on your skin
type but when I ask for more add the
first item to my shopping list she gets
a little confused sorry I don't
understand you I'm learning how to do
more if you're considering getting a
smart device for your home and you
follow a lot of tutorials this is a fun
feature you won't get with Amazon's
personal assistant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
