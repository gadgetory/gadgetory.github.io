look at the new 2012 Civic yet that's
exactly what it is one of the
best-selling cars in the world has
become perhaps rather unnoticeable let's
drive the 2012 Civic EXL with nav and
check the tech
an all-new Civic isn't like an all-new
Mustang
these are conservative car updates
include a less doughy face up front a
rump that appears to have been taken
from a Dodge Neon an economy mode with a
big green button a new 5 inch
information screen and standard
stability control to keep all of this
right-side up first thing you notice
when you get in the newly redesigned
Civic is they've taken that Honda
eyebrow - to a new level and I love it
right in the center a big digital
speedometer on the side of that 2
segmented bars it'll change color from
either deep blue if you're driving like
a pig Bluegreen if you're not too heavy
on the throttle and green when you're
driving like a Prius driver on the left
side as a segment gauge for fuel on the
right is your instantaneous mpg then
you've got this new thing on the right
which is a completely new idea for Honda
this big LCD info gauge that ties into
the left side controller here notice the
theme big and readable the display also
the controller this I button takes me
through I think a combination of three
screen positions this one here which is
date and time the next one which is
media and the third one which is kind of
everything fuel economy media date and
time all rolled into one that's the one
I like the same rocker lets you control
your media I go track to track or
station to station if I hold the button
down it seeks the station if I bump it
once it goes to my next preset it's all
very logical up and down gives you
volume and again notice how all the
graphics are very clear and easy to see
at a glance this is some nice interface
work and up here you've also got some of
your basic vehicle setup menus on the
right-hand side of the wheel is a
similar controller for cruise control
and then down here I've got my
hands-free calling and my voice command
button which still remains kind of
separate in a Honda which never made any
sense to me this also doesn't make any
sense why the hell we have a huge
tachometer in this car with an automatic
get rid of it there's got to be
something else we can put there maybe
not because everything I care about is
up on the eyebrow over here's the
economy button this car has either a
regular mode or push the green button
and you now I've got a wimpy car it
tailors back all of its driving
responses to encourage you to use less
fuel here's something else I don't care
about this head unit I'm tired of it
it's ancient
the
is completely now at odds with the rest
of the interface where Conda has done
this is the old school the kind of
crunchy graphics the little tiny fiddly
knobs the small typography on the
legends this is like 2005 and this is
2011
this doesn't belong here anymore the
navigation system is entirely
serviceable it's just not any fun to
deal with you do have live traffic here
into the little tiny information button
that'll show up as a list or on the map
same dopey controller Honda's head for
years but I think it's actually gotten
smaller this little mushroom cap thing
what's the point in a car your optical
disk is up here and among your audio
choices are that CD am/fm XM radio no HD
radio and I've also got my USB pigtail
down here auxilary analog is up here and
once they get a phone paired up I have
bluetooth streaming as well as
hands-free calling
audio output is straightforward 160 watt
amp that's it
no sobs no surround and no factory
choices for an upgrade not even on this
high trim car one transmission only on
this EXL high trim car it's this 5-speed
automatic relatively few gears for this
day and age no rear view camera standard
or optional on a Civic still no shifty
thing no gates no paddles no nonsense
this is not a race car it's been for
getting around ok in the engine bay it's
garden-variety classic Honda stuff which
is a good thing this car is about
getting around efficiently for like
300,000 miles this is the kind of motor
that doesn't a not overstressed 1.8
liter inline-4 sitting sidesaddle
driving the front wheels 140 horsepower
128 foot-pounds of torque gets this guy
up to 16 about nine point two seconds
which is not the point on a basic Civic
mpg is they deliver there at 28 City 39
highway 39 highway one shy of the magic
40 that's got to be killing them now
compare those mpg numbers to the
outgoing 2011 Civic and you'll see their
two to three miles per gallon better on
a car with an automatic nice but nothing
dramatic
okay let's drive our eminently civilized
Civic EXL again high trim car here but
most importantly a civic is the
transportation device the
athleticism of this car isn't the point
you get a civic SI for that now as I
mentioned the five-speed transmission
would appear to be a liability on paper
and the economy button here is one of
interest so let's see how those two work
together the nearest thing you've got to
a sport position is d3 if you do that
you kind of drop out of economy mode the
car automatically says you're not
driving Greenlee so I'll leave it in D
and I'll test it with and without this
economy thing on here's an on-ramp
it's gutless with economy off let's put
it on feels the same you have to say
this car feels more gutless than past
civics I've driven I wonder if it's
portable a master change in their tuning
to wring the most mpg out of the car
it's just got no snap at all
okay now at freeway speed with the
economy button on I definitely feel a
difference in tip in on the throttle if
I was trying to pick up some speed or
jump ahead into a lane it definitely
dials the response back from a car
that's already kind of responsible I
would definitely test drive a 5-speed
manual if you're amenable to that
the Civic is still a great everyday car
with a refined ride and solid
credentials but the Ford Focus the
Hyundai Elantra and even the stodgy
Corolla make the Civic less and less of
a standout a 2012 Civic EXL is going to
run you about twenty to seven out the
door with destination this is the high
trim model of course options on top of
that are basically nav or none that it
adds 1450 which is kind of cheap but not
cheap enough for that unit I'm going to
delete that and go aftermarket now your
other tech options a dealer installed
remote start for 500 bucks on by the way
the lower trim cars are available with a
5-speed manual this guy's automatical</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
