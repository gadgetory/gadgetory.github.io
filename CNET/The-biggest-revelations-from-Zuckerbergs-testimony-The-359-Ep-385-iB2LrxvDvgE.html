Ben Fox ribbon Facebook CEO Mark
Zuckerberg appeared before the House
Energy and Commerce Committee and well
he's got terse after a relatively easy
session before Senate duck face a lot
more pointed questions and some of those
seem to get under his skin okay what'd
you think I mean he didn't say anything
new though right he did the question
okay what it was the biggest revelation
was that Facebook tracks people who
aren't Facebook users now that's been
reported but it's never been explicitly
made clear by the company and Zuckerberg
I think it was kind of cornered and
finally admitted that yes they do track
people who aren't even Facebook users is
that through the well that can't be
through the facebook login because you
need a Facebook so if there are a lot of
different tools if there's something
called Facebook pixel is like one pixel
on various websites that actually have
they've got they're loaded with a whole
bunch of tracking tools then basically
can track what people are doing what
they're seeing and they're they're
basically creating what's known as a
shadow profile of folks who aren't on
Facebook in case you join Facebook they
actually already know you and the idea
of the shadow profile is being able to
kind of hook these shadow profiles to
their existing users and making it a lot
easier to or more accurate when they're
selling they're they're targeting their
ad targeting to sponsors I I will admit
that does sound creepy however there are
a lot of tracking companies and there
are a lot of cookies out there
absolutely not surprise me that Facebook
would do the same thing oh yeah look
it's I would you say the tone of the the
the whole testimony was a lot different
from day one day one it seemed a lot
more cordial the Senate Senators didn't
seem to be fully knowledgeable of
questions they were asking to punch
right and it seemed like with the house
the house clearly watched the Senate's
testimony and they learned their lesson
the questions were a lot more point a
lot more specific and there were times
where the clicker Brooke did I mean he
was not smiling at all the entire thing
he smiled a lot during day one day two
he was a lot more serious his answers
were a lot shorter he seemed a little
punchier granted he was sitting before
Congress for six hours the day before it
was about five hours
I'm second day so anyone would be a
little bit irritated it's a tough life
being a multi-billionaire all right so
Amazon's closed its reported one billion
dollar acquisition of smart doorbell
make it ring up and yet the exclusive
interview with Amazon's head devices and
the sea of ring talk about what they
would be said yeah unfortunately there
was a lot that was still TBD like
they're still waiting
now that the deal has actually closed
now all the difficult work actually gets
started where they evaluate their
portfolio I mean if anybody's been
paying attention Amazon now has three
different security cameras with three
different brands they're the Amazon
Cloud cam there's a ring and there's
also blink so they are gonna have to try
to figure out how they're actually going
to start working all those things
together but for the time being
ring is gonna remain an independent
company no employees are gonna lose
their jobs so that's a part the thing is
like that that integration is probably
something that people are interested in
if they're if they're a ring customer if
they're a Amazon or potential Amazon key
customer integration could be really
useful
yeah and that was probably the lousiest
bit that I got from the conversation
which was there was still a lot of
uncertainty as to what the plans are
gonna be after the deal closed after the
deal closes but Dave limp the head of
devices specifically mentioned that
they're gonna look very closely or
they're gonna look pretty closely into
integrating
Amazon key the in home delivery service
with rain alright Spotify and who are
opening up their popular $12.99 bundle
to everyone starting this summer that's
just a $5 discount over the if you'd
bought both plans together what do you
think is this enough to to entice you
and to join the Hulu and Spotify family
look it sounds like a really good deal
to me
unfortunately I'm already a user of both
at higher tiers so we have Spotify
family plan at $15 through my little
brother and I get the Hulu one with no
commercials so I pay more so
unfortunately how much is the
non-commercial one I think it's 11 or 12
dollars
I had the commercial one before and I
didn't like it as much and just to break
it down for you it's $9.99 for the
Spotify Premium account which is one
account for music can't share
and it's $7.99 for the commercial filled
Hulu version I would say this is a good
deal for a lot of people that might be
curious about either of those absolutely
this discount takes into effect in the
summer obviously this comes after
Spotify has gone public so there's a lot
of buzz lot momentum behind it yeah I'm
actually consider this I'm not a Hulu
customer right now but I'm a big Spotify
user and I'd be kind of interesting but
like you I would want a Spotify family
account right anyways if you might think
these are here check this out see net
and Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox ribbon
thanks listening remember when this show
was three minutes and 59 seconds a whole
minute a whole minute why do you think I
was doing this whole time re yeah we
gave like 20 seconds to the Hulu Spotify
we actually spend more time on who the
Spotify than I thought we would so I
mean look it is a good it's interesting
deal it's why we spent a little bit of
extra time I think we probably spell a
bit too much time I spent on $12 on that
egg timer to try to wrangle you guys $12
going over by like 12 minutes if it
wasn't for those things that's very true
that but get better actually we got work
out we got worse we're getting today was
way worse
we're actually bad we're about 5 to 10
seconds behind the last couple of
sessions and we spent a lot of time on
Facebook I mean it's a big story we need
to spend a little time on it I just like
to say that 359 doesn't necessarily mean
it's a four minute podcast it's more of
a philosophy it's a way of life is you
guys aren't even listening to me just
forget it I'm looking for questions all
right so let's let's let's talk Amazon
because we talked Facebook enough and
Amazon I mean you're the first to get
out the story the Amazon closed that
position and you did get the exclusive
interview with the Amazon head of
devices Dave lip so I mean talking about
like is this enough to entice people you
think like this integration and what
would that integration look like between
Amazon key and say the board you want to
another another element this was also an
Uzi bed from the conversation this was
also in their press release they dropped
the price on the original ring doorbell
to $100 the price was roughly $150
before an amaz
and 179 dollars on ring.com the ring CEO
specifically mentioned that this is a
great opportunity to introduce this type
of security feature to more people
broader demographic and I realized when
ring the moment ring made it bake was
when my parents installed one really
yeah they've got they've got a ring
system in their house they're very happy
with it they're very proud of it there's
uh they're in an LA right they are is
somewhere in Southern California yes
okay sorry
there was an LAPD pilot program
specifically in the LA area right that
it looked at two different neighborhoods
one of them they installed ring
doorbells so that's why I asked you the
other one they didn't and the amount of
burglaries dropped in the neighborhood
with the ring doorbells by fifty five
percent now is it just a matter of like
thieves come in and they sort of see
this smart doorbell they're like oh this
is not worth my trouble I mean like
there's a video camera pointing at your
front like outside at your front door
that is certainly a deterrent and I
remember the ring CEO specifically
mentioned I wish I had a but like I
asked him a follow-up about this but he
said that like apparently burglars and
robbers do ring the doorbell so that
makes sense though like they want to see
if there's someone home right right yeah
yeah so if you ring the doorbell and you
activate the video camera right you just
go like run for it like oh geez like I
got I got caught I'm also wondering if
like they're savvy enough to recognize
that it's a ring doorbell I get a smart
doorbell as opposed like the standard
one yeah I mean like I think it looks
like it has a camera on it they're not
yeah that's true yeah whereas with like
a lot of other smart home tech that's
inside your house you can and they're
trying to like hide that it's a camera
that's Allah grant you with these it's
like it's part of the security feature
where they want people to know they're
being watched right so that's
interesting so your parents like it oh
yeah they love it like you know there's
smartphone they like show me like a
check it out see the front of my do of
my house
I mean like I wouldn't get one of these
for a hundred bucks I don't know how so
I'm kind of a cheapo though $150
so hundred dollars I'm like sure I mean
it's a third cheaper
pretty good deal yeah not bad several
folks in the chat are agreeing with you
they say hundred bucks is a better price
but even some of them still think it's
kind of a ripoff yeah really is it and
also I have to pay attention to like
whether there's a cloud subscription
there I think there is but it's not
acquired similar to nest right like you
just do the camera thing you don't have
to pay for the monthly like storage
executives it's the same thing yeah
Amazon Cloud cam - yeah and we'll see if
some of that changes the whole idea with
Amazon is they did with ring like they
did with Whole Foods where they
selectively lower prices to say hey
we're the low price guys so I would
expect that they would probably try to
do more of this kind of thing to get
people excited and interested about
these companies but I don't really know
why they would have all these different
brands so I do wonder if they're gonna
start sunsetting some of them or trade
like like surge and combine them or
merge them and you know a conversation
with a head of devices he was like we're
gonna start looking at that that was as
far as he was willing to go and he said
I don't know if we're gonna do that or
not they just launched a new sub brand
called Camus's on that's like a bad porn
site or something okay I was thinking
camels no I was thinking like outlet
mall hands-on shops there's I don't know
ecommerce for camels but I I think
differently than you I think on behalf
of the internet from Matthew Dasher I'm
wondering how Amazon is going to
integrate ring I have a ring but I do
not do not want to be a key customer no
okay they're gonna be a lot of opt out
scenarios available to us as customer I
don't yeah I don't think it's gonna be
op de it's definitely me opt in I mean I
don't even know if it's gonna work with
existing customers right like how would
they work at this point like I said he
did Dave lamp said where we're gonna
look closely at this we're gonna look
pretty closely I did there is no
confirmation whether this is or isn't
going to happen but it seems pretty
clear that this is this is a good idea
for Amazon key yeah so they would
probably add it at some point but I
would say if you're an existing customer
like it's pretty good to be divorced
it's a good bet that yeah it won't be
forced on you you want all of a sudden
like be an automatic Amazon key customer
if you're happy with your ring service
we will ring product I think you li
you'll be fine with the way it is yeah
what might be interesting too is that
because ring already has a camera
attached to it I wonder if you wouldn't
need an additional Amazon Cloud cam
inside your home but that's the way that
Amazon key works where you have a smart
door lock and the cloud cam yeah it's
pointing at the door and that's why
that's how the delivery person is able
to open your door you see everything
that's going on from inside the house
they slide the package in and then right
was in store so that I mean the ring cam
could replace the the other camera maybe
maybe or it's just an additional layer
of security now you got two cameras
looking at the delivery person little
redundant I don't know I mean we live in
a cam world man yeah see not to get too
soapboxing but at what point do we spend
so much time watching each other and
tracking each other that there's nothing
left to watch or track yeah maybe we'll
get the cameras to watch the other
cameras is that camera functioning
correctly all right
taking another question from Josh boy to
this time is Amazon planning on
integrating ring into the echo and Fire
TV like the nest doorbell works with
Google home and chromecast so some of
those integrations already exists there
is an Alexa integration with several
ring products and you can check those
out through your Alexa app so you you
can actually like with the ring doorbell
for instance if you have a fire TV stick
you you can see the feed on your on your
television I believe so cool I'm I'm not
a ring customer so I haven't tried it
personally but you can go on Sina comm
to find out more of this stuff a nice
plug nice plug sure storm king asks
isn't a huge risk to give Amazon access
to your home through the key system what
about someone hacking your lock now I'd
say this from my perspective isn't any
worse than giving a friend a spare key
you know I grew up in a small town and
any we knew our UPS drivers and if we
wanted to we'd be like we left the door
unlocked you mean I would say it is
definitely worse than offering the spare
key it's like it's analog right like one
key Turkey as opposed to a hacker coming
like a knowledgeable hacker yeah but
anybody can pick a lock period not
anybody you can learn how it's not that
hard I guess or you could break a window
I mean like if we really want to if
somebody wants to get into your home
they're gonna get into your well look if
they pick a lot I can't wait to not
sleep tonight but if you nobody you pick
a lock and say there's alarm system or
there's a camera then you've got other
troubles if you're a hacker and all this
stuff is connected I mean theoretical
worst-case scenarios that can come and
disable everything open the door from
the door disable all the cameras shut
down the alarm system cuz it's all
supposed to connected and on the web you
just make a waltz right in and steal
everything you that would be a pretty
sophisticated it would it would
definitely be but I'm just saying like
theoretically that could happen because
everything is connected I would say
though that the locks themselves are
probably priority security wise as far
as Rd goes for those products you would
you and your biggest problem not really
it depends on who you're working with I
mean yeah there are a number of like
name-brand
companies that make smart lock like
August like that that I'm sure put a lot
more resources in security but if you
get like a cheapy smart door lock and
that's some people are gonna do it do
not get one oh yeah do not get that but
some people will those are susceptible
hacks companies are not not all
companies focus on security true and it
that's sort of the biggest problem
that's why I'm a little I'm always a
little bit nervous when it comes to
adopting a smart home tech and being
really extra choosy about which
companies I work with I mean you know
it's always a case of you get what you
pay for if you happen to get a deadbolt
lock your doors gonna stay more secure
than if you get a hook latch lock it's
you gotta invest smartly I'd say a
bigger risk is that Trojan horse element
where if something is dumb on your smart
home you can essentially lead a back
door for somebody who's sneaking through
the stinkin coffeemaker to get access to
your lock but have some of the locks for
your like computers or something if it's
all Wi-Fi connected going back to the
original question though about like a
lot of skepticism around Amazon key
that's bit that's existed from the
get-go and Amazon key and look it may
eventually prove to be a bridge too far
for people it's really up to consumers
to decide whether they like or prefer
and it's having this level of
convenience so pretty
yeah and it's clearly a balance yeah as
far as whether you trust Amazon enough
to do this a lot of people have mocked
it and it's still it's still like we'll
see what happens Amazon has definitely
presented itself as being very serious
about it they think they can change
people's minds about it and we'll see if
they can Lost Legacy asks I know hold on
sorry I read that wrong excuse me that's
huge egg huge egg asks is Amazon
accepting liability for their locks or
are they passing that off to the
end-user
they don't actually make smart door
locks they have third-party companies
like Yale oddest well they sell August
but Amazon key doesn't have any August
locks okay I think it's it's Yale and
and one other company I'm not thinking
of so there's no those companies that
accept a liability it's to a certain
extent but like I I don't I don't know
off the top of my head what the terms
and conditions of a Yale smart lock are
you know it's the same thing as like an
autonomous car is that when it gets in
an accident as a Tesla's fault that's
something that people are like talking
about and trying to work out legally
right now so if you got a small wow that
would we saw that was a goober uber I
know they're not the smart car maker
right and luckily with door locks yeah
door locks have existed for a very long
time yep and you know it's like his
deadbolt liable if like there was there
was a faulty mechanism or something and
like everybody was yeah yeah I don't
know you know like there are a lot of
people that sue a lot of company storm
King says I'm old fashioned I think I'm
gonna keep my regular lock and key for
now until this idea is more fully
realized I think I sympathize with you
yeah yeah I'm fine for now there's
something alluring about the concept of
having that because I've lost my keys
before and it can be me to ever stay it
happened to me this week I forgot my
keys and my wife was busy didn't check
her phone I was stuck outside my
apartment in like half an hour and the
cold cuz I didn't have a key I would
love to just pop in my smart phone then
just like walk down the street go to
Starbucks or something like the rest of
us no I was like oh I was waiting for
her to like get the text message or like
my super to come down
the super finally did come down get me
but yeah well so it sounds like from the
chat people aren't as into the smart
door locks but I'm curious to hear
whether people are interested in the
smart doorbells not just this is a point
of convenience sure like who's at the
door but also the ring folks mmm excuse
me specifically say that this is
something that can reduce crime in
neighborhoods and make ya safer I mean I
think that's why my parents got it there
was a wave of robberies in the
burglaries in the neighborhood and I
think that's what kind of motivated them
to get that mm-hmm definitely gave them
more of a sense of sure especially
because they travel a lot and so being
able to kind of check in on on the house
from the front definitely gave them more
confidence I think that's why that it
kind of breeches that it goes from
that's how you get from you know tech
enthusiasts to that mainstream audience
right you sell them on a benefit that
they can that's universally understood
intangible and tangible right yeah this
come for a peace of mind security those
are all things that people can
immediately embrace it's not just like
oh it's it's cool and techy and I can
check it on my phone like people don't
care about that and it's not well
Millennials do it's not yes to tech
savvy people mainstream customers don't
care as much but when you say oh
actually it's gonna help you security
break lowers the odds that your house
will get burglarized then yeah exactly
it's also not a privacy concern because
if Amazon or someone else where to get
the feed of like just the camera
pointing outside your house who cares
right like that's not really that
interesting it's totally different than
those baby monitors where like some
creep on the Internet is able to like
look at your kid's room yeah there's
good reason why people would be really
frustrated or you know right hours
facing camera it's a tough one to sell
but that does seem to be some a
wholesome consideration behind it like
there's a positive mission statement
it's just tricky to integrate that one
into our lives because it's risky it's
risky I I just I wanted to point out I
liked this comment from Carlos Medina or
Martinez the addresses of what about a
smart door lock with face ID
oh geez yeah after all this Zuckerberg
testimony about like all the racial
recognition and the user data that they
pull I mean it sounds like a good idea I
feel like I saw that in my mirror no no
like you know like a Microsoft or an
Intel conference oh hey I mean that
Cheryl kind of makes sense right like
there are definitely a lot of security
implications with that and vulnerability
issues but just don't know the basic
principle of like your door recognizes
you and open unlocks for you that's kind
of cool mm-hmm I mean like the voice I
mean if it's things like the iPhone 10
face come on
recognize me eyes open here we go yeah
face paint you came back from the game
and actually no that's that's not fair I
phoned iPhone 10 actually fails on me
whenever I'm waking up and like I'm in
bed and I like look at my phone it
doesn't recognize me I don't know why it
won't recognize me when I'm laying down
in my bed but when I get up it's almost
like oh it's you all right cool it's the
pillow yeah let's move on to Hulu
Netflix just sounded like a great idea
to me I would have definitely been into
this if I was still in college and
really on a budget
heck I'm into it now because I like
saving money well the key right you
don't have to be a college to anymore
we're all very true yes
you know from Michael Brown if we stack
up the audio and video sub-packages
subscription packages which do you think
is better bang for your buck the Google
YouTube red package Spotify Hulu or
Apple music which also does include
video as part of their service but the
video options for Apple the apples
something great right like it's fairly
limited planet of the apps yeah so
that's it that's it right I mean that's
hard to say cuz I'm not Hulu I don't
watch i watch Hulu you can watch a lot
of the newer shows like Roseanne was was
live and then it shows up on Hulu
pretty quickly oh right right right
immediately afterwards so a lot of those
shows like Rick and Morty Roseanne The
Simpsons well Rick and Morty's on there
yeah reckon we're right and I wanted to
watch Handmaid's Tale for a while then I
watched it yeah that's why I got Hulu
to begin with but I already have we have
Amazon Prime we have Netflix it's even
sometimes it's not even about cost it's
about time like I don't have time to
watch all these different programs yeah
I would probably say this package is the
best one that I've seen and I think
YouTube red is still trying to get off
the ground Apple music is pretty light
on video to you as you said so if you're
interested in the video aspect and like
also Spotify has basically all the music
that you want you could probably talk
about this yeah I feel like the spotify
aspect is more appealing to me then cuz
like I have other sources for video but
I use I mean I use a free cheer for
Spotify but I would love the premium
tier because I do go off why every once
in a while I hate commercials I hate
skipping through those things and being
able to control my playlists staefel
Roger the commercials keep us alive we
love we love we love commercials alright
are we gonna start charging us a
subscription for the 3:59 no no our
service will always be free some
component of our podcast will always be
free okay we're almost out of time and
we do have to talk about Facebook a
little bit I just broke a couple of
comments yeah yeah okay Michael Brown
the biggest revelation is that our
Congress knows nothing about the tech
industry and how free software like
Facebook works I agree 100 and oh look
so I would say that that's generally
that was generally the case for the
Senate I think the house did a lot
better the questions were a lot more
pointed duck was pushing back a lot less
because I think he understood that the
representatives the congressmen seemed
to be a lot more prepared that second
day like the questions definitely caught
him a bit cornered him a bit more than
Don day one so I have to give them
credit rallies look they're not they're
not supposed to be technical
technologically savvy right they're
supposed to represent but they should at
least stay awake when they're in the
seat yes did you see the one I enjoy I
did Oh
crap yeah well granite is sitting there
for like five hours that probably falls
he's been sitting there for 300 years
[Laughter]
look so okay random Congress sleeping
congressman aside I thought they did a
much better job on the second day and
look they're supposed to be
representative of the average person I
guess and so the average person isn't
supposed to be that technically savvy
their collective average age is
somewhere in the million yeah that's
that's true I think actually it's
somewhere like in the 60s this is
important which is not average no it's
not regardless of whether they did a
better job one day or the other asking
questions what do you see as the next
steps in this process and yeah is there
actually gonna be regulation I mean it's
my skeptical that would ever happen no I
think there will be regulation and after
hearing the the testimony I'm almost
certain there will be some form of
regulation that's the key is what that
regulation is gonna look like is it seem
like Zuckerberg I mean he's under a lot
of pressure
Zuckerberg seems then really independent
seems really open to regulation but the
thing of it is is if it's gonna be
regulation on his terms
cuz the thing of it is it's actually in
some ways advantageous for him to be in
the driver's seat dictating what the
regulation is gonna look like cuz it's
gonna it's gonna benefit Facebook right
of course competitively clamps down on
Facebook's own abilities it's gonna be a
lot worse for the next Facebook and the
next startup that tries to become
Facebook and that's that's another
potential concern as you're writing
these regulations like how do you how do
you do it without stifling the next big
startup right the next big Harvard
dropout was kid it's not from Sir enjoy
I must say the hearing and some of the
questions and it made me doubt the basic
technical competence of the members of
Congress rather than sucks I think Brian
here showing your hand too much look
obviously Zack is way smarter than
anyone else in that room and on day one
he definitely show
and he's yeah he's definitely more
technically savvy than these people
these people are not supposed to be
technically savvy but they're supposed
to be competent and a lawyer I don't
know but to my my point is I think the
point that the congressman were trying
to make was especially when it comes to
terms of services and communicating what
you're giving up to Facebook I don't
think you need to be technically savvy
to do that that's I think that was a
point a lot of the congressmen were
trying to make is some of these the day
that you're giving up the way they're
communicating it to you is not done in a
way that a normal person would be able
to understand and you know it was a
senator Kenny said like your Terms of
Service suck yeah right that was great
yeah that was I mean buddy he's not
technically savvy at all but it cuts to
the the point and the point was that
it's not clear what any of us are giving
up to Facebook and that should change
here's another thing though from just
from another like my very personal
perspective very biased perspective is
that their their views on it they've had
enough time to become aware right this
isn't new technology right Facebook sit
around for 13 14 years at this point
they should at least have a basic
understanding of it and they shouldn't
need to go to school today congressman
or just general the general public the
general public which and by and large
the general public does get it obviously
so many of us are using I don't think
they get no no not not the the core
things that we're discovering are wrong
with the infrastructure I'm talking
about the basic functionality and
purpose of Facebook and how and you
could argue there's a lot of
subjectivity to the purpose
quote-unquote yeah I would totally
disagree people and and I think the
congressman sort of proved that point
they kept referring to the users as
people who use Facebook as a customer
they're not the custom customer know
where the product the customer is the
advertiser and that is that's still a
point that most people get lost on I'll
give you that
it is a difficult thing to grasp right
but their inability to develop
comprehension or what seemed to be lack
of desire to try made me cautious about
what kind of regulations they would
impose on the future because they just
seem to be crusty old stuck in their
ways which is which is probably concerns
Facebook because the last thing they
want are draconian oh serves everyone
under the age of seven I don't think it
concerns Facebook I think Facebook looks
at that and they're like salivating
because they've got an army of lawyers
and and and lobbyists who will gladly
write the laws for them like hey do you
guys need some help what this seems like
you're not fully technically savvy we
got a whole bunch of experts I'll come
in and help write that rule for you
yikes so I don't know you know that's
either City is a little bit a little bit
dark so who knows but I do think
regulation there's gonna be something
people are gonna try I mean all we see
there's the honest ads act already which
which affects social media but isn't
that politically driven yeah it's
definitely you know there I think there
needs to be and there was talk about a
the idea of a data privacy agency and
that might be an interesting thing I
don't even know how that would that
would work I mean that's definitely more
as a consumer that sounds interesting to
me for sure yeah I mean I don't know
again I don't know how organ who would
actually run that and how the who'd like
how that would be who'd housed that
basically which department that would
fall under but there are definitely a
lot of interesting ideas mmm I guess I'm
just salty because the essentially was
forced to watch the entire thing and
just got progressively more and more
frustrated and bored
it was long it was long and that's by
far
nowhere near the longest testimony we've
ever seen in front of the Senate in
history but right it's very drunk well
no the Senate one was unusually long it
was almost as tough an hour - longer
than normal because it was a joint
session its room so there was twice as
many senators all getting four minutes
of questions it makes you almost feel
bad for the robot Zuckerberg well he had
his nice seat cushion it seem like he's
comfy yeah and they avoid them up
beforehand yeah you know with like a
little tin can the best was it the best
meme I saw there was one where someone
photoshopped him to look like that
wasn't a Photoshop and it was the other
one where they referred to as his seat
cushion as his wireless charging path I
thought that was pretty good too now if
we can just get in an Orange County
chopper this probably already exists
like that meme connected with Zuckerberg
that would just be
perfect I don't know what that would
look like how timely have you been
staying up on the old the mean trends
now coaching you after hours yeah yes I
was otherwise I would have like
mentioned rickroll or something yeah
right
although Westworld just rickrolling
everyone right I didn't say that
see this is the level of my like
knowledge like completely drop all right
