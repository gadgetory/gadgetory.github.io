advanced pokemon techniques so let's say
you want to go beyond collecting and you
want to take on Jim's easily what are
some of the best ways to actually power
up the team because the game plays a lot
different than it did on gameboy and es
where you caught a Pokemon you raised it
you got may be trained it with some
machines in this case it's more like
almost like trading cards yeah it's a
train it right you have to train it at a
gym you don't you don't train the
Pokemon though I mean you're just
training up your own level and you're
making the gym levels higher to be
honest this game is that's my little
monsters at all no oh that seems weird
no it's really weird it's more like
you're yet another reason why I don't go
to gym kind of like it's kind of
remember when the Americans in the Wild
West they hunted down all the Buffalo
and just are enjoying the mall and took
their skin and their skulls and spit
piled up the skulls and a big piles kind
of like that because your objective here
is to catch as many as possible and then
you need to turn them into candy in
order to power up your Pokemon you have
to turn these Pokemon into candy so you
take them to the professor and you
transfer them transfer them and we
doesn't exactly describe what happens
when you transfer them but you put in a
Pokemon and out comes a piece of pokemon
candy I think he grinds them and then
and then you feed that candy to the the
other Pokemon of the same time so it's
definitely got this auto cannibalism
thing going on here um and then and then
after you've powered them up to a
certain degree you can evolve them or
you can evolve them then power them up
and they could become a larger you know
monster ish in a much more powerful
version of the same Pokemon should I
need a lot more can they basically taken
on every single power that their
relatives add and ate them in the form
of candy but the weird thing is you
can't that if you find the big powerful
Pokemon in the wild you trade them in
for the same amount of candidate as the
small little weak ones so it's kind of
like you're you're you're thinning out
the herd by killing all the week Buffalo
darwin is a man in a way if you have a
little fitness bro if you have a Pidgey
in a pidgeotto in the same polka stop
you're better off just getting the
Pidgey and you much better balls it's
easier to catch the Pidgey you get the
same amount of candidate experience for
it and when you get that pitching into
your inventory it's easier to evolve the
pitchi because it only takes one you
know 12 candies to evolve a Pidgey
whereas it takes 25 or 50 me 50 I think
to turn a pidgeotto into a pidgeot so
it's you're better off just thinning out
the weak parts of the herd the other
night my pilgrim I just had a head of a
bunch of Pokemon ready to evolve and I
dropped one of the lucky eggs and just
hit evolve and all of them because I
guess then yet double XP yeah it's sort
of weird cuz it's like I'm growing all
these pokemon but I have no intention of
keeping eight of them and they're all
getting transferred after their being
evolved yeah I know that the fastest way
to level up in the game is to just get
rid sever your emotional connection to
any of these little monsters but I've
named them cracka lucky some of them
like little Kim evolve them and cut them
off and involved them and grind them and
carry the rear end them up and carry the
nickname to the new pokemon that you're
actually keeping for as long as you want
and the reason you do this the reason
you do this is because you're trying to
boost your own trainer level all every
time you evolve one of these Pokemon you
get 500 experience points you got a
thousand if you crack the lucky I
because lucky egg doubles all your
experience points so but the lucky only
lasts 30 minutes so in that interval you
need to grunt you need to evolve and
grind down as many pokemon as possible
to boost your trainer level and the
reason you do that is as your trainer
level goes up you automatically find
stronger and stronger Pokemon so that's
the best way to advance the game is just
to do that
