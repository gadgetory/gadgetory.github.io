Conte and it's time to get loaded LG
showed off the biggest 3d TV measuring
in at 84 inches they're calling this a
UHD TV or ultra high-definition it has a
pixel resolution of 3840 x 2160 which is
four times higher than standard def TVs
LG did not discuss plans to bring this
to market so don't look for this at your
local walmart the Amazon Kindle won't be
getting a touchscreen anytime soon
amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said that a color
touchscreen capability is still a long
ways out we had thought that maybe the
Kindle would get a full-on update and
compete with the ipad but doesn't look
like it the next version of rock band
may have keyboards a demo for rock band
green day had an image that features a
keyboard logo so if that's indicative of
anything brush up on your 80s tunes
where keyboard solos get the attention
they deserve and you can now get TiVo on
something other than tebow Best Buy
announced that it would bring tivo
software into its line of insignia tvs
it isn't DVR functionality though this
is tebow software to search content but
not record it you still would need a
separate DVR for that those are your
headlines for now but Facebook is
holding a press conference this morning
where it will announce updated privacy
settings will bring you that news in the
afternoon thank you for watching I'm
Natali del Conte the scene at TV and you
just unloaded
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
