and this is the creative soundblaster
jam a $50 bluetooth headphone that's
lightweight relatively comfortable to
wear and sounds good particularly for
its modest price point until recently it
was hard to find a bluetooth headphone
that sounded decent for less than $100
but that's changing as higher-grade
chips and components get cheaper the
sound blaster is by no means high-end
and in fact looks a little like the
headphones that came with the walkman
back in the 80s but there's something
endearing about it's throwback design
and as I said it's lightweight and
should fit most people pretty well
though not everybody likes an on-ear
design and there is no padding on the
top of the headband which may bother
some people they also don't fold up in
any way and while they seem sturdy
enough I can't tell you how well they'll
hold up over time as far as features go
there's a pause play button that doubles
as an answer end button for cell phone
calls the requisite volume controls are
onboard and when you hold those buttons
down they turn into transport controls
allowing you to advanced tracks forward
and back you also get a bass boost
button that does just that boost the
bass a little while sacrificing a little
clarity last but not least there's NFC
tap to pair technology for devices like
Samsung's Galaxy phones that support it
I didn't count err some bluetooth
hiccups and I also didn't think this
headphone works great as a headset for
calls caller said they heard a lot of
background noise when I talked and my
voice sounded a little recessed but on
the plus side the headphones battery
life is good at 12 hours and a headphone
sounds quite good with relatively clean
dynamic sound for Bluetooth bass was
also strong even without engaging the
bass boost button which I didn't think
added much in all this is a strong
budget bluetooth headphone but it isn't
without a few weaknesses I suppose you
can't expect perfection for 50 bucks but
you could always dream I'm David Carr
noise and that's the creative Sound
Blaster Jam thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
