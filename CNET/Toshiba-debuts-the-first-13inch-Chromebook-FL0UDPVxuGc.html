toshiba's first entry in the
ever-growing Chromebook market
innocently call the toshiba throne book
and it is interesting because it is the
first 13 inch pro book that we see there
a lot of 11 inch ones a lot of 14 inch
ones but I think 13 inches it's really
the optimal size if you want to mix
productivity and portability it's big
enough that you can work on it you know
pretty much all day long but it's small
enough that you can carry it around in
your in your shoulder bag it's not every
day at least several days a week and
when you want to take a Chromebook which
is reliant on that Chrome operating
system really needs to be online all the
time and use it for productivity you
want something that you can still you
know go to the coffee shop get on the
Wi-Fi there you know take to the airport
lounge and use it there it's 279 which
is right around what Chromebooks should
be you know if it's a little bit more
you get some other models that have like
you know touch screens and higher
resolutions but for a basic Chromebook
you know you kind of want to be just
under 300 bucks and I like that the
design is a little bit nicer than some
of the other really inexpensive
Chromebooks routine and you do get a
couple USB ports and you get an hdmi
output which I always appreciate having
especially if you're going to stream to
movies and I'll put the video somewhere
else i'm dan ackerman at CES 2014 with
the toshiba Chromebook
