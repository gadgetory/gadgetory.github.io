to the apple byte for everything good
and bad inside the world of Apple this
week we're breaking down everything you
can expect to see at apple September 9th
event and I mean everything this event
is going to be a beast so spoiler alert
if you really want to trick yourself
into thinking you can be surprised next
week don't watch this because I'm
including everything from iPhones to
iPads to the apple TV and more now
before we start we've got to give props
and I should just call this episode the
925 mac apple bite because mark Gurman
and his crew have really done amazing
work breaking pretty much all the major
news this week so let's get to it and
first up the iphone 6s it's been
confirmed that app will bring a new 12
megapixel rear camera to the 6s that
will also record 4k video a first for an
iphone thanks to help from its all-new a
9 processor and 2 gigs of RAM the
front-facing selfie camera will also
bring a flash by lighting up the screen
with a quick white flash when the camera
button is pressed the new iphone will be
composed of 7000 series aluminum the
same material in the Apple watch sport
rose gold will also be a new color
option matching the rose gold Apple
watch copper light color if that's your
thing now we've already talked about
forced touch for iOS shortcuts although
that might not be the final name for it
on the iphone the 6s will also bring
apple watch like animated wallpapers
ranging from a colorful smoke to a koi
fish in fact leaked images of the
rumored 6s packaging feature a gold coin
the phones are expected to keep the same
storage configurations with 16 gigs 64
gigs and 128 gigs for the 6s starting at
199 and the 6s plus starting at 299 also
starting at 16 gigs with a 4k video
camera is a little surprising and that
phone will fill up fast but 9to5 mac
reports say Apple is sticking to it also
multiple reports point2 September the
18th as the official release date and we
don't expect to see the iphone 6c at all
instead Apple will keep the 5s 6 and 6s
at
prices all right next up the iPads are
planned to be at the event based on
reports and my own confirmation the
product I've been waiting for the iPad
pro and a refreshed iPad Mini are
expected to make their debut on sep
tember ninth now the bigger 12.9 inch
screen ipad pro is the actual planned
name for the device and then if I'm
access pre-orders will happen in late
October with the device scheduled for
November we know about it's upgraded a 9
processor and the expected force touch
stylus with speakers on both sides for a
better stereo sound experience it will
also run its own iOS 9.1 that will bring
additional tweaks while still supporting
split screen view and multitasking while
watching video no pricing has been
revealed yet but the ipad is really my
number one travel buddy watching movies
and reading comics and magazines will
never look better and i know this now
the ipad mini 4 will be thinner with an
a8 chip support split screen mode and
will bring updated cameras and run iOS 9
alright we're also expecting to see
macbooks getting speed bumps as well
there's nothing too specific yet but if
there's any bet to be made it's that
Intel skylake processors will make an
appearance at the keynote and the other
product I'm excited about that will
really be the headliner of the event the
all new Apple TV 9to5 mac reports it
will bring a faster a8 chip a
color-matched black remote that will
still be made of metal with a touch pad
on top and two tactile buttons below for
Siri functionality and the home button
there will also be rocker buttons for
volume that will run an iOS 9 core that
will help in reducing the size of App
Store apps and include the same ports on
the back for HDMI power and USB but no
confirmation of optical audio the Apple
TV will also have a role to play with
apple's home kit platform which we hope
to see more of as well and gaming in the
living room will be a major focus at the
event an apple is seriously looking to
take screen time away from gaming
consoles this time around but the
biggest omission which has been expected
from a BuzzFeed report is that the Apple
TV will not support 4k video and sure I
know most of us don't have one but it
would have been nice to be able to
instantly stream 4k videos taken from
your iPhone directly to your TV through
the apple TV set now Apple has been
I seen out an eight gig and 16 gig model
and has considered to pricing strategies
with a 149 and 199 model but at the very
least we'll see a new appletv starting
at 149 and we expect to see an official
release date for OS 10 and iOS 9
normally arriving a couple days before
the new phones so September 16th might
be a safe bet watch os/2 will also get
an official date an apple is expected
reveal new colored apple watch bands
they aren't of the gross pastel neon
variety from the first time around so
yes I know it's a lot to take in there
won't be too many surprises after this
but we love to hear from you the Apple
biters about what you liked or disliked
from apple's event have them ready and
we'll talk about them all in next week's
episode but before we go we had some
viewer feedback from last week's episode
that we had to read to you rich fisher
rights in with brian you deserve a bad
apple one that is rotten to the core
really a crap apple hydrogen is written
as H subscript 2 H subscript plus has no
meaning H subscript plus is the hydrogen
ion related to ph however a fuel cell
combines hydrogen gas H subscript 2 and
oxygen gas Oh subscript 2 bad apple to
you um sorry rich and thank you because
like GI Joes roadblock once told me and
knowing is half the battle GI Joe also
you're right rich I do deserve a bad bad
apple alright that's going to do it for
this week's show email me at the Apple
bita cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong
and i'll answer when I'm not absolutely
destroying my nieces and nephews at
pokemons the card game thanks so much
