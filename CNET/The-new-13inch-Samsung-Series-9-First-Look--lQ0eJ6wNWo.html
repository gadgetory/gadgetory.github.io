back to school shopping season well
underway and a ton of ultrabooks are
around to buy one of the most stylish
ones of last year was the samsung series
9 and this year the new samsung series 9
has debuted just in time for midsummer
with a new intel core i series processor
that's 3rd gen core i5 and core i7 the
samsung series 9 13 inch that you see
here is 12 99 now this is at the top end
of luxury ultrabooks you can certainly
get one for 799 why would you want to
pay up for this well it's only a hundred
dollars more than the macbook air it's
kind of funny how many times have you
ever said only xxx more than a macbook
air and you get pretty similar specs for
gigs of ram and 128 gigabyte SSD what
you do get here is a smaller thinner
lighter product believe it or not
thinner at its thickest point and 2.6
pounds compared to a hair under 3 pounds
for the 13-inch MacBook Air also a
smaller footprint here that's pretty
impressive and it amounts to a razor
thin feel very light very portable
really nicely designed motos a backlit
keyboard zippy performance and a
fantastic screen really bright and
viewable from all angles really really
sharp screen and if you're looking for
that and you're looking for the smallest
most portable type of ultrabook that
money can buy you really might want to
look into this one drawback the touchpad
while it's big is a little bit finicky
oh that's true in a lot of Windows touch
pads they just haven't gotten it right
and this one I found myself prone to
highlighting text accidentally and it
was pretty frustrating not a
deal-breaker and for all the other
construction quality that's put into
this really nice feel solid aluminum
very sturdy and less flexi than the last
series 9 and significantly lighter and
smaller you got a package that's really
hard to beat and they didn't really do
anything crazy with weird motorized port
doors or strange elements although
you're not going to find a lot of ports
on this you don't find a lot on the
macbook air either there are two full
USB ports one you
b 31 USB 2 and then everything else is
relegated to micro jacks and little
dongles which is frustrating if you want
to plug in an Ethernet cable for
instance but there is an Ethernet
Domhnall that's included that plugs into
its own little port that's nice and
there is an SD card slot although you
may not be able to see it here now as
far as HDMI or VGA those require extra
connectors or adapters and again those
have their own dedicated little micro
slots overall it is a very nice luxury
ultrabook and surprisingly small even
for those who are used to looking at a
lot of these like myself the new samsung
series 9 is about as sleek and small as
it gets from scott stein and that's a
look at the new samsung series 9 13 inch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
