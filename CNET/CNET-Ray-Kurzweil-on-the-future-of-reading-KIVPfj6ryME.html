computer legend Ray Kurzweil who is
showing off a new e-book technology
today bleeeeegh Oh joining the lots of
different discussions we're having here
at the Consumer Electronics Show about
ebooks but this isn't a device it's
actually software that runs on either a
traditional PC or the iphone right you
know there's a lot of people doing
ebooks what got you interested in this
and what are you bringing to the table
I've actually been involved with reading
machines and reading devices for 35
years we had a reader's 20 years ago for
specialized population so now we're
bringing it to the general public and we
believe this is a big step forward Leo
will provide the original format with
all of the the graphics that the
publisher has provided which a lot of
other e-readers don't do and we have a
lot of other features that can integrate
with the web and with interactive
capabilities that a computer can provide
that you don't get on dedicated devices
it will run ultimately on every device
comes with a million free ebooks and you
can then buy additional books it will
synchronize with audio books and
actually will read so you get the visual
and audio experience with synchronized
highlighting and that actually helps you
to read and so it has a lot of
capabilities other e-readers don't have
and part of what Bleus strategy is is
the idea not just we need a ebook reader
that has color or this you know a new
device but to take advantage of the
devices that people are already carrying
and take advantage of some of the
capabilities that are on a more high
powered device like a laptop yeah I
think we're seeing that convergence on
every level people want to have a small
device and a device maybe this size and
they wanted to do everything they don't
want to carry an additional device just
to do one application like reading and
once you've done that now you've got
access to the web and all of the
interactive
you said that a computer can provide and
I think there's a couple interesting
examples of what is this added display
and connectivity allow you one of the
first areas i think is children's books
and maybe while you're talking we can
show a demo of you know why this matters
on a children's book so here we're
seeing a children's book where the audio
is that correct the audio as videos have
been synchronized and so this or started
off originally as a PDF and now we're
adding in audio and we're getting a
synchronized experience which is both
the original graphics from the original
layout of the book plus the audio and
joining me is Peter Chapman one of the
other executives at the company so here
we're reading The Three Little Pigs and
we're not just reading it on a laptop
like we might if we had a digital book
reader we're seeing obviously the
graphics in color but what else can I do
the three little pigs were old pink and
plump they all had curly whirly tails
when it was time for them to make their
way in the world now we have a lot of
research that shows that this actually
helps build your reading skills so if
you're a normal child learning to read
this will enable you to read more
quickly you can also read to learn read
it your intellectual level it's really
empowers children to read what they want
and this is using a human read audio
track but we can do it with high quality
texas speech as well for any book and so
one of the convergences in addition to
devices that blue is actually banking on
is the idea that the audio book of today
and the digital book will converge so
that you kind of have the best of both
of those formats right and people like
to get multimedia experiences and get
the same information through different
modalities that will be valuable for
adults as well
and there are other features if you have
a textbook bring that up I we can embed
interactive capabilities including web
enabled features that really take
advantage of the fact that it's a full
platform so the idea here is that you
might have something like a textbook in
this case an anatomy book and within
that there might be in this case we're
seeing video that can play and that's
actually a web browser that's going to
the web and getting that video ionic
bonding occurs between two atoms when
one of the atoms has and here it's
showing educational content but in
theory you could have a magazine that
had advertising magazines have never had
video ads before but now they could one
of the challenges is you know today
there's lots of books in a sort of
static eBook format but we don't have
the kinds of enhanced books in a
large-scale that you guys need so one of
the things you're banking on is that
publishers will want to invest and we'll
see a business in investing that that
rich format exists but publishers have
it here's some web content and you can
go to this website and it's not really
integrated with the book so it's
actually not going to be that hard for
them to enrich the books with that
content because they've already created
it but now they can actually integrate
it right in with the book which is the
logical way to do it I mean here this
little illustration which is now
appearing right in the book is actually
a dynamic web enabled application and so
here we have a quiz that's designed to
sort of augment the diagrams on the
right hand side so blue it's going to be
a free software download and when is it
going to be available it'll be available
next month and that what free download
comes with a million for your books
which you've gotten from five different
sources and you'll be able to buy books
and ultimately they'll be a very wide
array of content available including a
lot of enriched books which will give
you an experience you can't get with
paper books great thanks hey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
