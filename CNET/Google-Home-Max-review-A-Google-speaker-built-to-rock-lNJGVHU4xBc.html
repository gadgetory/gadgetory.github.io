power this is the Google home max
functionally it's just like the original
Google home only this one has a big
freaking speaker on it look at this
thing
when you want to get something done it
has Google assistant built-in so you can
use a voice command to make a phone call
to your long-lost relative you can
settle a debate with friends by
searching the web you can even turn off
the lights if you really don't feel like
getting up when you're ready to play the
max has you covered there too
it's built specifically for audio files
and good news it's the best sounding
smart speaker out there even better than
our previous favorite the Sonos one
however here comes the other shoe the
Google home max is a hefty $400 so do we
recommend it that's tricky as far as
those smarts are concerned you can get
the same always listening Google
assistant with all of the same
capabilities in the $130 original Google
home or the $50 Google home Mini the
solace one is only $200 and it has an
asan's assistant Alexa built-in with
Google assistant on the way so if you
primarily want always listening smarts
and just use the speaker for background
music you don't need to spend up for the
max if you're more demanding in your
music needs and access you covered with
lots of specs aims to please audio files
it'll automatically adapt its sound
based on what room it's in you can use
the app to fine tune the bass or the
treble of your music it'll act as a
stereo or mono speaker depending on
whether it's horizontal or you flip it
vertical and you can pair it with
another matched speaker for true stereo
sound it also kept up with similarly
priced tabletop speakers from Sonos and
Bose we like the Max's sounded better
than the Bose soundTouch 30 we still
like the Sonos play 5 a little more
especially for rock but the max holds
its own you might want to adjust the EQ
to reduce the brightness and you want to
keep the volume just short of full to
avoid Distortion I also found the touch
controls on the top
insensitive but these are nitpicks the
biggest problem for the max is that it
gets caught in the middle it definitely
can't keep up with a full stereo system
even playing to Mac speakers in stereo
doesn't add much depth it's not balanced
right and it's too expensive if you just
want smarts but thanks to Google
assistant the max has features that the
similarly priced Sonos and bose speakers
can match and it's good enough to fill a
room with excellent sound so if you want
a smart speaker that can help you throw
a dance party the $400 google home max
is actually worth your consideration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
