been a very coveted car a pumped-up
Carrera with way more power than was
strictly necessary but never a cheap car
the turbos always offer the kind of
brutal acceleration typically reserved
for machines costing much much more in
2016 Porsches putting turbochargers in
every new 911 good news right maybe not
some Porsche purists are up in arms
about a loss of driving character a mere
- engine noise and well this is that new
car this is a brand new Porsche 911 with
turbo chargers and I've come all the way
to the Canary Islands to answer one
simple question is it any good
it certainly looks good it still has
that traditional shape and style the 911
but I think it looks quite modern and
honestly quite pretty changes over the
outgoing car which was called the
nine-nine one or quite few this new car
which is called the nine-nine 1.2 as a
slightly more pronounced a little more
aggressive knows there are a few creases
on the rear end that weren't there
before and the new engine cover and
really that's about it in fact Porsches
press release in this car says that the
most striking new feature are the door
handles it's it's ten millimeters lower
and thankfully Porsche now offers an
optional lift to keep you from smearing
that new nose across every speed bump
you found and the new rear-wheel
steering system promises to make the car
more nimble the twisties and also more
stable in the straights so the big
question does it still sound like a
Porsche the answer is yes it does but
it's not as loud as it used to be those
of you who want a little bit more volume
will definitely want to option out the
sports exhaust which gives you another
little button here in the middle hit
that and the car does get quite a bit
louder at least it does on the inside
interestingly it doesn't get much louder
on the outside but unlike BMW who resort
to some digital trickery to pull off
back on the magic Porsche actually ran a
couple of tubes from the engines intake
into the car's interior here so you get
more noise without annoying the
neighbours it actually works quite well
the car does sound very good again it's
not as loud before
but it does still have that trademark
Porsche breath
where the old 911 had different motors
depending upon whether you went for a
base model or paid extra for the S the
new 911 offers a smaller 3 liter flat 6
across the range in base trim it makes
365 horsepower go for the S and you get
414 thanks to bigger turbos and some
other tweaks both figures are about 20
more horses than the outgoing car now if
you're thinking what I'm thinking yes
there is the potential for much much
more power from even the base car with
just a little bit of ECU hacking
courtesy of your local tuner what
that'll mean for reliability and of
course for your warranty remains to be
seen there is some turbo lag for sure
when you put your foot down there is a
little bit of a moment there before the
boost bills in the car leaps forward but
it's really not that noticeable that's
especially true if you go into one of
the sport your driving modes the
throttle response is sharpened and that
definitely helps to hide the turbo lag
there's also a button on the PDK
equipped cars which gives you a sport
response mode that's 20 seconds is for
Plus perfect for quick overtakes or for
quick escapes
on the inside things are much the same
as they've ever been inside of a 911
we're surrounded by nice materials
everywhere the front seats are
supportive yet comfortable and in the
back there are two child sized
invitations but there's been one major
change in the interior and that's thanks
to this iPhone for the first time the
911 offers apple carplay and well I'm
disappointed there's no Android auto
here those of you who live your lives
within Apple's walled garden will be
happy to know you can now build a garage
next door and park your new Carrera
inside if you don't have an iPhone or if
you can't be bothered to plug it in the
fully revised navigation system now
offers Google Maps integration and is
overall much faster in nicer to use
the new 911s gained about 35 pounds over
the outgoing model and while I hate to
see cars getting heavier as they get
older Porsche did have to add about 80
pounds where the plumbing and pipes and
other stuff to make those two turbos
work so it certainly could have been
levels adaptive suspension is now
standard on every 911 in normal mode the
car is quite plush and comfortable
hit the button though of course and
things get a little bit more stiff but
interestingly the carnivorous trust to
crash over bumps like other sports cars
can in sport mode it's still really
drivable even on the bumpy roads we have
here in Tenerife
whether or not you like the new motor or
the new look or the new handling the new
911 has taken a big step forward on the
interior with that new infotainment
system it's properly good it's going to
get even better when they add Android
auto as to the rest of the car I can see
how you might be a little bit
disappointed about the lack of engine
noise and the tiny bit of turbo lag
that's crept into the system but in
exchange you're getting more power more
efficiency a smarter car and better
handling you gotta admit it's a pretty
good deal
