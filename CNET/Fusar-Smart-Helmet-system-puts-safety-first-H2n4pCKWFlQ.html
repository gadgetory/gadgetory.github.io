adventure sports you'll know that you
probably want to document all your
thrills and spills but hey maybe a GoPro
or an action cam is not up your alley
this is where the fuse our smart
helmet system comes into play there's
three components to it there is the
camera itself there is a handlebar
control set and also the RC control the
camera is called the mohawk it will be
recording at 1080p with a Sony 16
megapixel sensor inside and the
production model will most likely have a
160 degree lens field of view that is
the camera comes with four hours of
battery life and an accelerometer and
gyroscope inside now if you have an
accident there is an accident detection
system so if you come off your bike or
you have a bad spill on the slopes what
will happen is that it will detect this
and then it will actually automatically
send an email or text message to your
set emergency contacts with a GPS set of
location and emergency contacts for them
to call to come get you the app can also
be used on its own as a standalone
communication system or you can do the
same thing

from your ride
using the handlebar control simply press
once for photos and they sent straight
to your tablet or smartphone or press
and hold to start a video recording the
camera itself will be available for 499
dollars that comes with the remote and
