Alexa voice control built in the Amazon
fire TV edition television is actually
made by Westinghouse and element but
it's really all about Amazon these TVs
are powered by the same software behind
amazon's popular fire TV and fire TV
stick without having to plug anything in
let's take a look the TV's come with a
remote that has a microphone for voice
control built in the concept is similar
to Amazon's echo or dot speakers but
with one crucial difference it's not
always on and always listening instead
left to hold a button down on the remote
and speak into it to get a response
Alexa's voice still comes through the TV
speakers and she can still control
things like lights and thermostats as
well as display information like weather
and local restaurants on screen there's
also a few cool TV centric extras like
the ability to find TV shows and movies
and switch inputs on the screen you'll
find Amazons fire TV menu system with
rows of thumbnails displaying TV shows
movies apps games and more there's also
a row that displays the TV's inputs and
you can name connected devices and
choose from among different icons and if
you use an antenna you might appreciate
the ability to pause live TV and
incorporate metadata like the show title
and more there's even a grid style
program guide and a thumbnail guide
display shows available via antenna of
course you also get access to the
thousands of streaming apps available on
fire TV including hulu sling TV watch
ESPN netflix and many many more amazon
taos its integration of third-party apps
beyond amazon video itself and offers
providers like netflix and others their
own rose to showcase content fire TV
also receives regular updates and access
to new apps before most smart TV systems
these Westinghouse and element
televisions of 4k resolution but
otherwise pretty basic in terms of
features lacking stuff like local
dimming and HDR which are available on
competing Roku TVs this year by our TV
edition televisions shipping soon from
Amazon and will also be available at
other retailers nationwide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
