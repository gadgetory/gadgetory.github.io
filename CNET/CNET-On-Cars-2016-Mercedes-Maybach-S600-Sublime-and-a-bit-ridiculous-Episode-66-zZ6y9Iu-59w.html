work this time airbags in places you
never expected them and is it time for
dash cams to start coming from the
factory it's time to check the temp PC
cars differently we love them on the
road and under the hood but also check
the tech and are known for telling it
like it is ugly is included at no extra
cost
the good the bad the bottom line this is
CNN on cars welcome to see net on cards
to show all about high-tech cars and
modern driving I'm Bryan Coolidge
now most of us were never going to buy a
car like a Maybach the problem is most
the folks they thought were going to buy
one didn't buy one either and they
killed off the very luxury derivative of
Daimler back in 2012 but now the name is
back as a Mercedes derivative an ultra
high-end version of the s-class this
should be fun let's drive the all-new
Mercedes Maybach F 600 with a big old
brawny bite turbo 12 and check the tech
I'd give you the short story on the
Maybach s600 in ten seconds it's an
eight inch longer fully loaded s-class
600 and the eight inches longer gives
you a whole bunch more room in the back
that's where the focus is on the extra
length notably it doesn't pick up a
whole lot of extra weight it only weighs
about 230 pounds more than the short
s-class otherwise the sheet metal on an
s-class versus a Maybach is so similar
you should look for the badges the one
here on the sale panel and the one on
the rump you won't find those on any
other Mercedes now getting into a
Maybach s600 is not shockingly different
than an s-class first thing your eyes
were drawn to are the dual twelve point
three inch widescreen LCD I don't think
I've got that much LCD real estate in my
TV room the one on the left of course of
your virtual gauges which occasionally
move out of the way to allow night
vision to take over the center this big
screen we've seen before it's the
command system that has navigation that
is well rendered but doesn't strike any
new ground beyond all the in-car
broadcast satellite and external media
sources you've also got the ability to
have tuned in as a streaming radio
choice and an in-car hotspot but that's
part of a telematics subscription at 450
a year now all of this is driven by two
controllers
no touch German remember I must say you
might think this trackpad is gilding the
lily with a control knob right near it
but this does wonders that touch pad is
also good for handwriting and pinch and
zoom on the map it's right about now
diving into all the menus you can access
with these controls that you realize
there's too damn much going on in this
call if you are working hard enough to
afford this you don't have time to be
playing with your car's menus you're
making money
chief example go to the HVAC ribbon of
buttons here and just press the one that
says menu then spend the next afternoon
or so figuring out all the ways you can
set up the climate in this car from the
temperature to the air distribution to
the air flow you can blow hard soft or
moderate to footwell airflow climate
mode the air freshener which is separate
from the ionizer really and similar
layers and layers and layers of
possibility occur on almost every system
in the infotainment head unit you don't
need a loan to buy this car you need a
degree in engineering and you know
you're not an Alexis in this car
completely different design language of
course but the seats are hard Alexis
always has plush seats this one does not
now let's talk about some visual tech
going on in this car I told you about
the night vision that we have in between
the main gauges we've also got the best
360 bird's-eye view camera in the
business look how beautifully it
stitches before cameras together it
doesn't even appear to be four angles
that's pretty slick and we've got the
magic sky control sunroof front and rear
hit this little button right by the
sunroof control and it goes from dark
blue to nearly clear electronically they
apply high voltage to a crystalline
structure inside the glass panel to have
it either reflect or pass light I bet
your Hyundai doesn't have that and my
last visual trick to show you is this
one you find that little icon looks like
a book and now you've enabled split view
on the passenger side right now I'm
seeing media from the driver's side
right now you might be seeing navigation
same screen same time but at this 45
degree angle it feeds two different
displays that's pretty hot the audio in
this car is off the charts and that's
bass fifteen hundred and forty watts
twenty four speakers from Burma ster
there's even a ceiling speaker in the
rear and a separate sub in the trunk
that gets its own 400 watt feed the
tweeters even rotate I'm not sure why
and this is a low tech but really cool
the hinge on the console changes
depending on where you open it
I couldn't get enough of this I played
with it all day now driving the my box
not much different than any other
s-class you've got this sort of
old-school electronic column shifter
here paddles on the wheel by the way
over here in the center console you've
got a sport or economy mode for the
powertrain and below that is a BC not a
spelling lesson that's automatic body
control that's the active suspension
either sport or comfort the adaptive
suspension on this car is not just
mechanically based he uses a camera to
look at the road and to know when
there's a big bump or divot coming and
pre adjust the suspension not wait for
the impact to happen this drives me nuts
though about the rear compartment and
the front for that matter you don't have
infinite door checks you got old-school
three-position notched hinges this thing
is gonna cut your shin off and did it to
me several times that since you have to
work 18 hours a day to afford one of
these they give you some nice tables to
do your work upon and what's interesting
about these compared to some other cars
of this luxury category is that these
are pretty darn good this is like what
you get in the airplane aluminized and
they come to the right place
dual tablet like screen these are not
iPads these are Mercedes proprietary
screens that can be playing either
plugged in media DVD or get you access
to almost anything at the front or let
you bring up media that gets sent to the
front for Master System distribution let
me tell you is it better than my office
cupholders are so passe instead you want
a heated and cooled cup holder just
press the button for which you want and
a little light inside changes
accordingly as well people are nuts
and of course in the car like this you
got to offer the coup de Gras of luxury
silliness the bottle cooler the fridge
right here behind your elbow holds a
couple of what it looks like to be
full-size bottles of champagne though
I'm sure they don't officially endorse
that problem is look how much room in
the trunk it takes up there's barely
enough room for the owners ego in there
anymore the Maybach s 600 shares an
engine with a standard s 600 luckily
it's a lot of engine a six-litre
twin-turbo v12 doing 523 horsepower and
612 pound-feet of torque rear wheel
drive only through a 7-speed automatic
zero to sixty and five seconds is only a
half a second slower than a short
s-class and the weight at 50 to 69 is
only 28 more pounds per inch of added
length 13 20 mpg escapes single digits
but not by enough to escape a gas
guzzler tax first thing I noticed in
terms of its driving behavior though is
if you have it in this economy mode and
if you have auto start/stop enabled this
may be the most raggedly driving
experience on the road part of that is
to make it a more comfortable less
transitional ride between stop and go
when you put it in sport mode though and
trounce it good grief how can something
this big go that fast is what you think
we do have a head-up display on this car
which is nothing necessarily new for
Mercedes but I will say they need to go
take some lessons from BMW it's not real
satisfying the overall smoothness is
incredible as you'd expect partly
because we've got over 5,000 pounds to
dampen out row and undulation in all the
power that is available varied as it may
be the heaviness the adaptive ride
control and of course who knows how many
hundreds or thousands of sound deadening
and insulation add up to a sublime
driving experience
ok bass if you can call it that a
Maybach s 600 is about one hundred and
ninety-three thousand dollar proposition
but of course we got to go see that
style we're gonna add a few grand to
that in the following fashion those rear
tables and heated and cooled cup holder
got to have those for two grand the
fridge is 1,100 I'm gonna skip that all
day long and
some trunk space split view I love it
700 bucks magic sky control is a pricey
overhead toy 5000 but boy is that slick
and of course the gas guzzler tax that's
1700 bucks you could have spent in a lot
better ways all in about two hundred and
three grand the way we would do it now
if you're going to buy a car like this
you sure don't need my opinion whether
you need it or not it's not a need
product but it's a whole lot less
ostentatious and over-the-top than the
old maybach 57 s and 62 s
it utterly separates driving from the
chore of driving find our full review on
that Mercedes Maybach s 600 over at cars
dot cnet.com we've become used to
airbags popping up all over around the
front seats and - like mushrooms in the
last 10 years but there was one part of
a car that was curiously basically
devoid of them even that's changing
that's the smarter driver is about to
find out when CNET on cars returns
air bags positively litter the front row
of late-model cars but here in the back
you kind of get table scraps
maybe one of those side curtain air bags
reaches back this far and maybe one of
the recent and rare seat belt air bags
the shoulder strap is actually an air
bag housed within what looks like a
traditional belt but if there's an
accident
sensors determine when the inflatable
belt should deploy signaling the belts
tubular air bag to inflate with
compressed gas IHS survey found 12% of
people injured in crashes were in the
back seat an even more notable rate when
you recall that often that seats empty
so automotive industry supply our TRW
has now developed two rear air bags one
deploys down from the roof the other out
from the back of the front seat now
these vaccine air bags look a little odd
right but the dynamics that led them to
that shape were based on a study of
German car accidents from 99 to 2013 a
lot of years TRW found that the majority
of folks who were injured in the back
seat in the crash either got hurt by
slamming into the back of this front
seat
or because they only had a shoulder belt
on and nothing else restraining them all
the force was concentrated here and they
got a thorax or chest injury the airbag
seeks to distribute that force much more
gently in smaller cars TRW expects the
seat mounted airbag is going to work out
better in larger vehicles the
roof-mounted design could be a better
idea by the way a rear airbags are not
just about protecting people in the back
according to Japan's Institute for
traffic accident research and data
analysis serious injuries and fatalities
to front seat occupants declined by 25
to 28 percent when the rear passenger is
restrained because they in the front no
longer had this one or 200 pound
projectile in the back hitting their
seat and causing more impact airbags
back here would be expected to even
further reduce front passenger injury
due to rear passengers these new bags
are likely to arrive in Europe first
where some new rear seat crash standards
are rolling out soon the US has yet to
develop a framework for even evaluating
them but the University of Michigan
Transportation Research Institute is
working on that so why is it taken so
long to get rear air bags into momentum
like this well two major factors one is
economics our makers aren't really crazy
about jacking up the MSRP by adding
features even if their safety features
sometimes that are not going to be used
very often underappreciated an unsung if
you will secondly 14 states in the u.s.
right now don't even require that you
use a backseat seat belt so in many ways
this is the low-hanging fruit even
before we put some inflatables back here
it pays to double-check your States rear
seat belt laws the availability of rear
airbags in the car you buy in a few
years and regardless of either that your
passengers are using the restraints
they've already got in the back welcome
back to see net on cars coming to you
from our home at the Mount Tam Motor
Club just north of the Golden Gate
Bridge well California has long been a
big trendsetter in the auto industry
very much dictating styles but more
importantly emission standards which has
led to a curious beast known
colloquially as a compliance car makes
for a very interesting and intriguing
car Tech 101
whenever you find the word compliance it
usually suggests someone is doing
something they didn't want to do because
someone else made them do it
in this case the someone who did the
telling was the state of California
which in 2012 told all the large and
intermediate sized car makers in the
state that a certain percentage of their
annual sales had to be zero emissions
vehicles that means battery electric
cars or the even more rare hydrogen fuel
cell vehicles all of a sudden oddities
like electric Fiats and smart fortwo
news and Honda fits and rav4 is cropped
up car makers that fail to sell the
minimum percentage of zero emissions
vehicles and this is figured out by a
formula far too complex to relate here
would then be subject to penalties that
they can satisfy by buying expensive
zero emissions credits from companies
that do sell more than their share of
zoo emissions vehicles for example Tesla
has made millions of dollars the last
couple of years selling credits because
all they makers do emissions vehicles
and they can sell them to car companies
that make gas engine cars and not enough
that don't spew not to say all zero
emissions cars are compliance
concessions the all-electric Nissan Leaf
and Tesla Model S are bonafide sellers
but those two cars make up some 70% of
the US evie market leading the rest of
the list to be painted with the
compliance car brush here's where it
gets tricky plug-in hybrids they use
both emitting gas and zero emissions
electricity they can run some all or
virtually none of their miles zero
emissions depending on the owner uses
the car not depending on the technology
the automaker built in so it's not in
the car makers control now recently
those automakers in California gone to
the state and said hey give us a much
bigger credit towards zero emissions
when we sell a plug-in hybrid because
they're using studies now that show
frequently when plug-in hybrids are used
in the real world they are in a zero
emissions State that is closer to that
of pure V's and fuel cells
in a moment where are the dash cams and
my top five luxury car tech options when
CNET on cars continues
from 2005 to 2015 just 450 of these were
built and over that decade it became a
household name the most famous car on
the planet and right now I'm going to
show you the face you make
fust buy more from the ex car team of
CNET UK at cnet.com slash
welcome back to see net on cars i'm
brian coulis
part of the show we take one of your
emails this one comes in from julius in
massachusetts who writes I was wondering
why car manufacturers don't offer dash
cams on their models he means factory
built in there are so many cameras on
new cars nowadays and since some cars
have hard drives built in why not use
them he says together to help see who's
at fault or to remotely view your
vehicle from a smartphone
well Julius a couple of things I believe
are going on here first of all once you
leave the US is a huge appetite for dash
cams strangely in the u.s. we're not
that into them once you kind of get away
from people like us who watch this show
who are really into internet smartphone
connectivity and car technology there's
not that much awareness of dash cams at
least in the US market right now so if
you're out there looking at the
marketplace the automaker wants to
develop form they're probably gonna put
their R&amp;amp;D dollars a lot of other places
before they start developing a lot of
built in dash cams another aspect here
is a legal one if they put in cameras in
cars that connect to storage hard drives
like you mentioned and Internet
connectivity they've suddenly made a
very elaborate surveillance system that
you might then point at someone who has
an expectation of privacy out there in
the world and now you've got a problem
with a car maker might be brought into
some kind of a lawsuit for invasion of
that privacy now there are a ton of dash
cams out there at very low prices it's
another reason why car makers where we
don't see a great market here how do you
compete with a pretty good $100 clip on
dash cam you can stick on your
windshield and the markets littered with
those by the way we did a piece on dash
cams back in August of 2014 I'll put a
link to that in our show notes for this
episode over at C net on cars.com now
one car we have driven that does have a
factory cam of sorts
kind of like what you're looking for is
the 15 and newer Corvettes they have a
track cam option again it's oriented for
track use not for security or for
collision evidence use but it gives you
a beautiful view of what the driver sees
going forward and overlays great
driving telemetry on top of that image
my colleague Tim Stevens did a nice look
at that I'll also put a link in our show
notes now since we spent some time
cosseted in that mercedes maybach s600
earlier in this episode i'm going to be
a good time to run down a list of some
of the most over-the-top luxury
technology options out there in the auto
biz
out here's my top five list of luxury
tech these are my top five technologies
that I think really set serious lock
Sheree cars apart from what the rest of
us drive number five is big-name audio
and I put this down at five because
high-end audio is popping up all over
different priced cars with meridian
beats fender be a no-name and others
getting into the cabin but the really
expensive audio rigs that had five -
even $10,000 to a cars price that's
still top-shelf ironically most buyers
who can afford such cars are at an age
where they can't even hear a high-pitch
doorbell but those speaker grilles are
sure impressive number four a v12 engine
the trend these days is to get more
power from fewer cylinders all the way
down to three even Ford's new supercar
only has six so what are some of these
luxo barges doing with 12 because that
says I make more money than you do oh
and it also has a certain innate
smoothness number three is night-vision
tech now head-up displays are moving to
the mainstream but these James Bondy and
night vision screens still remain in
your financial planners dashboard not in
the one in the mid Sbisa
he said you can afford number two lounge
rear seats still the very emblem of
class warfare because they're all about
luxury and repose while not even driving
your own car and they'll always remain
in this vaunted position because you
can't install them in a car that isn't
already huge before I get you to number
one here's a luxury car option that
isn't even in the car when rich folks
have bought the most high-end car they
can find they then raise the stakes
further with where you keep it I hate it
when I envy
cars bedroom number one is of course the
fridge the backseat cooler it takes the
cake because it's just as sybaritic as
those lounge seats but even less
necessary I mean come on there's a
7-eleven full of cold drinks every three
blocks across this country you'll make
it but you probably don't want to emerge
from behind your privacy screen should
add those to the list thanks for
watching hope you enjoyed this episode
