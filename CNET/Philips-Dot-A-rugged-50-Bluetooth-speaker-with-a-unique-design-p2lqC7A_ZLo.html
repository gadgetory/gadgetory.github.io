wireless bluetooth speakers but the dot
which retails for around fifty dollars
online is one of the company's most
unique looking models bowl shaped and
ribbed fills bills the dot as both water
and shock resistant comes in multiple
color options and can be stood up
vertically or propped up at an angle
what's kind of cool is that there's a
sensor inside that automatically pauses
your music when you flip the speaker
over on its head I'm not sure why a
simple pause button wouldn't suffice but
hey it's something different
hi I'm David carnal and yes I review a
lot of Bluetooth speakers here at C net
my take on this model is pretty simple I
give it a high marks for its design but
I can't say I was blown away by its
sound for an affordable speaker it
performs pretty well but it's just not
all that crisp sounding and will distort
when you crank the volume and around 1.3
pounds with a single three-inch driver
inside it's got a bit of heft to it
though it's certainly not heavy
I see people using it indoors say in a
kitchen or bedroom and then bring it out
to the patio or pool you could take it
on the road but it's a little bulky to
carry around in a laptop bag as far as
features go beyond the aforementioned
flip to pause feature there's a built-in
microphone for speaker phone calls which
is nice and a call answer and button on
top the speaker along with volume
controls this is a Bluetooth 2.1 speaker
and has a micro USB port that doubles as
an audio input with an included cable to
prevent that port from getting wet it's
hidden behind a removable rubber gasket
battery life is rated at 8 hours which
is about average for this type of
speaker it does play pretty loud for its
size and has some bass just not the
fullest or tightest bass it's fine for
playing background music though not
critical listening as I said ultimately
its biggest strength is its design so if
you like the way it looks it's certainly
worth considering at its modest price
point I'm David Carr noise and that's
the Phillips dot wireless Bluetooth
speaker thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
