Chang I'm Ben
Fox ribbon mi as the wolf act are the 1
plus 6 reviews are out and they're
mostly great at 5:49 it's a sweet deal
for a count of flagship caliber phone
but there are some little nagging
missing parts so it lacks waterproofing
not wireless charging inexplicably has
less of a battery charge than the 1 plus
5t and doesn't run on Sprint and Verizon
III I don't want to just completely rag
on it because it's a pretty decent phone
but I just want to get your thoughts on
the 1 plus 6 I'm a Verizon customer so
that's like an immediate non-starter for
me and it's an immediate non-starter for
like half of the country so why is this
phone getting such good reviews if it's
what it what is it it doesn't go on CDMA
yeah it's basically because it's been
able to package in you know most of the
features for a typical flagship phone at
a much much lower price at 5:49 that is
a far cry from the thousand dollar
iPhone Express looking at Samsung Galaxy
S 9 I think starts at 7:20 right and
this phone has some really great specs
it looks like it has a great feel to it
in the videos we've seen of it dual
cameras on the back optical image
stabilization for one of the cameras I
believe and it seems like it's an
affordable phone with really great specs
again though the shortcomings I think
are forgivable with that price point
right just you know the reason why it's
not on Sprint Verizon's because they'd
actually have to make a specific version
tune of that carrier that's not oneplus
as mo they typically make one Universal
flagship phone and unfortunately like
they can't make us some tweaks just for
Sprint Verizon this is a phone that
works globally and that's why 18t and
t-mobile or in the mix I will say that I
think the bouquet effect on this phone
looks really good so good for them and
like or not it's got the knotch but you
can turn off which you can turn into all
that screens when it's off its off you
don't notice it as badly it's a really
small notch compared to the iPhone 10 or
actually about the size of the Huawei P
20 maybe it's a pretty tiny notch and I
still think it's one of the ugliest
design concepts that's ever happened
except it's it's the thing now like
everyone's copy it's the mullet of phone
design from now and
ten years of like Oh what were you
thinking with that it was a bad idea all
right let's talk about Elon Musk he was
in he was at the Leo Beck bake temple in
Los Angeles last week I had a chance to
to watch his presentation where he
talked about his boring company this is
this underground tunneling company and
his plans to get us zipping around these
little mini pods at 125 miles an hour
wasn't he not gonna do a Hyperloop now
he is doing a hyper listing ssin he is
actually working on a Hyperloop even
though he initially said he wasn't this
is actually uh this is considered a loop
it's shorter term it's not it's not
cross country or it doesn't cross state
lines it's really only within Los
Angeles the idea is you can get from
Dodger Stadium to LAX in about ten
minutes is that good that's amazing
it takes like I don't know 45 minutes an
hour and a half in traffic so all
amazing things but you have to want it
for a dollar only she's good to be true
course that's do $2 do $5 nothing costs
a dollar anymore except stuff on the
happy meal I'm generally afraid of
getting stuck in this tunnel like I
already get claustrophobic in tunnels
there's something get stuck for like an
hour you're stuck there what happens if
you get stuck in one of the boring
tunnels you'll be stuck underground
you'll be really bored it sounds really
terrifying to me all right lastly we
won't talk about Amazon I've been yet a
chance to check out there the facility
specializes in shipping supersize
packages talk to us about what you saw
yeah it was a 1.2 million square foot
facility in Massachusetts that's 26
football fields what just happened
and it had it was the temporary home of
a hot tub a 70 pound beanbag an
industrial restaurant sink a life-sized
Yeti statue and apparently people buy
this stuff online and do they get
two-day shipping not all if it was due
date shipping they did send a javelin
there and that was two-day shipping but
some of this other stuff is absolutely
not this is really nice it's a there's a
great video that comes with the story
should check it out that's it for more
check us out on CNN or March or Chang
I'm Ben Fox Ruben am i as the wolf after
o angel sitting oh there we go
yeah
what was that alright folks you get
double the doo doo doo doo corrected
during the show that's what's at the low
price point you know what it's on sale
for $20 less and then we went live ah
crud ok so the 1 plus 6 Corrections 29
better deal correction yes that's why 49
forget it 5.9 yes absolutely sold I can
buy a case for it I mean I will say like
the 1 plus 5t I really liked it it was a
definitely a solid phone it's kind of
hitting most of the checkmarks for what
she wanted in a flagship the 1 plus 6
seems like a pretty good natural
evolution I do wish that and I know
they're talking to carriers but I do
wish that they offered more support well
that's the problem is is that 1 plus I
feel does not have strong penetration in
the US and if you're gonna throw out
half of the US customers in the in the
first place like they're just not even
gonna be your customers look there
that's a problem they're not there there
mo has never been about being like a
major player like an LG or Samsung they
don't have a big marketing blitz that
love there it's all word of mouth right
so they've gone after sort of Android
enthusiasts folks who are more
comfortable using on phones buying
directly from from a company's site on
scene and so those are typically
customers who are on 18 T and t-mobile
because they're more flexible with it
one plus is pretty niche right now and
it's old and they're serving a certain
market which is good because you have to
be educated enough to know that it
exists ya know that it only worked on
two of the carriers in the US and then
you're making that kind of trade off
because you're paying not a lot of money
for really good specs and it works on
limited networks but I mean AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile they're not like terrible by
any means I know Verizon's huge and in
red and yes definitely red no look the
networks are all generally pretty good
now so
yeah if I think if switching to AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile or like the one big deal
breaker for you it's not anymore if you
like those networks are generally fine
it's nice to see one it's nice to see
one plus getting some good traction in
the US and continually like coming out
with new phones here compared to some of
the other smaller tier players like
let's say like essential which we talk
about and write about but like I don't I
don't think I've ever seen somebody
that's like a friend of mine or even on
the subway with an essentials recently
in real life actually see I'm like
staring like a weirdo like boys it's a
black TCL black very oh my gosh like
it's out in the wild interview that / on
the subway well you know I'm just the
creeper like they're like no it's so I
would actually if I saw some with a
black mom maybe not blackberry because
I've seen more of those now but someone
had an essential phone I would probably
try to interview them what's going on
how do you feel right now I feel like
you should take some questions
good questions did we forgot all about
you Brian I thought you were gonna chime
everybody everybody forgot me out there
but no one's forgotten me in the chat
you guys are lovely thank everybody I'm
still here I'm just running star viewers
are the best right now is Brian Brian's
the he's the favorite amongst the folks
on the show so clearly all right
question time from Pabu ba my question
is why is this phone getting so much
attention I would second that I mean I
would say it's one plus has a reputation
for making phones for those hardcore
Android enthusiasts they pack in a lot
of decent specs into a phone that is
5:29 there's a very attractive price
point I think that's generally what it
is the price alone has a lot of people
interested in this phone and the specs
like you were saying are great and the
cameras really good and yet and the
reputation it's not like it's the first
one plus phone this is the technically
the seventh one because the five T was
the weird sixth one now this is this
well they've kind of gone in this mode
were they do two flagships now it's
usually a 7 + or 6 and then a 60 and so
the same kind of cadence of two flagship
phones and
don't launch phones specific to any
market they just launched a flagship
phone and everybody can buy it
that's the sure there isn't they don't
have like a cheaper alternative we've
got basically two phones a year and if
you like it buy if you don't well sounds
like that used to be Apple kinda yeah I
kind of and also they they sell out
fairly quickly it's actually there they
still have not wasn't one of them like
an invite-only for a while they were
invite-only and that's kind of how they
got their credit but it's it's once they
like there's like a limited window where
you buy these phones so it's that kind
of strategy has has worked for them in a
niche setting with people who are or
savvy who know Android who know what I
think LG would kill for this kind of
coverage oh yeah oh Jesus come on we've
been here forever more questions alright
more questions from sir enjoy op6 says
it's water-resistant but claims and I
quote a drop of rain shouldn't get in
the way of you when your smartphone just
don't take it out for a swim which phone
doesn't protect from a drop of water
does not I'm saying like everything's
water-resistant to a point well this
what's the point of trying to make a big
deal out of this you can't dunk it
underwater but can I dunk it on the
court you can't that's it time affair no
it's all the older phones that you know
if you accidentally like dropped in the
toilet or in the bathtub if you're I
don't know like died you know you spend
hundreds of dollars on a phone and then
all of a sudden is just gone completely
kaput on you the idea is is with the
newer phones that kind of thing doesn't
happen anymore which is a benefit yeah
and it may not happen that often but
nice to have that peace of mind mm-hmm
the oneplus probably get in a year or
two honestly because there's slightly
behind on certain specs but the insides
are really inside like the camera they
kind of fell behind on portrait mode on
last year's model this year I think they
really that with one plus six they
really stepped up the portrait mode yeah
sure they didn't have a dual camera
setup that they had the single camera
and it didn't work as well as they said
it did I think they really think they
addressed that issue this
this year do we know who's making their
OLED panel did they make their own OLED
panels because LG makes they made it for
the pixel and the Samsung ones i'm
really curious where they're getting
that because i haven't heard any new
reviews I haven't heard anything
negative about the screen right now I'm
kind of curious about that so I don't
know that I've looked it up find out to
the chat oh job we want to know from
whatever that's a great screen name do
you think this notch thing is completely
wrong and overhyped I think we've stated
that a few times I mean look it's I
don't know what overhyped it's just
become so Apple like screw that look
essentially done not there's no notice
because no one bought the essential of
what Apple did was turn the knotch
into an icon of luxury basically if you
said assemble a status symbol if you
have a phone if you have a notch in your
phone that means you have the iPhone X
which means you can afford the super
expensive phone and now every company is
coming out with their own notch phone
because they all think that that's
become that that's a symbol they want
right which ultimately D values the
knotch and means that the notch is no
longer what it used to be and so
hopefully is that means the notch will
go away at some point I mean there's
lots of patents and things I've seen
that you could build a lot of these
technologies in the screen camera spray
the pixels we're still waiting for the
fingerprint sensors in the hands for
that they've had they felt pads for that
for years now it's been a while they
still haven't gotten around to it I
think that's this was definitely a
design compromise and they laser way
yeah longer term though like we'll look
at this as sort of a sort of a blip
right before we got to the actual full
screen phones I don't know the air pods
we also thought was really really silly
looking and I see them all over they are
silly looking but they aren't saying
everybody wears them though that just
all the other kids are doing it dad just
because it's like oh acid-wash jeans are
back doesn't mean that's a good thing
okay that's what we're seeing right now
the Apple Apple can start a trend with a
terrible idea and everyone will follow
it
away from the knotch so far so far so
yeah I fonox outsells any other Samsung
phone though
does it yes you should top-selling
individual phone people like their phone
looking different I mean I like my phone
I think that might be it that it's
different enough that you know it's a
new and better it's the newest phone
with a new the OLED screen I think on
the iPhone 10 is a bigger story than the
stupid notch honestly though let's it's
much better than LCD when it comes to
display technology big fan of that but
apart from that I mean Samsung's had
that for years
LG's had it they're just like crying
that's what we like 1 plus why this is
why we need is on the show more often
not because of his valuable commentary
because there's someone else who can
keep up with my Simpsons references
there you go let's take a question from
Michael Brown well more like a statement
and I think this one's going to warm the
cockles of is his cold dead heart I feel
like oneplus phones are the Android
geeks dream with all due respect what do
you think is are they is anybody said
yeah I think that they are no no they're
not they're missing some things but they
are they're pretty close they're really
there when you're looking at the price
point you're like yeah this is really
close to great yeah but I got to be a
little bit more careful with this and
you might if you are knowledgeable in
phones you might go well I could get
waterproofing but that's gonna cost me
another $200 for something I also do I
get a case or oneplus and make that work
so I think it's also got the factor in
like with Samsung which has all the
bells and whistles
I would argue that the oneplus version
of Android is a little bit cleaner a
little bit quicker than Samsung which
tends to have a little bit more blood
wear yeah but they've got a little
lighter but I mean in terms of a clean
version of Android it's fairly up there
I mean I would still say the pixel is
probably the it'd be great if Google
bought one plus instead of the HTC guys
now we can make it work together Google
has a money buy both they should I mean
I would kill what was his street cred
though no wouldn't to get purchased by
the big guy
also it wouldn't work as Opel actually
owns them and I don't think they're
gonna let go of I don't know a goodbye
Appa that's a little bit that's a little
bit more pricey what's the market cap I
have no idea I'll find my own three
phone brands that are like in the top
two in the world what's the other one
vivo it's close to Android dream but
it's missing a couple of features
because of the marketplace if you look
at this phone in isolation it's a really
good looking phone good specs but you're
like wait a minute that's got wireless
charging and that one's got expandable
storage and this one doesn't so
expendable storage I think is the one of
the bigger crux is with this without
that cuz I hate it when Google's like oh
yeah we're not gonna have expandable
storage on the pixel so it's easier for
you to manage it's like you jerks like I
want to expand micro sd not in a minute
it's at this point in the conversation
we have to ask about the headphone jack
does it have one okay from Michael Brown
if the Google pixel 3 were like the 1
plus 6 would it receive this much praise
yes absolutely especially that price
point that was Google's original
strategy which is why people love those
Nexus phones and then they they decide
we're gonna do flagship phones now with
flagship pricing and then a bit of the
appeal kind of wore off there you know
arguably one plus could have been like a
nexus partner if they existed at the
time you know if you think about it
their phones are really nice and like
Huawei made it inroads because their
phone wasn't like really branded his
Huawei was Nexus I guess Huawei 6p
whatever it was
then there was LG's phones did really
well as long as they're called Nexus
before yes my god you said something
nice about LG did really well because
their phone in particular were the ones
that were the affordable one yes Nexus 5
was just like a huge seller this was a
pixel 3 and the cameras that's good and
that's never gonna happen
they're not gonna slash the price on the
pixel for the newest you know they could
do a small version just like there's the
cheaper phone SE and se2 eventually
coming
I don't see that happening but it's it
is possible I think I think it's gonna
happen an affordable one that's good
now we all disagree otherwise it's like
I love fast I agree with with Roger I
agree with Jen I agree with you I should
disagree so with all this talk of Google
ayahs you have a new Google show coming
up don't you yeah we're recording it
like right over there it's gonna be
exciting there's a prime by the window
yeah rightful from the window and
there's gonna be people like smacking
the glass I know I'm gonna be smacking
that glass okay dude maybe we should
show the fraud let's whoa what terrible
let's take a look at the tapes do it
check it out you want to know about
Google Android way mo YouTube you should
be watching Alphabet City it's the show
that covers alphabet from A to Z what's
alphabet you ask let me google that for
you
alphabet is mostly a collection of
companies the company would consist of
Google as well as other businesses
including X capital and GB I know it
sounds like a lot but we'll explain it
all on Alphabet City
you storm stoked yeah to stir alphabet
what's alphabets like it's a company
it's a major major major cause very
annoying for all report alphabet or
Google parent alphabet alphabet comma
parents company of Google comma right
thanks company you've never heard of
because they just don't that's a better
tagline I should say that in the
beginning I might change my script now
Google but you never remember that it's
true that reordered happens what two
years ago yeah ABC XYZ check that out
yeah but like okay maybe calico yeah
what is extending keep their fortune
they have that then there's also you
guys covered jigsaw recently right
that's another one this is way mo I
think that's because it used to be
within and there's nest and that's
complicated nest used to be part of
alphabet and then it went back at
matches part of google then reorg to
alphabet and then they're like put it
back into Google yeah it's all part of
the same company is just really
organizing the chairs a little bit also
everything the managerial structure
would change and you'd have a little
flatter structure because if you got
nest and it's kind of operating on its
own you got this Google hardware
division it seems like you could really
have that work together yeah better as
opposed to having two separate companies
for that nice well I'm excited for the
show because I need to often confused by
the sheer number of little subsidiary
companies that alphabet wait so how can
I watch this thing you can watch this
thing on YouTube you can watch it on CNN
song really let's see where else you
could probably watch it if you sit over
there you can watch it when I shoot it
at an hour - oh yeah you get some come
over you know sitting studio carpet yeah
look at the couch you can sit over there
nice just don't throw anything everyone
at the desk okay that's all I ask you
know rip down the step and just don't
throw anything at me okay
we are almost out of time so we'll take
one last question from Alex Mitchell
this is again more of a
statement but hopefully the tunnel we're
switching gears over to the boring
company here hopefully the tunnel will
have Wi-Fi for when you get stuck it's
Elon Musk how could it not I don't
actually I don't even know how that
would work they'd have to they would
have to charge the more you have to work
with like a Verizon well what if they
charge $50 for Wi-Fi that's the sneaky
part well let it look if you're on the
if you're on this thing for 10 minutes
it's not that heated
well in case you get stuck and also
you're gonna make me not look at my
phone for 10 minutes that sounds
horrible it's true thank you longtime
strangers with bicycles you just kind of
like it's like honey then you go into a
hole this is crazy and you need Wi-Fi
Bob look pretty cool man they got the
flashy fluorescent APOD seem to have you
know bathroom facilities well it's 10
minutes
really what if you have a kid you know
those things sometimes they don't really
think things out just things you know
what diapers are for a five-year-old
that's true definitely 10 minute blitz
yeah where it's you know you come very
close to your like bathroom immediately
and if there's any delays if what if
it's 12 minutes look I would say if he
almost promises a lot like like almost
it's all unbelievable really but
actually comes it actually comes a
fruition in any anywhere near the scale
that he wants it at I would I won't miss
you we are we are out of time but I did
want to address one more comment I
should address a bunch of comments
because everybody in the chats but
saying really cool sweet things we will
miss the old room too but the biggest
benefit Matthew data points out is we do
not have to deal with giant bomb
screaming on the other side of the
we will miss that you just going through
the wall just putting behind that
curtain cussing yell off-camera
a few times just for old times sake go
get a muffled sound bored with just
random things but anyways yeah thanks
everybody it's been really cool trying
this out bear with us while we get used
to the growing pains and the new setup
and excuse me for dropping frames here
because I did screw up a couple times
today but show you pay for it alright
Brian it's gonna be awkward for a while
more than usual anyways who wants to
wrap us up I guess we we don't know how
to where's the script 405 episodes in
you haven't memorized
go ahead wrap it up for us 359 is
available on iTunes tune in stitcher
feedburner google play music the amazon
echo and of course cnet.com thanks
everybody for watching guys thanks for
coming on the show watch over the bed
city agree alright at this point that I
usually write up
