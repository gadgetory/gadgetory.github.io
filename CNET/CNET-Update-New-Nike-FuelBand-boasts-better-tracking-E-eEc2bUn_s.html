the couch I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update nike has unveiled a new
version of its FuelBand fitness tracking
wristband the fuelband SE it costs 150
dollars and pre-orders have begun but it
doesn't hit stores until november six
this new model has accent colors inside
the band it has more sensors to improve
the way it tracks your activity it's
waterproof and it uses Bluetooth 4.0
which means it can continuously sync
data with an iPhone and consume less
battery yes I said iPhone this Fuelband
will not sync to an Android phone but
those without an iphone can save their
progress on a pc the new FuelBand also
will pull up the time with a double tap
and it can give you hourly reminders to
help push you to move with the new
sessions feature you can label the
activity you're doing share it and even
add photos or a location a session can
track your sleep quality based on how
much you're moving at night and it's
also better at awarding points for less
active workouts such as yoga the new app
focuses around how often you're moving
throughout the day and encourages you to
earn more fuel points to win badges and
do better than your friends twitter is
making a change that lets anyone sends
you a private direct message normally
someone has to follow you on twitter to
send a direct message but you can check
a box in settings to open the floodgates
and get private messages from anyone
it's a helpful way to reach out to
popular accounts news outlets or brands
without the world seeing your message
but those that turn it on will likely
get quite a few dm's from spambots the
rumors about Amazon working on a
smartphone continue the latest news
comes from the Financial Times reporting
that Amazon is working with HTC to make
a line of smartphones there are three
being worked on one is nearing the end
of development but it's up in the air if
Amazon will release it next year or
perhaps not at all if you remember HTC
has worked with other tech brands before
it made the facebook phone Apple fans
mark your calendars
new ipads and macs will be unveiled next
week on tuesday october twenty second as
expected apples sent out invitations for
a press event with the teaser we still
have a lot to cover there have been some
ipad images leaked early that hint that
the models could come in new colors that
match the iphone 5s and that it might
have the same fingerprint scanner and
aside from an update to some macs apple
should offer a price and release date
for its new operating system called OS
10 mavericks which was shown off in june
that's your tech news update but you can
get more details at cnet com / update

studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
