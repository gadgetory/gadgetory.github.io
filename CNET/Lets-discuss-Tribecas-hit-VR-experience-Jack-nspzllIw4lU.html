we spent a lot of time at the Tribeca
Film Festival in the last week and a
half and it's kind of a rarified
experience getting to go through some of
these VR installations so we thought
we'd walk you through our experience and
one in particular yeah Jack which was
the wildest one we did and is basically
blends VR and immersive theater so it's
kind of like using a VR headset at home
but the cool thing about what you get to
do a lot of these festivals and spaces
it's more like an art installation so
you're free to move in this larger space
and you wear the headset and you
interact with actual actors I got suited
into this VR backpack and put on the
headset and it was gonna come next
there's also an entertainment complex
called the void that does this with Star
Wars and things like that difference
here is again live actors so I was put
through a door and then all of a sudden
I'm in this cartoon house and as I'm
walking around I don't have controllers
which is the other cool part it's using
leap motion which is using sensing to
track my hands without any control so I
see a light as I walk past the dangling
light it actually hits me in the head so
there's a real objects I can reach out
and grab the light I go to the teapot
there's a real teapot and my frog mom is
with a broom she pushes the broom hits
me in the foot with the real broom tells
me to go sell a radio and I don't know
if I'm gonna do that and I started to
talk and I realized I can say whatever I
want and they're acting back with me and
suddenly I'm in a play and then I had to
was she left and I had to go figure out
what to do and all of a sudden this
airship arrives on a balcony and I go
I'm just trial walk out there sure and
I'm able to walk anywhere and I step out
onto the balcony with wind and this bird
creature trader honk Birds merchant yes
a few odd bird merchants once this
something to buy and I don't know what
so I try to fake her out by grabbing
something else like it like a tea pot
she does no that's not interesting so
finally I take the radio and she grabs
it from me and I'm like pulling with a
real radio over the balcony and she
takes it and
and I've lose the negotiation and I get
handed a giant magic bean and mom comes
back and gets really upset and I'm just
like becoming Jack at this point and
then a beanstalk Rises but at this point
I thought wow I'm walking around I'm
sitting on the bed I'm doing these
things
I know imma just are gonna in a thing
that almost feels like a video game but
the fact that I can say whatever I want
starts to put me in the role and you
went through a - yeah I think we
actually had a slightly different
experience naturally by the nature of
there being live actors and you
responding to them and then responding
to you everybody's experience is gonna
be a little bit different the story
definitely follows a very there are
definitely points that all follow the
same arc like I also my my frog mom was
also sweeping a broom but when I first
interacted with it with her it was me
taking initiative touching her before
she reached me so I reached out to touch
her and kind of surprised myself when I
reached out to touch her and I didn't
just bat away err it was an actual
human-like flesh-and-blood thing
who got annoyed with me for bothering
her while she was trying to clean so I
it's neat that you can kind of you start
to develop a relationship with a trained
actor who knows how to create a
relationship with an audience member
that they're supposed to be interacting
with it was like am I just doing like
comedy improv now with the with the
trader and and it reminds me of those
NPC scenes and video games were like you
know at what point like do I not have a
choice and what would happen if I like
if I wasn't in the mood would would they
find a way to still guide me almost like
a theme park now talk about your
experience at the end at the conclusion
of that chapter of the story because I
think we had a different experience with
that - you did okay so I remember at the
very end that I think the Frog mom goes
away this is where it gets a little
fuzzy frog mom goes away I go what do I
and she's really upset like you know
what did you do jack it's haffley you've
traded her beloved radio yes crappy
magical bean she throws my bean out the
window as you would expect I get very
I don't know what I'm just saying mom
come on I'm playing along and as she
leaves there's a rumbling and all of a
sudden everything begins to get kind of
crazy and actually everything is moving
and then I don't know what's going on
everything kind of whited out and then I
turned around and I saw that there was a
beanstalk sprouting and that's when I
said oh it's the you know I figured the
big Beanstalk and then I know what to
happen then I they just kind of like
fades out and it's like you know to be
continued and I think I got at that
point I remember what happened I think
they took my headset off obviously but I
was in the room I was not in the room I
got led out they led you and back out
onto the balcony so I saw nothing that
was in the room but I know that we
recorded what was in the room and it I
peeked at it later and it looks nothing
like what I thought it would I know I
didn't get to see anything in there so I
think what happened is you actually had
a computer malfunction yeah because I at
the end of mine she throws the beam out
the window the ground begins to shake
and the room begins to shake visually
and you're lifted like you feel the
sensation of the whole house being
lifted up on the Beanstalk and at the
end of mine instead of it Whiting out it
kind of you can look around and you can
see things and you're lifted up very
high in the air you can look down the
Beanstalk and it kind of transitions to
showing you the door in virtual reality
that you came in through and it says
above the door to be continued so it
prompts you to lead yourself through the
door that's actually to the door to the
room so that you can transition to the
next part of the story which hasn't been
made yet but that makes a lot more sense
but I think it's a testament to how
these things work that it it didn't go
as planned with yours but you story wise
you couldn't really tell but it was fine
and and you could tell that that's a
problem see things logistically or so
there's so many things going on that
we're do install this I guess like
they're trying to find places to do this
but it's not easy production so that's
our VR theater experience part one
