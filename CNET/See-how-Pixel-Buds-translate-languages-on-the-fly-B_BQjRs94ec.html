company's first wireless headphones and
they're going to take on Apple's air
pods at the same $159 price what they do
that Apple's ear pods don't real-time
language translation you can use the
Google Translate app just by holding
down on the right ear pace for a moment
it'll summon the Google Translate app on
your phone you can hand it to another
person and talk to them in another
language back and forth between Japanese
and English for instance kill la
Cucaracha Monica where are you from
today where are you coming from today I
am in San Francisco mimasaka
shall I see a movie I was hoping we'd
see it together but they don't work we
should see a movie together they can
also read notifications from your phone
allow you to make other google assistant
queries stop and start your music by
tapping on the right ear bud or you
changed the volume by swiping backwards
and forwards
unlike Apple's air pods they are wired
to each other which google says allows
them to focus on audio quality instead
of worrying about wirelessly connecting
to ear buds at a time and they've got
these cool little adjustable loops
that'll help them fit better into your
ears and stay there instead of dropping
out they should last for about five
hours on a charge says Google and the
case can hold for additional charges so
you got about 24 hours in total and when
you're done you can just wrap the cord
around the edge of the case stick it in
there and put it in your pocket those
are Google's pixel buds and they're
coming in November for $159</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
