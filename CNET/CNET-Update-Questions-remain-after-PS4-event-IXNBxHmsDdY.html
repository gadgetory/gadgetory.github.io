Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update sony finally announced the
PlayStation 4 but it did not show the
PlayStation 4 yeah Sony made this big
announcement in New York but never
showed what the actual game system will
look like or how much it'll cost however
we did get to see the new Bluetooth
equipped controller it's called the
DualShock 4 there's a little touch pad
in the center a color changing lights
speakers and motion controls sony also
showed the upgraded playstation 4 I
which has two cameras to capture player
motion and the cameras have a wider
viewing angle along with the ability to
log you in with facial recognition
software we know the ps4 will be out
sometime this year and time for the
holiday rush but that was it for
Hardware most of the focus was on new
features like social gaming and being
able to stream games players will be
able to stream a game from the ps4 to
their handheld Vita there's also the
ability to stream a game before buying
it when it comes to social players can
share video clips of their game to you
stream and Facebook and if a friend
can't finish a level well you can just
jump in remotely and play on their
behalf players can just watch their
friends play and post comments on their
screens sony also said there will be a
playstation app for Apple and Android
devices and it'll it players access
bonus material for example you can pull
up a map of a level on your phone in the
middle of playing a game the app will
also be a way to spy on what your
friends are up to games were another
focus a number of major developers
showed off what can be done with the new
hardware some developers gave a tease to
new game titles others showed off some
concept videos right now it appears that
ps3 games will not work in the ps4 but
it's still unclear how a player might be
able to play their older games possibly
through streaming this all is just an
early teased by Sony to get the media
buzzing about the ps4 but we'll have to
wait until e3 in the summer to get more
of our questions answered as for other
stories to keep an eye on Google
has released the Chromebook pixel the
first Chromebook with a touchscreen but
it comes at a crazy high price retailing
at thirteen hundred dollars so to back
up that price it's got some swanky
features like a multi-touch capable
gorilla glass screen that has enough
pixels to match apples Retina display
but Chromebooks are only for people who
do most of their work online and on web
apps you can check out the full review
