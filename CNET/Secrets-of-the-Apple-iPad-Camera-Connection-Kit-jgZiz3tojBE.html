today we're getting started with a
camera connection kit for the iPad as
its name spells out this $30 accessory
lets you connect your camera to your
iPad and transfer photos on the go but
after some testing I found out there's a
lot more you can do with these little
accessories let's take a look the kit
comes with two adapters the one with the
USB input lets you plug in your camera
with the cable this is useful if your
camera uses any memory card other than
SD if your camera is compatible with SD
you'll use this adapter and plug it in
directly to the iPad either way here's
how it works when you connect your
camera or SD card to the iPad when you
insert the adapter your photos will
launch immediately it actually happens
pretty fast then you can tap to select
specific photos or videos you want to
import or you can import all of them by
tapping this button here at the bottom
once the photos are imported you'll have
a choice to keep them or delete them
from the SD card so if you're traveling
and your iPad has more storage than your
full SD card you can use this kit to
free up space for more photos and videos
now your photos will show up in the
imported album in the Photos app from
here you can edit them in iPhoto by
selecting them from that imported album
or upload them to Facebook and share
them with friends or even put them in
your Dropbox with the Dropbox app videos
you import can also be handled in the
same way so you can upload high-def
videos edit them in iMovie and upload
them to YouTube all from your iPad and
for the record I've tried this kit will
not let you plug your SD card or camera
into the iPhone but one fun thing is
that if you have an iPhone you can plug
it into your iPad and import photos on
the fly so that's the primary use of the
kit but this little adapter can also be
used with other USB accessories like a
keyboard
lots of wireless keyboards created for
the iPad or small
and cramped so with this accessory you
can just plug a normally sized keyboard
into the iPad ignore this warning
message and you can start using your
keyboard to compose text immediately
same goes for a USB microphone just plug
it in and launch a voice recording app
like GarageBand to get high-quality
audio recordings on your ipad mini
accessories also work with the ipad so
you can plug in an actual keyboard and
record music in GarageBand not all
models will work so check online to see
if yours is compatible I haven't tested
every single USB device but many devices
from these categories will work with the
adapter as long as they don't require
too much power after all it's the iPad
that will be powering the accessory if
you discover any cool tricks for these
accessories let me know on Twitter and
