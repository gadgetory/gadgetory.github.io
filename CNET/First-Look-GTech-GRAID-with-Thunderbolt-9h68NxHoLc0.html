I have another Thunderbolt Drive to show
you now this is the seven or eight
Thunderbolt device I have worked on and
just to avoid starting like a broken
record I'm gonna say this right away all
Thunderbolt drives on a market right now
share a few things in common first they
all expensive some are more than others
but none of them is affordable second
they all very fast some are faster but
none of them is slow and third they all
support just on a bone standard no USB
no 5y no eSATA and lastly none of them
comes with the necessary Thunderbolt
cable which you have to pay another $50
for that's that let's take a look at a
few things that's unique to this Drive
now this G right here is a dual Bay dry
meaning there's two internal hard drive
on the inside that you can set in red
zero or red one the problem is the G
rate does not allow user to change the
into a dry by themselves meaning that
you might not want to use it in red one
because if something happened you cannot
fix it by yourself that set is not
convenient for a red one configuration
but rather rate zero which is fast but
not very good for important data and
secondly on the back apart from the two
Thunderbolt ports and the small
ventilation fan there's also a power
button now the G rate is one of a very
few Thunderbolt device on the market
that does not share the power status
with the connected Mac the good news is
you can turn it on or off anytime you
want by pressing and holding this button
for a few seconds like right now is
running without being connected to any
Mac the bad news is it will not turn off
when you turn the computer off or will
not turn on by itself when you turn the
computer on which is a minor
inconvenience what's the bigger
inconvenience is the pricing the G red
come in three capacity forte bike
secured by an 8 here by that cost $700
850 and $1000 respectively
that's about $150 or $200 more expensive
than some of it
peers to make up for that sort of is was
very fast in my testing being almost the
fastest honorable device on the market
it's also very good-looking and study
that said if you had a huge tech return
this might just be a great investment
once again my name is dongho and this
has been the first look at the gr8
Thunderball storage device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
