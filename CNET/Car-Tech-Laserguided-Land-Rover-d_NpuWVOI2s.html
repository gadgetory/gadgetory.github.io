new york auto show taking a look at the
Land Rover Discovery vision concept this
is actually the the most interesting
concept here at the show Land Rovers
done something pretty spectacular not
only in styling but in technology
there's a lot of really interesting
off-roading technology built into the
front of this car there's Laser
headlights to give you a better view out
the front and there's also infrared
lasers that map the ground in front of
the car the idea behind this is the car
really knows exactly what the grounds
like whether it's sandy whether there's
rocks things like that and it can tell
the driver about obstacles it can adjust
its own four-wheel drive systems to
handle that surface and it can also
suggest to the driver a specific route
up a goalie or canyon or some really
difficult terrain now under the front of
this concept there are cameras looking
at the ground and the image from those
cameras is actually projected onto the
windshield this is kind of an augmented
reality thing what it shows to the
driver is it makes it look like the
entire front of the cars transparent so
they can see the ground below the front
of the car and that'll actually let them
see specifically what the front tires
are about to hit that's really helpful
in off-roading inside of this concept
Land Rover designed it to have a lot of
open space and what we're seeing in this
particular configuration is they have
room for seven adults in three rows of
seating but the driver can actually
change that seating configuration with
the touch screen all the seats are power
adjustable so they can apparently change
it to 645 seating just depending on what
they want now the styling on this
concept also heralds a whole new sub
line of vehicles that Land Rover
promises to introduce it's a discovery
subline they're calling it and they're
saying the next vehicle in this line
will be called a discovery sport model
that'll come out next year we're
definitely eager to see that it'll
probably won't have all this laser
technology on it but it should be as
capable as any land rover for offroad
