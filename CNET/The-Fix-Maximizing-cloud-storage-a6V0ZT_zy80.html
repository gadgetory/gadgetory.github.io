show about DIY tech and how to's I'm
Donnell Bell and I'm Sharon Profis and
in this episode we're concentrating on
the cloud which is the best way you can
access all of your data no matter where
you are yeah a lot of these services are
very cost-effective most of them offer
you increased storage Eric Franklin is
gonna show us our best options the cloud
isn't some complicated idea that only
techies can understand despite its name
the cloud is simply the concept of story
and accessing your content over the
Internet as opposed to directly from
your computer that's it so here are some
of the best ways to store and access
your files folders and media online for
free Google Drive is the one I use most
primarily for work but also for personal
docs and projects honestly pretty much
everything I type is at least in an
untitled Google Drive document somewhere
drive offers 15 gigabytes of free
storage now unfortunately that spread
across all Google services including
gmail so if you send a large attachment
it counts against your storage now just
to be clear this isn't a pure cloud
storage option it's more like online
office not to be confused with microsoft
office online of course drives great you
can pretty much store anything you want
but if you have a google account you
already have access to it so you likely
have some experience with it now if you
want to just purely store data in the
cloud here are three services that are
perfect for doing just that any files
you copy into your sync folder will show
up in your cloud drive so you'll be able
to access the file from anywhere and
even if you delete the sync files from
your computer you'll still be able to go
to the internet and access them each of
these services allow you to share files
with anyone else through email and each
includes apps for both Android and iOS
if you're interested in getting an
initial 10 gigabytes of storage for free
check out box the interface here is
simple and appealing but keep in mind
for the problem with box is that there
is a 250 megabyte file size limit not
very large if you're planning to store
audio or video though most pics we'll
make it through just fine you can
upgrade to a 100 gigabyte capacity and
increase the minimum file size to 5
gigabytes now Microsoft onedrive is
useful for both windows and mac users
and it gives you an initial 15 gigabytes
of storage capacity it also supports up
to two gigabyte file sizes also for
every friend you get to sign up you get
an extra 500 megabytes of storage up to
5 gigabytes for a total of 20 gigabytes
if you sink one drive with your phone's
camera you also get an extra three
gigabytes of storage now what's really
cool is that if I download one drive to
this computer I can then go to another
remote computer log into my onedrive
account and then access every file on
this computer regardless of whether it
was st. or not also if you're willing to
pay two dollars per month you get 100
gigabytes of storage and for four
dollars you get a whopping 200 gigabytes
pretty great deal if you need a lot of
storage lastly there's Dropbox now this
may be the most popular of the pure
cloud storage services reason being it
supports the most platforms including
Linux and blackberry now right off the
bat you only get two gigabytes of
storage but like one drive each time you
get a friend to join you get an extra
500 megabytes of storage added up to a
limit of 16 gigabytes also by linking
your account to social media sites like
Facebook or Twitter or setting up a
mailbox account you get an extra one
gigabyte for each of those or enable the
camera upload feature and get another
three gigabytes so although dropbox
storage start slow you can easily
increase it at no additional cost and if
you're using the app or desktop program
there's no file size limit for about ten
dollars per month you can upgrade to pro
which gives you 100 gigabytes of storage
for twenty dollars you get
two hundred megabytes and for fifty
dollars you get 500 gigabytes all these
options are great for storing your data
in the cloud overall onedrive has the
best features and is the best bang for
your buck
it's time for a quick break but when we
come back we're going to show you how
you can set up your own personal cloud
welcome back you know the more we use
our tech for data we have to store like
my iphone but always runs out of space
because I take so many photos stop
taking photos yourself or you know it's
true though the more photos we get the
more videos more files we have to store
them somewhere but if you do it yourself
you can save some money cloud services
like Dropbox and Google Drive are great
if you don't have a lot of data to store
but if you have a larger media library
and you don't want to pay a monthly
subscription for cloud storage the best
solution is to create your own cloud at
the high end you can create your own 16
terabyte now server that functions a lot
like Dropbox but it's really geared more
towards the business professional and it
can get really pricey so instead I'll
show you how to set up a basic cloud for
yourself it'll let you download share
and manage files just like you would on
any other branded cloud storage service
you can expect to pay anywhere from
about 150 to 250 dollars for this type
of setup to get started the first thing
I'll do is plug in the my cloud directly
into my router then use western digital
software to set up the device I'll
create a user account and finally my
cloud is basically set up so now any
files and folders I want in my cloud I
just drag and drop into here once I've
got all of my files in there some photos
and video I'm ready to access them from
any other device so in this case on my
Windows computer it's as easy as
launching the browser and signing into
WDS portal online
since this is a Windows computer I'll
actually browse my cloud using an
explorer window there's my video
double-click and I'm streaming it over
the web I can even drag and drop files
from this computer directly onto my
cloud to top it all off there's an easy
way to access all of your files from
your smartphone using WD zap just like
any other cloud platform I can use it to
view and stream any files I have in my
cloud plus I can use the app to back up
and share photos I've taken on my phone
my cloud is by far the easiest and
cheapest way to set up your own cloud
but remember that since it is a single
volume there's no insurance if your
drive fails so use the USB input on the
back to plug in an external hard drive
and backup your cloud just to be safe if
you like to take a lot of photos like
Sharon does you probably want a way to
keep those organized and have them be
accessible well there are tons of sites
out there that will do exactly that but
before you go signing up for one there
are some important things to consider so
here are some tips to help you get
started and choose the best site that's
right for you I spent a good portion of
my life trying to figure out the best
way to store my photos it all started
with shoeboxes and then I moved to hard
drives and then are all went to the
cloud now we're lucky enough to live in
a time where there's so many options
when it comes to storing our photos
online but on the other hand with some
of the options out there how do you pick
the right one I'm gonna give you some
advice on choosing the right cloud photo
storage solution that works for you
first off you want to think long term
the reason so many companies offer you
free storage for your photos is because
they know how difficult it can be to
switch services down the line so you
want to think about a company that's
gonna be around for the next 10 20 50
years but if this is going to be my main
back up for a lifetime of photos I don't
trust the young guys won't go under in
the next 10 years or be sold to another
company so that leaves us with the big
boys he got Google Apple Amazon
Microsoft Yahoo and to some extent
Dropbox though we have a hard time
believing they won't get snatched up
eventually let's boot out Apple and
Amazon right off the bat iCloud only
works with Apple devices and it doesn't
handle video so boo and then Amazon's
Cloud Drive is just too basic so let's
go through the rest Google's photo
service is called Google+ photos you get
15 gigs and free stores though you have
to share those gigabytes with your gmail
and your google drive it also works with
your browser or you can auto upload from
the Android or iOS app now if you need
more storage you can pay for it up to 16
terabytes downside is is tied to google
plus Google's answer to Facebook you can
set photos to private but ultimately
Google is dangling the service out there
to get people to use their social
network and share photos more people
more photos more stuff to sell ads
around which is really what Google is
all about for something a little more
cut-and-dry you can try Microsoft
onedrive formerly Microsoft SkyDrive it
works with Android and iOS and also
windows and windows phone comes with 15
gigs of free storage plus you can buy
more it's a clean layout includes
detailed information on your photos
include the exif data my only worry here
is as the recent name change implies is
that I don't feel Microsoft is totally I
earned this thing out I mean Microsoft
as a company is gonna be around a long
time but I feel like maybe this time
next year Microsoft will call this thing
super xbox live photos or something else
I mean it's still a great solid option
especially if you're a Windows user you
have a Windows Phone but if you're not
there's some other options to explore
next up dropbox almost identical to one
drive it's an online file locker with a
very clean look and apps for every
platform including windows they have a
mobile app called carousel it does an
excellent job of letting you quickly
browse through your photo collection
with a timeline bar at the bottom of the
app the downside here is that you only
get five gigs of free storage before you
have to start paying unlike Microsoft or
Google online storage is drop boxes
entire business and they don't make up
the difference on online advertising
finally there's flickr by yahoo and full
disclosure I've used flickr for years so
I'm a little biased it works on every
platform even windows phone there are
useful privacy controls is a huge
community of users and the best part is
there's one terabyte of free storage
you'll get some ads but a full terabyte
should be enough to back up your average
photo library also video support is
limited to one gigabyte per video so you
have to back up longer clips to youtube
or do the world a favor and shoot
shorter vacation videos so there you go
that's my best advice for where to go to
store your photos in the clouds well now
you know i'm a flickr guy and I don't
blame you one terabyte free is not about
it's hard to resist alright that's it
for this week's show thanks for watching
guys hopefully by now you are a cloud
expert and if you want to reach out to
us I'm at Donald on Twitter and I'm at
Sharon Profis plus there's an email but
fix at cnet com and that gets all of us
yep and email us because we actually
read the messages it's true thanks for
watching bye guys
