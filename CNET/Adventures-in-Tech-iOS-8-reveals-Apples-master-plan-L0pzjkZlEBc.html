mobile software installing big friendly
gates in its famous walled garden for
why would Apple do this now adventures
in tech investigates Apple's master plan
since its creation in 2007 iOS hasn't
really changed much sure it evolved
visually and got new apps but the way
you interact with the software getting
things done by opening one app at a time
has remained the same that all changes
now however because with iOS 8 Apple is
tearing up the very fabric of its
operating system until now apps for iOS
have been unable to talk to each other
and you tall for developers called
extensions however will let apps pop up
inside other apps so you can share to
more places mess around with documents
or use non apple editing tools from
inside the Photos app more striking is
the power to install third-party
keyboards letting iOS customers use
something Apple didn't even make as the
primary way of interacting with their
gadgets with iOS becoming more open and
interconnected it feels like Apple is
suddenly much more relaxed which is
weird this iphone is terrible it doesn't
make all the battery stop charging I
don't know how
up to this point though apples strict
closed approach has made it obscenely
rich so I want to go all chilled out now
the truth is iOS 8 lays the groundwork
for Apple to take even more control
Apple has spent the last decade making
mountains of cash from mobile gadgets
but lately smartphones and tablets are
starting to feel a bit stale across the
board Apple needs to think beyond
hardware so as we see the smartphone
market maturing and set fatigue
resetting we start to see software
overtake hardware as the reason to buy a
device so if iOS 8 really delivers a
great core experience the extension of
that and really make apples products
that must have ones moving forward
extending iOS is exactly what Apple has
planned and in revealing iOS 8 it left a
few clues as to where it's headed next
for instance checkout home kit Apple's
new home automation platform that
connects the bevy of high-tech household
gadgets already in existence making it
theoretically possible to control your
lights doors and home appliances using
Siri meanwhile Apple's health kits
channels data from different health
accessories into one Apple made appt if
you use an iPhone then Apple already
controls the way you do email or
messages the new more open and
interlinking software that iOS 8
introduces will spread that control to
whole new areas ultimately giving up all
more power having that power over the
consumer to be that hub in their life
over all the aspects of your home
turning on the lights being able to have
a health tracking system where you and
your family can track one another's
progress being that gatekeepers all that
information only deeper ties you into
the apple ecosystem it's apples digital
world that gives it real strength Apple
knows that if it can stretch its
ecosystem to things like cars home and
health it also expands the reasons to
buy its hardware then of course there's
a delicious information that Hardware
generates all the amount of data that
they can gather from that consumer is
invaluable so being a technology called
gatekeeper to the key things in one's
home allows them to build up a picture
of a person to better serve new products
to better serve advertisers and that
data is the
the wider its ecosystem the more money
Apple can make and the more valuable
data it collects though we do hope it
doesn't use this irresponsibly in the
future Oh quest away your home tells us
you spend the weekend in your underwear
eating cereal straight from the box it's
time for you to invest in a bowl and
trousers get out of Barry's trouser
warehouse 5,000 square feet of trousers
trousers trap at first blush iOS 8 may
look like a new open Apple but in fact
the new systems it puts in place are a
play for even more control and this time
over much more than just your smartphone
what do you think apples master plan is
and are you looking forward to iOS 8 let
me know and check back next time for
another adventure in tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
