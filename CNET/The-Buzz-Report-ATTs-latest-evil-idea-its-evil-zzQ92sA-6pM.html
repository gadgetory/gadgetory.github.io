the buzz report the show about the tech
news that everyone is talking about this
week double gadget goodness iPad buyers
are apparently made of money and the
time-honored and torturous tale of
trying to get TV online but first it's
the gadget of the week let's do two
gadgets of the week since its mobile
world congress week in barcelona and the
fun phone news is crackin first up the
HTC One X which is approaching phablet
territory with a 4.7 inch screen but it
has a quad-core processor to power it an
8 megapixel camera and wonder of wonders
it will run ice cream sandwich at launch
plus it comes with Beats Audio built-in
so it can be your little hotel room
stereo plus you get 25 gigs of free
Dropbox cloud storage for two years so
you won't even miss the expandable
memory nice phone also getting a lot of
buzz the Nokia 808 PureView a phone with
a 41 megapixel camera 41 yeah it also
has five blades for a closer shave I
mean the phone will have a bigger camera
sensor than most phones so the
megapixels aren't a complete joke but it
will default to 5 megapixels for normal
shooting and let's be honest 41
megapixels is pretty obviously a
marketing stunt to distract us from how
the peer review is a symbian phone that
will cost six hundred dollars in the US
when it launches in May and now for the
news Apple sent out invites to an event
next Wednesday that we're pretty sure
will be the ipad 3 announcement the
latest crop of rumors plus the invite
suggests some new touch technology maybe
getting rid of the physical home button
on the bezel plus rumors say there could
be three versions of the iPad which
should feature a Retina display and a
faster asics processor and then some
reports out of China even suggest that
the new iPad could cost seventy to
eighty dollars more per model than the
ipad 2 more the top-of-the-line model
would be like nine hundred dollars in
fact that's about a hundred bucks less
than a macbook air unless the new touch
technology thing refers to a new
touchscreen macbook air
would you probably cost like 2 grand but
whatever I am in for that AT&amp;amp;T this week
floated the idea that hey maybe mobile
app developers should pay AT&amp;amp;T for the
data that their users consume it'd be
like a fun benefit for the user because
we would download an app that didn't
count against our arbitrary and way to
load data caps that are imposed by 18t
and then the app developer could pay ATT
to provide that data which we all
already pay for anyway what an ingenious
new business model AT&amp;amp;T needless to say
response has been tepid speaking of bad
news if you had toy story 3 tron legacy
or Mars Needs Moms in your netflix
instant streaming queue prepare for
disappointment stars is taking its 800
streaming titles out of the netflix
library because the two companies could
not agree on terms see the problem is
Netflix wants to stay in business and
stars wants to ride the sinking ship of
controlled distribution and content with
holding all the way to its early grave
it's exhausting really however just in
time for a game of thrones season 2 HBO
GO is coming to xbox so you can totally
get HBO on demand through your xbox as
long as you pay for the xbox live gold
account which is like 60 bucks a year
and you have to pay for HBO access on
your cable system which is like 60 bucks
a day and by the way good luck finding
Game of Thrones on demand anywhere else
anywhere it is nowhere and that children
is how the Pirates win our and that's
the buzz report for this week everyone
I'm Mollywood and thank you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
