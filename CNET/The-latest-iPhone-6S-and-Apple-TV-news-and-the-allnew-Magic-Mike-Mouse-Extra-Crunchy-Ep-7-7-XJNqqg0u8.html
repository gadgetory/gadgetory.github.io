the real world perspective my man yeah
I'm an Apple user exactly so that's all
we need and even if you don't use Apple
things we gotta bring someone in here
yeah we're good we'll work on that we're
just having fun all right ok here we go
iphone 6s stories now I want to preface
the show and pretty much say today's
show is brought to you by 9to5 mac and
the reason why I say that is oh my gosh
mark Gurman and his team over there they
are just beasts in it they pretty much
have broken ninety percent of the news
that's out there today about what's
coming next week so we've got to give
them props because they are really right
now just pulling everything I mean I
don't know how many people on their team
actually even work for a I know this is
like this Apple scoop them a lot of
stuff they have to know they've got
their contacts okay they're legit okay
so let's start off with the iphone we
know this this is public information
apple released their official invite to
the apple keynote which will be
September ninth that is nothing new the
cool thing on there is the headline on
the invite that said hey Siri give us a
hint hmm and so when I first see that I
I instantly think look we already know
series on the iphone this is teasing the
apple TV that is expected to show up
with siri capability i see i see ok but
we wanted to try something because if it
they're almost telling us like we should
ask Siri what we hear right yeah right
so I'm gonna ask Siri and see what Siri
says
okay if you have your phone plugged in
to an outlet right now I would advise
you disconnect it because you're Syria
is going to go off that it already might
have okay all right here we go let's try
this first one all right hey Siri give
me a hint can you get a hint no you may
however get it what what what what what
all right let's do it again hey Siri
give me a hint look deep within yourself
and you will find the answer especially
on sep tember ninth September okay we're
getting somewhere now deep within
yourself hey Siri give me a hint well I
hear there's something big happening on
sep tember ninth come on okay let's try
one more she's got she's got him she got
all kind of thing hey Siri give me a
hint well I hear there's something big
well you know what one more time hey
Siri give me a hint come on she gave me
like a hint of lime one time she told me
to go check out the rumor blogs like
everyone else does oh my god of course
here you don't want to talk I wonder if
they like act they're probably actively
programming that each day to come up
with different answers right man whoever
is doing that job is probably getting
paid more than you and I come by yeah
that's that's the sad thing right dudes
like $100,000 for that little entry
anyways the event will happen on sep
tember ninth but all the new see people
said I set off their watch I set off
their phones tomorrow tomorrow's like
come on man come on man bra bra bra all
right um here's some of the news
straight from nine to five Mac about
what we're expecting to see in this
iphone 6s that's why you guys are all
here iphone 6s camera appears to be
reportedly a 12 megapixel camera that's
on the rear facing side it will shoot
for the first time in Apple history but
of course not the first time on a phone
4k video recording it also have a
feature for flash for selfies what 9to5
mac is said is that your screen will
turn white and kind of flash your face
with
with an even you know with an even flash
because it's using the screen that will
be a part of it as well they actually
said the optics on the phone might be a
13 megapixel camera but because of image
stabilization and kind of cropping the
area where your you know it might move
or tilt it is said to be a 12 megapixel
camera so you just you just said that
your whole screen is gonna flash yeah
exactly so that's a little light and
kind of give you that screen glow yeah
if you need it I actually use that here
like this computer right here lights my
face yes so it's perfect it looks
beautiful thank you for him no can we
get a shot of your face sir wow that is
let me turn off the light here maybe
it's mabeline see how it gets darker wow
that's impressed oh you guys have no
idea how the technology here where it's
at yeah you yeah you guys are missing
out it's amazing it's amazing also they
kind of got the parts of the phones they
compared the camera size it appears that
the facetime camera on the new success
will be larger in size people asking
what about the processor it's been
pretty much confirmed and thrown all
over the place Apple will use an a 9
processor that is what is assisting and
giving this camera the ability to shoot
4k video do and do other things beyond
just that nice kind of crazy right yeah
also this is kind of a cool scoop I I
like this the iphone 6s will reportedly
this is again 9to5 mac i told you nine
ninety percent of the shoes out there is
thanks to these guys just killing it
they need to hire us what uter you try
and leave stated okay you better let me
know because i might just write on your
backside if i'm a gunite you and I
rolling out together okay yeah they're
gonna call us be like hey we realize
you're doing a nine-to-five Mac huh
gasps uh no but they don't they don't
they don't have the Beechum btz style
yeah we don't then got the swag Bravo
the swag brah people people listening
they're like I'm imma stop and listen to
this hot the same bra too much it's from
the Kanye speech from VMAs and look it
up yes Ronnie come on man kanya 2020
okay also um the iphone 6s is planning
to bring the animated motion like
wallpapers
two from the watch to the phone okay how
cool is that what what makes it what
happened is a 95 Mac said they had
different types of screen savers one was
kind of like this a colored smoke
animation another one was like a koi
fish moving around similar to kind of
like the jellyfish the flowers they
weren't sure if those wallpapers were
actually coming but then a picture of
packaging revealed that koi fish they
were talking about on the cover of the
actual iphone 6s packaging that's cool
wasn't that like one of the first ones
like the very first uh on the iphone one
wasn't there like a koi fish kind of
door there was no there was no right it
was a clown fish in a green variety
ahead of yeah yeah I remember that yeah
it wasn't a those that was their
signature wallpaper it was like and it
was a nod to Nemo because you know
Disney Pixar Apple yeah that whole
relationship right it was a clown fish
when I saw the story that's immediately
where I thought I was like can they have
like a fish like the iPhone one so
that's funny uh your brain is cracking
me up so that that's what we're
expecting to see I like it a lot Johnny
I've even talked about it in a new york
times article earlier in the year he did
say though one of the reasons why it
really looks good at least four people
on the Apple watch is that the Apple
watches is able with the new screen
technology they having it to really show
off like true black so that image of the
jellyfish or butterfly gets lost in the
background whereas with the iphone you
can kind of still see it's a gray or
color where the screen actually is
there's no kind of fool just deep black
yeah surface if you guys look at your
phone and you just have it on
generically you'll kind of see it's a
little grayer versus black so there you
go I don't know how much battery life is
going to take up yeah it's gonna let
your battery guys it's gonna it's gonna
suck it dry the other thing is a lot of
rumors that the iphone success will be a
there might be a pink one those reports
were a little they were kind of jumping
the gun 9to5 mac again reports that it's
the rose gold color kind of that coppery
color to match the options that are for
the Apple watch they're out there so
guess what rose gold watches rose gold
phone yeah I'm gonna get a rose gold
macbook coming soon
that's I think there's a small
percentage of people that are rocking
all all gold everything I get if you're
out all rose gold please send this a
picture while your rose gold gear ways
all rose gold is that another say five
times baths yeah all rose gold it's hard
all roads go hours gold sounds like echo
sound like an evil character and like
other schools like rasa rasa yeah
exactly rose gold raza yeah yeah razo
gold Russell gold rose ago Rose gone
yeah alright so that's that's some of
the rumors that are coming out with the
iphone 6s stuff also we don't expect to
see an iphone 6c there's a lot of rumors
that maybe we'll see something like that
that is expected to not appear at this
keynote in fact that project appears to
potentially be dead but we will see the
iphone current iphone 6 and 6 plus shift
down has kind of the more entry-level
models they'll probably really probably
be cut down by a hundred dollars which
is what's happened in the past with
every you know new generation that old
one stays for a while um so we'll have
six how fun will that be for a retail
associate yes would exceed tell me the
different XS plus the six plus the
successors excuse me sir what's the
difference between the 6x and that's the
what do you have a6 c6 see iphone 6c
haha you know you know that's gonna
happen wait wait what's that over there
is that the iphone 5s no no sir it's the
success wait so does but I never had us
did they go from 5s two successors five
to say that's the five plus oh no x what
sorry it's it's gonna be to myself now
I'm confused you want to stop the show
right now yeah let's stop it okay Steven
you got something you want to talk about
okay yeah okay so pew research poll came
out with a new study that said
eighty-two percent of people polled
think it's rude to use your smartphone
in a social gathering but eighty-nine
percent do it anyway I think I'm one of
them probably I'm sure I am here's
here's the story so they did this they
did this big pole here and many many do
many have an excuse they said so some
smartphone users they
like they'll use their phone thats
related to the gathering you know
they'll take pictures of what's going on
in posting it to the post a video or
something to a vine video of what's
going on forty-one percent share
something that happened at the party
thirty-eight percent like to get
information that would be interested in
the group maybe they're talking about
something like some movie and then going
to find out who the director was or
something but I thought it was very
interesting eighty-two percent think
it's rude but nineteen eighty nine
ninety percent still do it well this is
you guys do it yeah this is this is a
little phone a tacit story to piggyback
on the iphone what's your phone
etiquette I will tell you that because
you know we get so busy every day me and
my buddies we have this pact okay and we
only get these are some of my old high
school college buddies and we're a crew
that we get together maybe every once
every week geez now it's like two to
three months because it's so much harder
right you know that's hard good though
and it's like there's three months
there's a group of like 8 or 9 guys and
typically at least six of us show up
when we go to dinner we all we all texts
are well I text my BAE my boo hey bae
they make big they call them girlfriends
or wife's i mean like you nakato bay
yeah i'm going dark we put the phones in
the center and stack them up that's cool
if you reach for your phone you have to
pay for dinner okay I've heard I've
heard that and it's awesome it it's like
no one's looking at their stupid phone
and sometimes we try and like tricks i'm
gonna be like oh yeah like what is that
can you check your phone until we all
agree that okay you can go check your
phones before we roll out to the next
spot you guys should try sometime have
you ever had to buy dinner not because
of that okay yeah not because of that
Wow no could you mad really good but if
a phone goes off constantly and it's
someone who has a kid yes then we allow
that but it doesn't it's never happened
in the past in the three years that
we've done this well knew this whole new
initiative yeah someone's all someone
run on a periscope I cheat with my
SmartWatch ooh ooh well yeah I guess I
guess I make sense I turn I don't I
don't move are you that doesn't they
gotta look at her see that's what I'm
saying yeah what is so important you
gotta see someone's update about their
kid who just like you know did something
neat it up whatever people asking when's

like oh come on guys yeah so this is a
good one here ho brah that looks like

I mean again it's another shirtless
Channing Tatum picture sure lyst
Channing Tatum but this time he's
wearing like he has a collar with no
shirt and a tie and he's wearing like
some weird kind of cuffs or OU's got
cufflinks well no but still-- no sure
it's like the shirt wearing the collar
in the cuffs yeah it I've this is this I

he took to apples and he took like the
little top of the stem of the apple he
made the two apple side by side it looks
like junk it looks like man junk yeah

for me yeah right on okay okay and let
me start this music again uh not gonna
get a longer jacket will second
runner-up is from Fletcher block now
this is I like this one a lot because he
has the suit he has the shirt that we
were talking about that has just the
collar and the the thing but he's also
wearing a top hat and he has like a
magic like a magic wand which is poorly
photoshopped which makes it even better
I think but he did resize the mouth so
it's more of a square shape yes and the
apple logo is covering his genital area
so that's cool okay okay and the winner

all right it's all people that are on
periscope they can't see the images are
like this is killing me topic is dead so
maybe we now you gotta watch the show
man yeah maybe we maybe we maybe we
marinated on that too long I'm sorry for
all our listeners stick with us because
um I don't know what what do you think
what do you think we should talk about
what do what do people think we should
talk about um let me see real quick um
how about I'm just curious about Apple
TV Oh Apple TV yeah our man wants to
know about Apple TV okay tons and tons
of good stuff coming about from the
apple TV news world again thanks to our
friends at 95 Mac I just noticed that 95
Mac also has 95 google they do they have
my very name but if I Mac is their bread
and butter they're they're legit okay
Apple TV the fourth generation coming in
october for under two hundred dollars
now according to the reports Apple is
playing with the idea of a 149 to 199
price tag currently the current Apple TV
has been dropped to sixty nine dollars
if case you didn't know I think based on
the current landscape 199 is a lot to
ask for considering everyone else's is
pretty much roku's away 49 they're like
50 bucks totally don't
199 apple-like especially when you don't
even have your live TV streaming service
coming until next year don't don't bra
bra don't do that you know I mean that's
gonna kill yourself so um it will get
again get that streaming service next
year tons of stuff though we expect to
see from the apple TV for corn a 9to5
mac gaming and Cirie will be a major
focus as part of this whole new product
and I love okay everything about the
Apple TV for those that aren't up to
speed this is what we're expecting to
see this is the product that I am the
most excited about at the keynote coming
on sep tember night so we're talking
about a redesigned Apple TV a Serie
enabled Apple TV so you can navigate
through the menus a tut a remote that
has some touch capabilities kind of like
a macbook trackpad App Store capability
so we're talking about apps and games
when I'll be available through your TV
set and then let let's talk about the
fact that it has already been pretty
much confirmed that it will be one of
the central pieces for the home right
the ihome platform apples apples home
kit platform you can turn off lights
with your Apple TV remote it's the
developers developer notes and just the
logs have showed that you know developer
file sorry in the in the SDKs have shown
that home kid is a big part of this is
going to be a big thing so that's why
I'm excited about it I have an apple TV
I kind I use it decently mostly because
all my content is on Apple TV mm-hmm so
that's that's where it's at but gaming
in Syria will be a major focus um there
were rumors that the remote was going to
have kind of like a wiimote type of
action where it had a pointer and you
could kind of move it around like a
mouse that's cool or if you have an LG
TV you guys are super familiar about it
also it will have a button to use the
Siri prompt much like the Amazon fire
product does but this Apple TV remote is
supposed to be only connecting via
bluetooth and not through any type of IR
or you know camera system and can track
it yeah so I've got to imagine that one
capability is not yeah I don't think
that's gonna have it just you won't be
able to like pointed see like a little
mouse
if it's just bluetooth it's just
bluetooth yeah all right someone is
flooding the chat with all types of
nonsense mm-hmm anyways rodent by the
way mice for rodents I know what is a
rodent to mammal disturbed confused
someone has that someone has to get it
straight Thank You someone has to get it
straight this okay so um yes that will
be part of it also um the the app aspect
that there's reportedly some sort of
accelerometer detection in this remote
so you can use it for like driving games
and things of that nature oh that's cool
yeah it's pretty crazy hold on um
because people are can I can i block
this guy please there are blocked your
blah blah you blocked someone's route
trying to ruin this horrible get out of
here okay so Apple TV I mean Stephen
Apple TV any appeal to you or not or no
because I already have a nintendo wii u
i have a playstation 3 i have Roku i
have the what is it the youtube
chromecast so I mean I don't have I
don't need any I don't have any room for
anything else yeah thing you know and
about 10 different ways to stream video
so I'm cool you're cool yeah you're good
alright so I do this next story are you
gonna do it yeah no no what we do it the
google the google android thing well i
mean it's just a quick note that just
today people been asking about android
we're coming to iOS and google
officially launched the Android wear app
that allows certain Android wear watches
to be completely compatible with your
iphone which is crazy which is awesome
the thing about is the Apple watch still
hasn't even taken off that and well
right it's done okay alright but now you
have android where they're going to come
out with a flood of watches at Aoife
2015 in berlin at the end of this week
so we're gonna get oh yeah monsoon of
watches if you guys haven't looked at
all these crazy smart watches that are
potentially coming out you've got to
check out this thing from huawei it's
the wall way watch it's probably the
best looking smart watch out on the
market that we've seen today so far I
think
her Jessica dual-core talk about that
Huawei wish well way I could save while
we watch better than SmartWatch
SmartWatch watch my wife smartwatches
well wait wha wha way that rolls off the
tongue what it's huawei easier all right
let's go that's another story from nine
to five Mac keeping up with a 9to5 mac
theme here apple launches eyesight an
isight camera replacement program from
the iphone 6 plus so on the the backside
camera right yes if the front side kept
the rest of the rear rear camera on the
iPhone 6 plus some devices were having
problems and they were taking blurry
photos so Apple has announced this
program so if you could bring in your
iphone 6 plus and get it get the camera
replaced not the phone right just the
camera piece so um so yeah if you guys
are having problems with blurry photos
please take it into apple and get it
fixed ASAP yeah they can you can go to
the website on their support page and
you can enter in your serial number um I
did say on the actual apple by show you
might have you might thought you
actually had bad eyesight but you
actually had a bad eyesight I see what
you did there she just to get it did you
see ice what I what I did there I saw
you saw our people that are also
listening right now I think so yeah I
mean I had a problem my iphone to i
think it was like the I the headphone
jack stopped working all of a sudden I
took it in the apple store and they just
they're like oh yeah this is something
that's that you didn't cause we're gonna
give you a new iphone that's nice do you
use a do you get applecare on all your
stuff cuz I do what I when I first buy
it and I don't renew it this is what I
do I get applecare my phone and then
right before the new phone comes out
because there's always something wrong
or messed up with my phone yeah I just
swap it out for a new phone and then
sell it nice and I get it get a nice
chunk of change back yeah it's pretty
sis it's a smart thing to do oh yeah
okay uh you know because we've been
chatting and chatting back and forth um
I think we should start doing our phone
calls you want to do that let's do it
okay okay caller number 1 i'm just
curious about Apple we talked that we
talked about that already we already
talked to his right I know it's this
John but he Apple
iphone 6 want to becoming a better cord
they have better cause out on the market
from where Apple will not approve them
because it cuts into their feet but they
need a better cord because when you're
spending twenty dollars a cold everyone
a half you basically pay for iphone boy
when he come with a better system do you
know this is John Haynes I think I don't
think we do know right but he has a
point man Oh John Haynes John Haynes
talking about chords and how crappy
apples cores are and how they break all
the time it's been this way from their
power adapters six seven plus years ago
dude every Apple cord i have is frayed
and falling apart i have everyone
current one is all bendy and the rubbers
all like breaking and snapping and
everything the only one that is not is
the one that i bought that was generic
that I got an Amazon it's the only one
that's not broken I swear like weird how
much these cables cost twenty bucks he's
like yeah yeah he's a key he must really
go through a lot of cables yeah but it's
it's a funny exaggerated like I could
already pay for my phone but how many
cables I broke I mean with the old
headphones too I used to go through
those like those were garbage yeah like
every like two months I'd go back to the
store and take them they give me a new
pair so you know it they will they'll
never it's it's because they're more
worried about the aesthetic of the cable
and the wires then they are about the
durability of them that's just what it
comes down to hmm they'd rather wrap it
in this nice soft rubbery material that
breaks and that you know weathers down
easily snaps and then it exposes the
chords and the cords get messed up yes
what it comes down to yeah so you know
what that is Stephen that is a bad apple
and if I had a picture of a bad apple i
would i would have shown it to you yes
which we don't need to show this is an
audio podcast Oh although it's extremely
video heavy it's very video heavy okay

ho like you have to you have to give you
have to you know kind of sign off though
oh if you're gonna be Santa Claus have
some jingle bells in the background just
