feature I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update get ready for more ads
in your facebook news feed that are
based on your browsing history
Facebook's testing out a new way to push
ads to you based on the websites you
visit instead of just based on info from
your profile and the pages you like it's
great for advertisers but has potential
to be annoying for users depending on
how Facebook handles it first it'll come
to desktop users and eventually mobile
if you're doing some spring cleaning and
thinking about donating old unwanted
stuff you could make some money off of
it eBay is working with goodwill
industries on a new program called sell
it forward right now it's an early test
and only available for some California
residents but here's how it'll work send
use items to ebay in a free postage paid
bag if a Goodwill store can sell it
within two weeks you score fifty percent
of the sales price which is put into a
paypal account you can sign up to get an
alert when this program is available in
your area Walmart is borrowing an idea
from Amazon Walmart is testing a locker
system in some stores this summer it'll
let customers purchase items online and
pick them up in the store at a locker
that way you know the item you want is
there and you don't have to bother with
standing in a checkout line in
comparison amazon started offering the
locker option last year for customers
who had a hard time getting deliveries
to their door amazon puts its lockers in
other retail stores like staples
7-eleven and radio shack if you buy an
android phone with verizon it'll be
preloaded with a game app store called
games portal it works like Apple's game
center where players can connect with
others in the game network huge news for
anyone who has been pulled into the
addictive world of plants vs zombies not
only is there a sequel to the game in
the works but there's also a Facebook
spin-off called plants vs zombies
adventures where your plants travel to
new locations to fight zombies that drag
themselves in from multiple directions
and you could launch a zombie attack
against another face
friend flipboard is a popular app for
keeping up with news from your favorite
websites and social media streams it
presents stories in a magazine style
layout the version for Apple devices
just got an update that has people
buzzing now you can make your own
magazine and share it with others when
you come across the store you like click

magazine you can make a magazine just
