and it lasts the most anticipated
Android wear SmartWatch the Moto 360
we've heard about it for a while and
it's finally available what does it cost
to 49 we know that and it's going to be
available in a variety of designs it's
got stainless steel outside and it's the
first round SmartWatch that we've seen
won't be the last because there are
other Android wear round smartwatches
but the Moto 360 has an extremely thin
bezel and I was designed to create as
minimal as to look as possible it does
look pretty snazzy it's got a removable
watch band here this is leather made
with local leather for a company that
also makes footballs and basketballs
there will be a stainless steel version
later on in the year a stainless steel
band for 299 for that watch but you
could swap the bands later on too if you
buy one now it has a few Motorola
engineering tweaks improved noise
cancelling microphone technology it's
supposed to have better voice
recognition plus it does have a heart
rate monitor on the back that's Motorola
engineered as opposed to the ones that
are made by samsung but works in a
similar way it seems plus it's going to
be able to track your active minutes per
day so to get your 30 minutes of
activity per day over five days a week
it also has an inductive battery charger
so you can take this thing off pop it
into the charger and it's a very simple
recharge process without any dongles
it's supposed to get about 24 hours of
battery life the watch weighs somewhere
in the territory of 6 grams it's light
it's lighter than it looks and it feels
very snug on my wrist this has got the
same Android wear software that all
these android wear watches do but the
Moto 360 probably has the best
collection of watch faces that I've seen
really snazzy awesome looking watch
faces the Motorola has customized to run
on this watch that's a little look at
the Moto 360 now available i'm scott
stein at CNN</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
