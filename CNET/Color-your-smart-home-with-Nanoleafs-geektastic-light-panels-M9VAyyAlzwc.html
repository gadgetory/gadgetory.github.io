a set of color changing LED light panels
these are smart home gadgets you can
sync up with your phone and with apple
homekit if you're an iOS user that lets
you control them alongside other homekit
gadgets and using spoke and siri command
so the basic pitch here is that these
are kind of philips hue for your wall
you can stick these up in a modular
fashion connecting each triangular panel
to another one along the side using a
little connector chip it's a little
flimsy feeling I wish they did a better
job of providing some good mounting
instructions they sort of just throw
sticky tape at you and say have fun once
you've got one that you like you can
save it and then tell Siri to run it
whenever you like
or control it right from the control
center on your iPhone or iPad thanks to
that home kit integration that includes
home kit compatible Philips hue bulbs
like the one I've got in the lamp behind
me right now if I group them together
into the same room and then tell Siri
change all the lights to green you can
see that everything happens all at once
together really cool the Nano leaf
Aurora starter kit with nine triangular
panels and the base station there sells
for $200 so it's not cheap but it's
about the same price as a three bulb
Philips hue starter kit so not as
outrageous as you might think if you
want to add additional panels to your
setup nan only sells three packs for
sixty dollars each and the base station
can control up to 30 in total so a lot
of room to grow your set up given how
cool and unique it looks and how well it
worked in my test I actually think it
makes sense as a fun splurge if you want
something really designed focused for
your smart home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
