has set into the already quite crowded
SmartWatch market place and it's hoping
to win you over with a promised 30 day
battery life and quite an attractive
metal design now let's go in for a
closer look
physically it has quite a classic watch
design there are three round models
available with interchangeable rubber or
metal straps and there's also a
rectangular model available now as you
can see the display is monochrome now
vegetation to read under bright sunlight
although I'll have to wait until I'm
actually outside in order to test that
it should also help to get the watch to
that promised 30 days of battery life
but what about the smart functions well
the watch will connect to apps on iOS
Android and Windows Phone yes you heard
me
Windows Phone as well and it will show
things like your incoming notifications
Facebook messages calendar appointments
alarms fitness level sleep levels all
that kind of stuff all on the watch face
vector will also be working with
third-party vendors such as nest for
example to allow you control the nest
thermostat from the watch most of the
programming of the watch in terms of the
apps and its functions you'll actually
do through the app on your phone rather
than on the watch itself although you
will see that there are three physical
buttons on the outside edge of the watch
and it doesn't have a more typical
touchscreen the watch is due to go on
sale globally in the summer and vector
will be selling it through its own
online store as well as through select
local retailers how much will it cost
well the round one is the pricier of the
two costing three hundred and forty nine
dollars while the rectangle one will
come at 199 dollars so far I'm quite
keen on the watch it has a nice design
and thirty days of battery life really
is very appealing but we'll have to see
exactly how this performs when we give
it the full hands-on treatments I'm
