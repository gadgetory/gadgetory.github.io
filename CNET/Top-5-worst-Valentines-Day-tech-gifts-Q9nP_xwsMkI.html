to swoon sure damn I get excited but
swooning
these are the top 5 tech gifts to not
give on Valentine's Day and before we
start I'm sure there is someone out
there who would love any of these gifts
to say general person list so let's go
at number 5 bitcoin giving money to your
significant other in any way it's
probably a bad idea giving them online
currency isn't necessarily worse but it
might take some time to explain what it
is and how to use it to just don't do at
number 4 incompatible tech does your
loved one have an Android phone don't
get them an Apple watch do they have an
Xbox one don't get them PlayStation
games if you want to show you're paying
attention go into your mind palace or
snoop like crazy to see what your loved
one uses regularly make sure if you get
them tech it works with their stuff at
number 3 a hoverboard or anything else
prone to exploding those battery powered
scooters are pretty neat but right now
they are subject to some controversy
that would be some of them have been
exploding as in Catching Fire
it is definitely romantic being by a
roaring fire but your gift should not
explode - cause that roaring fire at
number 2 a car tracker nothing says I
don't trust you like a car tracker
automatic Labs makes a device that plugs
into your car and lets you get all kinds
of data on that car that's very cool
however this gesture to make a car
smarter could be seen as a wonderful act
of distrust so tread lightly at number
one any fitness thing you know what's a
great way to have a terrible Valentine's
Day insinuate the fitness level of your
partner is less than optimal if you see
a deal for a fitness tracker a smart
scale or utensil that can count calories
and yes that's a real thing purchases if
you'd like but don't give it as a gift
on Valentine's Day that is unless you're
looking for a Valentine's Day Massacre
look some of these gifts would be
awesome just pick a different day okay
okay

them on my as a card I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
