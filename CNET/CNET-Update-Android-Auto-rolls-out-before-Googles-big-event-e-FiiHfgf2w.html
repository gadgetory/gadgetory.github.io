Carey this is your cnet update Google's
Android operating system is now in cars
the 2015 Hyundai Sonata is the first car
to come with Android auto software
programs into the navigation screen that
means if you have an Android phone you
can connect it to your car using a cable
then you can transform the touchscreen
controls to show an Android menu you'll
get shortcuts to google map directions a
quick look at the weather recent calls
and ways to stream music you can also
use voice commands to search for places
just do a long press on the voice button
on the steering wheel to speak your
command it's similar to how Apple's car
play will work you'll be seeing both
Android auto and apples car plate and
more vehicles later this year general
motors just announced both systems are
coming to 14 of its 2016 chevrolet
models google is about to announce a
number of new software features at its
annual Developers Conference taking
place this week it's called google i/o
we're expecting to get a taste of the
next flavor of Android code name em some
of the conference topics on the agenda
give us clues that Google is working on
ways to keep your devices secure without
needing to put in passwords into
everything maybe we'll also see more
support for fingerprint unlocking
there's also buzz that Google's going to
show some sort of new wearable device
and you can expect more talk about
virtual reality at last year's event
google introduced us to the concept of
using a phone for virtual reality with a
do-it-yourself cardboard and magnet
casing so we'll see how that evolves
reports suggest google may unveil to
Nexus phones this year nexus of course
is Google's pure Android phone without
any extra software from device
manufacturers according to the blog
android police there could be two sizes
but Google doesn't always reveal new
phones at this event so don't hold your
breath cnet we'll have live coverage of
the announcement thursday at nine thirty
a.m. pacific twelve thirty eastern time
and i'll have the highlights wrapped up
for you in the next update episode
meanwhile as we focus on Google's up to
some folks on reddit posted a discovery
of a strange bug on the iPhone that
causes it to crash if someone sends a
particular string of characters in a
text message if you send someone this
message it will force the phone to
restart the theory is that the
notification pop-up cannot handle the
characters and that causes the crash
apple says it is aware of the problem
and will have a fix in the next software
update that's all for this news update
but there's more at cnet com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
