today we're gonna check out the Philips
htl 51:20 this is a budget sound bar
with an ultra sleek look and it's
currently selling for around two hundred
and fifty dollars the design is the
first thing you'll notice as it's really
thin and it kind of looks like an
airplane wing from the side the low
height also means that it won't block
your TV's remote control sensor in most
scenarios which does happen on a lot of
other sound bars it can be placed either
on a tabletop like this or you can wall
mount it and there's a built-in
orientation sensor that adjusts the
sound quality depending on how you place
it the Philips doesn't come with a
wireless subwoofer like a lot of other
systems do although it does have a
built-in subwoofer which helps handle
some of the low-end around back you'll
find more ports than usual including two
HDMI inputs two digital inputs an analog
input and a mini Jack input those HDMI
inputs are particularly nice on this
sound bar because they let you get the
full surround sound signal to your sound
bar which doesn't always happen when you
plug everything into your TV first you
can also connect a mobile device to the
sound bar using bluetooth so you can
stream wireless audio from just about
any smartphone or tablet the Philips
also includes a remote and the button
layout is pretty unusual the directional
pad is actually used to choose inputs
except for the HDMI inputs which are at
the top the volume control looks like
it's in the middle but that's actually
for lip sync the real volume control is
lumped in at the bottom with bass and
treble controls while there's no true
front panel display there are a few
lights on the front which are nice
because it gives you some visual
feedback when you're making adjustments
in terms of sound quality the best part
of the Philips is its virtual surround
sound processing now you're not going to
get true surround sound effects coming
from the sides or behind you but it
sounds much bigger than the length of
the sound bar and it compares to even
more expensive systems like the Sonos
playbar it's a pretty nice feature for
movies and TV shows where it's nice to
have a more immersive experience where
it falls a little short is unclarity and
overall dynamic impact without a
separate subwoofer it just doesn't sound
as powerful as some other systems
although it's definitely a step up over
the speaker
built into your TV overall the sound
quality of a similarly priced system
with the true separate subwoofer like
the Vizio s 4221 w is going to be better
although a few systems do sound as
immersive as the Philips and that's what
it really comes down to if you like the
design and the idea of a big soundstage
the Philips is a solid choice especially
for the price but if you're picky about
sound quality and you want the powerful
sound that you can only get with a true
subwoofer you're better off looking
elsewhere I'm asking the zodiac and this
is the Philips HDL 50</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
