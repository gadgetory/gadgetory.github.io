prints out text documents instead of
graphics while a simple black laser
printer can be a great partner for a
small office in the home or used as a
shared device with coworkers I'm Justin
for CNET this is a first look at the
canon imageclass LBP 1 v 1 DW printer so
single function lasers are pretty cheap
and they're usually easy to maintain
plus the toner lasts a lot longer than
ink which can be a great value when it
comes to refills but unfortunately this
is not one of those printers let's start
with the basics though like most
printers this one's not much talked
about in terms of design probably
because it's meant to disappear in an
office environment what is kind of cool
about this printer though is that the
paper tray is easy to adjust and use for
a bunch of different types and sizes and
it's got a built-in auto duplexer that
tries to save you some money by
automatically printing on both sides of
a single sheet the problem here though
is with the toner cost now this is a
common trick where printer manufacturers
price the hardware cheap and charge a
premium for ink and toner knowing that
you'll be coming back for more
I did a math for you and canons toner
costs three and a half cents per page
which is a decent price for inkjet
printers but most lasers cost less than
two cents per page now canon even takes
the price gouging a step further and
disables air print support for this
model of course if you want the ability
to print directly from your Apple iOS
device you can buy the more expensive
model but instead of doing that you can
find a bunch of other laser printers in
my for review on CNET that won't get
greedy with your money and that's where
you should go for recommendations so
that's going to do it for this video you
just refer at the canon imageclass lb p1
