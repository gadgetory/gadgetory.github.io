Insteon LED bulb we're looking at today
and this is a fully automated LED light
bulb that retails for $29.99 and this
will work with the Insteon Network if
you have an entity on hub for instance
you'll be able to control this thing now
usually with automatable lights we see
some sort of control switch or a dimmer
module this bulb is different it's got
the controls built right in it can
communicate directly with the instant
hub that's a pretty cool thing we
haven't seen that from a lot of other
networks so why have an automated light
bulb as opposed to a dimmer module or
some other separate device well this
gives you a little bit of flexibility
let's say you wanted to automate the
light in your ceiling fan for instance
to do that you'd usually have to go and
put in a smart switch or go into the
actual wiring and make that smart but
with this you can just change the light
bulb and automate that so it's a lot
easier that way
with Insteon you'll be able to control
the light bulb remotely either from your
computer or from a remote controller
that you can get separately or with the
Insteon app that's available both for
iOS and Android devices we're not the
biggest fans of this app it's not as
strong or well-designed as other ones
like it but it does do the job well so
right here I've got the bulb in action
and this kind of cheap flimsy flex lamp
it's a heavy bulb at 6.2 ounces so it
barely holds it up but here we go if we
turn this on and hit the studio lamp
button here I can turn it off and on
remotely using my smart phone but not
only can I turn it on if I hit this plus
sign on the app I can scroll up and down
and get the exact percentage I want so I
can make it dim I can make it bright I
can set it exactly where I want which is
a nice feature so we've seen how it
stacks up as a smart device but how does
the inst ule d-- bulb stack up as a
light bulb well it's an 8 watt LED bulb
and that's a pretty good number pretty
average for that class it's efficient
and using those 8 Watts it shines as
bright as a 60 watt incandescent light
Insteon actually says 60 to 100 watts we
think is probably the lower end of that
scale it's a little bit dimmer than we
would like it's not bad but it's not
enough to light up a whole room I would
say the Insteon bulb has a CRI number of
82 now what the heck does that mean
CRI stands for color rendering index and
that is an average think of it as like a
GPA for your light bulb and instead of
different
grades and different classes it's
getting different grades for colors so
out of one to 100 scale it's getting
graded on how accurately it can make a
red look and then how accurately can it
make green look and yellow-green and all
these different shades of different
colors and then it a verge of those
together and you get a number so in this
case that number is 82 and that's pretty
good that's a pretty higher end score
you want something in the 80s for a bowl
but you're gonna spend more than the
bargain price on the bottom line is that
this is a great device at a great price
now I know $30 for one LED light bulb
might seem a bit outrageous but there
are actually non smart LED bulbs it cost
20 or 25 and this stacks up nicely with
them plus it's got all the home
automation functionalities so it's a
great deal and it comes to the two-year
warranty which is nice and reassuring so
I say for home Automator is using entity
ons network it's a very smart buy for
CNET I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
