pretty McFly I'm Bridget Carey this is
your CNET update Nike has plenty of
high-tech ways to track your workout but
its latest tech breakthrough is really
just about looking cool the company
revealed a brand new self-lacing
sneakers called the hyperadapt 1.0 and
the self-lacing triggers when the heel
of your foot hits a sensor inside of
course the concept was first introduced
in 1989 in the movie Back to the Future
Part 2 where Marty McFly sports a pair
of Air Mags with power laces nike made a
version of this famous shoe last year
shown off by Michael J Fox to raise
money for his Parkinson's foundation and
those mags are still coming but this
hyperadapt shoe is different it'll also
be sold later this year we don't have a
price but you can be sure it won't come
cheap you have to charge it every two
weeks and it uses inductive charging
that means you may have to touch a
special surface instead of needing to
plug it in it comes in three colors and
if you want the shoe it'll first only be
sold to Nike Plus members Nike Plus is
the company's app for super fans and the
app is getting a refresh this June it
ties into the Nike Plus run in training
clubs for fitness tracking and sneaker
fans get access to shop before others
and it can be used to also find a nearby
store it can feel like we're
oversaturated with Fitness wearables to
monitor emotion and heart rates but one
company is taking a slightly different
more serious medical approach to
tracking a live course building a sensor
that is inside an Apple watch wrist
strap it's called the cardia band the
company makes fda-approved EKG tech for
mobile devices and it's now run by
victim d'autre a former vice president
at Google the company says this will
discreetly capture your EKG or
electrocardiogram any time you touch the
sensor so it can detect abnormalities
like arrhythmia and send that data to a
doctor if you rather go for something
more casual for your health tracking
with style the watchmaker fossil has
come out with these new bracelets called
the fossil cue motion it looks a whole
lot like the misfit ray but
like the Rhea fossils cannot be worn as
a pendant it's only for your wrist the
battery lasts six months and it's
water-resistant the q motion costs $95
it comes out in the US this summer
fossil also has some new Android wear
smartwatches coming later this year
there's the cube Marshall and Q wander
but neither have a heart rate sensor
that's it for this tech news update you

studios in new york I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
