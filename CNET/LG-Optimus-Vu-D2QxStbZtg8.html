editor at cnet com i'm here at mobile
congress in barcelona i want to show you
the LG optimus view this is one of the
few phones LG has announced here this
would call in a half phone half tablet
or phablet territory as we like to call
it so that means it's going to be bigger
than a usual phone it's actually a 55
inch screen so going to be a lot bigger
than what you sold in your hands it is
pretty slim it's only eight point five
millimeters so you can put in your
pocket pretty well of course it's going
to take up a lot of room but as far as a
coat pocket like my jacket cup pocket
right here it fits very well besides the
usual the virtual keyboard and a phone
dialer as you you're used to has
actually a notebook you can draw you can
make node so very much the same
experience as you saw on you see in some
tablets and the galaxy note is you can
certainly type you can use a keyboard
but then you can use this stylist as
well the back has a little bit of a
textured cover just have a bit of a
plastic feel which i'm not totally in
love with but the phone is comfortable
feeling in the hands feels a little
bottom heavy so when i was using it it
feels like it was kind of kind of fall
for it a bit but that's a minor
complaint would it make a big deal out
of it what's great about this phone
really is that display I think it's
gorgeous really like the resolution and
do like it and I think is that your size
is really going to be a personal choice
but if you're into this kind of size you
think it's cool then definitely check
this out I'm Ken chairman at mobile
Congress 2012 with the LG optimus view
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
