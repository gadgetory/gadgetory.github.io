actors who have played Batman you know
what I'm in a ranking mood we're gonna
make this a top seven actors who played
Batman number seven is George Clooney
this wasn't Clooney's fault he plays a
great tough guy
check out from dusk till dawn the blame
falls on director Joel Schumacher number
six is Val Kilmer Kilmer was an okay
departure from Michael Keaton's run as
Batman
wisey number six the blame falls on
director Joel Schumacher now let's get
to the top five at number five is Ben
Affleck okay the movie is not even out
yet but I'm ranking Ben Affleck higher
on this list then both Clooney and
Kilmer a flex delivery of lines as
Batman and the Batman vs Superman
trailers is way better than anything
Kilmer or Clooney ever did as bad people
will the movie be any good I don't know
at number 4 is Adam West the 60s Batman
series might have been really really
hokey but West did his best to deliver
some really goofy lines as seriously as
possible sure the series reduced Batman
to a joke but West managed to be less
silly than George Clooney he did at
number 3 is Michael Keaton Tim Burton's
casting of Michael Keaton as Batman was
controversial at the time
how was Beetlejuice couldn't be the
Batman and you know what he was really
really good he might have been a better
Bruce Wayne than Batman his Bruce Wayne
is a tiny bit unhinged as he should be
Wayne is a man who dresses as a bat and
fights crime he is unhinged at number 2
Christian Bale this guy can act he was
an excellent Bruce Wayne it was an
excellent Batman was his gruff bat voice
a little over the top
sure but again this is a man who dresses
as a giant bat when Bale was Batman all
you saw was Batman Bale and the Bruce
Wayne character disappeared he's a tough
act to follow and the number one actor
to play Batman is Kevin Conroy you might
not know his name or his face but you
know his voice Kevin Conroy is the voice
of Batman and animated shows like batman
the animated series Justice League and
others Conroy says the people behind
Batman the Animated Series auditioned
over 500 people before he gave it a try
it was also Conroy's idea to use two
distinct voices for Bruce Wayne and
Batman
because since Bruce Wayne is so rich and
famous people would recognize his
and so the kevin conroy legend grows
don't agree with this video let me know
in the comments or argue with me on
twitter i'm matt is I'm always up for
some verbal fisticuffs for more top 5s
