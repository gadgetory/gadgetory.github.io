little bit of a makeover you might want
to check out wonder wolf this is a smart
bluetooth enabled bowtie for your dog
and it also has a lot of smart
functionality it can actually track your
pet steps and the more it moves based on
the accelerometers motion the more
activity it will show on the related
Android and iOS app so if your pet is
resting you can see on the app that is
resting if it's moving more rapidly
you'll see that it's maybe running and
playing and over time you can actually
see if it's getting the amount of steps
it needs in a day so not only would you
have a happy pet because it's getting a
lot of exercise you'll have a
fashionable pet because it has one of
these adorable little bow ties fitness
trackers are not entirely new in the pet
space but this type of little bow tie
device is definitely the cutest one I've
ever seen and this company is also
unveiling something else new here at CES
and it's called wonder meow it's a
similar device available for cats that's
coming out in the fall it also has
bluetooth you'll also be able to track
your cat's activity level but in
addition you'll be able to see what sort
of adventures they get up to throughout
the day this has been the Wonder wolf
bow tie and the Wonder meow bow tie
