the company that made penultimate which
just got acquired by Evernote for an
undisclosed amount we have been here on
the skype and I want to talk to him
briefly about this acquisition first of
all congratulations thank you very so
Ben what are you going to be doing there
over at Evernote now that they've
acquired your business well we're gonna
be we're gonna be taking penultimate
from a one-person shop and and putting a
team behind it and doing a lot of great
things with with Evernote technology
that's that it happened to be really
complementary to what to what
Pendleton's already been doing but this
was really a one-person shop it was you
wrote the thing and ran the business I
did I had I had a I had some help along
the way from some person pretty talented
as geologists are independent freelance
workers along the way but all the all
the sort of product and the product
management and engineering and you know
business stuff was all me so tell us the
history I mean why penultimate how did
it start and win and what was in a
nutshell the trajectory of the app from
vente no all right um it's so so
originally there was an there there used
to be an iphone app that predated
penultimate there was really very much a
hobby project for me I was I like the
idea of digital handwriting and having
ink that looked really much like you
might get from a really nice pen and so
I sort of had as a hobby project but the
ipad was announced in january of i guess
was 2010 now and it sort of it sort of
dawned on me that really this technology
i built the sort of ink technology was
going to make a lot more sense in the
form factor of a tablet it really didn't
make a lot of sense on the phone so the
whole idea all along we said something
very easy to use because I I thought
that it is it's gonna be a mass-market
problem everybody who owns an ipad is
going to want to use something like this
at some point they're gonna have some
need for it was going to be notes in
class or notes at work meetings or is it
going to be keeping track of a keeping
track of plans for things and kind of at
this point uh you know a little while
ago where it sort of the question starts
becoming what's the how do you really
take something this to the next level
like what's the next step
and I've been actually in touch with
Phil Libin of Evernote for a long time
he was an early fan of the app and easy
I got you got to get you got to get
getting on our API like this is a really
natural fit we've got all this great
handwriting technology I integrated with
evernotes API several months ago because
i had users who were rich demanding that
like this was the nose natural fit and i
did it went it was a high-quality
integration and it was really well
received so you know eventually we kind
of realized that really you know
strategically this was a really great
compliment the additional value to is
I'm excited about being here because I
can take some of the type the
penultimate technology and ideas and
sort of ideas to sprinkle them you know
into some of the rest of evernotes
ecosystem and why are some of that
through in a way that makes handwriting
sort of first-class citizen really
within within the Evernote ecosystem
with all the existing kind of products
you know it's interesting a last August
Evernote acquired sketch which was a
very useful screenshot and graphing
graphics application that product to
this day the integration is coming along
but it's moving a little slowly filled
told me in another interview that you
know on the one year anniversary they're
going to make a big splash so I'm
looking forward to that it's it strikes
me that penultimate is much more of a
natural fit with Evernote and deserves
to be integrated far more deeply and
needs to be integrated far more deeply
so how do you navigate that how do you
think you're going to navigate that
inside of Evernote and with a user base
that is probably when they hear about
this news going to say oh for God's
sakes don't change a thing yeah I think
I think it's important to note that like
we're not going to break it and ultimate
you know I think I think Skitch actually
is an interesting model look at and it's
it's a I think it should be reassuring
for for penultimate users have you know
Evernote there's a there's a lot of
value here on what penultimate is and
that and that that makes it that makes
it exciting for me so penultimate sort
of will remain the powerful app that it
is today and you'll be able to continue
to use it you know as you do today if
you like but I think what's really nice
is that as
as you say there are huge opportunities
for going really deep with what with
what ever know it has to offer and what
we're going to do is start plumbing
these really these really powerful
things in and I think that users are
going to be they'll be pleased and I
think actually many cases surprised by
how much more powerful penultimate gets
as a result of this relationship for
people who have applications that I
think might fit into the Evernote
ecosystem or say any other ecosystem
entrepreneurs who into small shops who
have businesses they think deserve to be
made part of a larger business what's
your advice on the process of shopping
your business around and dealing with
the CEO and ultimately joining a larger
team with your your starter product well
I see you know Phil's not hard to deal
with you he's a good guy um the it's you
know I you know for me I it's you know I
would I wouldn't I wouldn't describe you
know what happened was definitely not a
shopping around of the app it was very
clear to me that there was a very
naturally and we already had an
integration you know I'd already sort of
been I already should have been talking
to Phil over a period of time it was
very it became very clear that there was
a really great strategic compliment
there and that and and the the
acquisition that we're announcing today
is just sort of the the the next step in
that basically in an accelerating
accelerating the growth I mean in terms
of you know advice to other two other
entrepreneurs I mean just just as with
any business you know being be in touch
with with people who are in you know in
the industry who are related and who are
interesting do you write who are doing
things that are related things that are
interesting things are complementary
those are always good people to kind of
reach out to and and see if there's
anything interesting there alright well
listen again congratulations on the
acquisition are you going to tell us how
much it was for not disclosing numbers
on it I didn't ask in a sneaky enough
way congratulations on it good luck
there at Evernote do not screw it up
don't screw up Evernote either while
you're at it and we'll look forward to
seeing what you do next thank you it's
very exciting there's a lot of there's a
lot of great stuff coming down the pike
