starts its own programming and cue on
the street the gphone hey there what's
going on in rich demuro with Cena TV and
you have found your way into the queue
let's get you started with your mouse
click moment free electricity from your
phone line this video explaining how
every phone line has a constant flow of
about 40 to 70 volts so the secret guy
behind the camera shows you how to tap
into this free juice by making his own
adapter then hooking it up to an LED
light like flashes when the phone rings
and turns off when the phone is in use
the video causing quite a debate about
the legality of the project probably
wouldn't do that in front of your phone
company installer not content to coal
clips from other programmers sprint now
producing their own cell phone TV shows
the two to three minute shorts are
called sprint exclusive entertainment
the clips feature well known hosts and
focus on sports music and entertainment
news the selections available on demand
and free to anyone with a power vision
data plan of course you have to have a
sprint phone music update hosted by my
favorite former vh1 VJ rachel perry was
wondering where she went moving through
the queue those online streams of
network shows are very popular the
number of us watching them is double
from last year sort of makes sense with
the rise of online video but the main
reason for watching shows online is
convenience and avoiding commercials
although those pre-rolls are impossible
to zap through many consumers use the
free streams to catch up on missed
episodes full episodes now the most
popular content online outs ting news as
the previous number one the top way for
watching broadcasts online are streaming
and free downloads forty percent of us
are getting this stuff the freeway time
for the beta what a relief when instant
messaging like meebo broke free of its
software roots now tokbox is hoping to
do the same for video chat the simple
website lets anyone with a webcam talk
live with friends and they could be in
quote no matter where they are or what
system they're on just sign up for a
username and send a link to your friends
again could be in quotes once they click
your connected you can even embed a
video chat player on your way
site blog or even Facebook there are no
downloads and best of all it's all free
now I had to try this out I embedded a
video chat player my facebook profile
and it seems pretty cool because every
time I try to video chat the person on
the other side has an incompatible
client for some reason very cool stuff
we'll have to watch this one finally q
on the street you can't help but wonder
about the gphone mark the intern here in
Times Square so Apple released the
iphone just a few months ago but now
Google is rumored to be releasing their
own version of a smartphone but the
question is what features would people
want to see most in a smart phone
pictures good quality fixtures I'll use
it for downloading music just the press
a button you can have food delivered to
your house so what are you looking for
on the gphone the sim card like for
every cell phone I would like to have a
qwerty keyboard and be able to get
online I would want to call out of the
country for free that's all for this Q
I'm rich demuro with CNN TV don't forget
to join us on facebook see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
