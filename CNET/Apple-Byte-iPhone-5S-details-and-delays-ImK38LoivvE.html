contain scenes that some viewers may
find disturbing like Brian tongs face
and are intended for a slightly more
mature audience it's such a great day
and like I told him that's not delivery
that's dujour for real baby that tickles
it makes me warm hey BTW what's up okay
BTW get a room right what's up Brian
song here and welcome to the Apple by
the show where a piece of fruit is the
number one topic now lots of news this
week and we start off with the official
announcement from the big a that WWDC
2013 is happening June the 10th through
the 14th in San Francisco at the moscone
center now last year brought the debut
of the macbook pro with retina display
but Tim Cook hinted that we won't see
any new hardware anytime soon during
Apple's recent earnings report he said
our teams are hard at work on some
amazing new hardware software and
services we can't wait to introduce this
fall and throughout 2014 and we've been
aching for just something new but Cook
said fall not summer but that time of
the season where leaves change colors
and fall so maybe we get a peek at iOS 7
and OS 10 10.9 hello kitty and that just
might be it you're just going to have to
be patient and yes it leaves plenty of
time for analysts to make up even better
rumors that's also the same week as e3
2013 so I have to decide will I be
playing with the new xbox and
playstation with booth babes giving me
constant attention or will I be here for
you the Apple biters for iOS 7 and no
new hardware you guys these are tough
personal promise people now we mentioned
apples recent earnings report and the
Cupertino kids were fueled by strong
iphone and ipad sales that were eighty
eight percent and 151 percent better
than the year before but apple reported
their first year-over-year decline in
it's in a decade and lower expectations
for this quarter with the lack of new
hardware you know whatever they're
holding back better be good now we did
get some other nuggets from the Q&amp;amp;A
session Tim Cook left the door open for
the possibility of a larger iPhone
saying he believes the iphone 5 still
has the best display in the industry and
competitors have made trade-offs to ship
a larger display you know one's like a
larger viewing area less reflective
display in a much higher pixel density
now cook adds that apple will not ship a
larger display while these trade-offs
exist or really until the next iPhone
comes out and let's be honest here 3.5
inches was the perfect size to apple
before four inches was perfect to Apple
and the next size will be even more
perfect term but apples behind here and
fall means there's a huge window of time
for android phones to make some ground
now Cook was also asked about mobile
payments and NFC functionality has been
a rumor feature but apple's CEO said i
think it's in its infancy I think it's
just getting started just out of the
starting block he's right and mobile
payments still have tons of hurdles but
remember there used to be a company that
came up with inventive solutions for
technology and just put it out there I
think the name of that company was Apple
yeah no I think it was so hopefully they
can show us something in the fallen
that's after Google shows off what
they've been working on in May all right
let's take a quick break for our App of
the Week
this one's just a fun one I know a lot
of you love Instagram but you should try
out two apps called insta weather and
insta place they're free with ads where
they have a 99-cent version and just
find where you want to take a picture
you can then swipe through a variety of
different overlays and pick the one you
want insta weather gives you the weather
details and insta place allows you to
choose your location take your picture
with the information displayed or
customize the text and then you can
publish it on your different social
media platforms it's quick and simple
and too cool apps for you the picture
phone lovers on iOS and Android as well
so that's a useful one but how about a
personal one of my own that I use you
guys have to check out how to get a girl
it's free and it gives you a really good
lessons like how to be confident tell
yourself I must succeed I don't want to
be alone anymore or how to create
encounters step 1 even if she's not
attracted by you she might be pleased
with your charm and have a look at you
yeah and trust me it totally worked for
me what do you know no that's what I
told me to do not the right way no the
hell that's not what I meant by a Rome
see like I said works like a charm all
right let's get to some other stories we
showed you rumored iPad 5 cases from
tactus calm last week and now they've
added a picture of the inside of the
rear shell of the ipad 5 they should
just build this thing already now they
also revealed an image of the alleged
rear shell for the rumored lower-cost
iPhone the part appears to be plastic
and consistent with how other sites have
described the design with a flat back
and curved edges taxes claims it will
launch on October 15th but we'll see how
that holds up Reuters also reports that
the next-gen iphone is potentially
facing delays after manufacturers
expected to start production in June
their Taiwan supply chain source claims
that Apple was trying to find a coating
material that did not interfere with
their fingerprint
sensor technology believed to be part of
the next-gen design and this may be one
of the reasons for the delay Reuters
also says a Japanese supplier has told
them small-scale production for the
lower-cost iPhone will begin sometime in
May and Reuters adds the lower-cost
iPhone we use the same 4-inch display as
the iphone 5s but will lack the
fingerprint sensor and have a plastic
case alright guys let's get to our
giveaway winners for a copy of injustice
