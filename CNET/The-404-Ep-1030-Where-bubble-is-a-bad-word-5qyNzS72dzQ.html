you've tuned into the poor for show on
cnet TV i'm jeff bakalar and i am Justin
you this is the show where a bubble is a
bad word bubble is a bad word Roble is a
bad word according to a good friend and
aunt Jill Schlesinger on the show today
what's up Angie round of applause you
got that in stereo today I love that huh
what's a great job hi i'm in i can't
wait a minute she's alright she's
alright to sit next to me dude has been
like what a forever fab you months you
know I don't know what happened we were
on that every three weeks schedule
everyone broke that I may have I may
have because of the particular travel
incident but yeah maybe we'll just go to
like in every other thing I think we
could do some we'll figure something out
I thought you had won the lottery or
something entirely without telling
anybody I know and had I won that
lottery you know I would be the person
who would definitely not show up for
work would you invest in the 404 though
I might take it public I took the 404
public you know what all I'm waiting for
is for you guys to come up with an idea
and I can ride on your coattails that's
what I've been waiting for so I read
about this whole Instagram nonsense y
esta gran and the ground instagram
instagram 3000 and all I could think
about was why are my guys not hooking me
up I can be employee number 14 yeah I
would be so psyched these dudes like you
guys have way better ideas than that I
don't know if we have better ideas yeah
thing is is that great ideas are
everywhere I know it's putting them into
practice in making them work because no
idea that pops in someone's head the
final product never matches up to that
yet instrum wasn't the first person they
were the first company to have this
photo sharing idea yeah right like we
were taking about path and and Nate but
but instagram has executed it right but
i will point out is the money person
yeah there's no revenues right yeah zero
so you don't make money to have any
money here's a billion you know what
they've made a billion dollar they did
make a billion now I we were trying to
our heads around this insane number ya a
billion dollars right now you know draw
something the people that that company
OMG pop they got bought four to 10 yep
it just seems is it me and maybe you can
bring us down to reality yeah is it me
or are things being way over value it
feels a little bubblicious that's good
then that's why we're shoujo but you
know what's so weird about the bubble is
there are real companies that do have
revenue right that are inflating the
bubble like right the evil Facebook
Empire okay because you know it's like
they feel like their kids that have
piles and piles of money and don't know
what to do with him yeah I don't want to
diss my girl sheryl sandberg cuz i have
a girl crush on her oh you do yeah cuz
you know she's the only grown-up at that
company oh I didn't okay she is she
really the oldest probably I'm pretty
sure she's a jolly 40 Nancy she's like
45 i think by like 20 years okay but you
know what's interesting is you know why
would they pay a billion dollars for
this long because they have a so much
money anyway that's burning a hole in
their pocket a billion dollar i think
they said we're paying 500 million
dollars for the company i think that was
the last valuation they did a deal like
five minutes before this deal right and
then they figured and we'll pay 500
million dollars for these two guys cuz
they'll end up being competition with us
so let's let's get them let's buy talent
let's go out it's like a it's like an
NHL contract like you know let's go get
Johnny tavaris he's awesome let's
overpay for him it doesn't matter we
want him and we don't want someone else
to happen if someone used hockey to
explain all of life's issues I would be
a genius that's it would be so we be on
it we're saying is that's how you should
learn math that's it that's right all
right don't eject but so the thing
that's so interesting about this deal is
is it a sign of a bubble that basically
Facebook has created or the venture
capital guys have created or is it a
sign that they're being really clever by
you know two million miles that they're
saying we know what we have in our
pipeline we know what we can do with
this we are gonna make a crapload of
money we're going to go public and
everyone thought Google was a bubble
right and look at it now I mean it is
you think about it's unbelievable to
imagine and people say apples a bubble
Apple by the way yesterday did something
phenomenal it broke through six hundred
billion dollars of market capitalization
now
let me just what's that mean let me give
you that I was going to define them so
market capitalisation you take the
shares the number of shares that are
outstanding for any company can you
multiplied by share price so be whatever
x 500 right ok so their market
capitalisation poked right through six
hundred billion yesterday you know how
many other companies have reached that
too uh one in the United States a little
exam what little company called
Microsoft Oh in 1999 oh my god so now
you start talking more impressive right
so it was six hundred billion dollars in
1999 bring that to me is more impressive
suppose night that you know to uh what
13 years ago that money is not worth as
much as a true but you know you also
might say uh-oh that means bubble right
and so the time this is the thing about
bubbles you never know you can keep
getting bigger and bigger but there are
these companies are making money it's a
little different than the internet
bubble where you had companies that
weren't making money facebook makes
money Apple makes money facebook just
started to make right yeah but you know
I think once they go public it's going
to be almost like the shareholders are
gonna say you got to make money right
and Google's making money so there's a
lot of companies that are actually going
up in value that are making money
contrast that with the 90s the late 90s
and early 2000s at like you know pets
com right oh my god remember the sock
pics are the best it was awesome and you
know they had no money and it was going
crazy now i will say i think there's a
bubble in some of these private deals
right but who cares on some level it's
their problems not our problem right and
you're it's only a problem you're a
facebook shareholder eventually and they
keep spending like drunken sailors with
nothing to show for it it did seem I
don't want to say irresponsible but it
does seem a little outlandish almost
just uh yeah careless yeah well it
seemed like it was just blank you money
almost right yeah you know I felt like
it was like wow but you couldn't cut a
better deal I'm surprised they did it at
Instagram and not at Pinterest or
something yeah can you talk to me about
these other things usually other
companies that are being mentioned and I
don't know anything about them so you
need to educate me so a Pinterest which
I probably on
stand the least out of all these
enormous uh or like insanely popular
overnights runaway success stories
pictures is is a way and correct me if
I'm wrong Justin because I know you have
an idea about it too okay I mean we all
know what it is it's it's basically like
a virtual bulletin board that get able
to share with people and pose to and
express things in a certain theme that
you're into sure that's sort of like the
best way I can explain it path is kind
of like a facebook timeline but very
detailed and unique to yourself we're in
it it sort of brings in all of these
different elements like a Foursquare
element you can sort of check in
anywhere pal kising also was in the
beginning I think they limited your
social circle to 50 users you could only
share your photos with 50 okay and then
I think in the second update they
updated that 150 okay they're
advertising themselves is like an anti
photos social network really the thing
is is like in you can follow someone's
path so you can literally like they can
say like oh i woke up at this time I I'm
here with these friends I checked in
here I like this here's a photo and it's
like this never ending trail or path we
should sort of comical trail that's
right arm and that's sort of what it is
you know it's fascinating just played
people playing games with themselves and
yeah and convincing them that they're
more important than they really go
basket really cares about this i mean
i'm not i mean i guess if you are a
Hollywood star and you are you fall you
love this person oh I love Bieber he's
great and you don't want to know
everything he's doing but really
generally speaking why does anybody care
about this for real you've got to tell
me because I can barely like even
imagine why people care about things on
Facebook they mostly don't you know but
I'm just saying that like why do we need
that that instant almost like update a
dialogue of life I think that was the
core of why facebook became so popular
is that people I think a driving force
of it is is one people just they wanna
lie clerk and they want to get laid nice
it is true like I wanna like get closer
to someone who they can have and sort of
create relationships with people and
just sort of plant seeds and do what
they got to do
think at the crux of it yeah that's what
it is right and then a lot of it is also
you know don't wrong there's other
amazing things that have sort of evolved
at a facebook with you know people
getting to share their their likes and
dislikes and opinions and so I think
what my face i mighta many different
silos on Facebook sharing their location
what they're listening to the news also
i think it's like so dangerous i have to
say is like the nervous you know Nelly
here the paranoid Jewess i would like to
say that you know like I don't really
want my nieces and my nephew's doing
anything like that where people know
where they are I completely read them
the riot act about security on Facebook
don't you be careful about what you're
writing and you're fine a college now a
college can do you know because it's
dangerous number one and there's a bunch
of crazy wackadoodle zout and i think
that's the reason why people are sort of
upset and threatening to leave instagram
now that Facebook's bought them because
the worried that their location
information that they provide geo tags
on Instagram yeah that's gonna get sold
to Facebook advertisers yeah and then
where as before when they were just a
start-up it was like a very much a user
company brain chip now there's an
advertiser being involved and you got
imagine that's gotta be the driving
force I mean at the end of they could
say oh they threw a billion dollars at
Instagram like morons but there's a
method I use their butt and they're
buying information about people it's 27
million users it's not like I mean how
many Facebook have 1 800 million now and
I didn't almost at eight-fifty my god
it's crazy it's gonna be one in six
people on earth basically an and how
many people I mean that how many people
really use it because you know there are
people who have Facebook pages that
don't look at them well how many active
users do you think they're I don't know
I think they claim the active is like
kind of close to that really all right I
think so I don't know has anyone here
let's just go do an update since the
whole facebook IPO story anyone clicked
on an ad recently on face I've still to
this day never clicked on operation go
to our graves saying we will only by
mistake break what whoops yeah that
thingie very close it yes and then below
yeah yeah on now my latest rant of this
day is about LinkedIn okay yeah
whatwhat's why did I do that yes on
because some water
stupid of me it is silly and I know
every single career person has said that
we interview on the show you know looked
it's terrible jobs crisis I don't want
to underestimate this we've 12.7 million
people that are out of work we are so
it's like it's such a horrible thing in
this economy to have that right you guys
know people that are out of work I know
people are at work and so this is
probably a really good thing to connect
I am immediately repulsed by the whole
concept because I'm an old-time
networker so I pick up the phone and I
schmooze and I take people on the line
literally rub elbows I rub the gimme
your elbow was far away Richard give me
really literally rub elbows there you go
you know rub elbows because let's do
that was pretty hot if you gotta admit
though that the okay so if the core
driving force behind facebook is sex
yeah the core driving the driving behind
linkedin is money yeah well or a job so
let's just say job okay but that's money
that's money but um but the thing that's
weird about it is all these weirdo
people that come out of the woodwork and
you know what by the way let me just say
that I did a little bit of surfing on
linkedin when before I realize that
you're you when you go look at someone's
profile they know it oh shut up I did a
very bad thing and I had to like this I
was like oh no wait a minute it shows
other people when you're lurking on ya
yes it does JDate yeah it says this
person who's looked at your profile and
so I made that mistake exactly one time
ladies and gentlemen where I went and
like I did something bad I looked at
somebody I was like that was so stupid I
shouldn't have done that well I learned
my lesson learning more tonight if you
look at their page but don't add them as
a contact it still tells you oh my god
that's not right isn't that crazy it
wasn't worse I'm hoping maybe I am wrong
i'm hoping the wrong he was the chat
room to figure that every journey
mistress i got the riches like I've been
holding this secret for a while that's
like that is so crazy is it right and so
famous that's immediately I was like
first of all it's me it becomes a little
bit obsessive compulsive because you're
like who's looking at me yeah right no I
don't like that at all and then you may
and I made this one mistake and I'm so
bummed out you know what is so bad about
it
I went and looked at some at somebody
that my significant other day that is
the worst that is so bad that was such a
stalking week oh my god you showed your
colors right there I know what I mean is
that bad you're not the only one that's
done that though most people just take
it on Facebook right yeah well that's
where you should had yeah uh who knew
who knew Richard Richard Richard you
held back to summation anyway I did it
that one time and now it's like she
knows that I've look at her oh it's
having active linkedin profile the same
as maintaining an online dating profile
when you're in a relationship you mean
like is it kind of weird to current
employers to see that you have a
LinkedIn profile that you keep updating
well I think that it could be I think
the thing it's a little bit weird about
it you're shopping yourself out exactly
have a job but but i also think at the
same time so is your boss you know
anyway everyone who everybody's on it i
think in the beginning it was a little
bit more like oh you know usually and
then you should be very careful about
what you put on linkedin especially if
you are employed right but i cannot tell
you the number of people who came out of
the woodwork and also by the way i did
the same thing i was like a woman
linkedin i thought was like twitter i'm
like i gotta get a bunch of people in my
key circles now like take that damn
thing down yes sirs waste a freakin time
oh my god i I mean I really Mady
activate the account how many people who
are talent do you think actually been
found got new jobs on linkedin yeah I
don't think the another post of XYZ like
Oh Charlie Rose oh well let's get andys
tumbling did that same Oprah's on
linkedin yeah it's almost you're almost
sort of uh selling yourself short by
being on I'm right yeah my mind is dirty
lose you have to leave em o'neill's for
other people and get testimonials on
your page like I said it's cheapening
the whole networking legitimizing it or
use it not whoring it is a little bit as
animals is that my god losing schmoozing
and that sort of talent of doing that
and being personable and sociable is
something that should not be you know
taken less seriously just by throwing it
all yeah and I think it's sort of an
interesting thing I mean I know people
have probably gotten connect
through that linkedin but i also wonder
like really who gets a job that way i'll
tell how people get a job my friend
Eddie calls me up one day and he says I
got this younger guys friend of mine
he's in his like 32 years old he's been
in financial services kids struggling
you gotta talk to him yeah I go take the
kid out to lunch because he's a friend
of my friend another lunch you picking
up your unbelievable unbelievable it's
right I'm gonna get paid back in space
on though I'm going to heaven i'm going
to employment heaven yeah take the kid
out for lunch we're chatting so nice and
he's just he's working at a big
companies going nowhere right but he's
hard-working he's smart okay so i called
my come out of lunch i call my friend
Michael I said hey Michael he owns a
financial services company see you
looking for anybody cuz yeah actually
I'm interviewing right now I send the
kid over there two months later kids
work started working this week there
it's who you know it's like an end and
that was that was off linkedin yeah it
was all flaunt all on like that you know
how's that kid gonna get that job right
it's got to be a personal connection so
if you're looking for a job I will say
this really work that network and don't
just work at an electronic Network like
talk to people and don't ask people for
stuff give them stuff right I feel like
people when yay they hear the word
networking ignore that not the bar
because I do hate the word yeah but it
doesn't it's not transparent enough it's
not what it means networking is not
networking as when you first hear like
when I heard I was in college or like
you got a network you got a network that
means getting drunk with people right
which is also great it's true and making
friends with people that's it being nice
and doing nice things for people exactly
may do nice things Manning any bridges
he's got a mean right for sure right so
like that guy from Goldman Sachs who
wrote the op-ed I would never hire that
guy even if he was right about
everything he said work though why he
sold a book for a million bucks who's
gonna buy that dumb book one cares well
he already so he sold it those million
dollars it's not enough to do any it's
not speaking of a million dollars you
can talk about the Powerball thing yeah
and you wrote a very interesting piece
on what to do it was it when you in the
lottery because you are you oh I can't
remember what I wet my head what if you
win okay you thank god i'm so i should
have been when when you win cuz you are
gonna win so this was the most fun thing
to write because when i was an
investment advisor I
had a client who won the lottery yeah so
he was among how much did they win well
let me just give you the prep the
preface it okay so wasn't my client guy
comes in with his wife and he's gonna
interview me and say I mean I heard you
on the radio and I want to come higher
your comment that's only that's right
but seriously I one of business right he
comes in we have a whole conversation
you know tell me about what's going on
the kids college education maybe we need
more insurance very low key yeah lovely
and then did he break it out and at the
end of the conversation I said so do you
have any any other questions for me and
I just explained i said here's how we
would go forward if you want us to work
we can do this we can do this we can do
this you could do this for yourself i
said you don't need me to do this he's
is one more thing mmm he says we're
coming into a little bit of money a
little I said really have like what I
miss I'm sorry did someone pass away cuz
actually my wife won the lottery oh my
head I said really how much the lottery
was for 80 million dollars oh what a
hobby and their lump sum after tax they
had 23 million dollars oh wait that's it
well it does you know what the when you
see 640 no I know it's not so it is it's
basically that's if you took the stream
of payments over a certain married but
you can also get a lump sum right so the
long time is less so for the 640 was
something like what five no no was four
okay so like say hi threes actually and
then they basically take fifty percent
of yeah oh you gotta pay taxes so so my
client so this project I was shocked
right so they talking it was what 22 23
million okay so I say in that great
moment of honesty get the black out of
here you are the lottery and so my rates
just went up yes I'm really nice and the
guy said to me you know I'd I
interviewed a whole bunch of people yeah
and this has been a great test for us
because we hold back the information we
see how people react to us as if we're
just regular people and then we tell
them this and they told me how many
people they had interviewed and they're
not working with and then they said okay
we're gonna work with you we're gonna
give you all our money amazing and I
said okay you're not gonna do that
that's crazy you can't get 23 million
dollars 21 advisors and you know I'm
gonna call up this guy he's a really
good friend of mine you're gonna give
him money you're gonna give me money
give another guy money you're gonna like
did what that's what they
that's smart and crazy so then I use
that as the basis of writing this
because I learned a lot from them and
and kind of the whole experience it was
right raisa are you so so people who won
this last one yeah they came into
hundreds of millions of yeah well it'll
be slowed up right because it's one
waiting to greet people in one and
another but let's just say that for all
intents and purposes let's just pretend
that each got a hundred million dollars
that's just like six people got a
hundred million bucks yeah right and
then they have to ask the question do I
take a stream of income do I take a
certain amount of money every year right
or do I take a lump sum hmm now the good
news is if you take a lump sum you got
the money right right that's cool I feel
like that's what you should do well
financially it makes better sense just
because who knows how long we live and
who know well it's a 20 it was a for
this particular lotteries 28 years they
did an annuity my client no my clients
okay age of the lump sum and paid their
taxes right now the problem is when you
have a lump sum you can blow it right
and so there's all this research about
lotteries that lottery winners are broke
within like five years what does that
mean I've does not just mean that
lottery winners are stupid yeah I think
that's what that means like stupid
people in the lobby no but it could you
see those shows on TLC and it's like the
lottery ruined my life yeah because they
well first of all it's cuz you go crazy
right it's insanity right and you bought
the Texas Rangers right right so close
that were you like oh yeah I really
thought it was a great idea to open a
laundromat yeah with my gangster cousin
right fantastic idea I gave him a
million dollars so uh so sometimes the
stream of income is a really cool thing
you see I never have to think about it
right but for people who are not stupid
for people who are not stupid it is
probably better financially to have
control of the money but then you've got
control the money and you've got to
invest it and you've got to hire people
to manage your money and you've got to
really go through and decide how you're
going to live your life and it's in very
intense it was nice to watch these
people go through it and see the
decisions they made no I would not be
one of those people who would go to work
the next day but I think having a job is
a very good idea even if you want a
hundred million dollars even it well
even if you said you know what I want a
hundred million dollars let's just play
this out I got a hundred million dollars
and then after lump sum after taxes i
ended up with 30 million dollars man
that is that really your losing seventy
percent is there it's probably pretty
close really yeah because if you got a
hundred million and then you took the
lump sum which is probably 60 and then
you pay your taxes is 30 depending on
where you like I thought a hundred was
after that was actually a lump sum I
would just saying six people 100 million
all right right yes the mix so now you
have 30 million dollars which is pretty
awesome and so maybe what you would say
is I'm gonna take 20 million and I'm
gonna invest that for the rest of my
life I'm set and you could do that
safely safely without going crazy a lot
of money yeah never live your life and
now you're gonna say well five million
I'm gonna blow I'm just because you know
you're gonna blow it that's tough to
blow 50 no it's not what I like a high
if you've got my house okay right you
could but you're like you could be like
okay I'm gonna buy an apartment in the
city right and a house of the Jersey
Shore sure done done by Langham but you
could blow five min on one place in
exactly or you know whatever so you get
but let's just say you imagine you're
gonna blow some amount of right then
wouldn't it be cooled he said okay the
other five million I'm gonna start my
own personal foundation I'm gonna give
money away I'm gonna work really hard at
this that's gonna be my job yeah that's
my job I'm gonna like be really that'd
be cool to me I would uh I would
continue to come to work and see how
long it takes to get fired really cuz
that would be awesome because I would be
like I have 30 million dollars sitting
in the back I'm going to you collect
like your boobs at work but just like
not do anything baby whatchu but maybe
what you would do is you'd say okay
about 20 million dollars it's in the
bank cool it's cool and I'm gonna spend
a couple million and then I'm gonna take
three million i'm going to start my own
business i'm sure all my own beautiful
podcast you do Justin I got to pay him a
salary Richard I got to pay his side
Jill of course has to get a bigger
salaries also get a slice of the power
I'm and you and you start saying like
I'm gonna run a business yeah and you
allocate some money to do that you do
something you're really passionate about
it okay be too young right I don't know
yeah you wouldn't be bored really good
day I don't know be like bye you know
what even though he be like I'm buying
the jersey devils yeah farm team no farm
team the Albany river rat yeah you
because you'd be a river at I wouldn't
buy them i bet i would i would try I
don't know what
I would do yeah I would just give money
to the NHL and be like just take care of
me the rest of my life you could buy one
of the things I put at the end of the
plug post is that you know in the very
beginning you wouldn't want to block you
want to blow some money but you wanna
but it's very small amount right so I
said you know you got to keep your first
splurge under a hundred grand yeah okay
and then so now I put some ideas up for
people like your first splurge under a
hundred grand let's go around the room
right so you'll see in mind so Justin
you have it up there at the very bottom
yes so I say things like you know you do
to me I thought like these i was working
with a bunch of guys up at cbsnews com
we all picked one so i picked what you
which you would imagine is I said I
wanted a fully outfitted Mini Cooper you
know like fun it's like 30 35 grand just
a fun thing to do then somebody said I
want tickets to all the premier sporting
events for the year that's that's why I
like that what else is up there can we
see what you had weekly massages for two
great years that was Allen's that was a
good party good pen ran an African
safari for the entire family of four
like now yeah so that's pretty good so
that's a lot of money right to just tell
me I'd you know I'm saying like a fun
splurge yep you have money you're not
gonna make it a crazy you're not gonna
buy a house with it I don't think a
hundred grand is enough for a first
place what do you want to do for her if
it when you say a hundred gram you think
a car like I could do a car car to me
like I mean there's a lot one guy said
oh I want a blob you know what we first
he said a Ferrari i'm like sorry 300
grand ya gettin so i would i think i
would recreate my own personal amazing
arcade like reality by like you're a
child yeah yeah but like really rare
pinball and i would have that you have a
man cave like Noah but where did you
build that wouldn't you want to buy a
house first and then make a rule this is
his first thing you put your body
parents have I put that in storage until
and then I've my big thing would be like
a ridiculous pen azman yeah like
realistic like 5,000 square feet nice
like ridiculous see I would not move out
of my apartment I really wouldn't i
might buy like in it and that means
you're par- delivery no but it's a sick
place i really don't but it just like
that wouldn't be the thing i would want
it you got invited me over i'll tell you
whether or not you ever seen alright
that's fine the water's be I you guys I
souped-up me super
it's a convertible that's fun and all
that very just lame I would take myself
and to my friends on a trip to France
and we would ride the root of the Tour
de France that's cool a couple of
brand-new bikes and like kids for that
trip great that would be awesome I think
those are great i think experiences if
there's all this research is called
behavioral finance yes so crazy and
interesting it's like the intersection
of economics and psychology yeah and
this guy dan Ariely has done amazing
research and he says here's the deal
when you spend money on an experience
like that it is you sort of get a better
bang for your buck than buying your tree
right your your your car your this or
that but like the experience of doing
these things is off has a longer lasting
positive effect I'm telling you I
understand it's an intangible some
people i was with you right decision I
know what it was it Richard will be a
man would you do well the first thing I
thought was like buy a sports car but
like you said that if they get a Ferrari
or something that's like 300,000 by the
way does he have the greatest voice it
doesn't a very soothing oh my god oh I
feel like I'm address after hours yeah
yeah it's the quiet storm excellent what
would you buy so maybe I do like a trip
around the world like just take like the
rest of the year just a dream like every
country may be sick that would be
awesome really cool I think it would be
really awesome to like I the first thing
I thought of when I went you know of
course we were talking about when we win
you know I'd homines it's gonna happen
that's gonna happen I said you know what
I would do if because especially the
time I'm like I would take two months
off and rent a villa in Tuscany mmm
chill out for two months nice that
sounds awesome hasta yeah whatever get i
get a coat yeah i would i would do like
the personal trainer that was sort of
thing you know i would definitely do
that all right what if I have all this
money then what's the what's the one
service person you want like you know
Oprah has like a trainer a cook dad that
you know so good is gonna be up there I
think a cook is awesome good just
because you know personal shopper maybe
I could do that for you a straight-up
manager to take care of your daily
day-to-day BS yeah cuz when you got a
lot of money they're clear a lot of
promise you want a bum you know I'm not
like met daily manager I like a cookie I
think to be a good
to go shopping for you cuz you know in
New York it's like the biggest pain in
the neck right of course I in turn that
would pretty much do all of that so yeah
wait a minute in today's get an intern
oh yes they have to pay it in yeah I
think we're at the pay that comes from
CBS I don't oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah yeah
we have a budget of zero dollars haha no
video video video that's video video
video did you continue to do the 404 FBI
what no you wouldn't let me the online
no I wait a second CBS would own the 404
we have to change the name and she
turned around right fine or we could buy
the 404 from CBS sure cool to dollar and
then we're fine to Dallas 50 not a
dollar yeah and I happen like that all
right um should we take a break and take
a break all right when we come back some
questions will get asked and Jill will
answer stick around there's a lot more
404 right after this this is the 404 Mr
effers the show where we all sing songs
hey day millions of dollars pouring into
the hands of the American worker now in
the mind of the average worker live two
separate personalities one look Christy
wait a bit ready you're going to save a
bit of a parent you are one oftentimes
idle money burns a hole in your pocket
which brings up the other personality
let's encrypt
I see chat come on with me actually have
a censored oh I got a couple of good
feet but lady I've got some bitter deeds
important ones too when every American
should pay his or her income tax gladly
and proudly this year thanks to Hitler
and Hirohito taxes are higher than ever
before will you have enough money on
hand to meet your payments when they
told you yeah we think carry that need
it yeah what you do not want to forget
our fighting men do you refer then
you'll have to stop Steven right away to
me aerotek statement listen shall stand
it it's your toe yeah Wow hey lady it's
you do but it's your war to you must
save for victory
welcome back to the 404 show that was
some interesting that cool so explain
well so the the IRS the Internal Revenue
Service basically got disney to create
this cartoon to explain to people why
they should pay their income taxes
because we really hadn't had a big
broad-based tax system that was enacted
until after World War Two we had all
these debts to pay spent all this money
and you'll see here these references
like Hitler and Mussolini taxes that and
so there was this kind of it was like a
wild almost like a propaganda tool and
was used throughout the country amazing
on television 40 1943 and it was a
really kind of a cool campaign and so it
just makes me laugh because it does
explain like the rationale behind income
time don't act like you were alive when
you when that first came out I remember
well no I mean but it was really cool
and it was yeah sure it's propaganda
okay totally is tried uh effective
propaganda no I know yeah all right so
um I want to get to a couple questions
first I got a few sent to me directly I
just want to relate to this to you okay
do you ever hear of a place called mint
mint mint com what do you think of mint
is that a good is that can you trust
them yes you like what ya soon mint com
is like there's lots of different ways
you can track how your money is spent
right Justin didn't you use mint I had
one and I'm not right for you that's
been great says it is it costs money to
you know get the cream there's also an
iphone app well I use it every time I
make a purchase you know like anything
bigger than like two dollars so like a
way to track how you turn right and it's
great it taps into your bank account
again right it doesn't matter but you
don't have to if you want to use it just
as a spreadsheet you can do that right
actually Jill had a great idea for me to
create my own so I've been using that in
conjunction with it but this is when
that girl is going to accuse me of
flirting with you yeah that's right
seriously whatever so so so mean taps
into your finances and it's a way to
control your exactly great way to
control how you spend or keep tracking
keep track of it I'm a little hesitant
to tell to recommend it to people just
because you know they're getting your
info
mation what are they doing with it how
do they make um they sell advertising
yeah like that's it I'm but I would not
be concerned with that I think it's a
joint i think this mint.com gets the
seal of approval yes what else you got
for me how does Jill manage her personal
finance she spreads like a reckless sale
because you know you he you give a lot
of advice yeah I think people just want
to know I know what I do so what I do is
I'm totally I kick it old school I have
spreadsheets that I keep track of
spending okay I don't keep now I did
I've been doing this you know this many
years of being an adult in the workforce
just like I keep it all up in the head
actually I and and what I do is I try to
sort of use an annual annualized number
then we sit down we say here's what we
got these are our fixed expenses these
are our fun things that we do this so
these are the this is our overhead this
is our monthly nut these are the things
we like to do right and we talked about
you know well you know we got this you
know this kind of vacation you can do
this that the other thing we make
decisions about that ahead of time and
then with my investments I am I manage
my own money and I use index mutual
funds or exchange-traded funds very
boring plain vanilla I'm not a stock
picker and I have a boring diversified
portfolio I really do have a board i
really do it's like the I I really do
practice what I preach only because it's
easier for a man and I'm really you know
when I look at the world I think like
what are the ways we can do stupid
things to ourselves and I try to take
those things out of my life right so if
you take those things out of your life
you pretty much stay out of trouble okay
and that's it and that's kind of what i
do and i have make sure that i have you
know wills and i have some disability
insurance because if you lose your voice
in our job it's a bad thing things like
that and kind of rock and roll from
there so um course i could sort of
manage my life better if i were just on
my own and I didn't have to rely on CBS
that's why I need more Twitter followers
yeah Kylie can just cash that in at the
exactly so uh that's that's kind of my
my game I'm always you know when you
talk about investments I'm always blown
away by the guys who got in early on or
just one dude I think it's that same as
Anderson ya got in early on Instagram
yeah Witter he's event
capital raised Avicii sanit but he just
sees the writing on the wall yeah and
I'm the one thing is you don't hear
about with the VC is that they usually
have about seven deals that don't work
out that way and three the to Brasov
anderson right so and so that's the
thing you have to remember it's would
like anything else and there's huge risk
right so there's a thunder downside and
I'm 44 my point of view you know what
there's nothing that says you're going
to pick a portfolio of stocks that is
diversified and be able to like hit it
out of the park right so most managers
don't do that and so that's why we use
diversified portfolios if you want have
a little fun money you know my sister
was telling me the story about a guy we
know and she's like he's got five
million dies of Apple stock and it's all
his entire net worth is in apple stock
oh my god now I just couldn't sleep like
that it's been an awesome investment for
him right I know that sleep it would
freak me a whole livelihood is just
hanging about not hanging by a thread
mean the threads pretty it's strong but
like you know you think about it you
think well okay so Microsoft was really
strong in 1999 and now a dozen years
later doesn't look so good no but I
still think that Microsoft has a solid
family it has a great foundation all I'm
saying is that you know you could see
your net worth sliced in half right for
good reason tonight almost yeah so I
would always say to people if you've got
all this money in one stock you know I
talked to guys here all the time they
own CBS stock like like higher ups and
they have so much of it and they say
he's been great you know we rode it up
from four dollars to thirty dollars I
said that's great but you actually had
to take the ride down from thirty
dollars to four dollars and who was
happy during that time that was not a
pretty time sure so I can't I can't bear
that I'm too much of a wimp all right I
couldn't do it play it safe that's me
like that all right get to us in
question ah Christopher says that he got
the runaround from different department
stores he was approved by a bank of
america student credit card seven
hundred dollar credit line four and a
quarter percent APR is this similar to
an interest rate yes it is well do you
blew that right uh he's got a credit
line okay 14 and a quarter percent PR
which is the interest are you getting a
run around about he just said he took a
long time to get it okay okay I got you
now he wants to know is he get
challenged charged every month yes no
its you get it every month it's not 14
and a quarter percent every month it's
an annualized rate of 14 and four
percent he says he's 19 it's his first
credit card he's scared to use it
I love this team I understand that so I
said to him this I put in duct tape well
hey yourself use it and pay your bills
because one of the things that I get
really nervous about is that people
start saying I'll never use credit only
use a debit card but that's a problem
because as you know when you go buy a
house you need to have a credit history
of course debit card does not give you a
credit history any card is it difficult
to get pulling money out of your bed
it's like using your money right so I
would be very very careful i think debit
cards were gods gift yeah this is the
greatest thing over all my money's on
yapping a plastic know it sucks yeah
yeah I mean every card for things that I
know that I have to pay that I can't
live without like electricity for my
cell phone I'm always gonna pay for
those things and you know what and you
always make sure you have the money to
pay for them and you never blow off a
credit card payment and forever Joe
wants to know he says for he's got a
nice who lives in Japan and is a
Japanese national to college funds via a
529 plan if you are going to save for
college 529 plans are great the problem
is that the 529 plan is not available to
those outside of the US oh so how do I
save money for college in with the best
benefits and I would say this Joe that
you know you can set up something called
an agua a uniform gift to minors act or
an utter my uniform trust to minors act
you can set up accounts like that but
what may really be the easiest thing is
to just set up a separate account a
joint either in your name or probably
just in your name is better and keep it
simple and use index funds and don't
create a tax liability joe says you rock
i truly enjoy your visits on the 404
rightful for me and valuable for those
just starting their financial journeys
oh it's so nice in simply brian says
he's been working for three years he's
unable to control my expenses and cannot
save much what does that mean he has no
willpower i guess for someone with this
problem what is your financial advice i
know i can save but maybe it's i don't
know where to invest or what to do help
me you know what Brian I think this is
like a diet it really is talk about
willpower so what you want to do is you
want to start automating things the
reason you can't save is because you're
waiting you're basically saying oh I
have a thousand dollars I live my life
and at the end of the day I hope I save
something don't do that that's one of
the ways I loved one of the reasons I
love a 401k
you set up that saving automatically and
it doesn't buy itself if you don't have
a 401k set up an account at Vanguard or
fidelity or zero price is it this are
you being dishonest with yourself when
you say that that's you saving money no
that's you saving money that is you
saving my gitam atleast absolutely and
now he's doing you don't have a 401k
maybe you're working maybe you're
working for yourself or doing a little
bit piecemeal work there there you will
open up an account you go to Vanguard
mmm t rowe Price fidelity Charles Schwab
you open up an account and you say to
them every month suck a hundred dollars
a month out of my credit out of my
checkings account and then it will
happen automatically you'll create your
own yeah and that's the way if you
automate things it's way better and by
the way it's just it's harder to do
things that aren't automated no matter
what can I everyone from Twitter do it
um at your buddy Jeff wrote that's weird
it's not me you know hey for a foreign
and Jill I'm wondering is there a way I
can lower my student loans if I myself
am an educator is interesting I teach
college been out six years okay um this
is that is that something yeah that is
something and so I got a question from
Rudy about loan consolidation and so let
me just talk about this first yeah he
this guy Rudy says to me says you know
is it possible that these loan service
consolidation companies are for real and
that yes if it's offered through the
government okay and so yes it is true
the problem is about you know loan
consolidation is that for some people
the amount you pay every month may
actually rise they've really got to
check the numbers the other thing that I
would say is that in this case this guy
he said you know he's having a hard time
about references and who he gives and
this that and the other and he needs
references and so he says you know
basically who do I list as a reference
basically you I would say a family
member is good or like a best friend or
a cousin or something like that and the
other thing is that you know I think
that you really have to be careful about
loan consolidation because if you do it
incorrectly mm-hmm
you end up with higher payments for some
reason that is really going to screw you
you've got to look at how much you're
paying don't do it just because it's
easier to have one company right do it
because every single month the payment
will be lower if it's going up at all I
would never do it yeah forget about it
and if you have a variable rate and
you're trying to lock in low rates
that's another reason to do it and
you're still a big believer that this
will be our next undoing I don't know if
it'll be our next undo it I just think
it's AI think have to be very careful
with student loan debt right I really do
it i think that people are being a
little nutty with the amount of student
loans they take on given that we know
that it's a weak labor market and people
aren't making that much money I
interviewed this guy and he's got a
great website anyone is looking for
student loan information fin aid dot org
I think it's org might be calm but its
fin aid dot something okay and his name
is Mark Kantrowitz okay super smart guy
he says to me he's like look don't take
out more loans in total then you'll be
making your first year out of college
that's kind of an interesting thing to
be sure that right so you're gonna come
out of college and you gonna make it
you'll have a job hopefully you make 30
grand are you saying don't don't take a
job for four don't take out loans more
than 30 grand I make sense right if you
can't get that cuz it's gonna take you
so you're already underwater starting
got it out of the gate yep so I'd be
very careful with that yes I'm sorry
going Lou asks american express and
discovered do not charge over-the-limit
fees I so he wants to know if you go
over the limit on your card does it hurt
your credit yes but only if the company
reports it mmm-hmm so can you know yeah
you gotta pull your credit report okay
annualcreditreport.com you should pull
that basically at least once a year
maybe twice a year really want to make
sure make sure there's nothing funky on
there okay I'm and he said I read
somewhere that you're not technically
over the limit until the end of the
billing cycle is that true it depends on
the credit card some credit cards used
to do a mid-cycle then now I believe
it's all end of cycle we're talking a
lot about cycles we are talking about
that's like a cramp right now that's
messed up I have such a problem with
some of the credit card uh legalities
and technical oniy right they are they
still I know there's been this whole
wave of reform that's gone over there
the card act but they're still not as
transparent as I would like and I feel
like maybe that's just a company by
company situation where be nice if they
really just presented information to you
in a digestible easier to understand
matter yeah but I still feel like they
are doing something to deliberately
confuse you yeah i think that they
there's two parts of it one is that the
card act has made it clearer about what
you're paying and things are due the
problem is that these credit card
companies have bunches of lawyers who
are saying if we don't put all the
gobbledygook in there we're not going to
make any money no not so much we're not
going to make money someone's going to
sue us okay and that's why there is so
much gobbly gook if that is if you hear
if you really want to talk to someone a
bad let's talk to like a lawyer sometime
and they'll tell you about all the times
they get sued right and the and the
answer to these two preventing lawsuits
is you disclose everything here's what's
happening right and if you don't read a
tough luck right on one other question
that Lou asks about the chase blueprint
full pay program he says they're saying
that the user can avoid payment paying
interest if they pay the balance of
selected categories in full even if you
carry a balance isn't that part of that
always the case the answer is no that is
not always the case in other words this
is a slightly different kind of credit
card because it gives you a little more
flexibility and say I always know I pay
those things but if I have extra things
over here that I don't pay I don't wanna
get paid I don't have to pay interest on
the most credit cards don't do that they
say you're over your over true and you
could get pay that huh you want to hear
this really depressing one oh man are we
gonna get bummer spilled everything okay
oh but she's awfully nice oh she at
least she keeps her head up I think just
every mistake one can make I think we
made oh gee that's not that's how she
starts at all that she starts 50 years
old my husband is self-employed I was
also self employed part-time as I raised
two children for 18 years my son's out
of the house my daughter's in junior
high school no savings no college fund
no 401k no other retirement oh dear we
owe twenty four thousand dollars in back
taxes to the IRS back taxes just that's
bad that's bad because you I RS always
knows where to find you we were counting
on our home eyes retirement we have
three acres my 80 year old parents built
a home we're living and we have a lot of
equity in the house
that's the good news there's some value
but my folks have money into it which we
need to reimburse them for don't pay
your family back to screw them I know
this is it they she says we're looking
at foreclosure if we sold now there
would be no money left after paying
everyone off mmm so what do they do I
was laid off blah blah blah overwhelmed
this is the but the core issue I'm
overwhelmed and I cannot any way out oh
this is so here's what i want to tell
you there's a lot of people out here who
are like that and they probably aren't
listening to the show but maybe you know
people in your you you really do feel a
little worried about them and your I
don't worry about them I worry about
them because I feel like you know you
know someone wagging their finger at you
is not going to really make it better
yeah so what I want to suggest is this
that there are certain instances where
declaring bankruptcy actually really
does make sense and I know that seems
very antithetical to the American Way
but you know what it's a way to say i
have screwed up I have made mistakes and
I need to start over right because this
woman is 50 years old and and she and
her husband need a second chance for
sure and I think that that's why you go
to go through a bankruptcy I happen to
know a woman who's 50 years old she just
went through bankruptcy it's awful it's
painful she has nothing zero she's 50
years old she's got nothing that's great
and so what but what it does is it gets
everyone off your back right so you can
start and you can go you can move what
is the problem though and the bigger
picture giving people like a free pass
well I don't think so because I think
that it's part of the legal system in
the United States we've always done it
you know you can't do it you're there
should still be I do think so because I
think bad things do happen to people i
think that there are people who really
blow it and there they are stupid okay
and they do bad things yeah but there's
a most of the people who get into big
trouble it's not because they're trying
to game the system it's like you know I
had a job I lost my job I was trying to
get my kid through school I borrowed
against the house I did this I did this
my mother got sick my husband speaks you
made you can't call some events in life
and so don't be afraid to say you know
what this was so hard I I can't do this
anymore where do they go from nothing
though from nothing you go you say I
have a job right you basically decide
whether you start over you figure out
whether you're going to lose your house
or not you rent and you know she luckily
there's one of them have
up right you know and you have to start
somewhere and you just start and the
thing about bankruptcy is you don't get
credit again no one will extend credit
for you right for about seven years all
right so you again you got exactly but
it really does make you form those
habits again that's what's good about
paying taxes every year now even though
I don't you know you are he's below
again I am even though there is no good
thing about paying tag I'm getting a
buttload back though this year oh yes I
told you I don't like that why because
that's you have lent the government
money I'm saying but I asked my
accountant he said no I wouldn't change
anything in the way well how much it
will talk yeah uh before I'm saying that
it puts me into good habits for what
three four weeks and I'll go back to the
old right right right we've we we didn't
answer the twitter question about of
student loans that he's a teacher now so
yes he can do that I'm sometimes when
you in some institutions they'll you're
in forbearance so you gotta go he's
gotta go is he trying to take out
student loans i think is trying to pay
him off and the is he want to know if
there's a better way to pay them off
after now that he is a teacher well i
mean some it depends where you are some
places actually will help you with that
depending on where you go some places
will help pay off student loans some
private schools will actually say hey
you come here you're not part of the
pension system but will help you have
your loss varies by employee yeah I'm
the other thing you can do is you can
check out loan consolidation but the
best thing you can do with any debt
whether it's student loan credit card is
to do what Justin and I were talking
about way go to mint com it's some sort
of tracking software or whatever just
put on a legal pad figure out how much
you're spending set aside in a dollar
amount every single month and say this
is how it's going to go down and I'm
going to have to deprive myself a little
bit but you got education with surety
awesome right so um one thing that's
kind of wild about student loans it's
like impossible to default on them in
other words you can declare bankruptcy
yeah student loans don't get released in
