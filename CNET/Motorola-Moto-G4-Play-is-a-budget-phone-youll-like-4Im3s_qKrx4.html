new Motorola MOTO G foreplay you might
think it was 2014 5 inch 720 display 8
megapixel camera no fingerprint sensor
it does have a headphone jack though but
there is one speck that really caught my
attention the price it is cheap and that
makes me happy so what do you get for
that price and is it any good well in
two words a lot and in another word yes
there are many positives its small light
and plastic and I think that's great
because I don't feel like I'm going to
break it or need a case also its splash
resistant then there's the battery life
which is outstanding and a big reason
for that is because the Moto G for play
also runs it close to stock version of
Android marshmallow true this is the
most affordable of the three budget
phones in the Motorola MOTO G family but
also true it isn't going to take the
best pictures or shoot 4k video or even
have the speediest performance but
you'll be able to have a phone that
allows you to do the most common things
you use your phone for you can access
the Play Store you can use facebook
Messenger Instagram snapchat play games
like Pokemon go and Monument Valley and
of course take cat photos while the
5-inch 720 display worked well in most
situations the screen can wash out in
direct sunlight also the Moto G for play
only comes with 16 gigabytes of storage
though there is a microSD slot and 2
years free access to Google photos but
then again it's cheap the Motorola MOTO
G for play is the Toyota Corolla of
smartphones it does the majority of what
people use a smartphone for and it won't
break the bank
think of all the things you can use or
the money you save you could take
Spanish lessons you could take a trip to
Vegas you can go out to dinner you could
buy your co-workers lunch you could
repaint the gutters you can finally get
that grandfather</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
