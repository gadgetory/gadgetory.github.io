Nintendo's transforming new console the
Nintendo switch now the switch is
actually several consoles in one in one
form factor few dockets with your TV to
play on the big screen using an external
controller you can then pick it up from
the dock and start using it as a tablet
with controllers on the side then you
can of course put the screen down on the
table and use the controller separately
either using Wii Motion style
controllers or clamp them together and
use them as a more typical of games
controller the idea is that the switch
is portable so you can take it away from
the TV in your living room to the toilet
or over to your friend's house but some
multiplayer Mario Kart action it's
certainly an exciting concept for a
console but there are some major
problems I've seen so far for one its
launch price of 280 pounds is extremely
high was actually only going to be for
games available and launch of which one
is a Zelda game and none of them will be
bundled with the console for that high
price other games coming later this year
include a FIFA title snowboarding game
steep and will have to wait to the end
of the year for Mario to get his first
proper outing on the console
really Nintendo that's poor form overall
I can definitely see the advantage in
the transforming nature but the core
selection of games and the massively
high price really does mean it for me a
lot of a shine has been taken out of the
switch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
