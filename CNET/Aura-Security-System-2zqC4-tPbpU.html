systems now if you don't know what it is
I don't blame you it's not a Wi-Fi
system it's not a Bluetooth speaker it's
definitely not a paperweight because
it's too light for it oh that's another
one here well this turned out to be a
security system that's right
here's how the system works you take
this hop here connect to your home Wi-Fi
and place it at one end of your home
then take the second unit a sensor and
place it at the other end of your home
the tool when connect to each other
using a wireless signal to create an
elliptical sphere in between them like a
football when something is moving inside
that sphere is motion will be detected
the system will then send you alert to
your phone or can even sound alarm with
the built-in speaker here now the best
thing about the aura is the ease of you
it took me less than 10 minutes to set
up just a fraction of time I use to set
up a regular camera base security system
and by the way you see the light here
they also light here too as because they
both come with a built-in battery that
lasts for a very long time so it's very
useful in case a power outage now the
system is also very fun to use viewer
this or our mobile apps here you can
quickly arm or disarm the system
remotely you can also view things in
real time as well as see what happened
in the past 12 hours or the entire week
and by sea I mean this grabs you because
since there's no camera you would not
know who or what actually mess with your
home and that brings us to the very
first thing that's not so cool about the
system you cannot customize the size of
the object that would trigger the sensor
and that means your pad might rip the
sensor my 15 power put a mix did all the
time the second thing is the system has
quite limited coverage which depend on
the distance between the two unit here
now if you use the system in an open
space you can place the two of them some
50 feet away but if there are walls in
between well maybe just 25 30 feet so
unless you have a smart home there is no
way the system here can cover your
entire home and in fact even
if you have a small home it's still kept
and that's because the system cannot
detect motion be high the sensor so
there's no way you can make the or a
mortar your driveway or detect if
somebody open the front door for example
also no home shaped like a football so
there's always some part of the home
that's not modern on top of that the
system s whereas the ORA app required to
connect to the vendor at all times and
you have to surrender your home address
for them to work well that's a little
trust but the thing I found the most
outrageous is the price $500 okay
exaggerated $4.99 seriously it's so
expensive that if you decide to get it
you might want to get another cheaper
security system to make sure that nobody
gonna break into your home to steal your
Belov aura so the aura is true unique
and cool but considering its cost and
its effectiveness or lack thereof I
would go with a traditional camera based
system in a heartbeat a thorough is fun
to watch myself candidly moving around
you know that and that's because I'm
don't know and this is the aura from
cognitive system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
