Cree TW series LED lightbulb to look at
today this is a 13 and 1/2 watt bulb
that's made to replace a 60 watt
incandescent and it does a good job of
it it puts out 800 lumens compared to
the 880 you'll get from an incandescent
so it's plenty bright enough now this
bulb comes on the heels of Curry's
original LED bulb which was a nine and a
half watt bulb that put out the same
amount of lumens so it was actually more
efficient that bulb is 1297 at Home
Depot you can get it a little cheaper in
some places because of energy rebates it
is Energy Star certified which helps and
that's a great deal that bulb is a very
tough act to follow so this is their
follow this is their attempt at it and
what they've done is they've made a very
strong effort to increase the CRI which
is the color rendering index of the bulb
and that's why this bulb has kind of
this bluish hue it's got a little bit of
a tacky feel to it and all of that is
part of an effort to make it better at
rendering colors now the CRI score which
runs from 1 to 100 being the best is 93
on this bulb and that's the highest
score you'll find for an LED that's
commercially available right now
unlike the 1297 bulb before this bulb
cost 1997 so what are you getting for
that extra seven bucks well you're
getting more accurate colors and is that
worth it depends on what you need I
wanted to test out just how much of an
effect this had on colors so I look for
the most colorful thing I could find in
the office here and that turned out to
be a bowl of Fruity Cheerios which we
were actually using for vacuum cleaner
test fitting now we're gonna light this
bowl of cereal using just the Cree light
to see how nice it makes these colors
look and then for comparison we'll do
the same thing with a basic standard 60
watt incandescent bulb so I'll go ahead
and I'll take the Cree bulb and I'll
screw it into this apparatus here and
we're gonna hold it up above let's go
ahead and kill the lights
so here we have the Cree light and only
the cria light illuminating the cereal
and as you can see the colors do look a
little bit more vivid in my opinion now
here we have an incandescent bulb this
is 60 watts this is the comparable bulb
to the Cree this is the type of bulb
you'd replace using this crea light and
we're gonna hold this up right above the
cereal just like before
let the filament stop wobbling there a
little bit and just like that we see
that it looks fine you can see it you
could eat this bowl of cereal in the
middle of the night if you use this
light but the colors might not look
quite as vivid as the Cree looks and
this is because the incandescent is not
going to be as accurate at rendering
colors as the Cree TW series so the
question is is that worth it is that
worth seven dollars more especially if
you are sacrificing a little bit of the
energy efficiency of the bulb for most
consumers I think that efficiency is
probably the top priority so I would
recommend the previous cree LED bulb but
if you want that high CRI if you want
accurate colors if you're displaying
artwork and you have a lot of need for
that type of bulb this is a fabulous
bowl you'll be very happy with it
