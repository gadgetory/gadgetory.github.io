the wrong edge it looks a lot like the
outgoing 14 certainly in its general
shape and volumes and proportion but the
dead giveaway is right here the 15 has
this deeply sculpted side where the past
edge had this kind of black slab side
the grille is a little different the
taillights are very much like a fusion
which is no coincidence because the edge
is largely based on the platform shared
with the fusion overall it's about an
inch longer and 15 that's not dramatic
by any stretch now inside the new edge
Ford's done a lot of work to bring it
upscale and not be so utilitarian
there's the real problem though this
head units the equivalent of wearing a
Nixon Agnew campaign but I'm not a queer
going back it's the my Ford touch with
some Sync technology that Ford took a
drubbing for four years it's been
replaced by sync three unfortunately
this 15 edge only offers this outgoing
my Ford touch the 16 will bring you the
much more desirable sync 3 you know what
to do of course the good part of Ford
LCD interface is over there in front of
the driver where you've got those two
helper screens alongside the speedo and
those are configurable in almost any
variety on the left or change to
whatever focus you care about of for
choices on the right and they each got a
dedicated winged controller on the wheel
that's some affords best UI and HMI even
if this is kind of the opposite anyway
let's take a look at some of the
controls down here everything here is
now a physical button and they're large
and pretty well spaced so this is well
done human machine interface here's
something new this camera button is
going to turn on a front looking cam
this is I think a first for Ford overall
it gives you that sort of going out
forward look when you're sort of nudging
out of a blind space you can even go to
a really extreme fisheye here our drive
controls are pretty straightforward a
conventional automatic transmissions er
nd s in this case but s isn't a complete
cohesive sport mode it's a sport profile
of holding gear shifts and a company in
this shifter are of course the almost
common now paddles on the wheel only one
choice though and that is this automatic
in the back of our edge we've got an
interesting numbers story going on
there's another inch of legroom which is
nice to have a compact ish crossover and
about another inch of shoulder room
roughly per two passengers back here
here's the proof in the pudding I set up
this passenger seat for me up there and
now I'm able to sit behind me back here
and it doesn't happen in a lot of cars
we've got inflatable seatbelts in the
back on this vehicle I've also got a
nice big panoramic roof up here that
extends all the way back to the rear
headrest now some things have changed of
the engine bay on the new edge and some
things have it first of all this is
another standard engine the 2-liter the
little guy in line for sitting
sidesaddle with EcoBoost technology that
means a turbocharger and direct
injection it used to be kind of a pricey
option now it's the base engine it's
also now got a twin scroll turbo so a
turbo that has two modes of operation to
be more responsive additional engines
include the three and a half liter v6
and the 2.7 liter four-cylinder EcoBoost
butters your new base the numbers drop a
little bit it's now 245 horsepower up 5
and 275 pound feet of torque also up
five what didn't change is the mpg it
still comes in at twenty four average
which is twenty City thirty Highway the
last edge was 21 City 30 highway but the
average comes out the same all of this
goes out through a six-speed automatic
transmission we have front wheel drive
you can also get these guys in all-wheel
drive and by the way all it wants is
regular gas first thing that struck me
about the new edge is the ride quality
this is smooth and nice and liquid very
compliant I like that I think it's a
home run for the market they're going
after now the next thing you notice is
the powertrain is that ok how's this
little 2 litre EcoBoost turbo dueling
well it actually does fine as long as
you don't let it get buried under car in
other words don't find it
loafing along and sixth when you need to
stab at the power so drop it in sport
mode for example get on those paddles
and keep things cooking some interesting
driver assists on this car one
is terribly cutting-edge is lane
departure warning and lane departure
prevention because it has an electric
power steering rack they can address
that digitally and tell it to nose you
back in that's how they do it perhaps
the most interesting though is this new
layer of self parking technology now
this vehicle adds perpendicular on top
of that and also exit mode so if you're
too damn dumb to get out of a parking
spot you parked in know how that works
this will get you out of it that front
cameras you know it's useful if you're
coming out of a blind spot you gotta hit
that button of course you got to think
about it manually but it's got a good
clear image and they're also quite an
elaborate array of surround sensors that
are available on this vehicle to augment
the front and rear cameras you have no
surround camera tech however you get a
lot of segments there on the screen as
you can see along with various beeps and
color-coding to let you know what you're
about to spray and coming later not
available now as I understand it but in
mid model year production will be
adaptive cruise and the forward
collision automatic braking okay let's
do up a fifteen Ford Edge CNET style
starts off at thirty six five because
that's the price of admission for this
titanium trim with front-wheel drive and
this is a pre-loaded vehicle but then we
check the box for package 302 a Ford's
just got away with names don't then that
brings you a lot of toys the power
liftgate you can wag your foot to open
the panoramic roof overhead that new
active parking assists the front camera
HID headlights blind spot warning the
lane departure and prevention I showed
you on the road voice based navigation
and those rear seatbelts with airbags
built in now thirteen hundred more
brings you the driver assist package
which goes further with adaptive cruise
control as well as forward collision
mitigation braking that's automatic and
for some reason they lump in a tilt
telescope wheel with that and my
favorite option is dealer-installed
three hundred and thirty bucks for a
safe in the console what are you gonna
put in there
you're not James Bond I'd get one too
anyway we're looking about forty three
eight all in for this guy
here's your bottom line on the edge
looks a lot better I think but still
very familiar more room in the back seat
always a good thing that technology and
the - that's sad you gotta wait till
2016 I'm afraid and the 2-liter EcoBoost
turbo engine is now standard used to be
a rather pricey option for cars driven
CNET style standing by now at CNET on
