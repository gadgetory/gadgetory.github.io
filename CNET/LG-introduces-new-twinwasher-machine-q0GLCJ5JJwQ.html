ideal solution for this household and
millions like it it's an industry-first
it's the LG twins wash system with the
mini washer a washing machine that
offers two washers in the space of one
with this twin wash system people are
now able to divide and conquer by doing
two loads of laundry at once a large
load in the main washer and a smaller
more specialized load in the world's
first mini washer in the pedestal while
this mini washer may be small in stature
we've equipped it with the same direct
drive motor that we're famous for that
powers of course our ten-year warranty
and what's even more incredible about it
is that consumers can buy the mini
washer separately and use it with any
existing LG front load washer and while
the main washer takes care of the
everyday laundry items this mini washer
handles the little loads of intimates
and a workout gear delicate knits and so
on what's the result significant savings
of time and effort and probably most
importantly the household bandwidth
what's more with all these clothing
items being taken care of at once
washing times are significantly reduced
leaving even more time for the family to
spend on the things that they want to do
the new design concept enables users to
take advantage of a second washer
without actually having to have
additional space in the house and what's
more the newly designed front load
washer with the door position 21
millimeters higher and the drum angled
at a 6 degree angle makes the unit much
more accessible as users no longer have
to bend over to put in the clothes or
take them out so our twin wash system
isn't the only way we've made doing
laundry less of a hassle
our entire 2015 LG enters Energy Star
certified washers are equipped with some
amazing features that will save laundry
time and electricity and water too take
for example the mega capacity front load
washer with turbo wash thanks to our new
improved turbo wash technology washing
has never been faster in fact savings of
up to 30 minutes per load even on large
loads how does it work
briefly twin nozzles at the front of the
washer are used to spray a concentrated
detergent solution directly onto the
clothes while a high-pressure nozzle
from above sprays tiny water particles
down through the clothes during the high
spin cycles for quick and effective
rinsing and through our LG smart think
technology custom cycles can be uploaded
to the washer cycle statuses can be
monitored remotely and users can be sent
alerts when the cycle is complete and
what's more the energy monitoring
feature provides helpful data while the
innovative home chat service allows
users to know the status of the washing
machine simply by texting it with their
smartphones so let's take a look at our
new top load washer &amp;amp; dryer pairs for
215 our newly designed top load dryer
features easy load it's a revolutionary
two-way open door system that allows
users to easily transfer clothes from
the washer to the dryer so that they no
longer have to bend over or risk
dropping clean clothes onto the floor
and moreover this top load Energy Star
certified washer features the largest
capacity on the market today so get this
a consumer can clean a king-size
comforter and a full set of bedding in
one load optimal efficiency great time
savings so with all the thought we've
put it in the washing machines however
we haven't forgotten what needs to
happen when the wash is done we have to
dry the clothes and our new turbo steam
dryer it ejects steam directly into
fabrics eliminating dirt odors quickly
efficiently and cuts down on pricey
dry-cleaning bills but what we're most
excited about is our new heat pump
technology
gee in q4 of last year we were the first
to introduce an eco hybrid dryer and now
we're continuing to roll it out
nationwide it combines conventional
vented drying with a proprietary heat
pump that recycles heat helping to
dramatically reduce energy consumption
by up to 53 percent in fact it's so
advanced that the EPA awarded it with
the first 2014 energy gene technology
award which recognizes breakthrough
innovations that reduce energy use and
greenhouse gas emissions our new line of
Energy Star certified dryers which by
the way a new Energy Star category for
215 plus our new washers and of course
the mini washer represent the next level
of wash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
