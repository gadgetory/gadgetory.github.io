mobile it costs 150 dollars off contract
runs android 4.1 jelly bean and has a
dedicated camera button but do you want
to buy it maybe not I'm jessica's all
court for CNN and this is your first
look the ring is one of a couple hundred
fifty dollar phones for virgin mobile
specs lineup generally from phone to
phone but on here performance
unfortunately is a little bit worse it
has a four inch Super AMOLED display
here it's on full brightness looks very
rich and colorful one thing you notice
though is when the screen is off it
looks really bad it's sort of dim and
has the strange cast and blackness on
the sides that makes it seem like
they're sort of a filter on top it's
very highly reflective and that
unfortunately plays a role when you're
looking at the content it just isn't as
sharp and crisp as other phones next to
it physically the phone is compact looks
like a lot of other Samsung phones so
much so that I sometimes got them
confused and picked up the wrong phone
while I was reviewing this one very
glossy sides and surfaces slips easily
into pockets it is compact enough to
tote around there's a dedicated camera
button on the side there's also a
microSD card slot on the other side that
will take up to 64 gigabytes and
external storage on the back is a 5
megapixel camera with flash
unfortunately this one underperformed
with mediocre shots that were usually
doll and a little bit blurry same goes
for the 720p HD video audio did not pick
up very well an image was also the same
sort of dull flat coloring inside you've
got a dual-core Qualcomm processor that
should be all right but I found the
phone very slow data wise the phone will
also be slow because it is 3g not 4g
enabled sometimes i found that it took
up to five minutes to fully load a
website overall if you are looking for a
budget smartphone keep looking there are
other options on virgin mobile and other
carriers i would skip this one myself
I'm Jessica doll court this has been
your first look at the samsung galaxy
ring you can read my full review at cnet
