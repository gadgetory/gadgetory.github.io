a Windows Phone device this spring HTC
launched a new Titan handset which
compared to the older version has a
bigger battery better camera and 4G LTE
support how does it compare to Nokia's
Lumia 900 well I'm Bill Detweiler head
technology editor at CNET's sister site
tech Republic and I'm going to find out
by cracking open the HTC Titan 2 opening
the Titan 2 doesn't require any special
tools just a Philips triple zero
screwdriver and a thin metal or plastic
tool i began by removing the bottom
cover from the back of the phone next i
removed the three visible and three
hidden case screws from the bottom of
the back cover using a thin metal blade
I gently popped off the upper cover from
the back of the phone and again removed
all the screws with the screws out i
used a thin metal tool to pry the
display assembly away from the body and
then lifted the body off once inside the
phone i removed the battery all the
internal screws and the plastic battery
compartment i then disconnected the
visible cables from the phones to
printed circuit boards lifted the
board's away from the display assembly
and disconnected the remaining ribbon
cable from the underside of the upper
board next i separated the two circuit
boards removed the cameras remove the
SIM card reader LED flash PCB proximity
sensor and emi RFI shields with that our
teardown was complete so what did I
learn about the Titan 2 from our
teardown and how does it compare to last
year's Titan and the Lumia 900 well both
Titans are similar in size shape and
weight and like the original Titan
there's no trick to opening the Titan 2
just a lot of screws to remove and
several covers to pop off both phones
have a replaceable battery two large
circuit boards a 1.5 gigahertz single
core processor 512 Meg's of RAM and 16
gigs of storage and like
earlier phone the Titan 2 has a 4.7 inch
LCD with a resolution of 800 by 480
pixels and it has a single piece display
assembly what really sets the Titan 2
apart from its predecessor is its
support for 4G LTE a 16 megapixel camera
and a slightly higher capacity battery
when comparing the Titan 2 to Nokia's
Lumia 900 there are also several
similarities both phones have single
core qualcomm processors both have 512
Meg's of RAM 16 gigs of storage and the
same 3G 4G wireless modem the lumia
screen does have a higher pixel density
thanks to its smaller size and comes
with Nokia's clear black filter the
Titan on the other hand has a 16
megapixel camera compared the Lumias 8
megapixel one like the Lumia 900 the
Titan twos hardware is partially
dictated by its operating system Windows
Phone 7.5 doesn't support dual-core
processors which are found in many
Android devices and the iPhone 4s
likewise both phones have less RAM than
the Samsung Galaxy Nexus and less
storage than the top-end iPhone or
Galaxy Nexus but as I said in my lumia
900 teardown higher hardware
specifications don't always translate
into better performance Windows Phone
7.5 was designed to run well on single
core CPUs and on 512 Meg's of RAM and
given my experience with the Titan 2 and
the Lumia 900 it does at $199 with a
two-year contract the Titan 2 is more
expensive than the $99 Lumia 900 you'll
have to decide if the larger screen and
higher megapixel camera are worth it now
to see more Titan to tear down photos
