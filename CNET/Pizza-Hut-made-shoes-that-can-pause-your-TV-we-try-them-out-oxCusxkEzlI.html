like this I feel emotionally insecure
about wearing these what has Pizza Hut's
name in his in pizza shoes
you may have no idea of this but Pizza
Hut made a limited run of shoes last
year that ordered pizza with the press
of a button it was like an Amazon -
button for your feet it was a publicity
stunt and that stunt is back with I Tops
- Pizza Hut's making only 250 pairs of
these fifty of which will be sold others
given away so what do they do they order
Pizza Hut pizzas and now they pause live
TV I look at wearable tech I thought I'd
give them a try I'm not really a sneaker
head in fact I'm wearing sketcher shoes
that's usually what I wear every day
these are PI top - so I don't know how
they compare against other high tops
they look really red and they're smart
shoes I'm gonna try them on my size 11
super wide feet yeah I don't even know
how to tie shoes well feel this feeling
thick
let's kick my other shoes away they feel
okay I mean the look is growing on me I
like them they are they are probably
more stylish than the average shoes that
I wear which is not saying very much
they feel they feel good they feel good
there's like a lot of a lot of shoe
there any things are absurd PI tops to
come in all red or wheat and read their
tech is in the tons basically velcro
pockets where the tech is hiding took
off the adhesive one side has a flick
smart button that pairs via bluetooth to
a Pizza Hut high-tops app on phones and
will auto order pizza when you set it up
with a single click double click or
click and hold I wasn't able to
reprogram it but there is a flick button
that exists it's an actual product that
can be used to control other things like
smart home controls the other side has
an IR blaster like one of those novelty
key chains when it's near a supported
cable box with DVR it pauses TV
automatically that's it no extra program
functions no volume or on/off or channel
controls only certain cable box DVRs
work and be patient it takes a few
seconds lo and behold
things are getting more into it now that
did it
no no we're public some people love the
look of the shoes I felt a little less
confident its conversation starter hey
what's up right now they're the easily
the most interesting thing about me so
they have dominated my my look at this
point there's like two reasons why you I
guess you'd even be interested in shoes
like this which I wouldn't be but one is
that further smart features maybe which
are kind of at and the other is the the
crazy look maybe that there Pizza Hut
branded which they're not that
over-the-top it could be worse right it
could be a Pizza Hut jacket the issues
are an absurd publicity stunt that's
being used to sell pizza time to
basketball tournaments but imagine if
this were used in other ways
technically the idea of Smart buttons
and shoes could do all sorts of things
maybe you could turn on lights or maybe
you could use it to ping for an alert in
fact you could put all sorts of smart
buttons into these shoes in those
pockets it's just that they're
customized right now so smart shoes are
here the question is where they're gonna
go next
today Pizza ordering TV pausing shoes
tomorrow Pizza ordering TV pausing shoes
they can turn on your lights
dream big no it's definitely cold down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
