dollar headphone market but these honors
have a great neutral sound that works
for listening on your phone or at home
hey it's Justin from CNET this is a
first look at the cost SP 330 on ear
headphones so these are on ear
headphones again meaning the ear pads
sit directly on top of your ears that's
as opposed to the kind that wrap around
them now the pads themselves are made of
soft memory foam that feels pretty
similar in comfort to the boson ears
except the cushioning that rests on top
of your head can feel a little
constricting after a while so be sure to
try these on at the store before you buy
them so one thing I didn't like about
these headphones is that they don't
include a lot of the mobile friendly
accessories usually see they come with a
durable nylon carrying case
but the headphones don't fold in so it
almost feels like a full sized headphone
when you have it in your bag I was also
a little surprised at the lack of an
extra cable with a remote and microphone
to control tracks and make phone calls
that's almost standard these days even
with headphones well under $100 now in
terms of sound quality these aren't
going to blow you away with their deep
bass levels instead these headphones
have a very flat frequency response so
you can expect your music to come across
with a very present natural feel to it
remember these are not active
noise-cancelling headphones but they do
pretty well with isolation regardless
now with a retail price of a hundred
thirty bucks it's kind of tough to
recommend these headphones over the $150
boson ears which are more travel
friendly with a folding headband smart
phone ready controls and a more
contemporary design by comparison the SP
330s sound just as good powered by the
same sources if not a little cleaner but
I'll need to see the price drop under a
hundred bucks before these headphones
really stand out you can read more
comparisons and details of my full
review on SEANET
but that's going to do it for this video
I'm Justin you you just took a first
look at the cost SP 330 on ear
headphones thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
