according to a new report from recode
amazon lotsa launched a pair of music
streaming services the first service
would cost about ten dollars like
Spotify Apple music google play music
and pretty much every other music
service out there and like every other
music service Amazon's $10 offering
would be ad free and allow for offline
playback on any device the second
service is way more interesting this one
would cost about half the price of the
first service however this cheaper music
service would work only on Amazon's echo
hardware it's not clear whether the
service would work on the smaller echo
dot either way they're cheaper service
would also be ad free amazon wants to
launch the two services in September o
the report mentions one more minor thing
amazon does not have final deals in
place with major music labels and
publishers one sticking point is the
price of the cheaper service will it
cost five dollars or four dollars amazon
already offers a music service that is
tied to amazon prime the selection is
not as broad as Spotify or Apple music
the report does not mention whether
these new services would replace
Amazon's Prime music option that's it
