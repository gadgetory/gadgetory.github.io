Bakalar filling in for Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update some big
features are being released for mobile
twitter users today the company
announced that it will start allowing
users to tag others within tweeted
photos in fact you'll be able to tag up
to 10 people in total and none of your
precious 140 characters will be at risk
either you'll also be able to upload a
maximum of 4 photos at once which the
service will then automatically format
into a nice collage again these features
seem to only be available to mobile
platforms so you'll need to update your
iOS or Android app to get the changes
also it's being rumoured that Twitter
might actually do away with the retweet
button and change it simply to just the
share button I don't know how we'll
survive word is that Spotify might be
prepping an IPO for this fall the six
year old music streaming service has had
an explosive 24 months despite criticism
that it doesn't pay artists nearly
enough analysts described the prospect
of an IPO as attractive simply because
most of the company's revenue is a
result of subscriptions and not
necessarily advertising the timeline for
the IPO is subject to change though it
appears that Spotify is well on its way
to being a publicly traded company so
what does amazon have planned for
streaming video well invites for an
event in New York City have gone out to
members of the press today that teases a
chat with Peter Larson he's Amazon's
Kindle vice president of course this has
led to a wide spectrum of rumors

set-top box a possible gaming console or
even something totally different
altogether we'll have live coverage of
the event when it happens on April
second Microsoft Office is finally
coming to the iPad because you've been
wanting that forever today the company
made the news official though iPad users
will still have access to plenty of
other alternatives not to mention the
