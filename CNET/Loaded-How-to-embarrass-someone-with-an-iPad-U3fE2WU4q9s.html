I'm Natali del Conte and it's time to
get loaded Barnes &amp;amp; Noble announced the
color screen nook on Tuesday it's made
for reading books periodicals and
children's literature as we discussed on
Monday it has a 7-inch color touchscreen
and eight gigs of onboard memory to
store all of your reading material
there's also a social component allowing
you to share books over Twitter and
Facebook it costs $249 for the Wi-Fi
model and starts shipping november
nineteenth t-mobile customers will soon
be able to use their phones to deliver
the internet to other devices a new
tethering option will cost fifteen
dollars per month starting November
third smartphone users with HSPA or
hspa+ will be able to get up to five
gigs of data per month to send to their
laptop or other connected device and you
won't be getting any one a white iphone
4 for Christmas this year that's because
they have been delayed until next spring
which is about the time we'll be
reporting on rumors for iphone 5 what
you can get this Christmas is an
engraved iPad though Apple is offering
free laser engraving with the purchase
of any ipad this also might make the
iPad theft-proof because really who's
going to steal an iPad that says I love
you pookie and myspace got a makeover
today the site is going back to its
roots as a music and entertainment
portal hoping to get and keep more
members aged 35 and under in addition to
the focus on music and entertainment the
site has curbed members ability to
customize their pages quite so
obnoxiously and yahoo mail also got an
update the company claims the new web
version of the mail client a speedier
and less spammy it also integrates
Twitter and Facebook feeds directly into
the client limewire is in trouble with
the law the file-sharing site was
slapped with a federal injunction on
Tuesday that ordered the site to disable
certain parts of the service this is a
result of a battle with the recording
industry association of america that
obviously has a problem with people
sharing music on the site this
injunction orders limewire to shut down
search download upload file trading and
distribution so basically everything we
use it for the limewire music store will
still be available though and finally if
you are
said about the death of the cassette
tape Sony Walkman dry your tears it
turns out Sony is stopping production
only in Japan a Sony spokesperson told
pc magazine that the vintage device will
still remain in production in the US for
the time being they said that there is a
consistent but small demand for it so it
will remain on sale for 2999 those are
your headlines for today I will see
tomorrow I'm Natali del Conte for
cnet.com and you've just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
