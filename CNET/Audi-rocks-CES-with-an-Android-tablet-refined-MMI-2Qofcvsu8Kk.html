and Audi's booth looking at the Audi
smart display now this is an Android
tablet that Audi launched here at the
show it's got a nice aluminum case it's
supposed to be fairly durable for the
automotive environment it actually
integrates with the car it's not just a
tablet on its own so it's connecting to
the car through Wi-Fi I've had a little
demonstration of the cars that
infotainment Center here so your
passengers can sit with this tablet and
say they can pull up the map I can pull
up navigation maybe do a search for
something for you if you don't want to
do a search on your own or you're busy
driving do a free-form search we'll just
throw an Audi on here and so we get a
list of locations that show up here now
I can just drag one of these over if I
pull up navigation here it'll
automatically load whatever destination
I put from here onto the cars and
navigation so your passenger can do all
the navigating for you likewise your
passenger can also be your DJ and also
we have a nice little car screen here
let's actually show the cars speed and
other information that's actually coming
from the car into the tablet you can't
really do that with any other Android
tablet only the one that's really
connected integrated to the car like
this one is but also the cool thing is
we can also go to standard Android
functionality we got our apps right here
we got our whole screen full of apps so
gonna have any Android app loaded onto
here so your your passengers can use
this and this tablets can be connected
to the car as a Wi-Fi hotspot has a 4G
connection out to the Internet and so
they can just do anything they want on
here watch movies or whatever while you
drive so now let's go over here to this
Audi TT virtual cockpit
out he brought the interior of its
upcoming out e TT model now the TT is
gonna be really exciting when it comes
out later this year we haven't seen that
car yet but we are seeing the cockpit
we're seeing a whole new infotainment
system they've really updated their
multi media interface with this fully
new system they call it the virtual
cockpit so what we have is a fully LCD
instrument cluster here so of course we
have our gauges in the like and we can
look at our speed and our tachometer and
stuff like that but then if we want to
look at the infotainment functions I can
push this
button and I get my functions for radio
media telephone and navigation we'll
take a look at navigation first so I
also have a new controller over here
Hardware controller and they've
simplified this with these kind of
toggle switches for your navigation map
telephone and radio and media so I can
also go quickly to navigation just by
pushing one of these buttons here or I
can use the menu here so I go to
navigation and now I get a full-on map
shown on the cells of the instrument
cluster right in front of me that's
extremely cool and if I want to find a
destination and there's a touchpad on
top of this dial so I can start tracing
in letters this is kind of like the
touchpad in other outies but it's a
little more refined it's also on top of
this dial to make it more compact
I found a result here so I just pushed
down here and it automatically throws it
into navigation and sets up my route
guidance now if I want to look at media
sources I can just flip this button here
on the side and now I can see my various
media sources playing here if they also
of course have telephone and same thing
the same search function also works with
your address book so I my phone paired
to this car I can start tracing letters
to find anybody in my address book and
it'll bring up a list bring up the
results I can play psychologist by
pushing down on the central controller
here it's a really cool system they've
really streamlined this MMI interface
this virtual cockpit takes what out he
had before and makes it a lot easier to
get around a lot easier to find thing
the information flow is just so much
better and it's gonna be really exciting
when we get this car on the road I've
been cutting hammock here at CES 2014</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
