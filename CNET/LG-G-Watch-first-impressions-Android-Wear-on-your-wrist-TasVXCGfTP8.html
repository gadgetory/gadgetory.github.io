my wrist well this is one of two new
Android wear watches which are available
forward or now this is Google's entry
into wearable tech on the wrist and the
LG G watch is one of three there's also
the Samsung gear live and the Moto 360
but the Samsung and the LG ones are the
only two available right now the motor
one is going to be later in the summer
so what is the difference between these
two and what do they do the LG G watch
is the more expensive it's 229 and it's
got a 280 x 2 80 IPS LCD screen it's a
square screen and it's got a comfy rock
band it's like a silicone rubber type of
band see attached or like a regular
watch band it actually has a very
comfortable feel very nice sleek
materials glass on top and metal in the
middle black or white and it uses
android wear what is that exactly well
we don't even really know because what
we've been told is not exactly what it's
going to become right now it's basically
Google services you're going to talk to
your wrist or you're going to swipe
through notifications which come up like
cards a lot like Google now if you use
an android phone so if you want to
quickly ask it who's the foot 12th
president of the United States or where
can I get pizza around here or where's
the Moscone Center it'll pop up
something really quick you can also
check the weather and it will also send
notifications to you from all the places
that you get notifications if you have a
pebble watch or if you manage
notifications where we have another
smart device you already know what
that's about so we'll get things from
Twitter Facebook your emails and it can
get kind of crazy but you can also
manage that back on an Android wear app
that runs on your phone this only runs
as a companion to android phones android
4.3 or above is a whole list of
compatibilities you have to have
Bluetooth 4.0 and there is a little bit
of storage on this watch for gigs and
there's 512 megabytes of RAM unclear
what that means in terms of how it will
run apps and there will be apps a number
of Android apps are going to run and
then load onto this android wear watch
once they're available there aren't
really any right now there are also
moments where I can look at something on
the watch or search for something and
then press a button and
up on my phone if I want to read more so
it's meant to be kind of a companion app
experience between the watch and the
phone the LG G watch is also ip67
water-resistant the same type of water
resistance that you would see on things
like Samsung's gear watch's battery life
right now it's hard to tell it's got a
400 milliamp battery and it's getting a
bad day of use stay tuned for full
battery tests but that's certainly less
than other watches out there and it
means you're gonna need to charge this
thing pretty much every day that's if
you keep the screen on all the time it
goes into sort of a power-saving dimming
mode but you can also have that screen
turn off all together after you've been
using it for a few seconds and there are
no buttons on this you've got to tap the
screen or you've got to activate it or
talk to it so it gets a little
disconcerting no way to figure out how
you can override that with a button so
what else you get in the box you get
this watch you also get a little
magnetic charging cradle that is micro
USB and the plug and the plugs in here
pretty nicely as sticky kind of gel on
the bottom so it'll stick to a table and
allow you to put that by your nightstand
and charge it the LG G watch actually
feels better than it looks and it's one
of the thinner of the Android wear
watches but at this point early Android
wear software and there are more Android
wear watches to come at least the Moto
360 probably more so stay tuned and see
what's coming they're going to be a lot
of these things and we're gonna have to
see what the apps feel like to I'm Scott
Stein and that's a look at Android wear
on the LG G watch
