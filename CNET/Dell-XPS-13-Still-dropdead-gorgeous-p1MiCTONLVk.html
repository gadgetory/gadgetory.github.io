favorite 13 inch laptops when I first
saw it in early 2015
Walton Ayodele used 4 years for
different systems this new version with
a stunning departure stripping away the
traditional wideband of wasted bezel
space around the display for a nearly
edge-to-edge look it didn't hurt that
this was generally an excellent laptop
on top of that and offered high res
touch screen options which set it apart
from the other premium 13-inch laptop
everyone always obsesses over the
MacBook Pro late 2016 brings us the
refreshed version of that new XPS 13 and
while it's got a few updates including a
new processor it's essentially the same
system from last year and not that
that's a bad thing
the bezel free screen which Dell calls
in infinity display is still
unparalleled a MacBook doesn't even come
close and the sturdy attractive body is
room for plenty of ports and connections
which is something almost every other
thin 13-inch laptop is dropping the ball
on these days but since this design was
introduced almost two years ago now the
competition hasn't been sleeping we've
seen many much thinner laptops like the
HP Spectre and amazing OLED screens like
in the lenovo x1 ThinkPad also unchanged
is the single biggest thing I've heard
people complain about in the XPS 13 the
edge to edge display means there's no
room above the screen for a traditional
webcam so that has to get shifted below
the screen which makes for a perfect up
the no shot
