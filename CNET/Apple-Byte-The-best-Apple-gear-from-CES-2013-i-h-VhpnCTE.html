2013 it's a special edition of the Apple
byte so we're gonna scour the floor see
if we can find those unique things for
you guys so you know let's go check it
out come on all right guys you know
Apple has their own Smart Cover case but
this is the smartest case I have ever
seen this is the Ozaukee I coat and what
makes it unique is yeah you know you see
you have this plastic backing on there
you also have the magnetic little snap
cover but this has these different
little grooves inside of here that
allows you to fold it in five different
shapes for five different positions and
we like a lot of positions this case is
available now and it cost seventy nine
ninety nine I know it's not the cheapest
case but you know what I'm feeling the
Stalin it actually has function
hey guys we're here just mobiles booth
and you know I'm a huge fan of their
designs so they have two new really cool
products you know I just got an iMac so
these two are kind of relevant to me
this guy is called the a Lu rack and
what makes it unique is it fits on the
backside of your iMac so if you have a
lot of space behind your computer you're
on the go maybe on an office or an open
area you can actually put your laptop
your MacBook Air your MacBook Pro behind
the iMac to store it and then grab it
whenever you want
now the other product they have here
this is called the aloo base and you can
see here this is a MacBook Pro I can
just drop it into the space it comes
with two different inserts for different
sizes to support a MacBook Air or a
MacBook Pro but it's a really nice hefty
piece of aluminum feels really solid it
has a rubberized coating on the bottom
so that it stays in one place this is
priced at $50 the alloy rack is $60 but
these are two cool products when just
mobile that you guys to check out
oh my
this shiny one goes there and this oh
hey guys what's going on alright so
we're here at CES there are tons of
cases all over the place but this one's
pretty unique it's from you know bling
my thing and it's a do-it-yourself case
you know it kind of lets me express my
artistic side oh look guys there it is
someone real special it's gonna get this
thing alright guys we're here in the
mobi booth and we know if you're
familiar with their magic feed pack this
allows you to take this base and charge
some of others' apples devices like this
if you see this this is a specific
charger that goes in here and that
allows you to rest your mouse on here
and then charge it independently well
now they've added this new thing called
the magic juice it's gonna be $79 that
takes that same concept allows you to
rest it on this base and then take this
power wherever you go to charge
something like your iPhone or iPad it's
coming out of May but it's another way
that they're extending this portable and
wireless charging in the Mac ecosystem
to their own products I love this job
hey girl no no you don't need to look at
those things look look what I made for
you look at this thing yeah really oh
alright guys that does it for another
special edition of the Apple buy here in
Las Vegas I've got my camera here I'm
gonna take a picture see you guys
I made this for you will you take it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
