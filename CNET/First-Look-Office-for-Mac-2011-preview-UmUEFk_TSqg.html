at officemax 2011 preview now Mac users
might want an experience with office
that matches a little more of what you
can get out of office for windows and
the good news is that later this year
officemax looks like it's gonna be
promising an experience that's a lot
like office for windows and gives a few
new wrinkles and features that we
haven't seen before notably outlook and
one of the advantages of outlook should
be that the database file is actually
going to be saved as a bunch of files
instead of one large one but that means
it's easier spotlight searching and in
addition should work better with time
machine now on the Microsoft Word side a
cool thing is that it works a lot more
seamlessly with Microsoft's web apps an
apple has a lot of great software but
one thing they're not so fantastic with
is working in the cloud one nice thing
about word on office mac 2011 is that it
works seamlessly with microsoft's web
apps allowing you to save to its its
cloud environment and also pull
documents off from light editing to
actually bring it down in a word for
more full-featured editing well find out
a lot more as we get closer you should
expect it later this year and it should
be a nice surprise for anybody who's
looking to really turn their Mac into a
full office machine I'm Scott Stein and
this has been a first look at officemax
