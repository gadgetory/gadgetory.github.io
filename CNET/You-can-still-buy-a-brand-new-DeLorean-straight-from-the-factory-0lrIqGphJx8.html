the stainless steel because it's so
unique the Goldwing doors even you know
the the rear engine layout it's a true
Grand Touring sports car I was a
teenager when the car first came out in
1981 and it was just completely
different from anything else on the
roads here in America and it just caught
my attention this is the job that I
wanted when I was 16 years old you know
had the original company carried on I'd
probably be sweeping floors in a factory
someplace but just by happy accident I
happen to be here and it's it's fun to
be involved so intimately supporting the
legacy that is John DeLorean the car
that bears his name
I originally did my apprenticeship when
I was in Liverpool and I grew up there
and then came to the states in 1980 I
opened up a shop of my own in Los
Angeles fixing English French cars
Buju Renault ng trials by 82 I had
DeLorean owners coming to me asking me
if I if I would look at their DeLoreans
and then as the years went on it seemed
like it was the best way to go for
business so I just basically decided to
concentrate on DeLoreans
we opened up a facility in Houston which
originally we decided that it was going
to be more like a Central Depot to ship
parts to owners to make it more
convenient and quicker shipping time and
when we opened in 87 we invited what we
knew from the mailing lists of local
owners and and we had about 50 cars show
up and maybe a hundred people show up
and and at the end of the day 30 cars
stayed and since then I've never been
less than 30 cars in my possession here
in Houston in 1982 when the factory
closed they were still left with about
17 1,800 unsold cars and a factory full
full of parts to build more there was a
company called consolidated
International which acquired all the
unsold cars and all the parts they were
not car enthusiasts it was just a
business deal fast-forward to 1997
Steven was able to acquire all of that
inventory of parts that remained which
was still enough to fill this 40,000
square-foot building here full of
literally millions of brand-new DeLorean
parts from the factory nuts bolts
washers glass stainless wheels are still
available as new old stock parts from
the factory here we are with this big
warehouse and and I'm used to a part
about the size of this jam-packed with
all the spares no computer system no
staff and that's when the fun began of
course
our primary business here in Texas is
the sales service and restoration of
DeLorean cars at any given time we've
got between 35 and 45 cars here for
service or restoration literally from
all over the world we own all the
remaining stock of parts that came out
of the factory in Belfast and that
comprises most of our inventory so we do
part sales to shops and owners all
around the world as well as we put the
facility together and then we started
doing tours and people would come in and
people would say man you've got enough
stuff here to make cars like yep and
then it sort of evolved to why don't you
make us well we will and that's sort of
where we're at right now others about
2800 parts that make up a DeLorean
we have about 90 9.2 99.3% parts
availability now with that point seven
point eight percent it's it's things
that can typically be fairly easily
either reproduced or can be acquired as
a rebuilt or in some cases a used part
if it has to be by filling the holes in
the inventory so to speak there's about
a thousand doors here in the building
and the door of course being the most
complicated part of the car to reproduce
they're almost evenly matched in pairs
left and right so about five hundred
cars would be the maximum when we bought
all the inventory we did get all of the
technical specification all of the
drawings so over the years as as things
have run out we've reproduced them from
those drawings with CAD cam and with
scanning and with 3d modeling and stuff
like that things that were just so
impossible just a handful of years ago
seemed to get better and better all the
time
most everyone who comes in knows the
DeLorean from the Back to the Future
series of movies I think DeLorean had
just as much of a starring role as
Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd you
can't go to a gas station you can't stop
in a parking lot without somebody asking
where's the flux capacitor what happens
when you get to 88 miles an hour B and
you
that hey Marty as you're driving down
the road so it happens all the time it's
it's one of the things that we just have
to embrace I believe that if if it
weren't for the movies
this covered be no more remembered than
a Bricklin which was another goal wing
car that was made in very small numbers
outside the United States and sold in
the US
obviously it's phenomenal for us for the
brand we have all this free marketing
that's going on 24/7 around the globe
you watch Back to the Future you see a
DeLorean you go to the Internet and you
find out that hey DeLoreans are out
there we have had people that have come
in here that have been kids that have
come in in between their dad's legs
saying I wanted the Lorient and they've
grown up and come and bought one we've
seen it happen so many times
everybody's got a DeLorean story and
that's what's cool to hear that the car
made such an impact on people you know
not just 30 years ago but even still
today having been out of production for
32 years that people still recognize it
and like it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
