experience for Android I'm Tuscan all
court from Siena this is ami from
Facebook and this is the HTC first phone
that comes pre-loaded with facebook home
that is what facebook is calling its new
android experience it isn't exactly the
same as the app it's separate from the
app but it does take over the home
screen in a way that lets you interact
with certain Facebook features front and
center when you turn the phone on from
the lock screen the first thing that
you're going to see is a photo that's
animated in the background it takes over
the entire background you'll see it of
your friend you might even see a picture
of your own profile at the bottom so
right away you can view the photos
automatically or you can actually swipe
through them double tap to like a photo
and you'll see a very big thumbs up you
can also view the comments and add a
comment right from this cover fee you'll
notice that the phone itself has three
buttons at the bottom the circle button
is actually the home menu there's also a
back button and a menu button when you
touch the profile photo it can take you
back you can get to all of your apps or
you can get to messenger messenger is
kind of cool because it doesn't
distinguish between what's a facebook
chat and what is a text so in a way it
kind of borrows from apples iMessage so
the launcher is interesting because even
though you can see all of your apps laid
out you can save shortcuts to this app
launcher and the app launcher kind of
lays on top of the main image you can
swipe up to see it you can also page
through the launcher and you can have as
many launcher pages with shortcuts as
you want you simply press a drag to add
a short cut to the launcher in this
sense there are no traditional home
screen so there's only the launcher and
then of course the apps to get out you
can always press the circle button or
you can toss something down in a flick
motion and that will get you back to
your main screen
there is support for notifications they
will pop up onto the screen you can just
swipe them a way to get rid of them you
can tap to open the notifications and
take a closer look this will of course
work with notifications that come from
other apps if you want to see anything
else you can simply open up the app from
the app launcher or from the main screen
facebook has implemented a really
interesting way to talk to people
they're calling it chat heads yes chata
heads so it's an icon an image of a
friend kind of bubbles around and you
can click and drag it to the sides if
you want to reposition it and see it on
a different part of the screen it will
not go to the middle you can touch this
chat ahead to see any messages that are
in action to start a conversation to
message through either text or through
facebook chat you can tap again to close
it and when you're done you can flick
down to close the entire thing so you've
got multiple messages open you can
similarly flick down to close them all
at once the screen and chat heads are
very responsive it does feel a little
bit like the digital version of tossing
a soccer ball it's kind of fun the HTC
first phone is a mid-range device it's
got a 4.3 inch screen it's got a 5
megapixel camera on the back and it's
got the sort of soft touch finish that
you can see not a whole lot of extra
details or accents on the device it will
be exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T and it will cost a
hundred dollars with a new two-year
service agreement will also be available
on April twelfth and you can pre-order
it today so that's your very first look
at the HTC first cone and Facebook's new
facebook home for Android I've got to
get all 44 cnet we're going to have much
more on this coming up so stick with see
that TV
