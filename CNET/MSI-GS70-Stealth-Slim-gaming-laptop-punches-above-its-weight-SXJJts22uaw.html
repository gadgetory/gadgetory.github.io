laptop with a big screen and lots of
power I'm Dan Ackerman this is the msi
gs70 stealth now msi is one of those
companies that not only makes its own
computers it makes a lot of the bodies
that other smaller boutique computer
makers use to make their own gaming
laptop so it's nice to see the actual
original version here a lot of the
17-inch gaming laptops we've looked at
recently and we've been testing a whole
bunch from origin from Alienware from
others are those really traditional big
bulky boxes I love that this msi version
even though it's a 17 inch laptop with a
current generation nvidia graphics card
is super super slim it reminds me a
little bit of the old 17 inch macbook
pro that apple doesn't even make anymore
but that was a great example of a really
slim 17 inch system and you see it's
it's you know not super light but it is
very thin and they certainly pack a lot
in there you've got a 17.3 inch 1920 by
1080 screen it is not a touchscreen but
I haven't seen a full-fledged 17 inch
gaming laptop with a touchscreen yet
maybe someday you've got an Nvidia 800
Series card in this case it's the 870
not the super high-end 881 step down
from that but I think in most games
you're probably not going to notice the
difference or you'll appreciate this
just the slim size of this even more you
can get a bunch of different
configurations this one has a one
terabyte traditional hard drive and
about 300 something gigs of SSD hard
drive space a couple of smaller drives
sort of rated together I also like the
SteelSeries keyboard on here getting a
decent gaming keyboard especially into a
slimmer laptop usually very difficult
SteelSeries is company that makes really
good gaming keyboards so even though
this is a traditional kind of flat key
island style keyboard here it actually
works really well for gaming well the
touchpad passable but you're probably
gonna be using a mouse 90 percent of the
time anyway now like most of the other
big 17-inch gaming laptops this guy is
not inexpensive this particular version
is about $2,100 that's because you get
that big double hard drive the
traditional giant drive and then the
smaller SSDs rated together if you knock
something that down you could probably
get it down to 15 1600 and still get the
great graphics card and the great design
and the slim size you know I certainly
look forward to seeing a lot more of
these thinner gaming laptops go
forward hopefully somebody will get me a
touchscreen version soon I'm Dan Akron
and that's the msi gs70 stealth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
