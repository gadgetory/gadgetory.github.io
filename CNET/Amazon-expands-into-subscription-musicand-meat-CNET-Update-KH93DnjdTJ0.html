Spotify it's called Amazon music
unlimited the subscription music
streaming service is similar to what's
offered by a Spotify Apple Google and
all the others you can instantly stream
any song you want on-demand starting at
$10 a month but Amazon has a twist on
the price if you are a member of Prime
the monthly fee is knocked down to $8 a
month and if you want to go cheaper
there's also a $4 a month option but for
that crazy low price there's a catch you
can only listen to songs on an Amazon
echo smart speaker the integration with
echo is the real hook here echos
assistant Alexa now understands new
voice commands to play songs you can ask
to play a mix of genre or mood based
tracks from a specific decade or year
and if you don't know the name of the
song well Alexa can still play it if you
can rattle off some of the lyrics if
you're thinking wait didn't amazon
already have a music service well not
exactly prime subscribers had access to
a limited library of music that was
complementary with a prime membership
but it doesn't have access to as many
songs Amazon's latest expansion does go
beyond music though possibly into meats
Amazon is also looking into opening its
own small grocery stores according to a
report from The Wall Street Journal
citing people familiar with the plans
Amazon is not commenting on its
convenience store dreams but it would be
a natural way for Amazon to expand its
grocery delivery service Amazon fresh
it's not the first time we've heard of
such a report two months ago geek Wire
reported that Amazon was building a
drive-up grocery store in Seattle Amazon
has experimented with a few actual
brick-and-mortar stores ever since it
opened an actual bookstore in Seattle
last year that's it for this tech news
