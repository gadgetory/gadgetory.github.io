buzz report this week's grab ulis a
windows vista pylon and killer Stars but
first it's the gadget of the week the
gadget of the week is the Logitech
Squeezebox duet it's a little two-part
Wi-Fi equipped digital audio system that
will find all the music on your home
network or on a subscription music site
or on an internet radio station and play
it you plug the box into your home
stereo and then use the little remote to
navigate to whatever music you want to
play and then you play it and it works
and it's pretty easy to use I don't
really even have anything snotty to say
about it
it's a cena editor's choice it's just a
really cool idea i mean it cost 400
bucks that kind of hurts but it's super
cool except the name is kind of dorky
Squeezebox but other than that it is
perfect and now it's time to turn our
attention to an extremely important
issue scrab ulis for months now scrab
ulis has been in danger
the game which is a cheerful and ultra
addictive online ripoff of scrabble came
under fire by the makers of scrabble
buzzkill fans went crazy starting
petitions to save scribe ulis and then
this week realnetworks stepped in and
said they might you know I'll be able to
help out with the situation cuz they've
dig this grab ulis and they might own
some rights to Scrabble which could
probably install nine kinds of adware
anybody inscribe ulis notifications all
the time but whatever at least you'd be
able to play but then this week Silicon
Alley Insider reported the possibility
that a scribe ulis deal might not happen
because the two brothers who created it
are demanding tens of millions of
dollars for it so like it's kind of like
if I stole your car and I tricked it out
a lot with some fly rims and an xbox 360
with the plasma TV in the trunk and
stuff and then everybody in the
neighborhood loved it and I gave
rides all the time and I really did a
lot of work on it so then when the cops
came along and they said hey you have to
give that car back I said pay me 50
million dollars you feel me
well it's Friday and that must mean it's
time for some terrible Windows Vista
news this week Microsoft said it would
delay service pack 1 for Windows Vista
ultimate because of problems with 31
language packs the news follows a wave
of already terrible news about Vista and
sp1 it's available now supposedly only
to Microsoft developer Network
subscribers but apparently some people
just have it randomly show up and when
it does show up there's a good chance
it'll break some of your applications
especially security act and all of this
comes after Microsoft had to stop
distributing a Vista update related to
the service pack there was preventing
users from starting up their pcs after
they installed it and they actually
lowered the price of this so because we
assume they're desperate to sell some
copies you know this is really not as
much fun as I thought it was gonna be
pretty much just sad and now for a new
segment on the buzz report that I'm
calling you might remember a few weeks
ago when the US Navy shot down and out
of control spy satellite that was
threatening to crash into Earth and
poison us with toxic hydrazine fuel yeah
that was nothing check this out Wow
pretty picture right know that my
friends is a nearby star system that's
home to one highly unstable star that's
nearing the end of its life you know
supernova and when it does go supernova
there's a chance it could throw off an
intense beam of gamma rays that if aimed
at earth could strip away our ozone
layer and cause mass extinction like of
us yes the chances are remote and yes
the star probably won't go supernova for
a couple hundred thousand years but you
know what I freakin hate space I'm
Hollywood and this has been the buzz
report thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
