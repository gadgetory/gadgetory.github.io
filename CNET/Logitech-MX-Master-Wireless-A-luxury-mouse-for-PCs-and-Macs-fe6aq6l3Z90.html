this is the MX master wireless mouse
which retails for $100 and Logitech says
it's its best mouse ever typically
higher-end mice tend to be targeted at
gamers and yeah you can certainly use
this for gaming but it's designed for
day-to-day use and dare I say it actual
productivity
thanks to logitech's dark field laser
technology it works on just about any
service even on glass I didn't do
anything too fancy with it but it does
seem very responsive precise and smooth
from an ergonomic standpoint it also
feels quite comfortable as you might
expect from a high-end mouse it does
have plenty of extra bells and whistles
the first of these is an integrated
rechargeable battery that's supposed to
last up to 40 days on a single charge
you can connect the MX master to your
Windows or Mac computer with the
included unifying reciever
a small USB dongle that will also work
with Logitech keyboards or via Bluetooth
smart technology if you go with
Bluetooth you compare the mouse with up
to three devices and switch between a
laptop desktop or say a tablet using the
appropriately named Logitech easy switch
button on the bottom of the mouse Mac
users meanwhile enjoy the extra perk of
gesture support most the multi finger
trackpad gestures can be duplicated on
the MX master when holding down and
extra key it also has a speed adaptive
scroll wheel that lets you auto ship
from click to click to hyper fast
scrolling along with a thumb wheel for
side-to-side scrolling and page
switching you can customize all the
buttons on the mouse using the Logitech
option software it's worth noting
however that this mouse is for
right-handed operators only there's no
left-handed option Logitech says it
tried a left-handed Mouse a few years
ago but it was a major flop apparently
lefties use their right hand for mice or
up for the trackpad I currently use a
trackball with the Windows PC I use it
work at an Apple Magic Trackpad with an
iMac I have at home well both cost less
than the MX master my initial few days
with it have left me pondering a switch
I don't know if that makes this the best
Mouse ever but it's certainly worth
sitting if you're in the market for a
premium Mouse I'm David Carr noise and
that's the Logitech MX master wireless
mouse thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
