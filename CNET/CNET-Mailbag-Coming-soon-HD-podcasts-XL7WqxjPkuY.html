the cnet mailbag the show where we take
your feedback and answer your questions
about the stuff we're doing here at cnet
let's get started with what I am now
officially calling our burning question
Jamie and oh so many others asked us hi
Molly I was wondering when the HD
podcasts are coming to iTunes because I
noticed that a few weeks ago there were
two or three HD podcasts in my library
and then they disappeared thanks love
the show yes you may remember that we
accidentally delivered some HD episodes
into the feed and we've since rolled out
HD streaming at seen at tv.com but we
haven't resumed the HD podcast delivery
that's because we run our podcast
producer Jason Howells straight into the
ground all day every day and he hasn't
had time but he says he'll have them up
and running this week and we're holding
him to it now here are a couple things
to know about this if you want to get
the HD versions of our video podcasts
you will have to subscribe to the new HD
feeds will post those feed links at
podcast cnet com as soon as they're
available and they'll of course be in
itunes there will still be a standard
definition version for those of you who
aren't quite ready for those mondo
downloads and also we won't be
reinterred in HD so the new HD feed that
you subscribe to we'll just kind of
start that day no HD archives for you
sorry next up Scott wrote in and said
what is with the voice at the beginning
of the buzz report please get rid of it
i will give you two dollars is that a
deal he means this now from the number
one on air and online information source
with a digital age
well here's the thing Scott that voice
is Don LaFontaine and we found out right
after he died that he actually used to
announce a show called cnet central for
cnet when we were a TV network in the
90s and we think that's really cool and
so cool that we felt like we should
honor him by using that intro on the bus
report plus I love it like love it love
it but if you all hate it that's cool
just tell me and you know we'll see how
it goes moving right along lon fall
until he blew had a question about last
week's show did you just pointlessly
mentioned markless aya and mail bag
because he is hot or because he actually
liked your top from banana republic
maybe he did it really doesn't matter
because it's great that you mentioned
him and flashed his picture too because
he is hot I would like to suggest you
mentioned markless taya in any context
anytime like someone said they couldn't
find the link to a thing on cnet website
you could say you know who couldn't find
the link to the thing on the cnet
website mark lucia flash marks picture
and then proceeded to show or tell how
to find the link thing preferably get
mark to demonstrate it to with his
muscular arms sigh I'll see what we can
do lon fault that's actually not why I
mentioned him last week unless it was a
subconscious thing you know who else has
a subconscious mark Lucia oh I did it
again anyway Sam from Australia wrote in
and said in Brian tongs quick tip about
gmail and fighting spam he had a green
macbook what is it some type of shield
custom Sam I know it's cool right here's
how cool it actually is the case is
called the spec hard shell from speck
products com not only does brian Tong
have one or like 10 he used to work at
spec and it was his idea like he
invented it and it was the first laptop
case of its kind ever and thank you for
asking that question because I never
would have found out this amazing fact
about brian Tong if you hadn't written
in so awesome all right speaking of that
quick tip alex AKA tales from the IRC i
know what that means says bryan did a
tip on finding spam with gmail and said
you have to email address well you
actually have a bazillion you can add a
plus sign to your email
us so I love mollywood at gmail com
would become I love Molly would plus
seen it at gmail com I love Molly would
+ iphone at gmail com I love Molly would
plus Cylon @ gmail.com or anything else
just thought I'd pass it along tails
