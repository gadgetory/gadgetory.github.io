they do today which is a nice way of
saying you should probably put some duct
tape over that cassette deck
I'm Brian Cooley with the top five
things that are next in line to make
your car look like one eisenhower drove
you don't know who he is do you
number five the test drive not exactly a
technology but a time-honored technique
for deciding if you want a particular
car but a recent survey by IBM found 21
percent of recent new car buyers or
lessees never actually drove the car
they bought before they bought it I
think with the time they did all that
internet research they were probably
sick of the thing number four
gauges you know those things that look
like that watch you don't wear anymore
from top dollar Land Rovers and Jags to
a humble Chevy spark Eevee LCD screens
are taking over giving car makers real
flexibility in information display I
applaud the trend but not necessarily my
prospects when that whole module dies at
once
number three rear seat entertainment you
know those back seat DVD systems they
were never technically elegant and they
were always too much money plus your
kids were always bored with that handful
of scratched up DVDs or wedged in the
seat back pocket now they just have
their iPad and you just saved a couple
grand which you'll spend on data fees
for their iPad number two iPod
connectors cars used to have an iPod
connector for the cool kids and an aux
jack for the losers things have changed
now it's all USB ports that work with
all kinds of portables and car makers
don't have to care what connector Apple
just changed to the number one thing
that is going obsolete in cars and fast
is the CD player
never mind that it's the best sounding
source ever put into a car we don't seem
to care like a cougar bar around
midnight it's all about choice not
fidelity so now it's streaming apps mp3s
on portables satellite radio
that's what rules the dash Ford's
already done away with all their multi
CD changers and the 2013 chevy sonic was
I think the first car
not even offer a CD at all no matter how
you configure it to be on top of all the
new technologies that are coming and
going from cars these days follow our
show at CNET on cars.com and all of our
reviews at cars dot cnet.com i'm brian
