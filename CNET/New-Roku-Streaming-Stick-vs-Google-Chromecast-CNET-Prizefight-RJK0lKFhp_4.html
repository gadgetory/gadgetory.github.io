for a big time battle between streaming
sticks or dongles
it's a prizefight punch-out between the
new streaming Roku stick and Google's
latest chromecast
this prize fight will be decided by the
committee of one can't go wrong tom so
let's get it on round one is designed
Roku and Google brings simple and sweet
designs for streaming Roku's new stick
is almost the size of a stick of gum the
chromecast is a circular dongle and
they'll both hide behind your TV set
powered by a USB port or a plug-in
adapter both fit in your pocket and
we're calling this a tie next round is
user interface and navigation
the biggest difference out of the box is
that the Roku includes a remote control
but you won't find Roku signature
headphone jack now there Universal
search allows you to type in a title
actor or director and shows you where
you can watch that content across all
its apps Roku is interface is still the
best in its class and using its remote
to navigate is easier compared to the
chromecast that has no real interface
but relies on apps on your phone tablet
or your computer to throw content to
your TV it's biggest advantage it's easy
to throw content quickly to your TV but
it's not enough as Roku takes this round
round three is content
content will always be king and no one
can compete with Roku's deep deep
library of over 3,000 channels Google's
chromecast has all the key apps like
YouTube Netflix Hulu and HBO and it has
a better variety of games that you can
take to the big screen
chromecast mirroring from your laptop
makes up for some of the lack of content
but it's still laggy and just not good
enough
Roku brings the most content you can
find and takes another round round 4 is
performance content is important but so
is the amount of time it takes to get to
it the biggest issue we found were the
longer boot times for the Netflix and
YouTube apps on the Roku in our CNET
test it took Netflix 18 seconds to
launch on the Roku stick and only four
seconds on the chromecast the YouTube
app took 15 seconds on the Roku and 10
seconds on the chromecast now the
chromecast has the luxury of using your
phone or tablet to load the app first
but results are results and it takes
this round the final round is value the
Roku streaming stick is $50 and that's a
deal with the remote control in every
streaming service you can think of the
chromecast is even more wallet friendly
at 35 bucks if you're ok with using your
smartphone as a remote which a lot of
you are but Roku is still the best
streaming platform with an experience
you're getting that's well worth the
price so let's break it down we had a
tie in round one but then Roku took
three of the next four rounds and reign
supreme as this price fight King
I'm Brian Chong thanks for watching I
will catch you guys all next time for
another prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
