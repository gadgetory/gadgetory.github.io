mark let's say on cnet com and it's time
to get loaded amazon is launching to
native language Kindles in Italian and
Spanish both the Italian and Spanish
Kindle devices will come with bookstores
in each respective language the italian
kindle store will open with over 16,000
books while the spanish kindle store has
over 22,000 titles authors in both
countries can now publish their works
through the Kindle direct publishing
platform they sell 499 euros and yahoo
users apparently want themselves some
iphone Yahoo released its most search
terms of 2011 and the iPhone came out on
top Casey Anthony was number two and of
course just like every year the celebs
get their search love Kim Kardashian
Katy Perry and Jennifer Lopez rounded
out the rest of the top 5 being also
released their top searches although
Bing groups there's by category and
bings tech category Xbox was the most
searched consumer electronic Amazon's
Kindle came in second with PlayStation
iphone 5 and the iPad following in that
order Google's Android team is hard at
work to create software compatible with
a number of chips this could include
Intel and AMD processors which may power
future Android tablets where it is that
support for certain features like sound
camera and Ethernet aren't quite there
yet but we'll keep you posted and rumors
from the K business suggest that apple's
next gen ipad and iphone models will run
on the LTE networks not too much of a
surprise considering that the last two
iphone models were expected to have 4g
but did not apparently Apple execs met
with Japanese carriers to talk business
with the devices running on LTE they're
expected out in summer and fall of next
year and the European Commission has
formed a coalition aimed at making the
internet safe for kids it consists of
companies that operate in the european
union states and tech giants like Apple
Google Facebook and Nokia are on board
the Coalition is focused on implementing
age appropriate privacy setting tools in
technology policing material that could
be harmful to children and better use of
parental controls of course this means
parents need to be more tech savvy than
their kids those are your headlines for
today a mark
