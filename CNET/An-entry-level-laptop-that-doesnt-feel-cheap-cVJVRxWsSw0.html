look at the HP pavilion 11 this is in a
way a spiritual successor to one of our
favorite laptops from a couple of years
ago that was an 11 inch HP called the DM
onesie and we love that one back then
because for about three or four hundred
dollars you got an 11 inch ultra
portable laptop that didn't weigh a ton
worked fairly well was a big step up
from the netbooks that were still
popular around then this new version the
pavilion 11 obviously aunty quite a bit
by adding a touch screen which you
really do need for windows 8 and of
course it's got that Windows a tile
interface which works well on a smaller
11 inch screen like this of course there
are a couple of trade-offs because this
guy starts at 399 now we have a 429
upgraded slightly bigger hard drive
you're dealing with an AMD processor
which just is not going to be as speedy
as a basic intel core i3 processor
course only have four gigs of ram and
you don't have a lot of the fancy extras
like an SSD hard drive or even bluetooth
which you can get as an add-on here in
the base model i would normally say that
399 or even 450 for something like this
like you know it's it's three point four
pounds it's not super light it's not
super slim but you consider it cost less
than an ipad you know it's actually a
pretty sharp design with some nice metal
accents on it and a pretty solid
keyboard I'd say that's a pretty good
deal unfortunately this system ran afoul
of one of my pet peeves I found that web
surfing and on a smaller screen with a
lower resolution you have to do a lot of
that two finger scrolling to go up and
down a web page a kind of a sluggish at
times and that's really what you spend a
lot of your time doing and I personally
blame that lower power AMD cpu here I
found that to be pretty annoying i'd be
willing to spend a little bit more to
trade up to a faster cpu either an intel
one or you can actually throw 50 bucks
on top of this andrew up to the next
level of AMD cpus the a6 instead of the
a4 now for about four hundred dollars
you still get a pretty finish lightish
well-constructed design and a
touchscreen which is pretty tough to
find in this price range but I'm not
sure this is the go everywhere everyday
