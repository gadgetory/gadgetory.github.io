Francisco Airport international terminal
each day and now the airport has some
high-tech help to speed them through
customs SFO installed 40 self-service
kiosks that eliminate the need to
manually fill out customs paperwork
filling out the form waiting in line
handing it to an officer having that
information be reviewed all of that can
happen now in about 90 seconds or less
at the kiosk passengers scan their
passport take a picture and answer
questions they can also submit
fingerprints none of the information is
stored on the machines passengers then
take the printout to a customs officer
to review the Vancouver Airport
Authority which developed the machines
says wait times have been reduced up to
eighty nine percent for kiosk users
there's a lot of eligible travelers u.s.
Canadian passport holders people
arriving under a visa waiver and that's
about 35 different countries in the
coming months the kiosks will be
upgraded to include facial recognition
technology the automated passport
control system is being used in more
than 30 airports including Los Angeles
Chicago and New York's JFK the officers
like it because it does be the process
through it's a lot easier for them to
see the information quickly the next big
advance will involve your smartphone
it's a lot easier I mean bringing us up
to the modern age with electronics
applications that can be used on your
iPhone or your tablet an appt tested in
Atlanta last year is now also available
in Miami Seattle and Chicago's O'Hare
the free app lets passengers fill out
information on their mobile devices
submitted upon arrival and head straight
to a customs officer potentially cutting
out wait I'm even more in San Francisco
