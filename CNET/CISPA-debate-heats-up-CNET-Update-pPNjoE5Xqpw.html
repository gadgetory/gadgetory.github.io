Bridget Carey and this is your signet
update there's a new controversial
cybersecurity law up for a vote this
week and it has many concerned about
privacy rights the bill is called sista
which is short for Cyber Intelligence
Sharing and protection act it's designed
to give Homeland Security more resources
to better track down and fight cyber
terrorists but some say his powers are
too broad giving the government the
ability to snoop through medical records
private emails online financial
documents all without a warrant or
limits and there's a new proposed
amendment that would give the Homeland
Security Secretary Janet Napolitano the
ability to bonner all government
networks and communication this would
trump the existing privacy and
surveillance laws the debate begins on
the house for Thursday and voting takes
place Friday Apple posted earnings that
