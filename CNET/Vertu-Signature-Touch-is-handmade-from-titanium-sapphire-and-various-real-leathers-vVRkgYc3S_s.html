an Android phone that looks unlike any
other and also comes with a price tag
unlike any other this phone starts at
six thousand seven hundred and fifty
pounds or around eleven thousand three
hundred fifty dollars
there's no denying us a shocking price
tag but you do get a hell of a lot of
phone for your money let's start with
the design forget about the plastic
Galaxy S five this thing has a body made
from titanium it's wrapped in leather
although you can also have it wrapped in
alligator or lizard skin if you want to
spend even more money and the screen is
covered in a hundred and eighteen carat
sapphire glass can your phone screen be
measured in carats no it canals
certainly has a striking aesthetic it's
an aggressive complex design that
certainly won't be to everyone's tastes
particularly if you're more fond of the
minimalism of the iPhone it feels great
to hold though and is at the very least
I catching the speakers are provided by
high-end audio specialists Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen
while the camera have been certified by
Hasselblad makers of some of the best
cameras in the world you may have
noticed the red button on the side
that's not just there for show pressing
it will put you in immediate contact
with vertie user concierge service who
will do basically anything you ask
whether it's arranging a chauffeur to
the airport or more likely flying a
fleet of private jets the phone is also
able to encrypt your calls and text so
prying eyes and ears can't spy on
whatever shady deals have made you rich
enough to buy the phone in the first
place inside the phone is of course
running the latest android kitkat
software is powered by a supercharged
quad-core processor and it has a full HD
display now I'm not going to say whether
a phone that costs about 13 times the
price of a galaxy s5 is a good buy or
not that really depends on how much you
value handcrafted - luxurious design
exclusive services and knowing that your
phone costs more than most people's cars
if nothing else I'd recommend looking at
one yourself the curiosity stake are one
of 13 boutiques in Beverly Hills Bond
Street in London or in Moscow but I
would suggest putting a shirt on if you
want any chance of being allowed with
the door
