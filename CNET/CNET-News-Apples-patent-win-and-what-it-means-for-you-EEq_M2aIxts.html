much Samsung must pay apple in damages
for copying key aspects of the iphone
and ipad apple claims samsung had ripped
off design elements including rounded
corners and parts of the user interface
like the pinch to zoom and rubber band
features after two days of deliberations
a federal jury here in San Jose on
Friday cited overwhelmingly with the
ipad and iphone maker this means they're
going to have a lot more ammunition when
they go after other companies they've
already gone after HTC they've gone
after motorola and it's really kind of
gives them the power to go against
someone like google directly with
something like Android Apple viewed the
verdict as a validation of its
innovations saying in a statement quote
the lawsuits between Apple and Samsung
were about much more than patents or
money they were about values in its
statement Samsung was unwilling to
concede a victory to Apple saying quote
today's verdict should not be viewed as
a win for Apple but as a loss for the
American consumer it will lead to fewer
choices less innovation and potentially
higher prices and there could be further
consequences when companies spend tens
of millions of dollars fighting legal
battles they're spending less on
innovation smartphone users are likely
to feel the verdicts impact when
shopping for a new device there's going
to be a drought for a little while in
terms of the the range of options that
are available in the android overall
market this isn't the last word between
the tech giant's the two companies are
scheduled to go to trial again over yet
another set of patents in 2014 in San
Jose I'm Sumi das cnet.com for CBS News</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
