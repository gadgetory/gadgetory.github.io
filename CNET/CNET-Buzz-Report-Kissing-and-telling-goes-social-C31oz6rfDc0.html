online information source with a digital
age
hi i'm molly wood and welcome to the
buzz report this week robot cars the
return of windows and sleazy websites
but first it's the gadje of the week the
gadget of the week is the robot Prius it
was built by Anthony levendusky who just
happens to be an engineer for google the
Prius is fully autonomous and recently
it drove itself along San Francisco to
mark Adaro hopped on the bay bridge and
exited at Treasure Island and the only
bad thing that happened is that it kind
of scraped the wall a little bit well
and it took us another step closer to
Google having either direct or indirect
control of all the technology will ever
need to lead us to our robot overlord
apocalypse but other than that it's a
very impressive technological
achievement and now for the news rumor
has it that the next version of Windows
Windows 7 has hit a major milestone and
that a public beta might be available by
the end of the year dude it better be
and it better be good like get the
stench of Vista off your shoes good
because I got to tell you I like the
Seinfeld gates ads but I'm feeling like
I'm the only one the US government
accountability office says the
Department of Homeland Security is quote
not prepared to handle cyber threats in
fact some analysts now think that DHS
can no longer even be trusted with the
cyber security mission and that someone
else needs to step in for the sake of
national security and you know what
happens now we outsource it to Google
its pieces in a puzzle people put it all
together oh all right I'll stop now it's
just almost too easy in other news this
week reports surfaced that apparently a
limited number of new for gigabyte apple
ipod nanos were being sold in europe
even though the new nanos were
officially released in 8 gigabyte and 16
gigabyte configurations although frankly
why anyone care to report this is beyond
me and finally let's see what's
happening in the world of web sites this
site is not clogging the tubes yet and
hopefully it never will be boffer e-comm
is in private beta and it will according
to early billing be a site where you
upload information about people you had
sex with and then the site will create a
neat little more
to show just what a kiss and tell
a whole you really are people that is
not polite don't do that I'm mollywood
and this has been the buzzer report
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
