is logitech's harmony touch universal
remote control this is a first for
logitech harmony the well known brand of
universal remote controls because it
does involve a touchscreen this remote
about a third of it right in the middle
it's a 2.4 inch color touch screen so
that allows some extra customization and
some pretty cool tricks on the flip side
it doesn't have as many buttons as
traditional Harmony universal remote
control so in all I really didn't like
it quite as much despite being a lot
more expensive and a lot more seemingly
advanced because of that touch screen
we'll start with the design on this
remote it's actually a really cool look
if you hold in your hand it's a little
bit smaller than the traditional larger
wands from harmony it's also got a very
nice feel my finger kind of slid right
into the back here it's got kind of a
curved back when you set it on the table
it's got a nice sexy slide right from
the back to the front so all things
considered it's one of the most
attractive remotes I've seen the front
does tend to attract a few extra finger
prints but not much more so than a
standard smartphone or tablet that's
really the look that Logitech was going
for here with this remote it does look a
little bit more like a smartphone or a
tablet than traditional remotes and
again that's because of this touchscreen
the screen itself is pretty responsive
when you get into the settings you can
actually play around and move the
buttons so that's one of the nicer
things in fact the remote can move the
buttons without having to connect it to
a computer so that's one of the nice new
things about this remote like all
traditional harmony remotes it's
designed to control your entire system
by activities you can scroll through the
activities here you see their watch TV
and a bunch of other different
activities clicking on one of those will
send a series of codes to the television
and your entertainment center to engage
whatever devices you have and of course
set the remote itself to control all the
different devices seamlessly one of the
other cool options the touch screen
gives you is the ability to have
favorite channels programmed right in
there so you can put up to 50 of these
channels with icons and easy access
instead of scrolling through your dvrs
guide another thing the screen gives you
is a numeric keypad you might have
noticed there's no keys on the actual
remote so you have to go to this virtual
keypad to type in channel numbers and
like on the downside that lack of
buttons on this remote does mean that
you don't get quite as easy access to a
lot of the best known functions and I
really found that to be a deal-breaker
another step of feature of the Logitech
touch is the built-in rechargeable
battery
you can't remove the battery if
something goes wrong so you might have
to make a service called a logitech on
the other hand this cradle does provide
a nice home base for the remote control
so you might not spend as much time
looking for it around the living room
one of the worst economic decisions
logitech made with this remote is to put
the transport controls which are play
pause fast-forward all those at the very
top so they're really difficult to reach
and I use those controls all the time
for example when skipping commercials on
a DVR speaking of skipping commercials
this the remote does not have a
dedicated button for a forward and
reverse skip for 30 seconds skip for
example on a TiVo of course you can
program those using a soft key but it's
really nice to be able to have a hard
key for those things especially if you
do a lot as commercial skipping in your
DVR does offer 30-second skip real big
downside and of course traditional
Logitech remotes do have that button the
bottom set of buttons is a little bit
more difficult to reach than I'd like to
see as well you can actually have to
stretch to get down to the guide and the
DVR buttons the cursor controls a little
easier to access but again not quite as
nice as I'd seen on some remotes where
they do place that really central cursor
directly below the thumb one of the cool
things the touch screen does allow is
gestures so you can program up to five
different gestures swiping in the four
cardinal directions and also a tap and
that does allow a little bit closer to a
smart phone style interface but on the
flip side the screen itself isn't as
responsive as most smartphones and
things like scrolling can go awry and
especially because there's a strip here
along the bottom you can sometimes
accidentally activate the devices or the
help function like all harmony remotes
the touch does require you to connect a
PC to do all of the heavy lifting in
terms of programming you can also learn
commands from your other remotes if they
aren't in Harmony's database that whole
process went relatively seamlessly and
again it's one of the main features of
harmony remotes of course it is
available on a lot cheaper remotes like
the 650 and that is the tuchas main
downfall as the 650 is available for
about a fifth of the price of this
really expensive remote it's about 250
dollars lists and that means you can buy
a Harmony 650 for sixty-five dollars
that's a huge difference in price and
for my money I'd rather spend it on a
tablet which is about the same price as
this remote that's a quick look at the
Logitech Harmony touch I'm David Katz my
