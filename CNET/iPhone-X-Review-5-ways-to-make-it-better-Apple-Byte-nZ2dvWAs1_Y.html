and you know what it is this is the
iphone 10 and this is going to be our
review it's gonna be a little more
laid-back we're not gonna just jump into
all the specs and all the features we
like to talk about the experience of
using it you know what are the things
that stand out what do we like and then
one of the ways that apple can do to
improve this phone whether it's for next
year or even within this year and we
know right off the bat i mean this thing
is gorgeous this is by far in my opinion
the best design iphone that we have ever
seen from a standpoint of you know you
have that whole full screen look but
then at the same time after using this
for a while like people that have it
have found out this may not be the
iphone for everyone so let's just jump
into it and first let's talk about the
speed of this thing obviously if you
play with this phone it's a speedy phone
you're not gonna feel like it's slow at
any point in time but really where the
speed comes into play is how you use it
we know that Apple is now bringing us
face ID they took out the home button
they took out touch ID and there's
actually ways space ID is surprising
like it actually works really well there
are instances where face ID is actually
faster for example if you pick up your
phone it's been on the table and you
have notifications the fact that when
you look at it you can just tap those
notifications that show up and it goes
right into it another way that face ID
is actually faster is when you're using
sites like let's say banking sites you
don't have to enter in your information
you go into that login screen you happen
to be looking at your phone and voila
you're in so those were kind of some of
the couple of instances where face ID is
actually faster use but then you also
come across situations where it's slower
to use nothing can beat the speed of
touch ID we know this but I think there
were times where it was almost too fast
so for example in previous iPhones you
have your lockscreen wallpaper that
looks really nice I would double tap it
and before I could even see it or enjoy
it it would already be gone so in a way
because face ID takes that extra split
second I can actually enjoy my
lockscreen wallpaper
I'm not saying slower is better but in
this situation it kind of is there's
also other ways we're not having touch
ID does affect how you use the phone
face ID isn't always gonna be faster so
there's some concessions here for
example when you're closing apps it
takes an extra step you have to drag
from the bottom up and hold it then you
have to hold on your screen so that you
can actually delete or manually close
apps that takes longer
I don't really like that also with Apple
pay when you're at a point-of-sale
register you you have to look at the
phone so before I used to just pull out
on my pocket
DoubleTap the touch ID and boom I didn't
you have to think about it I didn't have
to look at it you do kind of have an
extra beat so there's those moments
where it's absolutely faster to use face
ID but there's other times where it's
just not so you got to get over the fact
that touch ID is gone you know there's
things like the control center it really
requires you to use two hands almost to
bring it up swipe from the top right
hand corner you can use reach ability
and then swipe from that corner but it's
still another step so some things are
faster some things are slower and when
we say slower we're really talking about
like literally a second here and there
this is not a deal-breaker but it's just
something that you will experience when
you use the iPhone 10 not only from the
first day but as you continue to use it
all right next up we've got to talk
about the screen I mean I rave about the
design display made actually rated it
the best screen in a smart phone ever I
mean that's high praise but really
there's two people that are going to
love this first of all if you had a plus
phone and you're going down to the
iPhone 10 it's a smaller form factor but
you still got that great screen real
estate most of those people love it and
if you're one of those people that still
has yet to get it and you want to go
down from A+ a 10 you're gonna
absolutely love the screen and then
there's this other group of people
pretty much someone who's always been an
iPhone user but has never had a large
screen phone I think a lot of them are
are wowed by it because not only is it
OLED but it's also the first kind of big
screen form factor that they've ever had
they aren't used to seeing what else is
out there from like Samsung or you know
the Google pixel phones so that's why
they're gonna love this phone the screen
is really top-notch and I think you're
gonna love it
another thing that I love about this
look the camera here is great DxO mark
rated it the best smartphone for taking
photos specifically but when you use
this camera right you can battle these
between any other phone the top-tier
cameras that are all great they're just
kind of come down to maybe specific
things that you're that are more
important to you whether it's like
exposure the texture the color balance
of the actual camera that's gonna help
you decide which phone to get but bottom
line this camera is phenomenal you love
all those different modes one thing that
makes it kind of funny is that the
selfie camera is so good it like it's
almost
to sharp it's it's like we're not used
to seeing our faces that sharp and it
can kind of actually be a little like
disturbing you're like yeah I don't want
to use this selfie camera as much but
bottom line this is a great camera on
this phone so those are some of the
things that just really stand out about
this phone and I think what's unique
about it too is the more that I've used
this phone the more I like it I've
talked to other people they feel the
same way and that's a good thing like
the more you use something and you
actually start enjoying it more that's a
great thing with the phone so the iPhone
definitely delivers in that from that
standpoint now let's talk about how we
can actually make this phone better or
ways that Apple can improve it maybe
even improve it within this year the
first thing is look we talked about a
lot there's no home button what could
they possibly use to emulate or replace
that home button for me they've got to
use 3d touch now 3d touch is an
interface that isn't used as much one of
the reasons why some people don't even
know it's there
Apple doesn't require us to use it to
use the phone you know we have all these
new gestures that you have to learn to
use the iPhone 10 why not use 3d touch
kind of like as the home button with a
hard press you get that feedback it's a
combination of face ID as well as it
speeds up as face ID gets better I think
that would be a great way to kind of
give some of those people that home
button feeling that they miss put it in
that home button spot and make it feel
like you know what this is a complete
slate of glass we know that Apple is
moving in that direction
eventually we're just gonna have a piece
of glass in her hand but put some sort
of a home button I think 3d touch would
be the answer for that another thing
they can do is that when I pick this up
it felt like an iPhone and that's a
great thing you want the device to feel
like it but at the same time it it can
sometimes feel underwhelming like this
is a great piece of hardware but it felt
exactly like iOS 11 which feels like iOS
10 it doesn't feel like there's anything
really fresh with software other than
the fact that you're forced to know and
learn new gestures to operate the phone
so what I'm asking for maybe maybe it's
me just being like expecting too much
I'd like to see some new software
innovations and features 3d touch still
totally underutilized but also look at
what other phones are doing out there
they're adding these bells and whistles
that are usable you know like sorry the
pixel has the same
new feature with an always-on phone you
have you know phones that have enabled
you to squeeze the sides
it might sound gimmicky but there's ways
to add true software innovation and
functionality that maybe Apple hasn't
prioritized so that's one of the things
that you have this great device give me
some new great features in software and
don't tell me that an emojis is an truly
innovative software feature
it's fun it's it is fun another thing
that is maybe one of the most divisive
things about the iPhone 10 for me it has
to be the knotch now some of you are
used to it they you know I've heard
people say oh I don't really see it
anymore that's okay but I'm not that
person like the not still bothers me and
I'm reminded of it constantly especially
when I'm writing an email or a tweet or
text message and you see all this extra
space underneath the keyboard if you
look at that really carefully look the
knotch does make it look unique I get it
like I just not for me
other people make that's why Apple
that's how they brand it as the iPhone
10 fine I'll give you that but for me I
wish they could just make it a solid bar
black bar across the top move down the
utilities like Wi-Fi Bluetooth the
battery put it right below that and then
shift everything down like if you look
at the keyboard screen there is more
than enough space for that and then
you'll still have enough space to swipe
your thumb from the bottom to the top or
bottom up to unlock the phone I think
that that is something that we won't
always see this notch I mean shoot maybe
we will Apple does what they want but
for me I don't like the notch and I
think there's a way to get rid of it to
still make it sleek and sexy and smooth
this one's not a deal-breaker for me but
especially like this phone is great
guess what most of us are gonna put a
case on it like I don't want to put a
case on it but you have to but it's it's
actually a lot heavier compared to
previous iPhones like if you close your
eyes you put them in one hand it's
heavier when I put it in my pocket with
the with the case I can definitely feel
its weight again it's not a deal-breaker
maybe I'm just nitpicking but it's a
heavier phone another thing that bothers
me is now with this new iPhone we have a
lot of different interfaces and you eyes
from original iPhones with home buttons
the iPhone 10 and even the iPad they're
kind of disconnected and I get it like
we are moving towards a single piece of
glass with literally no buttons I know
that's the vision and that's the
future but right now you know with the
iPhone 10 you slide up for your home
button for your home screen or to unlock
it and you slide down from the top right
to get control center on the iPad pros
you slide from the bottom up to the top
to get to the control center and then on
the right you know the current standard
iPhones 8 and lower you press a button
it's the interfaces are disconnected
it's really the most fragmented we've
ever seen Apple software and I just wish
and would like to see it to be more
ubiquitous across the product line like
Apple used to I get it it's different
hardware but they still could have kind
of made them a little more cohesive and
that would have been a nice thing
so who's this phone really for I mean
come on it's for the gadget lover it's
for the hardcore Apple fan it's also for
someone who wants you know Apple's best
design phone ever and they look at it I
look at this thing as like Apple's
concept car right now this is just the
start if you want to jump on that you
want to take a ride and you want to see
what happens you know what to expect
like if you're someone who wants a
headphone jack if you're someone who
stills got to have a home button you
shouldn't get this phone like I'm not
gonna get this phone for my mom I'm not
gonna get this phone for my dad I'm
gonna wait until the absolute last
moment for them to jump on to this form
factor just because it's really not for
them so overall this is a great phone
this is yes the best iPhone Apple has
ever designed I'm some people calling it
the best phone they've ever made it's
hard for me to say that because it still
isn't for everyone but you know I think
about this phone everyone talks about
the $1,000 price point it's not up to me
to tell you if it's worth spending
$1,000 over your own money I hate it
when people say it's not worth it no one
is gonna tell me or you how to spend our
money but for me I mean it was worth
$1,000 so guess what I bought it for
myself that was for me I think also
overall when you look at this phone you
know if you know what you're going to
get into the lot you know you're losing
a lot of things but you're learning new
things it's really just a beautiful
piece of glass that's a screen and
that's a good thing that's a cool thing
you're gonna enjoy this phone I don't
you're not gonna just like it a lot I
think you're gonna end up just loving
this phone a lot and that's cool because
you should love something that you spend
a thousand dollars more so there you
have it that's kind of our Apple bite
review I'd love to hear what you guys
and gals think in the comments whether
you agree with what I said
the things I said disagree with
everything I said let us know write down
in the comments we're gonna check them
all out and there you have it the Apple
bite iPhone 10 review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
