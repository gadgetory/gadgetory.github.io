surprise quake is back quick Champions
is in production from its software if
you never played Skyrim and you happen
to own a ps4 or Xbox one you are in luck
because Skyrim special edition which
will feature updated graphics and mods

future holds for Fallout 4 including
some new DLC that will continue to hit
this summer not to mention a pc version
of the mobile hit fallout shelter
bethesda also teased out fallout in BR
and they're actually releasing a version
of that for HTC vive in 2017 speaking of
VR Bethesda is exploring ways to bring
the doom experience to be are but for
now doom will be getting some free
content updates and premium DLC very
soon also Bethesda is offering the first
level of the game for free on any
platform you want to try it out on so
remember pray and all those rumors about
pray too well developer arkane studios
is actually doing more of a reboot of
the game and it's just called pray I
know it's confusing the debut trailer
showed us a future where humans are
being experimented on and an alien
invasion looks to make things even more
complicated but yeah it does look pretty
cool finally Bethesda took a lot of time
showing off dishonor to it looks like
the team at Arkane Studios is trying out
some really creative and unique gameplay
abilities with the tandem of characters
you'll play at dishonor to takes place
in a new city 15 years after the
conclusion of the first game the regular
end Collector's Edition hits consoles
and PC on November 11
