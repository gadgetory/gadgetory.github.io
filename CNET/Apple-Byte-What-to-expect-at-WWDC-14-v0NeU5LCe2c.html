to the show for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple and this week
it's all about what you can expect to
see at WWDC 2014 just a few days before
the big announcements all right let's
get to the show and Apple officially
announced they'll be making their WWDC
keynote announcement available for the
public to see with a live stream on
Monday June the second at ten a.m.
pacific time with exciting announcements
now june second will also be the day
that no work gets done now Apple doesn't
always do this so consider it a treat
and you know see that we'll have our
signature pre keynote and post keynote
coverage for all of apple's
announcements right here so make sure to
hang out with yours truly and the rest
of our crew will be taking your live
calls live tweets and we'll break it all
down for you now I think it's going to
be a good one this year so what should
we realistically expect to see from the
beg a well the Financial Times is
reporting that Apple has been working on
an iOS controlled smart home automation
platform that will be unveiled at WWDC
now remember this conference is all
about the developers and there's
typically less of an emphasis on
hardware the platform would turn the
iphone into a remote control for your
lights your security system and other
household appliances Apple is one of the
first retail stores to carry Philips hue
light bulbs and the nest thermostat that
can both be controlled by your phone but
apples looking bigger to unveil a new
central platform that will do it all
with different devices now the report
says it will be similar to Apple's made
for iphone program that labeled speakers
headphones and accessories except this
time it will apply to light bulbs home
appliances and more but too bad they
can't use the name my home yeah it's
already taken by this guy now if you've
been following the show we pretty much
have kept you up to speed on what else
to expect but just in case iOS 8
codename Kokomo is expected to get a
boatload of new features in all of this
will point the new hardware we can
expect to see in the near future fitness
and health tracking will get a big push
with the health book application that is
expected to aggregate health and fitness
data from different apps and hardware
all into one place it'll be able to
track any
thing from steps taken calories burned
miles walked in even blood work details
like heart rate blood pressure and blood
sugar levels now maps will finally bring
public transportation and it improved
maps with clear labeling and data that
will be more reliable but I'll be the
judge of that we're also hoping to see
voice over LTE become a standard part of
the OS currently many calls are sent
over last gen 3g networks but voice over
LTE would bring significantly improved
call quality and if you've ever tried a
FaceTime audio call it sounds amazing
with a good signal and that's really
what we're missing all right in the US
t-mobile currently supports it while
verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are testing it out for
a roll out later this year we may or may
not see this depending on if the
carriers are ready and will be curious
to hear anything about the new carplay
and what type of inter a pinta gration
we might see bridging third-party apps
to apple's new platform all right OS 10
10 point 10 is codenamed sera after the
fine red wine and reports from nine to
five max that Jony ive is leading a
significant design overhaul for OS 10
and the new aesthetics will be the
flagship feature apple will be touting
with a new look and feel across the OS
expect it to be flat and white and
hopefully they get rid of their hyper
colors and what about Dre don't forget
about Dre don't know me fix a mochi put
a fizz okie Apple confirm the deal for 3
billion dollars with this nice picture
but I don't know about you I was just
hoping that Tim Cook we rockin a big
chain in this picture and also uh he's
hiding something something on his wrist
now WWDC could be the place to talk
about the Apple beats vision for a music
service moving forward but let's also
hope Dre does not perform on stage
because Kanye did that years ago and
everyone stayed seated and watched like
it was an app demo you got below me
takes pics take this haters
it was embarrassing all right onto the
hardware side like I said last week we
aren't expecting an iphone or i watch
here they could prove me wrong but WWDC
has always been the place where new
computer hardware has been announced in
the past now I expect we'll see new
macbook pro retinas with speed bumps at
the very least and the dark horse here
could be the long-rumored 12 inch Retina
Display MacBook Air with a thinner
design and an all new body we just don't
know this for sure yet also imax mac
minis and even the mac pro could be in
the mix for speed bumps and price drops
but if not at WWDC then most likely
during the back-to-school season and
again I know I still don't see an iWatch
or an iPhone here but the surprise could
be the all new Apple TV because this is
where developers are and if they're
going to open it up for more apps and
games this is the place to show it off
so really that's a lot of stuff packed
into a two-hour presentation we have iOS
8 OS 10 a possible home automation
platform new MacBook Pros another way
too long demo for the next infinity
blade yawn then there's a chance for
speed bumps to other macs and the
possibility for the all new Apple TV
it's more than enough to talk about all
that WWDC 2014 stuff until next week but
there's a wrap up of what we expect here
at the apple pipe alright guys let's get
to our spec macbook pro case give away
last week we told you to decide if it
was a good apple or a bad apple for the
big a to take down the weed firm app now
a lot of you said it was bad because
Apple wants to keep all the weed to
themselves which is exactly what a
pothead would say so congrats go out to
our appt abiders on email john lozol day
says bad apple because what is wiz
khalifa going to do in his free time
Kerry Gong says good apple because weed
is a bad for anyone and on Twitter
Daniel yanez thinks it's a good Apple
only because he liked the picture of the
good apples we showed and ebrahim Namir
says it's a bad apple since they just
showed they are against high tech all
right congrats to all of you and we will
be in touch keep sending me your email
to the Apple by to cnet com or tweet a
brian Tong so I can read them while I do
my
my crunches you know what the summer
coming up got to work on that that's
going to do for this week so we'll see
you after WWDC 2014 and I'll catch y'all
next week for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
