easy to be impressed especially at its
price currently at around a thousand
dollars it's six motors are attached by
folding carbon-fiber arms and once in
the air its legs can be lifted up giving
its 360 degree rotating 4k resolution
camera and unobstructed view it also has
obstacle detection so it'll stop itself
from hitting things in front of it and
it's piloted with this massive
controller with a 7-inch touchscreen
built-in and a mess of buttons knobs and
switches or you can fly it with this the
little wizard controller which can also
be used as a gps tracker for the typhoon
h to follow you automatically actually
flying it was literally hit or miss
though as I had one fly off on its own
and crash into a tree and another had a
motor failure though a built-in failsafe
lets it safely land with its five
remaining motors when it was flying it
worked his promise so Chuck my
experience up as anomalies but I did
learn the H is not sturdy in particular
the camera mount it is fairly user
serviceable though and all of its parts
are available online or through the
company so definitely points there and
it does deliver good video my
recommendation
the typhoon H deserves consideration by
seasoned pilots with a lot of open space
to fly
