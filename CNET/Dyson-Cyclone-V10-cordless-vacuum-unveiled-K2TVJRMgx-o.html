sometimes suck or not suck like they
should the engines are not as powerful
and battery voltage can fade the longer
you clean but niacin says they've worked
on that and have made this just as
powerful as a corded back this is the
cyclone v10 it is a light machine with
20% better suction than the previous v8
model Dyson is so confident in its
performance that the company vows to
never again make a corded vacuum they
see Wireless as the future they're still
going to sell the corner vacuums but all
the cool new stuff is going to be
Wireless this model boasts a more energy
dense battery it has 60 minutes of
fade-free power fully charging the
battery will take three and a half hours
there is a little port on the bottom if
you want to have a wall plug and a cord
maybe don't wanna deal with cords they
do come with a wall mount and you'll
just slide it on in and have a charge
once the battery is fully charged it
will stop charging so won't kill your
battery to save battery life it uses a
trigger to turn on instead of a
traditional on/off switch now much of
this design is similar to past models
accessories snap on and off there is the
option for a larger trash bin it'll hold
40% more to empty your bin
you just pop it off and then just push
the red lever whoa there I got to work
on how smooth a hand with that
the v10 starts at around five hundred
dollars it comes with two cleaner heads
one especially designed for hardwood
floors Sir James Dyson introduced the
v10 himself at a New York event but it
was not the only new Dyson product
unveiled updated pure cool air purifying
fans can now detect more pollutants in
the air including gases like toxic paint
fumes the big feature of the new air
purifier is that there's an LCD screen
that tells you in real-time what it
detects when I spray the chalk it'll
detect it clean it and then let me know
when it's gone if you do not want air
blowing on you all the time the machine
can be set to purify the air without
acting like a fan the purifiers come in
two sizes the tower is priced at nearly
five hundred and fifty dollars the
shorter model is 100 bucks less
replacement filters come in a bundle for
about $80 between the vacuums and the
air purifiers DICE's big focus right now
is keeping her home nice and fresh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
