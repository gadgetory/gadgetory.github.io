and here entering the Google demo space
they just showed off the pixel three the
excel and all kinds of things you can
see they set up little rooms so I
believe there's a three Excel right on
the counter and it's got a case on it
already now it looks a lot like the
leaks guys so deal with that
it feels pretty light I will say I'm
pretty surprised by that you can see
that they've come with a black wallpaper
so you don't really notice that it's got
the one camera on the back like we
expected and then there's the pixel
three which also feels surprisingly
light this does not feel hefty at all
kinda reminds me the original pixel in
design and you can see that the corners
are squared off this is the pixel this
is an older pixel isn't it but this is
not it's just definitely the excel so
they fooled me because this is an older
pixel here and here we can see the
Google home hub which Google just showed
off today keeps you a nice visual
interface it's very similar to the
Novo's smart display redesigned version
of the home hub I'm gonna keep wandering
around because there's many many worries
oh look it opens up a lot so let's
wander let's see if we find a proper
three because what we saw with the three
excel but not the fridge it appears that
this is the pixel slate correct yeah
this is fixer slates a twelve point
three inch screen what kind of display
is this
display it's gonna have 293 PPI it's a
molecular displacement is that a variant
of LCD or or branded terms can you tell
me what the unbraided term would be I
mean I wanna grab these guys so I'll ask
around about that momentarily but I see
you can expand the desktop to 4k
monitors and can you tell me if there's
just one USB first two USB seaports
that's pretty awesome and you can have a
fingerprint scanner up there so this was
not once a surprise because we've seen
this leak before but it looks really
great there's compared with other
keyboards obviously it's got a stand but
they keep wandering around thank you
very much
they're still on the go you can see the
back of the Google home device you've
got four colors it's got this fabric
here it's pretty light 7 inch display I
will say when we saw it downstairs and
looked a little bit like look like a
little washed out it looks pretty good
in this bright one it's deeply
integrated into nest devices as well so
if somebody rings your doorbell you have
a nest cam it'll show up on the Google
home hub let's keep wandering to find
there's so many people here you can see
I will say the energy right now is a lot
higher now than it was when we came in I
think the software features they showed
off really impressed people because
while the hardware might look ho-hum
it's really the software that drives
your experience let's see if we can go
find a pixel some more if you find them
there's a DJ booth for some reason
all right let's keep warm there's so
much to see in this demo area I see a
lot of people clustered around there
that's probably
we will find the XL and the three at
night will be reported in the cinemas
hand right there is the pixel 3 not the
Excel model and you can see it borrows
its styling a lot from the pixel to
excel no not on this I don't know what
kind of screen technology it is but it
does cost 799 what if I can find
somebody to tell me
kinda would you be able to tell me what
kind of screen technology is in the
pixel 3 pixel 3 itself brand ambassadors
okay okay I'm gonna go find him thank
you as I bump into people everybody it's
panic a out of here
let's see if I can borrow this gentleman
hi would you be able to tell me what
kind of screen technology is up in the
pixel three and three itself yeah sure
so both pixel three they're both can you
can you tell me if they came from LG or
a different vendor his last year's OLED
screens with pixel to excel had some
issues in the press can you tell me
about that what's great about both pixel
three pixel three Excel is we've
designed and developed it from the
inside out at Google okay we're not
disclosing our specific vendors but
we've made several improvements to the
quality so you have a new adaptive color
mode which allows you to have a bright
vibrant rendition of the colors also
both displays are certified by the UHD
Alliance which allows you to have
awesome HDR so in case you couldn't hear
him they took this gentleman told me
Peter told us that these were designed
in-house they're not telling us about
the vendors who provided them but they
passed a certification as well UHG oh
are you making a lighter defies for HDR
playback I can show us wick demo
yeah why not we could get that mobile
just pull up an HDR video on YouTube
here
I mean this is gonna be strange for
getting it through a filter of my camera
so I can tell you from how it looks and
by my eyes looks great but you tilt the
disc light to see if the color shift at
all it does not appear to shift colors
I'm really excited to check this out
later at home let's see we've got to the
let's see the regular three now this
three starts at $7.99 and the XL starts
at 899
what do they top out I can hear the
speakers from here so that is just just
a simple and what we saw oh my gosh they
actually have something called pixel
Park guys if you want to Alphabet City
that's what we call our segments so
that's even weirder
there goes Scotts died oh my is actress
Tina calm and this has been your look at
the Google demo room thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
