with some new products this is the new
smartphone as the spark comes in some
other variants as well but this is the
this is the cool one Andy won't you run
us through the specs of the spark cool
what got is 5-inch display 720p
resolution 1.3 gigahertz quad-core
processor it runs cyanogen which is a
vision of Android a lot more
personalizable and we've got an 8
megapixel camera at front and back you
may have noticed luke yeah I have
noticed in particular these aren't the
highest end specs available on a phone
but of course this phone does come with
a much much lower price than many phones
around there this is going to be only
about 90 pounds in the UK that's er that
is really cheap very free yeah the other
variants that you mentioned was the
spark Plus which has got a little bit
more storage and the spark X which has
got a slightly bigger screen and a
higher resolution camera and that's
gonna come the spark X it's gonna come
in at 130 pounds so quite a bit more
money but you do get some more specs
what do you think of the phone itself I
think it's okay I mean you're absolutely
right it's very mid-range it's not gonna
set the world on fire doesn't really
have any new features that it's bringing
to the table you won't get elsewhere but
it does have is the low price and that's
kind of in the story of smartphones the
last few years like just getting cheaper
and cheaper and more capable I'm sure my
first impressions are that it would be a
sort of straight down the line basic
capable smart really want to do is
better tweeting little bit instagramming
than this sort of thing is absolutely
fine if you spend most of your life and
what's that then perfect if you want to
play a lot of hardcore games if you
really want to get into taking some
glorious photos on your phone that's
when you need to start paying more money
for phones like the iPhone or the galaxy
s7 well much more on spark stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
