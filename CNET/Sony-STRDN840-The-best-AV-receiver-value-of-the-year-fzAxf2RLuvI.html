we're taking a look at the Sony STR DN
840 this is a 7.2 AV receiver with
built-in bluetooth airplay and Wi-Fi and
it's selling for just 420 dollars from
the outside it has a typical AV receiver
look it's a big black metal box so
you're going to need plenty of room in
your TV cabinet sony has done a decent
job at making the front panel look
stylish but it really can't compare to
Moran says slimline and our 1403 when it
comes to style the included remote isn't
bad although it has more buttons than it
should the white input buttons do stand
out well and there is a big volume
rocker at the bottom although it's easy
to get mixed up with the not so useful
sound field selector that's right next
to it on the back the sony has 6 HDMI
inputs which is as many as you're going
to get at this price level there are
also a fair amount of legacy connections
including three total digital audio
inputs but component video is nowhere to
be found
one thing to note is that although the
sony is a 7 channel AV receiver it
doesn't support true seconds own audio
capability so if you have a to room
setup it may not be the best choice the
real standout is all of Sony's wireless
capabilities Wi-Fi is built-in which
makes it easy to get on your home
network for firmware updates smart phone
control and the ability to stream from
its integrated streaming services which
include Pandora Slacker and internet
radio even better both bluetooth and air
player built-in so it's simple to
wirelessly stream audio from any app on
your smart phone or tablet
Sony's made it so convenient that you
can even set the receiver to
automatically turn on and switch to the
right input any time you selected via
airplay or bluetooth it's really a
killer feature and no other receiver has
this much wireless tech for under $500
so if your music collection revolves
around your mobile devices this is a
pretty great pick we also had Resident
audiophile Steve Guttenberg give it a
listen and he was mostly impressed
action movies had all the appropriate
punch and to channel music was detailed
and lush it didn't sound quite as good
as the marantz and our 1403 and
head-to-head test but they're close and
honestly they both sound pretty good
all together the STR DN 840 just has an
unbeatable set of features for the price
especially if you want to stream from
your mobile devices which is why it
earns CNET Editors Choice Award this is
the best value I've seen this year so if
you're looking for an AV receiver start
your search with this one I'm Matthew
Muscovy ak and this is the Sony STR DN
