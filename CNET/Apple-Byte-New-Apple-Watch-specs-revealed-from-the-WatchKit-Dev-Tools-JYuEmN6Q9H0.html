the Apple by for everything good and bad
inside the world of Apple and our
winners for the canoe stance giveaway
but first let's jump into the show and
apples released the latest iOS 8.2 beta
to developers including the watchkit
development tools that will enable them
to start trading apps and software for
the Apple watch that we expect to see in
spring 2015 now new information from the
watchkit SDK reveals the two different
screen resolutions for the two Apple
watches the smaller thirty eight
millimeter Apple watch has a resolution
of 272 by 340 while the larger 42
millimeter watch has a resolution of 3
12 x 3 90 Apple refers to the watch
display as retina and instructs
developers to use image assets at twice
the resolution now in the notes apple
says the Apple watch aims to blur the
boundaries between physical object and
software through the digital crown
navigation to the taptic engine for soda
alerts and force touch a new touch
control system thoughtful design should
contribute to this experience of
hardware and software feeling
indistinguishable man I have no idea who
could have written that up like really I
can't put my finger on it alright one
other note currently after watched
third-party apps require a connected
phone to allow them to function and
developers will need to be mindful of
that we're fully native apps that will
be able to run on their own on the apple
watch will come later in 2015 so
logically an Apple watch that requires
no iPhone whatsoever comes in 2016 the
smartest time to buy one alright display
may recently published their latest
results of their display color accuracy
shootout to find the best mobile
displays amongst phones and tablets now
even though the ipad air 2 finished near
the top in a couple of categories the
iphone 6 plus and the air too finished
fifth and sixth place overall and
display color accuracy with the galaxy
note for taking the top honors and
surface pro 3 coming in second Amazons
fire HDX 8.9 inch also performed better
in these tests so if you're super
defensive about your iPhone you can tell
people in the YouTube comments below
that display color accuracy doesn't mean
everything alright in tech down the road
that will make your phones only better
sony which supplies apple with their
camera components debut their new 21
megapixel image sensor with an ultra
fast autofocus that also takes 4k HDR
video you can even see a comparison of
image quality here from the previous
sensor the new sensor is called the
Exmor RS IM x230 its stack design cuts
down on size which might help remove
that camera nipple on your iphone 6 and
6 plus but i know some people like
nipples and it has 192 autofocus points
which can track faster moving subjects
instantaneously so my prediction get
ready for this is that a future iphone
will have a 21 megapixel camera uh-huh
you heard it here first on the apple
bike alright Apple announced last week
to its accessory partners in their made
for iphone and ipad programs that new
lightning connectors and specs will be
available for them to build new
accessories that includes apple's
proprietary connection previously
reserved for its own iOS devices
accessories that still only have a USB
port to charge them can now use a
lightning port in the future or using a
lightning cable as a headphone cable is
another option that could be implemented
by accessory companies in future designs
alright everybody now this next story
could get a little salty but a UK market
research firm called yougov collected
all their research data from a sample
size of around 10,000 people to create
general profiles for a typical Samsung
fan and a typical apple fan in the UK
and their findings well a typical
Samsung fan is a 40 to 59 year old male
describes himself as polite but is on
occasion disinterested gucci is this top
clothing brand and he drives a Vauxhall
now compare that to a typical apple fan
that is female 25 to 39 years old
describes herself as clever but on
occasion is
troll freaky Hollister company is her
top clothing brand and she drives a BMW
yeah I'd say that's pretty accurate but
if you sift through the data there is
one thing and one thing only that both
sides agree on the pet that both Apple
and Samsung fans are most likely to have
is a fish who do all right let's
announce our winners of the canoe stance
