can ease the pain or if that doesn't
work just get a robot cat I'm Bridget
Carey this is your cnet update
relationship breakups can be crushing
and all the photos and connections on
social media just make getting over your
romance so much more awkward but
Facebook is stepping in to help you get
over your ex if you change your
relationship status to indicate that
you're single again you'll get a prompt
to see less of your ex on your timeline
or not even see him or her at all
anywhere on Facebook it's like a block
without having to actually block them
you can also hide your posts from being
seen by your ex or you kid and you want
your ex to know how much fun you're
having without them right after you sort
through the social media drama the next
step in getting over a breakup is to
stream copious amounts of Adele's music
to wrap yourself in a warm blanket of
feels to cry it out her new album 25
went on sale friday but she's not
releasing it on subscription streaming
music services like apple music and
spotify you can still buy digital copies
of songs but this may actually be a big
album for CD sales billboard reports
that her album could have the most new
release CD shift in the past decade with
3.6 million physical copies in the US
the last album to do better than that on
CD shipments was n sync's no strings
attached 15 years ago now as you say bye
bye bye to that X you're going to also
want to hit the gym to pump up that
self-esteem google is rolling out an
update to the Google fit app on Android
to display real-time info on your walks
runs and bike rides with your smartphone
by your side you can also track strength
training like sit-ups push-ups and
squats and after you land a new lover
with that hot bod you built up you can
turn your story of getting over your ex
into an award-winning screenplay with
Amazon's new free script writing app
it's called story writer it submits
you're finished script directly to
Amazon Studios because Amazon is looking
for some good movie ideas for its
streaming service and if that doesn't
work accept the fact that you're going
to live alone forever and
one of has Rose newest robotic cats the
joy for all companion pet is made to
bring companionship to seniors for
ninety-nine dollars it responds to pets
and hugs with cats sounds and movements
it's simply perfect that's it for this
tech news update and there's more at
cnet com from our studios in New York
I'm Bridget Carey
