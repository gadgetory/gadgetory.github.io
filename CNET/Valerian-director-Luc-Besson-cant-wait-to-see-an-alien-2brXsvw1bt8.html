with the technology you can really
basically do everything I can turn you
to an elephant in three seconds
we have thousands of drawings we have a
Bible of 600 pages with the entire world
every aliens one by one their lives what
they eat where they're living you know
where their specialty and then about
alpha station which is the main location
in the film which is a Space Station 12
kilometers of diameter and 8,000
different species of alien living in it
and we have all this information in the
Bible so when the actors are coming at
the beginning for the rear so they got
this material they can see the aliens
from from from from the side you can see
animatic they have the Bible so they
they feel pretty easily they feel
everything they they're not naked you
have to navigate to first the
storytelling that's the most important
what is the stories about and the
characters and then after you can put
the clothes on
you can see the film just for the fun
and the colors but the main theme is
really living together you know today in
our society as soon as you don't have
exactly the same color or the same
religion or even worse same age same
size the same sex
we always it's always like if we try to
find a reason not to not to be together
you know what's interesting in the film
is now we have to deal with 8,000
different kind of species and then
suddenly everybody say with brothers I
don't care if you black or yellow you're
my brother because these guys are alien
for sure they not from here and it's
funny to play with that because it's
show it shows in fact how tricky we
still be you know like we still like
thinking in a tricky way and I can't
wait the first alien will come on earth
because they will you know they will
take away all the the racism and
although all of this we will all feel
brothers for sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
