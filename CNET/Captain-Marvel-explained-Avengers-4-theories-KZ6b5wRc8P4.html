our deep dive so much last week that
we're doing it again and we're gonna
talk about Captain Marvel this week now
obviously we are all super excited to
see Marvel's first solo female superhero
movie but you know some of you guys
might not be keeping up on your comic
books or maybe you're not super familiar
with Carol Danvers outside of the Marvel
Cinematic Universe which means you don't
know a whole lot about her
Oh Entertainment Weekly released the
official images of her costume and some
other production stills so we're going
to talk about those today we're gonna
answer three questions who is Captain
Marvel
how might her movie play out and how
could she help in Avengers 4 so who is
Captain Marvel well as of right now in
the comic books Captain Marvel is played
by Carol Danvers Carol Danvers is a
badass Air Force pilot so brie Larson is
gonna be playing this character I can't
wait to see it
that's not the original character though
the genesis of Captain Marvel is Marvel
who is a character introduced in the
late 1960s and then went through some
other iterations before culminating in
the death of Captain Marvel in the early
1980s between then and now three other
Marvel characters have taken up the
mantle of Captain Marvel and Carol
Danvers became the fourth and that all
went down in the 2012 Captain Marvel
Earth's Mightiest hero written by Kelly
sue Taconic which is a really good read
highly recommended fun fact by the way
you might be thinking to yourself how DC
how to Captain Marvel yes they have in
the 1940s in fact but now today he is
better known as Shazam it's a really
really delightful little tidbit of comic
book history that you could totally look
up okay so we've talked about Captain
Marvel we know what she is we know who
she is
let's talk about those 10 different set
images and what we can infer from them
first of all let's discuss the suit it
looks amazing
approved rubber-stamped yes please thank
you it's a it's a delight I love it so
much okay let's get into Jude Law's
character they're actually keeping his
character quite a bit under wraps but he
has said he is a devout member of an
elite Kree military group so this is
star force that they're in and I'm
guessing Jude Law's character is going
to have
something to do with influencing Ronan
the accuser
because he's not exiled yet in this
movie my bet is by the end of Captain
Marvel Lee paces Ronan is going to be
very similar to the villain we know and
love from guardians of the galaxy vol 1
in another set image from Entertainment
Weekly we see Carole inside a Kree
military outfit now this suggests she
will be fighting for the Kree at some
point in the movie but if I have
anything to go by meaning this slide
right here the suit she probably isn't
going to be fighting for them the entire
movie on top of that we also got a look
at the scrolls which is a shape-shifting
alien race that is at war with the Kree
hence why Carol is in their military eye
but it also looks like the scrolls have
been doing some sneaky things down on
earth potentially masquerading as humans
hmm it's very interesting there on top
of that this movie is a prequel it's set
in the 90s which means comebacks galore
a slew of MCU faves will be returning
Ronan obviously which we've talked about
and Korra from the first guardians of
the galaxy shield agents Maria Hill Phil
Coulson and that's right everybody a
two-eyed Nick Fury he doesn't even have
an eyepatch yet and it looks like they
are de-aging samuel l.jackson and he
looks good science is awesome okay so
that is what we can infer from these set
images what does this all mean for
Avengers 4 well couple things number one
Captain Marvel is known even in this
image way back in the 60s Captain Marvel
is known for having negeb and so these
are really powerful gauntlets that allow
Captain Marvel to tap into the negative
realm when the MCU started Fox owned the
rights to the negative realm though
which leaves tapping the quantum realm
as an alternative power where have we
heard the quantum realm before that's
right everybody ant-man and the wasp my
guess is that some of the plot of the
movie is going to revolve around Carol
getting her hands on those Nega bands I
don't quite see them right in here so
I'm not sure if she already has them or
if she's gonna have to get them from
somewhere but I have a feeling they're
gonna be a
really important part of the vendors for
now the most important question who the
hell do we call cap now is it her or is
it this guy
well sorry Steve Rogers Carol Danvers
outranks you thanks so much for watching
we are dying to hear your Captain Marvel
and Avengers for theories drop those
right down in the comments and of course
you can always watch last week's episode
right over here thanks for watching
