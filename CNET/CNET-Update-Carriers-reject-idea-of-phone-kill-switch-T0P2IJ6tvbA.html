smartphone theft I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update smartphone
theft is becoming an increasing problem
and to stop it some lawmakers are
pushing for cell phones to have a kill
switch so if your phone is stolen it's
turned into a useless paperweight and
criminals would be discouraged from
stealing it but the mobile carriers are
rejecting the idea Samsung tried to
incorporate this technology in its
phones but the major US carriers would
approve of Samsung's anti-theft software
well why is that because the carriers
could lose money right now there is lots
of profit to be made from customers that
pay for those monthly insurance plans or
from those that need to buy a new phone
because of theft the lobbying group for
the wireless industry the ctia published
papers saying that it doesn't support
the idea of a kill switch because of the
risks that come with permanently
disabling a phone as it stands now the
carrier's can stop stolen phones from
being used for calls or texts on a
cellular network but the phone would
still work over Wi-Fi and it can't be
used in other countries so it's up to
you to be prepared to know what measures
you can take if your phone is stolen
android windows and iOS all have
different tools for tracking down
locking and wiping data remotely and you
can check out the update blog for a link
with more details on how each system
works more advanced apps are being made
for the google glass headpiece google is
giving developers new tools to build
more complicated apps and it's revealing
some potential cool uses for glass a new
word lens app translates text into a
different language strava is a tool for
tracking the distance of bike rides or
runs so you don't take your phone out
during a workout golfers can use glass
to get facts about the course and how
far they are from the green and users
can get cooking instructions through the
small screen with the app all the cooks

about moga's new iphone game controller

own now it's the powershell controller
