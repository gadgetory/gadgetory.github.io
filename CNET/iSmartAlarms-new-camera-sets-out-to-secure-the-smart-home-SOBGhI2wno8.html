smart alarm my camera keep and this is
the second-generation camera for the
fee-free smart security system we first
reviewed eye smart alarm back in 2013
and at that time the camera that came
with the kit as an optional accessory
was a bit of a letdown it was glitchy it
was tough to get started with the setup
wasn't that easy this camera now things
are a lot better you've got a much
easier setup process you'll just plug it
into your phone and let it register it
takes less than a minute to register
with your Wi-Fi network and hop onto the
app there I tested that out in multiple
locations and on a couple of different
Wi-Fi networks and every time it was a
piece of cake so very satisfied with the
setup process
additionally monitoring the video feed
in the app was very smooth even on LTE
off the Wi-Fi network I could look at my
video feed in a smooth seamless fashion
didn't have much lag didn't have any
difficulty panning and tilting the
camera which you can do by swiping over
the video feed in the app the camera
features a resolution of 720p it also
has built-in night vision for seeing in
the dark and built-in motion and sound
sensors that you can set to alert you if
the camera sees or hear something the
live video feed was smooth and seamless
the motion and sound alerts came through
whenever I wanted them to all so nice is
that you can use this camera as a
standalone device you don't need an
existing eye smart alarm system in order
to set it up you can just buy the camera
on its own and have it running through
the app without a cube one base station
and the other eye smart alarm sensors
you can also integrate it with those
though and use the motion and sound
sensor to trigger the alarm
now that level of performance and
functionality is very good considering
the price of this device at 150 dollars
it's cheaper than Dropcam cheaper than
piper in canary the thing that you're
missing though by paying less is that
this camera does not yet have the
ability to save video clips so whenever
it detects sound or motion it will
automatically start recording you can
open the app up and view the live feed
and see what's happening and you can
snap a screenshot of what's happening
but you can't tell it to record even
manually iSmart alarms planning on
debuting a huge overhaul of the app
version 2.0 in February and that will
include options for cloud storage and
also local storage by plugging a USB
Drive into the back of the device also
down the line I smart alarm is planning
compatibility with thread with home kit
with nest and even
channel so a lot of new stuff coming in
2015 for this system we'll be paying
attention and letting you know how it
works in the near future be sure and
check out my full written review of the
I camera keep I'll be sure and update
that in February once we know how that
video storage functionality works and
also check out the rest of our smart
home reviews at cnet.com for CNET
