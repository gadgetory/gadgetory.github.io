store may know exactly how I feel about
a product just by the expressions I make
while shopping love it or hate it this
technology is a possibility in the
retail store of tomorrow Google
showcased its facial detection software
at the largest convention for the retail
industry it's the NRF Big Show in New
York City here retailers scan the show
floor to learn how technology can be
used to win over more customers and when
an edge over Amazon Google which has
mastered the art of tracking you in the
online space offered ways to track data
on you in the physical store space
detecting emotions with hidden cameras
may be a far-fetched way of finding out
if you really like those new pair jeans
but there are plenty of ways to also
track the flow of customers in a store
and how long they stay in a certain area
of course it takes more than data to get
a customer to step foot inside a store
in an age of instant gratification and
online one-hour delivery retailers are
looking into instant customization how
about just order your own sweater in a
store get a coffee 45 minutes later BAM
you have your own custom sweater princes
and a designer sweater from eileen
fisher no less until display the shima
seiki it knits out a seamless custom
sweater tailored to your fit no wasted
inventory and customers get exactly what
they want in under an hour you can find
the shoe with the perfect fit with a ten
second scan of your feet the True Fit
scanner which also partnered with Intel
measures the shape of your feet and also
the circumference of your calves that's
handy when hunting for tall boots well
why would you need your foot scan in a
store when you could just try on the
shoes in person the idea is that now the
store can recommend which shoes will
best fit your feet and they have data on
you as a customer for recommendations in
the future what about finding the
perfect fit when you're shopping online
augmented reality can provide some
confidence Google's project tango
technology is incorporated into phone
apps like this one from wayfair to show
you what a piece of furniture will look
like in your room or a fiddle
fit in your space it requires a
smartphone with a special depth sensing
camera and only Lenovo makes one now so
you may be sitting around a while before
you can use it on your favorite
smartphone or seen it I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
