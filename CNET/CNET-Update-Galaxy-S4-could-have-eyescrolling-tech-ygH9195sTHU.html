Carey and this is your cnet update the
samsung galaxy s4 could have I tracking
software so you can scroll through the
screen using your eyeballs it's the
latest report on the highly anticipated
smartphone and it seems like a legit
rumor the New York Times reports it
spoke to a Samsung employee who try the
phone and when a user's eyes reach the
bottom of the page the software will
continue to scroll down so you can keep
reading Samsung does have a patent on
something called I scroll and I pause
but we won't know if it's a feature
until March 14th when the phone is
officially unveiled at CES this past
January I got to try something similar a
startup called the eye tribe was showing
how easy and cheap it was to install I
tracking software into a tablet or
smartphone and don't forget the galaxy
s3 already has a program called smart
stay that scans your pupils with the
front-facing camera to see if you're
still looking at the screen and if you
are the screen doesn't dim another
report out today is that YouTube could
be working on creating its own music
streaming service this news comes from
fortune and apparently the service would
offer free music streaming with ads as
well as an ad free subscription option
people are looking up music all the time
on youtube so there's a natural
connection there this would put YouTube
though up against services like Spotify
and Pandora say goodbye to the tweetdeck
apps twitter is shutting down tweetdeck
apps for Android and iPhone as well as
the desktop Adobe AIR program the apps
are being taken out of the app stores in
May and shortly after all the programs
will stop working altogether instead
Twitter rather have you used the
tweetdeck version made for web browsers
when you're at your computer and the
plane twitter app when you're on your
mobile device there's a company that's
taking a new approach to streaming
movies and TV shows it's called hit
bliss and the service will pay you to
watch commercials and you can spend that
money on renting movies and shows you
can't just walk away in with the ads
play you have to check in during an
advert
Heisman to prove you're still sitting
there but just watching six minutes
worth of commercials can earn you enough
to watch a movie right now the service
is in beta so you'll have to sign up to
try it out and today I like to introduce
a new segment it's called this is
happening on Twitter the toilet paper
brand Charmin has a social media team
that's tweeting about how often they go
to the bathroom and they're encouraging
others to do the same using the hashtag
tweet from the seat just making sure
you're aware this is happening that's
your tech news update you can find more
details on these stories at the blog
