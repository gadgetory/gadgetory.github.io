out in the wild and earlier this week
Scott Stein reviewed the devices which
now support water resistance improved
cameras and battery life but as everyone
expected over rumors for months no
headphone jack at all instead they
include an adapter and Bluetooth audio
support so you guys have both spent a
lot of time reviewing a variety of
headphones with without headphone jacks
when that announcement came out do you
think losing the port's a big deal
nowadays we have so many bluetooth audio
devices out there now I'll start yeah I
think it's a huge deal yeah I was really
upset by it i'm still wondering if there
are people that were shopping for the
headphone for the iphone that don't know
it doesn't have the headphone jack i'd
love to see that reaction even today but
yeah i think it's it's a huge deal even
though obviously apples not the first
company to release bluetooth earbuds I
just don't think that their version of
them are good enough to sort of warrant
that decision hmm I I actually disagree
i was a little bit concerned i thought
about it for a while i've written a
bunch of articles on it and in the end I
was like you know I don't think it's
that big a deal um partially because at
least there's someone I was more worried
they're going to charge thirty dollars
for the adapter at least they put it in
the box hopefully you don't lose it um
but and then you know I just think right
now the market is really swinging
towards wireless headphones anyway so
it's already over a fifty percent of
revenue or sales going to and that's
going to keep increasing and at least
now you know good wired headphone is
going to be a a wireless headphone a
bluetooth headphone but it's finally
bluetooth is finally getting to the
point where it actually sounds pretty
good Apple did that before when they
moved from 30 pin and lightning the
adapter for that was about i think
twenty to thirty dollars and this time
it's only nine dollars for that 3.55
into lightning but i was very much
expecting it to be
30 bucks and some of the competitors
which might get to a little later they
still charging thirty to forty dollars
and they I'd like multiple lightning
ports or an inline remote to the thing
hmm yeah i mean i think that apple's
trying to make it as seamless as
possible to move people away from it at
the same time i think the benefits of
not having it it's supposedly there's a
little bit better battery life there's
also the waterproofing obviously there's
phones out there that have a headphone
jack that are so waterproof so the idea
that you're you're getting something in
return you are getting that second
speaker i don't know how much of a
difference that makes butts gonna make a
little bit of difference but the idea of
selling that loss with another gain
they're trying their best to do that
mm-hmm yeah the thing that the accessor
that I love the most I think you wrote
about it this week David was by a
company called spigen I wish we had them
in the office right now but it's an
accessory that attaches to your to ear
paw ear pods and it's basically just a
landing lanyard to turn your bluetooth
earbuds into a wired earbud well it's an
Aristo they call that true wireless um
true wireless earphones what's the point
of that is that just for people that
want to dangle and negligent acts out
feelings yeah they're like well I think
people a lot of people are afraid that
they're gonna lose them if they don't
have to carry around that case all the
time is that what it is I mean how much
does that thing like 30 bucks or
something else No ten dollars Oh ten
dollars oh well it will be ten dollars
but the bridges those air pods are going
to be 160 170 dollars per 59-59 awesome
some 160 then the and maybe it just
gives that a little more security if you
in case you were to lose or dominant I
also think that isn't as big a problem
with the air pauses people think because
you just I've been using a lot of these
totally wireless earphones for last few
months and once you put it back in the
case you just put in your pocket and
they're stowed away just like having
headphones any case
what I will say is I think what people
are going to be shocked about is how
many people buy these air pods and then
use a single air pod as basically their
way of making calls like all those you
know they've sold literally millions of
LG tone neckband style headphones and
the idea what that is you can use them
as a stereo buds but at the same time
you'll see a lot of people just pull a
butt up to use as a single but to make
calls so I mean I think I think that's
what's going to surprise people how many
people end up you see them wearing one
of those things in their ears and you do
need to put it back into the case at
least every couple of hours to get that
full 24 hours yeah I mean I look I at
Kate's charge of the year buds to the
thing that I was really surprised about
what the air pause is that you can't
change the track by touching a part of
there's no button on the actual air box
a lot on that we're going to show a
bunch of examples of bluetooth earbuds
that came out prior to the air pots and
those all have some way or another to
either control the volume or change the
track of bone and I think that's going
to frustrate a lot of people when they
buy them to you spend 160 bucks you
still have to pull out your phone change
the track or turn the volume up I'm not
so sure about I mean I think it's more
you know I think apples focused on
making them dead easy to connect and
stay connected in a very reliable
connection those are the two things that
are problematic with these truly
wireless so that's where everything was
focused so when you pull one of these
these buds out it is connected to your
phone you're done and that is appeal it
going to be appealing to a lot of people
yeah especially if you have the entire
ecosystem to I mean it's not just your
phone if you have it connects by iCloud
right so if you have ipad or you have a
watch it'll connect to all those
automatically which is pretty convenient
too but you have to have all those
devices in order to buy it if anything
people are going to be possibly slightly
disappointed by the sound I think they
sound fine but because they're an open
design first of all they let some sound
in so if you're in a noisy environment
you'll have some sound leaking and also
you're not going to get a ton of base so
if you're a base lover I don't know if
the air polish going to be for you yeah
you're definitely trading convenience
for a sound lonely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
