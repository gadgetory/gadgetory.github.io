premium two-in-one formula and it really
shows in the yoga C 930 not to be
confused with the dual screen somewhat
experimental yoga book C 930 this is a
straightforward convertible laptop like
last year's yoga 920 that it replaces
the C 930 isn't drastically different
but a few design changes helped push it
ahead of that model the 920 s watch band
style 360 degree hinge is replaced with
a new hinge that's also a speaker sound
bar those speakers combined with two
downward firing speakers up front and
Dolby Atmos software for some of the
best audio you'll get from a laptop this
thin and because they're in the hinge
you get clear audio no matter what
position the screen is in the C 930 also
comes with an active pen that stores and
charges in a garage at the back edge of
the laptop just pop it out and start
writing or drawing on the screen it's
small but unless you're using it for
long periods of time it works well and
because of the garage it's always there
when you need it one last little extra
feature is a privacy shutter to block
the built-in webcam it's barely visible
but there's a little slider that with a
simple flick moves the shutter into
place the rest of the C 930 doesn't
stray from what made the 920 excellent
like it's comfortable backlit keyboard
and responsive precision touchpad a
windows hello fingerprint reader and
performance that's on target for its
class along with more than 12 hours of
battery life in our tests plus it has
the look and feel of a premium laptop
with a metal body and a screen with
almost no bezel so you get a bigger
screen in a smaller body if you need
things like more connection options or
discreet graphics or it's near $1,200
starting price pushes it beyond your
budget it's not for you but at the
moment if you're looking for a premium
ultra portable two-in-one uc9 30s about
as good as it gets
