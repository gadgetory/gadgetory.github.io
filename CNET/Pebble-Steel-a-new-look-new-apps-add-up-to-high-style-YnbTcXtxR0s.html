smartwatch emerged which a lot of people
were talking about the Pebble watch and
it was interesting because hey this is a
watch that ran apps and attempted to be
a little smarter and was the first of
its kind that was really defining a
landscape that's pretty well known as
wearable tech wearable tech is not
really something that you necessarily
want to buy into well now all of a
sudden babble has a new watch
the pebble steel here it is on this
wrist and it's available now now what
does this bring to the table you saw it
at CES and I've been using it for the
past few days and it's not a revolution
in wearable tech but it does two things
really well it redesigns the watch and
it also finally creates an app store and
a way to manage those apps that before
you'd have to hunt around for now does
that add up to something that's a
revolution on your wrist well it depends
on what you're looking for it's not
something futuristic in that next-gen
type feeling compared to what we saw
last year but if you're looking for a
watch that's smarter and a watch that's
better design the pebble steel is about
as good as it gets right now and it's
probably the first SmartWatch you'd
actually want to buy you are gonna pay
an extra hundred dollars for the steel
however if you like this design it's
pretty snazzy it's all metal well then
it's worth it but you know $150 does get
you the original pebble that's still out
there and both of them run the new app
and the new app store and run new sdk
2.0 created apps which were more
advanced that came before I'll get to
that in a second the design you know it
again it's all about style it's shaved
down there's a gorilla glass screen
which creates less glare on the watch
face and makes the the watch in the
numbers pop more in daylight you can
still wear the pebble steel in the
shower it's five atm water-resistant
just like the previous model it also
comes with the leather wristband in the
box now that's not water resistant you
can swap them out and pick which one you
want kind of justifies the price a
little bit more it comes in glossy metal
or it comes in this matte black design
and there are no other new real features
in this other than a little glowing LED
light so when you plug it in in charge
you now know when it's done charging and
that could be used for other apps and
notifications it still vibrates it's
got the same button layout three buttons
here one button here and it feels
smaller although the screen is exactly
the same size as before it's the body
that's different now what else is new
the apps the apps are all completely new
but that's available to you if you get
the steal or you get the original pebble
we've heard about these apps for a while
there are now partner apps like Yelp
ESPN some big name quantities Foursquare
are available now what they do well you
know don't get your hopes up too much
because what this is still is a black
and white display not a touchscreen and
there were three buttons over here they
handle all of your interactivity
Foursquare allows you to check-in
anywhere you want the Yelp app actually
allows you to browse restaurants that
are nearby
ESPN shows you sports scores but not
detailed stats yet so it's helpful and
it's fun but it almost feels more like
the idea of the Palm Pilot years ago if
you were to take Palm apps shrink them
down onto a watch and make them
connected with your data connection and
your phone in your pocket that's cool
but it's just not going to be something
that's going to go into the next gen and
allow you full touch of interactivity
right now there are some other fitness
apps and some games there are a bunch of
things already on the pre-release
version that I looked at of the pebble
app store and they were all free
although a lot of them invited you to
download a necessary partner app that
was available on the actual Apple App
Store that cost a couple of dollars so
some of them had some strings attached
but a lot of them the watch faces and
some of these other apps you do get all
right out of the box which is a nice
plus the other positive thing about the
pebble in 2014 as compared to last year
is that the experience on iOS and
Android feels very much the same a lot
of the apps work perfectly
interchangeably across both platforms
there are some apps that only work in
Android though that I found but a lot of
them work on both iOS and Android and
you can get now finally the same types
of notifications you can tie-in anything
from Twitter Facebook anything gets a
notifications on your phone pops up here
that was available before but now you've
got these apps that not only can mirror
what's on your phone but allow you to
interact a little more at the buttons
maybe to check in maybe to scroll or tap
through into certain elements that tie
in here but it doesn't get its own
internet connection obviously it still
pairs with your phone but the amount of
fun
that it supports this is probably one of
the best supportive watches out there if
you want a smart watch iOS Android and
the number of Android phones it supports
is a lot better than some of the more
restrictive ones that we've seen
certainly like the Samsung Galaxy gear
but even some other ones that needed
Bluetooth 4.0 to connect this is not
that you can connect with a variety of
other phones to the App Store also has
some nice features in it that allow you
to finally manage the apps on your
pebble you can pull them off and put
them on but there are only eight memory
slots in the pebble steel just like the
original pebble that means eight apps or
app or watch faces anything you put on
here only eight that's pretty limiting
you will find you'll run out of that
really fast you can easily swap them out
from your phone wherever you are at a
bus stop or wherever you might be so it
doesn't take a long time but put aside
your dreams of any sort of apps on here
that's gonna collect a lot of data over
time because you're gonna be deleting
and reinstalling those apps does it only
takes a few seconds but I would have
liked a little more storage on this one
how do I feel about the pebble steel I
like it a lot
I'd want to buy one it doesn't mean this
era that you'd want to buy one but this
is a watch that is smarter just like the
nest is a thermostat that's smarter and
maybe that's the best approach to take
in smartwatches versus something weird
and futuristic that flies off your wrist
pebble steel is probably the best
SmartWatch that I've seen I'm Scott
Stein and that's a look at the new
pebble steel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
