welcome to the apple bite it's all the
good and bad inside the world of apple
now iphone rumors and reports are at an
all-time high so let's just jump into it
and we start off with the best look up
to this point of what's believed to be
the first iphone 6 4.7 inch model
assembled together from a collection of
production parts according to russian
site felled and bolt now there's a
couple really nice-looking shots here
and it brings back memories of the
original iphone design from 2007 with a
rounded corners and pillow shaped volume
buttons and is expected to be
significantly thinner at seven
millimeters these are still unfinished
parts and based on your reactions from
last week's show some of you are really
upset about the rumor protruding camera
lens now a recently posted schematic by
Apple Club indicates that the camera
lens will only protrude out point seven
seven millimeters similar to the ipod
touch and not as pronounced as we saw in
last week's photo i don't know why
people are crying about this by the time
to slap a case on your phone you won't
even notice it and we won't hear a peep
from all those crybabies if it's a
significantly better camera now the new
iphone is expected to have a completely
revamped guts and a post from chinese
apple repair shop geek bar claims the
iphone 6 will be outfitted with a faster
LTE modem from qualcomm offering speeds
up to 100 50 megabits per second and
support for LTE advanced only a few
phones in the u.s. like the galaxy s5
have this next-gen category 6 LTE modem
and it has yet to roll out globally
another report from geek bar claims NFC
will be coming to the iphone this time
they showed off a wiring schematic where
an NFC chip from nxp the company would
fit onto the iphone 6s board so what
looks like the most realistic
possibility so far a lightning cable
that can go both ways now there's
multiple images including this one from
Sonny Dickson that have surfaced showing
apples potentially new lightning cable
with the reversible USB connector on the
other end making it easier to charge and
sync their devices no matter which way
you put it in Apple even filed their own
patent in January of 2014 but we may not
see this yet you
after all the leaked photos and videos
because a California company named
ultratech already holds a patent for the
reversible connector and they're selling
them right now also the iphone 6s screen
resolution is in question after many
targeted the 960 by 1704 resolution as
the sweet spot that would allow a smooth
transition for developers to the new
display but after looking at an up-close
picture of the iphone 6s potential
screen and a discovery by 9to5 mac
inside the latest Xcode 6 software
development kit a resolution of 8 28 x
1472 might also exists and it's possible
these could be the two resolutions for
the 4.7 inch and the larger 5.5 inch
screens both still falling under apples
retina requirements so after all these
reports the next iPhone might have a
faster LTE modem an NFC chip a
reversible lightning cable a slightly
protruding camera and two screen
resolutions September 9th can't come
soon enough so we can get the official
word and there's so much around the
iphone right now do you forget about the
iWatch well a new report from KGI
Securities analyst ming-chi kuo says
apple's iwatch lunch could be delayed in
2 2015 because of the difficulties and
challenges with manufacturing the
all-new device this is just his claim
everything still points to an October
announcement but if there's enough
momentum behind the new iPhones and the
new iPads Apple may not have to be in
such a Russian you know that are only
going to release it if it's ready to
roll also OS 10 Yosemite received its
6th developer preview release and it
also added a few new amazing wallpapers
that really make you feel like you're at
the National Park Wow there's also some
new icons for hard drives the font book
terminal and more the dashboard is now
translucent and a new feature they're
adding is the ability to do screen
sharing over I message accounts it
previously required an AOL IM gmail
jabber or yahoo account and you can
allow or block someone from seeing your
screen turn audio conversations on or
off and give them control of your screen
i will not let them do that
now to the quick bites the NFL now
channel has now been added to Apple TV
just in time for the start of the season
with instant in-game highlights live
events and press conferences but no fool
live games make sure to check it out so
you can watch all the various highlights
of my 49ers stomping all over your team
that's right also the creator of flappy
bird Dong Nguyen says he's bringing the
game back but before he does he has a
new game called swing copter that's
basically like flappy bird but you tap
horizontally but it also looks even
harder the game is supposed to drop this
week so we'll tell you if it's just as
frustrating as flappy and Apple execs
including tim cook Phil Schiller and yes
even dr. Dre took the ALS ice bucket
challenge in did a nice little slow-mo
and Dre even challenged mmm Kendrick
Lamar and Snoop Dogg to do it all to
raise awareness for the ALS Association
and to fund research to end the disease
commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease
now this movement is more than a viral
video that started as an idea from
former boston college baseball captain
Pete Freydis who has ALS so I'm thrown
out my challenge to you the Apple biters
to either donate or send in your own ice
bucket challenge and we'll get a few up
on here next week alright that's going
to do it for this week's show send me
your email to the apple bite at cnet com
or tweet me at brian Tong thanks so much
for watching we'll catch you all next
time for another bite of the Apple
alright ms shana mendiola I accept your
ALS ice bucket challenge in before we do
this I just want to mention this is more
than a viral video this started as a
campaign from Pete Freydis from Boston
called their baseball captain it's an
amazing story powerful story so this
goes out in honor of him as well as
everyone else suffering from Lou
Gehrig's disease so I want to before we
do this challenge three people the
founding fathers of Cena TV first
Bollywood Oh second Brian Cooley who
matt is cool third Tom Merritt oh all
