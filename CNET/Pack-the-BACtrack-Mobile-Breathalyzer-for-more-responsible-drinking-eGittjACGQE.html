right now we're taking a first look at
the BACtrack mobile breathalyzer okay I
know what you're thinking you're
probably asking why would I want to buy
a personal breathalyzer especially one
that talks to my smartphone I admit I
was skeptical at first as well and the
backtracks high one $49.99 sticker price
doesn't help what this gadget promises
to offer however is a law enforcement
caliber breath alcohol sensor squeezed
into a high-tech and compact package the
backtrack also connects to iOS devices
wirelessly over Bluetooth connection
through its companion iPhone app you can
view breathalyzer results in the
traditional value of blood alcohol
content percentage commonly referred to
as BAC the app also spells out BAC
readings in detailed explanations of how
specific values typically affect
behavior plus mental and physical acuity
another neat trick the backtrack does is
project the time it will take until
you'll likely be sober based on your
last reading you can store your readings
on your phone in the cloud or remain
completely anonymous by discarding
results after each measurement the
backtrack even lets you share readings
over social media sites such as Facebook
and Twitter if you don't find that
notion particularly disturbing how about
pushing your location BAC level and
timestamp data to other backtrack app
users well the backtrack does that to
the backtrack unit itself is lightweight
and small enough to fit in the palm of
your hand it comes with its own handy
protective case as well the device just
has one button for powering it up and
initiating pairing mode sexy blue LEDs
glow and flash to indicate power and
connection status once paired just tap
the screen to begin the measurement
process blow into the mouthpiece for a
few seconds then wait a few more for the
results to check BAC levels of friends
the backtrack comes equipped with
plastic tips so others won't feel
grossed out by your cooties as a New
York native and one who doesn't drive
often owning a product like this
probably isn't worth it if you're
addicted to your car or live
in more suburban or rural regions and
arns a teetotaler then the BACtrack is
worth a look it could help you avoid
over indulging and drink more
responsibly or at least wisely call a
cab if that's what needs to happen I'm
