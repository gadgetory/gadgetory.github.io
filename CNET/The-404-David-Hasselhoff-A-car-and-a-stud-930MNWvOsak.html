KITT let's write the car from Knight
Rider to celebrate 30 years of Nightmare
30th anniversary it's making us feel
real old yeah but Mattel has the Hot
Wheels 30th edition it's exclusively
available at comic-con 2012 40 bucks
they're selling it on the show floor
yeah this is an exact replica of the
original Pontiac trans-am that was
driven by so it's pretty amazing look at
I want you to see if you can get in here
look at all the buttons it's got buttons
galore in here they told us not to touch
any of the buttons because we'll
accidentally fire rockets or an oil
slick so we have to be very sure also
must wear protective eyewear we're here
with the legendary David Hasselhoff star
of Knight Rider we're at the Mattel
booth celebrating the 30th anniversary
of Knight Rider what's it like being a
part of such a timeless franchise it's
amazing you know everybody grew up with
it and I've got so many Knight Rider
stories from all over the world from
Zimbabwe to Pakistan to Thailand to
everyone coming up saying it was part of
their childhood and you know and and
it's kind of like anti reality so all
the kids now are discovering it they're
going wow this shows really good I'm
going you know we have bad reviews in
the beginning like who's about a car and
a stud you know and wouldn't last a year
well it lasted 92 hours and now 30 years
later you still see the people coming
out for me it's um it's kind of like I
got Knight Rider I'm still Knight Rider
but but you know what it's about one man
can make a difference and you can
and and you have to make a difference
like in sound corny but in your own life
to be happy so you know I'm happy and
and if I can do it and share it with the
world and this can bring happiness and
show kids that there's more to life than
than reality which really isn't real and
that they can come to the comic-con and
fantasize and dream and and get scared
and live their life oh my god how great
is that you know so it's cool do you
think
Knight Rider is a symbol of America like
your captain here the epitome of America
do you think there's all I know he's a
German superstar but do you think he
encompasses some sort of nationalism ha
the Hoff is a symbol of America he's a
symbol of freedom he's a timeless
symbols he is he's uh I honestly think
that he's he's brought it he's brought
the two of us together Germany and
America have you ever got to meet and
David house off before what was it like
was it like seeing him for the person he
answer all my questions he took the time
I actually got to spend like five six
minutes with them I felt kind of bad for
everybody online but you got to know him
a little bit yes would you ask him oh
well I just want another one fan I was
trying to start struck to be honest with
you I want to ask you obviously kit as
great as he is right now but are there
any technologies and you would like to
add now if you could go back and sort of
make a new one well I'm making a new one
right now I'm going to be 60 on Tuesday
and whatever we're building my car it
might kind of like the updated kit car
with the gold wings and you know and
it's connected only to to me and so the
only one that can drive this is
connected to me because of a certain DNA
and so if you were taking it to a warm a
technical level of that that the only
people that could drive kit are the ones
that are emotionally connected to it and
some in some scientific way right and
that that's what I'd like to do like to
do it in the film that you know it only
recognizes you if you have a heart or if
you're
if you're the white knight if you're the
right person so if a person gets in
there and it's got the wrong DNA the
Carwood doesn't work let's say one day
you have a child or something like that
and they ask to take the car out of the
box what do you say to that I no longer
have a child at that point Wow Wow
alright so we're here with Greg um you
look empty-handed I didn't see you sign
a poster you didn't you didn't get a Hot
Wheels car or anything what did you get
signed by the heart oh I got something
much better than a poster oh my gosh I'm
scared what very nice you must be the
first person ever to get your chest
assigned by The Hoff how did he respond
to that oh he looks pretty pleased about
it these kids who watched the show are
seeing it happen it brings it brings us
all kind of together because we were all
kids and when I was doing I was 28 I was
basically a kid and was just like wow
this is the future and we saw the future
you know and to see it actually come
true and then to be real just shows that
fantasy is really reality yeah there's
so much advancement to technology you
know in 30 years in automobile in just
the entire industry you're a part of
that and what does that mean to you well
you know the guy who designed the car
and his he he he everything he's put in
here has now come true yeah Japan just
realized that they said it in the year
2020 they're gonna have their own Knight
Rider car seemed to be driving itself so
we will be saying take me home kid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
