trend these days Microsoft has listened
to user feedback and with its Windows
8.1 Update is directly addressing some
of the missteps it took with Windows 8
first up the start button makes its
triumphant return left clicking on it
will switch between desktop and touch
interfaces but a right-click gives you
options you've probably been missing for
the past eight months another off
requested change was the ability to boot
directly to the desktop and now you can
simply right click on the taskbar select
properties choose the navigation tab and
under Start screen check go to the
desktop instead of start when I sign in
and after that everything will be all
old timey for you search was already
really powerful when those eight but now
gets a level increase search now
delivers results from your PC apps and
the web in one fell swoop popular
searches like known actors get a hero
page less popular search queries like me
get typical web stuff mostly completely
unrelated to anything I actually do know
that's not my Wikipedia page I don't
even have one settings get a complete
overhaul with Microsoft adding plenty of
options like power and sleep and display
options among plenty of others
previously these were only available
through the desktop but now make an
appearance in touch the built-in camera
app now does more than just crop a lot
more you can change the brightness and
contrast of a pic rotate the image and
my favorite is the new color enhancement
tool to select the color you want to
enhance by dropping the cursor on an
asset that shares the same color and
then enhance or D enhance to your
heart's content snap view is now more
flexible and can fit up to four apps on
screen at once if your screen has at
least a 2560 x 1440 resolution that is
otherwise you'll see a maximum of three
xbox music is a facelift and now you can
create radio stations based on the type
of music you like much like Pandora or
Spotify and a new interface makes it
easier to do things like make playlists
finally the windows story gets a
redesign with a cleaner and somewhat
more sophisticated
and instead of having to always update
your apps they'll be updated
automatically and only the system admin
for the computer you're using can change
that option app pages surf is more
pertinent information about the apps
like reviews ratings and app details
there are plenty of other changes but
those were kind of the big picture ones
that really stood out to me windows 8.1
will be available later this year as a
free update to Windows 8 checkout cnet
com for for the coverage i'm eric
franklin and this has been a first look
at Windows 8.1 preview</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
