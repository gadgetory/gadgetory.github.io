that can follow you down a mountain
without crashing in 2015 the Lilly drone
raised 34 million dollars on the
strength of this video which shows a guy
just throwing it up in the air and
having it follow him down a hill
snowboarding thing is it wasn't true
this video wasn't shot with Lilly drone
at all it turned out and the technology
wasn't capable of following you like
that three years ago a $2,500 drone that
can actually follow me around so let me
show you what that looks like with some
footage from the sky do r1 itself this
is one of the very first clips I shot
with the sky diao and it's a little bit
tame to start but this is still not
somewhere I generally fly a drone
there's a lot of trees overhead I'm on
the sidewalk where I'm not supposed to
be riding anyhow and of course I'm not
controlling the drone at all it's just
letting it follow me I don't have any
way to tell whether it's doing the right
thing until I watch the video afterwards
you might notice I'm giving you a nice
long clip here just to show you that
we're not cherry-picking the best
moments the sky do did all of this
itself and here we go underneath the
arch oh god I love this shot and you get
the cherry blossoms in the view and it's
following me around this apartment
complex even though I'm dodging through
the trees I'm under the cherry blossoms
have you ever seen a shot like this with
a drone before it's not something you
typically get it's not something you
typically trust your equipment to do
because it might crash into something
here was another early test I've got the
sky do following me a bit trying to see
how it's predictive tracking system
works it uses the cameras and a bit of
software processing to figure out where
you might go so even if you dodge around
behind a tree or something like that it
can
figure out where you're likely to be
next and follow you it's also got the
ability to climb up way up high if you
like you want to get a different
perspective it doesn't always have to be
right down behind you
this was a speed test I was trying to
sky do to see if it can catch up with me
if it could follow me I'm going full
speed on the road bike there's also a
lead mode which I really like since he's
got cameras front and back you can have
a fly around in front of you you can
wave up at the camera have it capture
all kinds of stunts that way you might
be wondering how this all works the sky
do has 13 cameras on the top every
corner and on the bottom two in each
place so that it can kind of stitch
together a map of the world around you a
three-dimensional map where it knows
where all the obstacles are it's a
technique called slam and it's similar
to something that self-driving cars use
right now
oh yes the foliage okay so I took this
to a park nearby my house so I could see
how it can handle dense foliage and did
pretty well I don't know if I like all
the blown highlights here it definitely
had some trouble with the bright Sun
coming down through the trees and still
trying to capture the dark regions
underneath but it's pretty great and
this is somewhere I would never ever fly
a drone normally you trust a drone to
come back to you to try up in the sky oh
yes that's right
sky dia warns that it can't always dodge
little tiny thin branches like that and
I'll show you a bit more that later I
don't know if I really like this shot I
like the blue skies but it's a little
bit dim and gloomy on the ground I do
like that it's got this program where I
can orbit around me and kind of get you
that 360 without even trying so it's
pretty good at not hitting people which
I like but it does still startle them I
got a lot of weird looks with this drone
walking around the street taking it
places that you wouldn't normally take
drones and a couple people gave me the
evil eye and then I've also got an issue
here this is where I discovered this the
first time I discovered that the drone
can't always follow you through all
kinds of narrow passageways at the Jeep
that couldn't follow me past the Jeep
was a little bit confused
and I think in a sec you're gonna see as
it rounds the corner it's not gonna
follow me here either
it just doesn't know what to do the
cameras they look left they look right
they're like there's not enough space to
get through here and it doesn't follow
me so you have to come back and get it
so there'll be these times where I
couldn't quite trust it to follow me
through all the things I was doing if
you got a space that's wide open you can
just you don't even have to look at it
you can trust it to do its thing most of
the time but if if there's an obstacle
if there's anywhere where it's like it's
not sure what to do you might look
behind you and realize it's gone this is
where I really put the sky dia through
its paces I found a mountain biker on
the mount up on that tall mountain
mountain Uma home I think it's called up
in San Jose and I said go for it let's
see if we can follow the sky do in this
mountain path with all the shrubbery and
honestly it did a pretty damn good job
it has a little trouble if you go too
fast up the more obstacles in the way
the more chance it's gonna get confused
and not be able to follow you after
you're going really quickly and this is
out okay so watch this this is where I
really got a little bit concerned I
realized that it wasn't quite what I
wanted in a drone yet this isn't this is
the biggest limitation of the of the
tracking system so far if it does lose
you it might go around and try to find
you again and then hit something if
you're in an area with those thin
branches again it didn't see those thin
branches hit the obstacle and that was
the end of oh yeah this is a definitely
borderline for what the tracking system
can do it was starting to lose track of
me there it was a little bit shaky as I
made that transition from dark to light
this time I was able to make it cuz it
still had a good glimpse of me the
entire time but going through was able
to follow me through the tunnel the sky
do still got a lot of limitations for a
$2,500 drone it's not something you can
just fit into your back pocket throw up
in the air and forget about and it's not
exactly a filmmakers
either since it doesn't have dedicated
manual controls but it is the beginning
of the realization of that dream that
the lily drone made us believe in and I
wouldn't be surprised if four or five
years from now every child has these
features every drone could theoretically
follow you around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
