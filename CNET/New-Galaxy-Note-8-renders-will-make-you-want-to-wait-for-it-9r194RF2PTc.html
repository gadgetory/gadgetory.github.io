Google issues for all the Google you
could think of we've talked about the
Galaxy s8 enough already
like we really have but it's also the
Android phone then everyone still cares
about the most right now but what about
the upcoming Note 8 Samsung has
confirmed in a recent press release that
a high-end smartphone is planned for the
second half of the year and really that
can only mean one thing the Galaxy Note
8 and yes it's normally expected around
the august/september time frame but
could this be the phone that addresses
some of the issues with the s8 and s8
Plus take a look at this Note 8 render
from concept trader that's based on all
the leaks we've heard up to this point
you'll obviously see the familiar design
philosophy to the s8 with its larger six
point eight inch infinity display a
breakdown of dual lens cameras that's
not on the s8 for wide-angle shots and a
stylus that fits inside the phone now
the assumption here is that Samsung will
even figure out the fingerprint sensor
and enough time so that it lives inside
the front of the display instead of
putting it right next to the camera lens
on the booty side of the galaxy s 8 and
s 8 plus again this is based on the
rumors but there are plenty of you that
know the note 8 could be the best
smartphone of 2017 whether or not you
use the stylus give me some of that now
jump into the comments and let us know
how many of you are actually just
waiting it out for this Note 2 8
all right Bixby is here for the galaxy s
8 NS 8 plus well at least if you're in
Korea anybody anybody watching this
right now from Korea on yong-ha say yo
huh well the Bixby voice assistant
promises to be integrated directly into
the OS but right now people are just
using the Google assistant and if they
get used to that because it's actually
good Bixby ends up losing more of its
relevance to galaxy users there still
isn't an official date when it's
expected to roll out to the US but
reports say Samsung is hoping for this
month now that's not the only software
Bugaboo some s8 and s8 Plus users are
reporting an issue where the phone just
randomly reboots
a thread in Samsung's forums is already
27 pages long where users report that
during normal usage or even sometimes
just sitting on standby
the phone will reboot out of nowhere and
this is also happening when the phone is
in use one fix being shared is to remove
the micro SD card because some users are
saying that the phone is asking them to
transfer files to the SD card before it
reboots it's a quick fix for now and it
sounds like a software issue that
hopefully gets resolved soon and Google
i/o is just three weeks away on May 17th
to the 19th they've announced some
improvements this year including larger
venues for sessions reserved seating for
attendees and there will be 150 sessions
that will all be live streamed at the
Google i/o home page one change is that
there will be a developer keynote right
after the main keynote that ends at
11:30 a.m. so that devs can take
advantage of the new product
announcements now we can expect to see
in-depth reveals for the new flavor of
Android Oh aka maybe Oreo Google home
improvements Android wear and Google's
daydream the Google pixel held its own
standalone event after i/o last year and
that will most likely be the same this
time around
alright that's going to do it for this
week you can email me at Google issues
at cnet.com or tweet me at Brian's hung
thanks so much for watching and we'll
catch you next time for some more of
that Google ishes come saw humming dah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
