thousand eleven I'm Bridget Carey on
cnet com and it's time to get loaded we
start today's show with a security
warning to iPhone 4s users there's a
default setting you might want to change
the voice assistant Siri will send a
message or open a calendar without
requiring a password to unlock the phone
on one hand it can be time-saving if you
need to send a quick message but it also
means anyone could just walk up to your
phone and ask to see what's on your
calendar start sending emails or text
messages that's not too secure you can
turn this off by going into settings
under password lock and turning off the
option for Siri to be accessed without a
password brand pages are coming very
soon to the google plus social network
it's not going to be within a week but
it will be launched quote imminently
according to google's vice president of
engineering at the web two point O tech
conference in San Francisco there's been
an overwhelming interest in getting
business accounts on Google Plus also in
the works users eventually won't have to
use the real names check out this new
robot being developed at the University
of California inspired by the
indestructible cockroach researchers
created dash plus wings a nimble robot
that scampers about at about three miles
an hour and can climb in clients of 17
degrees the idea is that down the line
this fella can help get around and hard
to access places after a disaster like
searching through rubble after an
earthquake all windows phone 7 users
should be getting that mango update by
now microsoft announced in a blog post
that the mango operating system update
had a slow initial rollout but 7.5 is
now available for practically every user
worldwide when available users will get
a phone notification and can update by
connecting to a computer don't tell MC
Hammer he can't touch search because he
just did with a new startup called wired
do hammer had time on stage at the web
two point O tech conference to talk
about the search engine that he says
focuses on relationships between words
instead of the literal phrase so for
example you type in 90210 you won't get
the show you'll get info about schools
and local crime stats in real estate
it's in private beta test now so time
tell if it's legit door if he should
quit those are your headlines for today
