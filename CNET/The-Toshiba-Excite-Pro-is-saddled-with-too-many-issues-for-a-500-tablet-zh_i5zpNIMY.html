monster it has a 1.8 giga hertz Tegra 4
processor a 10-inch screen with a
resolution of 2560 by 1600 and 32
gigabytes of storage however specs is
one thing and how those specs actually
work together is something else the
excite pro starts at five hundred
dollars for 32 gigabytes of storage
there is no cheaper 16 gigabyte version
and for the price toshiba packs in a lot
of features a micro SD card slot micro
HDMI and a micro USB port however you
can't use the port to charge it it can
only handle file transfers the 1.3
megapixel front camera is easily one of
the graininess cameras I've ever seen on
a five-hundred-dollar tablet but the 8
megapixel back camera is actually really
good it takes sharp pics video and
handles colors pretty well and has an
LED flash the tablet weighs about the
same as other 10 inches about 1.3 pounds
or so the back is this textured plastic
that doesn't do much for the grip but
kind of gives it this rough-and-tumble
feel where you'd expect it to be able to
take some punishment it has Harman
Kardon speakers that are actually pretty
good but only if you have two Sheba's
audio enhancement feature turned on on
the other hand resolution plus which is
supposed to advance standard def videos
didn't seem to enhance them all that
much other than making the colors a bit
more saturated gaming performance is up
there with a new Nexus 7 games played
with smooth frame rates and text is
really sharp but the screen is fairly
dull the colors are washed out also when
navigating the interface opening and
closing apps there's a definite stuttery
sluggishness to the performance that's
disappointing given how smooth Tegra 4
performance was on the Nvidia shield the
excite pro has plenty of features a
sharp screen and really good gaming
performance the washed-out colors and
sluggish navigation could be forgiven if
the tablet didn't cost five hundred
dollars sure you're getting 30
2 gigabytes of storage but users
shouldn't have to pay that much for a
tablet with so many issues check out my
full review for more info at cnet com
