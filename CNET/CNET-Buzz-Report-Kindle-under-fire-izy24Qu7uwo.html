the buzzer report the show about the
tech news that everyone is talking about
this week it's no cell phones in cars
and this time we mean it ipads in
cockpits because why not and the
drunkest airplane flight of all time but
first it's the gadget of the week the
gadget of the week is the kindle fire
all over again the Kindle Fire is taking
a beating this week over usability
issues software bugs and lack of
parental controls that will let any
child or anyone really just come along
and buy whatever they want with all the
easy one click purchase capability and
don't forget the hardware there are tons
of complaints about the annoying power
button on the bottom of the thing too it
was even compared recently to the Edsel
which seriously the Edsel quick tip
actually if the power button on the
bottom is bothering you just turn it
upside down see the screen rotates
you're welcome now sit the hell down and
wait for your software update and then
take the 300 bucks you saved by not
buying an ipad go to hawaii sit on the
beach and read a good book on your
kindle fire with a mai tai see what I'm
saying and now for the news this week
the National Transportation Safety Board
recommended a complete national ban on
cell phone use by drivers in cars the
ban would cover all 50 states it would
include hands-free devices but you could
use bluetooth systems that are already
installed in cars and it would be
accompanied by a huge awareness campaign
that highlights the dangers of
distracted driving and while I do
believe that this is a complicated issue
with far-reaching ramifications and
there's no doubt in my mind that texting
while driving in particular is an
epidemic and dangerous problem i have to
admit my response to this idea can be
summed up in these two simple points1
you wish and two self-driving cars
meanwhile as we're trying to get drivers
to be less distracted the fa age
to prove the use of iPads in airplane
cockpits at all phases of flight during
takeoff and landing the whole way to and
from the places the whole thing each
pilots iPad will replace about 35 pounds
of paper and that will apparently save
more than a million dollars worth of
fuel every year american airlines will
start rolling out the iPads and cockpits
this week you however will still have to
turn off your regular old low-power
Kindle during takeoff and landing just
don't get me started scientists say they
are closing in on evidence of the
elusive Higgs boson particle sometimes
called the god particle researchers at
the european organization for nuclear
research say they are tantalizingly
close to discovering the particle and
they should be able to close the book on
this puzzle sometime next year if the
Higgs boson is found it could
theoretically help explain why other
particles have mass and it could lead to
all kinds of other discoveries like
super particles and dark matter really
blow open the field of physics in fact
and lead to flying cars and
teleportation what no flying cars and
teleportation seriously why are they
doing this then in other unlikely events
in the universe here's an update on the
AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile merger a federal judge
will allow 80 to temporarily withdraw
its petition to buy t-mobile and delay
an antitrust hearing that was scheduled
for februari ATT now has until January
12th to either present a new plan for
buying t-mobile somehow someway or
decide to cut bait because they ain't
fish in considering that the FCC
multiple states every other wireless
carrier in America and most consumers
oppose the deal I am leaning toward cut
bait but who knows safety new details
emerge this week about what happened
when two now former rim executives got
so drunk on an airplane that the flight
had to be diverted and they had to be
dragged off the plane in handcuffs well
it turns out these poor guys were drunk
before they even got on the plane they
were screaming at each other during the
flight one lay down on the floor and
kicked the ground they assaulted and
yelled at flight attendants and they
were so rabid with Ray
about their lot in life that when they
were put into plastic handcuffs they
actually chewed through their restraints
oh my god on the plus side though any
out of work telecom executives job
openings a trim and finally let's have a
look at what's clogging the tubes my
favorite animal video in recent times
and that's saying a lot is this lizard
deliberately playing a video game happy
holidays everyone oh and don't miss the
baby seal that sneaked into someone's
house and then cuddled up on their couch
because I mean you will feel better
about life and that's the buzz report
for this week everyone I'm Mollywood and
thank you for watching power button
bothering you turn it upside down the
scree upside down the screen rotates
turn it upside down just turn it upside
down the screen rotates you're welcome
I'll use the book that'll turn it upside
down oh well that's because I went
sideways yeah all right we'll just do it
try it that way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
