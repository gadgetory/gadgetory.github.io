the new iPhone 8 and the new iPhone 8
plus these are a new generation of
iPhone it comes in silver Space Gray and
a beautiful new gold finish iPhone 8 an
A+ is also microscopically sealed for
water and dust resistance and they have
a new retina HD display in each model
there's a 4.7 inch Retina display in
iPhone 8 and a 5.5 inch an iPhone 8 plus
along with the displays iPhone 8 and 8
plus have new stereo speakers as well
they're 25% louder than the speakers in
iphone 7 and they have a deeper bass
inside iPhone 8 mate plus is a brand new
chip and this is a breakthrough
performance in a mobile device we call
it a 11 Bionic 64 bit design 4.3 billion
transistors six core we're going to geek
out here for a bit because it is so
awesome it has two high-performance
course they're 25% faster than the high
performance course and the previous
industry-leading 810 chip is for high
efficiency course through up to 70%
faster than the ones in the a-10 chip
and the GPU is designed to accelerate 3d
apps and games especially those that use
our new metal 2 framework all this helps
to improve performance and helps us take
better pictures there's an all-new 12
megapixel sensor it's larger and faster
iPhone 8 plus has two new sensors in its
dual camera the wide-angle camera has an
F 1.8 aperture and optical image
stabilization the telephoto camera has F
2.8 aperture so as always we want to
show you the kind of photos you can take
last year we introduced portrait mode
iPhone 8 takes fantastic portrait modes
and people flip over taking these photos
and now with the iPhone 8 plus you're
gonna get sharper details more uses in
low-light and even a more natural bokeh
in the background of the photos using
the new dual cameras and a 11 Bionic
chip and the iPhone 8 plus the team has
come up with a new feature called
portrait lighting and then you see
machine learning it creates facial
landmarks and actually changes the
lighting of the contours over your face
now these aren't filters this is
real-time analysis of the light on your
subjects face in fact you can go in
later after shot a portrait mode photo
into the Photos app and change the
lighting effect to select which one you
want to use on your photograph iPhone 8
has the highest quality video capture
ever in a smartphone so let's say you're
shooting 4k 64 video you can look like
this it's beautifully optimized for
quality and for compression level and
this video was shot on an iPhone in 4k
it's amazing we custom tune each iPhone
for augmented reality the cameras are
actually individually calibrated in the
factory and that makes a huge difference
in the performance for AR there are new
gyroscopes new accelerometers and here's
sky guide from v star labs you can use
AR kit with this app to actually
superimpose the map on top of the sky as
you're looking at it around you what's
really cool is with AR kit the metal to
on the new iPhone we are able to
experience games in an entirely new way
these players are able to view the game
from any angle our content has to be
incredibly detailed with the power of
the new iPhone an unreal support for
metal - we are able to render the entire
level on screen and amazing 1.2 million
polygons while also allowing you to move
in close to really appreciate the high
visual fidelity and now with iPhone 8
with its glass back we're enabling the
freedom of wireless charging
what makes this possible is we're
building into iPhone 8 and 8 plus
wireless charging with Qi that she is
the leading openness wireless charging
standard and we hope to help Qi by
increasing adoption of it in creating
new use cases for it many restaurants
shops airports cars have started to
build in support for Qi wireless
charging and they'll work with iPhone a
many companies are offering cheap
chargers and those that are chief
certified should all work with iPhone a</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
