maybe we're not alone I'm Bridget Carey
this is your C net update NASA's Kepler
space telescope has confirmed the
existence of the first planet that's the
most earth-like we found it's orbiting
around a star that's similar to our Sun
Kepler found it by looking at the star
and noticed a planet passing in front of
it and it looks to be in a habitable
zone meaning it's at the right distance
from the star for liquid water to pool
on the surface the planet named
kepler-452b is basically Earth's older
bigger cousin it's 60% larger in
diameter to earth that means gravity is
twice as strong so perhaps if there were
people on there they'd be a little more
short and stocky pulled closer to the
ground a year there is 385 days so they
get an extra month than we do we don't
know what it looks like these are all
just artist renderings of what it could
be because it's 1,400 light-years away
let me put that in perspective with our
technology it could take 20,000 years to
travel one light year so yeah maybe
we'll get there in twenty eight million
years give or take a day and so we can
hitch an uber ride with warp drive to
get there we'll just have to speculate
which brings me to the next story
both uber and lyft are making headlines
as more people are turning to these apps
in major cities when they need a ride
lyft is a distant second place to Eber
in terms of size and users but it has a
new perk that could draw in more
customers ordering a car pick up from
lyft can earn you points to buy free
coffee at Starbucks and you can also tip
your driver with Starbucks points which
can be redeemed for food or drinks lyft
is a three-year old service now in 65
cities across the US and you may know
them as the cars with the pink mustaches
similar to how eber works anyone can
sign up to be a driver to earn some
extra cash and customers use the app to
request a nearby driver to give them a
ride the Starbucks partnership with lyft
is pretty noteworthy it's usually over
that gets all the attention and scores
the partnerships and speaking of uber it
just won a major battle against New York
City Mayor Bill DeBlasio and Lee
for now after uber unleashed a massive
marketing campaign attacking the mayor
the administration has made peace with
uber and is backing down from a proposal
to put a cap on the amount of uber cars
that will be allowed to operate in the
city the bill would also have limited
lips growth the point of the cap was to
study traffic congestion in the city
being caused by the surge of these cars
working for ride hailing apps there are
more obrah cars on the road in New York
City than yellow taxis which is more
than 14,000 now the mayor's office says
it will do more studies before taking up
the issue again and uber says it will
provide the mayor's office with data
about its operations that's it for this
tech news update there's more at
cnet.com from our studios in New York
