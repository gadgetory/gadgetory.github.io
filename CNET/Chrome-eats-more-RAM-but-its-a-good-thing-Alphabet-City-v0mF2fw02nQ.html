show will recover everything related to
alphabet Inc also known as Google's
parent company I'm your guide ayahs
actor today we're talking about
Samsung's folding phone and YouTube
things but our top story is about
Google's browser first stop the chrome
dome Google has enabled a feature called
site isolation for the vast majority of
desktop users of Chrome actually it's
been enabled for 99% of users on Windows
Mac Linux and Chrome OS what site
isolation it runs a separate browser
process for each Internet domain that
makes it more difficult for a malicious
site to steal data from other sites site
isolation also helps protect chrome from
meltdown and Specter remember that
nightmare those two can allow a bad guy
to read your computer's memory due to a
flaw in modern processors so why do you
care about site isolation this security
measure leads to higher overall memory
use that's right
chrome is eating even more ram than it
used to Google says it may be a 10 to 13
percent increase in RAM usage so the
good news is Chrome is more secure the
bad news is it's gobbling up ram to do
it wondering about that one percent who
don't have site isolation setup Google
says we're keeping a 1% hold back for
now to monitor and improve performance
Google says it's looking to extend a
site isolation to Chrome for Android as
well
next stop the often traveled Android
Avenue
a new report by the Bell says the
foldable galaxy X will be released next
year the report also says Samsung is
deciding whether to introduce the folder
as a standard product or a limited one
the Bell says that it's not just Samsung
prepping a folding phone but Apple and
Chinese companies are doing the same
thing Samsung has been quite public
about releasing a folding phone it even
created a promo video with one it's only
a matter of time before it gets released
next up X crossing two companies are
spinning out of X alphabets R&amp;amp;D unit
project loon and wing will now be
separate companies under alphabets
umbrella we talked a bit about Project
loon last time
it delivers Internet using balloons in
the stratosphere yes I realized that
sentence sounds ridiculous but that's
what loon does then there's wing wing is
a drone delivery system that uses
all-electric drones that fly up to 120
km/h at Heights up to 400 feet above the
ground
so why were these two projects ready to
graduate from X a spokesperson from X
told me that both wing and loon have
advanced to the point where the risk has
shifted from how do we do this to how do
we take this product to market X will
continue to work on other projects like
glass Enterprise Edition and Makani if
you're wondering about the Makani
project it uses kites to generate
electricity from the wind that's right
energy kites let's head on over to
YouTube Union
there was this thing on TV called the
world cup you might have heard of it
during a game between England and
Croatia Google streaming video service
YouTube TV took a dive for about an hour
Google sent an email to those who have
YouTube TV and said it will give them a
free week of service YouTube TV cost
about 40 bucks per month so this is like
a $10 value there's also a new tool
coming to YouTube meant to protect
content creators YouTube will scan for
foolery uploads of your content the tool
is called copyright match the tool
copyright match will scan other videos
on the site to see if your video was
reposted if YouTube finds a match it
will appear in a tab called matches then
you decide what happens next
last stop comment code this is the part
of the show where we shine a spotlight
on the best audience in the world you
guys
Nathaniel said why would you need
incognito mode on YouTube you can't even
watch porn on YouTube that's the most
useless feature ever
well Nathaniel I think the incognito
mode can be useful so not every video
you watch influences YouTube's
recommendations mr. Brightside said I'm
not a fantastic audience I respectfully
disagree mr. Brightside Raoul says I
think Google should revamp its Android
tablet OS instead of Chrome OS it will
be a game-changer thanks to everyone for
writing in if you've enjoyed your stay
