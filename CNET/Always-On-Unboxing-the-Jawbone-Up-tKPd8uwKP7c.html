is the jawbone up now I really wanted to
play with this last season but the first
model was pretty much a disaster it was
so bad that they stopped selling it
pulled it from shelves wouldn't talk
about it in public and then have finally
released a new version so let's check it
out this is very similar to the Nike
FuelBand in that it's meant to be worn
all the time on your wrist and it does
similar functions in terms of tracking
activity calculating your calories
things like that it is also
unfortunately super hard to get out of
the box I want to rip the box oh there's
tape right here aha oh the tape even has
a little arrow that says hey dummy pull
here whatever tape down second tape down
the arrows are kind of small I thought
ha well that was easy okay get to know
the up band I like their little get to
know thing because the up band is pretty
much as simple as it can get there's no
screen and there's only one button so
they're like hey there's a button right
here and an LED right here and you're
done all right let's get out of here oh
look a little tab that says open I like
this I need a lot of instruction
getting started is a two-step process
get the app activate your band the app
is I'm sorry to say only available for
iOS much like the Nike FuelBand so if
you do want an android solution it's
pretty much the Fitbit which
unfortunately doesn't sync wirelessly
with Android sorry Android guys get the
stick once again here's our little job
own charger and USB dongle I wish it
matched I'm just saying that's kind of
tacky what do I do now oh we're gonna
lift I love this packaging oh I am
delighted by the cleverness of this
packaging co-presented like fine jewelry
okay so it's pretty much just a little
one size fits all snap-on bracelet
actually it's not one size fits all I'm
sorry it comes in various sizes we
ordered the medium and green it also
comes in black and maybe some other
colors okay so let's see here let's
refer back to our where the things are
the mode button is literally just this
little guy at the end oh there's our LED
so apparently it just changes between
green and red depending on what it's
doing well there's some blue and some
flashing maybe that's sinking Oh some
red and green flashing I don't know what
any of that means maybe once I do the
specs will know
the jawbone up comes in three sizes
small medium large and a variety of
colors it has a pretty straightforward
interface as you saw it's equipped on
the inside with a motion sensor it has
the single push-button interface a
vibrating motor for notifications the
app is only available for iOS 5.1 or
greater but you can run it obviously on
an iphone and ipod touch or an iPad
battery life extremely great you can use
it for up to 10 days between charges
however you will probably have to plug
it in before that because you cannot
sync the jawbone up wirelessly at all it
has no Bluetooth or Wi-Fi you have to
plug it in to sync data and charge it
the up works as a pedometer that can
also calculate the number of calories
that you burn during a day based on your
age height and gender it also breaks
down your daily activity in terms of how
long you've been active your total time
active and of course your longest time I
don't like the Fitbit the jawbone up
band can also track your sleep and see
how long it takes you to fall asleep how
many times you woke up during the night
all based on your movement the ups app
allows you to log your meals and of
course all of your other activity and
this is kind of cool it has an idol
alert feature and it will vibrate if it
detects that you haven't moved after a
predetermined amount of time this is
great for somebody who might have RSI
and needs a little haptic feedback
reminder to get up and move around a
little bit the up is water resistant job
one says you can actually take a shower
while you're wearing it although they
don't recommend swimming with it it is a
little bit expensive 129 dot 99 cents
the new jawbone up is definitely an
improvement over the first model and
it's stylish and functional I have to
say though that for an extra twenty
dollars you can get yourself a fuel band
which has a screen does all the same
data and wirelessly syncs with the iOS
app that's a big bonus to me also I'm
sorry but would it have killed them to
make this the same color because look at
this that
is ugly if it just came down to the up
versus the Fitbit though i think i would
go fit fit this guy is much more
convenient not as noticeable you don't
have to replace your watch with this
kind of funky looking thing and it's a
little bit cheaper too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
