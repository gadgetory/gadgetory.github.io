versions of the car your dad used to
drive and they go like stink in 2016 -
new MSR on the way the m4 GTS and the
car we're here to look at the all-new m2
this is the fastest - series money can
buy and it looks like an angry - series
which is good because it's sort of what
it is now the previous quickest - you
can buy the m235i was absolutely
brilliant
love that thing - bit but the m2
promises to be more his what's new first
things first the look this is an
aggressive looking car big arches huge
air dams and some fantastic details have
taken the 2 Series from pretty it's a
pretty chuffing aggressive it'll come in
four colors blue black white and grey
and the only interior trim is black you
can only have the 19-inch alloy as you
see here - and the M standard quad
exhausts are all present and correct
under the bonnet is a puffed up version
of the m23 5 is 3 litre turbocharged
engine except in there is putting out
365 horsepower and 343 pound fit is top
speed is limited to 155 miles an hour
unless you take the right box on the
options list then you get somewhere
closer to 170 nought to 60 - takes 4.5
seconds with a manual or 4.3 with a dual
clutch auto the important thing to take
away here is that you can have this with
a stick shift you can change gears
yourself with a third pedal and
everything and you don't get that in an
Audi rs3
how's about the Eco stuff well in
various configurations it'll manage 35.8
mpg and emit just 185 grams per
kilometer of carbon dioxide which is not
bad you've got a Leckie diff to make
sure things stay the way they should be
there's also the brilliant M dynamic
mode which gives you a little bit of
slip so you can be something of a hero
but there still a safety net so you
don't spot your brand spanking new car
my favourite bit though is the smokey
burnout mode there's a button for
burnouts which is awesome and if you
spec a manual it'll blip the throttle on
the downshift so you don't have to the
m2 I think looks a bit toned down
compared to its predecessor the 1m coupe
a but it certainly looks angry enough to
make it stand out here's the thing could
this be this generations m3 look back at
the e30 it was small had a great turn of
pace looked awesome and like the m2
wasn't super common only a few hundred
m2 s will reach the UK each year it was
also gladly brilliant and got the
legions of people hooked on the m3 ethos
nowadays the m3 is a serious bit of kit
it's quite hardcore in some respects and
it's also quite big the m2 is smaller
cheaper and almost as quick is the kind
of car that people can get into and then
join the an eco system just that little
bit earlier anyway with the m2 and the
m4 GTS BMW centenary year is looking to
be a very noisy very smoky and very fun
one and before we go this is what the m2
sounds like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
