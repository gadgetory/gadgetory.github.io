all it takes is one finger I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your seat at update
the robotics company i robot is best
known as the creator of the Roomba
automated vacuum but there's another
side to iRobot that many don't know
about a military side i robot has more
than 6000 defense and security robots
deployed worldwide some of these robots
are being used in war zones for bomb
detection and disarming some are being
used in Japan to clean up the Fukushima
nuclear meltdown local police use them
to scope out dangerous situations each
robot required specialized training to
operate but now that's all changing
iRobot unveiled a new system that
controls all these models with a simple
touch screen app on an Android tablet
previously first responders would use
laptops and video game controllers to
operate these robots but now just put
your finger on a tablet screen to drive
the robot and move the limbs during a
demo I was able to pick up the controls
with practically no training and that's
the point any Joe or Jane can run a
robot rescue mission without having to
go through time-consuming training of
course irobot hopes that encourages more
first responders and local law
enforcement to buy a few for their teams
and this is just a baby step to the next
advancement not needing a driver i robot
is working on programming the robots to
recognize obstacles and then give it a
few more years and we'll have Robocop
and battle mechs let's switch gears to
the world of mobile AT&amp;amp;T will have to
pay the US government a fine of 105
million dollars to settle charges over
the practice of mobile cramming the
Federal Trade Commission went after
eighteen t for collecting hundreds of
millions of dollars from customers who
subscribe to services that give you
daily text messages with jokes
horoscopes or ringtones the problem is
those services cost ten dollars a month
but consumers may not have been aware of
the fees because the charges were not
always clear on the bill and 18
teen other carriers were taking a cut of
that money at least thirty five percent
the carriers have stopped charging for
those services but if you feel like
you've been charged unfairly you can go
to FTC gov to ask for a refund meanwhile
the app words with friends is back zynga
is rolling out a new version of the
scrabble like game now you can play by
yourself against a computer and you can
pick a nearby stranger to play against
and what's a four-letter word for junk
advertisements the head of snapchat said
ads will soon be coming to the popular
messaging app but the ads will not be
targeted so basically get ready for
snapchat spam that's your tech news
update for Moorhead cnet com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
