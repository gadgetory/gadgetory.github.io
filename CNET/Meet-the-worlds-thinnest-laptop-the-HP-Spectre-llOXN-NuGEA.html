to be the world's thinnest having played
with it I'm inclined to agree the HP
Spectre is ten point four millimeters
thick I went back and looked at MacBook
Air 17 millimeters thick even the 12
inch MacBook is 13 millimeters thick you
may not think that's a huge difference
but once you get down to this level it
actually makes a big deal to shaping one
or two millimeters off something the way
that HP does it is by using an in sent
him so that means you can open it fully
but you don't have some of the extra
added bulk on the back that you do with
a traditional clamshell laptop the body
is made of carbon fiber and aluminum
it's got a very unique kind of smoky
gray look with gold accents now inside
in a small laptop like this you'll often
find an Intel Core M processor this
actually has full Core i5 and core i7
processors plus a very large battery
that's free thin and spread out over the
entire sort of interior of the laptop
you're going to be able to pre-order
this from HP or Best Buy's starting at
the end of April it's going to start at
1169 and it should ship around the end
of May that is the very thin very light
HP Spectre</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
