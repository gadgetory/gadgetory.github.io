Tex ultimate Throwdown showdown I'm
Brian Tong and we've got a face-off like
no other we're taking the two biggest
names in tech and throwing them in the
prize fight ring it's Bill Gates
versus Steve Jobs and this one's going
10 rounds so hold on to your butts round
one is baller status whose pockets are
lined with so much cash that money ain't
a thing and they can make a brain all
day Bill Gates current net worth is that
fifty eight billion dollars and Steve
Jobs is at 5.4 billion Bee Gees rolling
10 times stronger this round goes to
gates first you get the money and round
2 it's all about power fortune releases
their power 25 lists each year at the
end of 2007 Bill Gates ranked seventh
and who do you think is numero uno you
got it
Steven Paul Jobs he's change the game
for computing music wireless phones
retail and Hollywood and no one has more
influence over such a diverse group of
businesses jobs flexes his muscle where
even at 1 next up who's got three fridge
you've heard of the options backdating
scandal with SJ but he's been clear that
VG this guy has a criminal record he was
arrested for speeding and driving
without a license sure it was 31 years
ago but there's the mug shot to prove it
that's right gangsta gates takes the
lead ground for education both Bill
Gates and Steve Jobs dropped out of
college to pursue their dreams but the
odds of you doing the same thing taking
over the world and ending up on a
prizefight pretty slim so go get your
diploma and educate yourself people
nobody gets a point this round next
round
it's vector you've heard the stories
about Steve Jobs
plus he outright smack talks Microsoft
in his keynote and have you seen those
ads what he got planned we just gonna
copy everything you did in 2007 no
contest here Steve Ott was the dick
six employment history Bill Gates has
run Microsoft his entire life and is
stepping down on his own terms to run
his foundation Steve Jobs was ousted by
the company he built then returned to
Apple to make it bigger and better than
it ever was SJ is pulling away and I can
hear the Apple fanboys cheering with
glee appearances next whose passion is
fashion Steve Jobs you know he looks in
the mirror like a lot picks out the
perfect pair of Levi's and he uses that
lint remover on his st. Croix black mock
turtleneck before lacing up his box
fresh New Balance sneakers
now William looks in the mirror twice a
week maybe in the morning and if
disheveled his style well then he's got
it but he wears different shirts ties
pants even colors he changes dates gives
us something to look at every time and
he takes his round
we're almost there people round eight is
cult leader status who makes people
cheer even weep and scream like little
girls at a Hannah Montana concert when
he announces the latest product even
though everyone in the crowd already
knows how it looks and the specs for it
three words reality distortion field
it's a real thing look it up in
Wikipedia and when 3G actually gets
announced oh all hell is breaking loose
Jobs can lead a cult like no other next
round it's all about
Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are both
married men so who has the hotter wife
and you have to pick one it's really
like comparing apples to oranges and if
you have to ask me I'm picking apples
baby
so after nine hotly contested rounds SJ
leads five to three this doesn't look
good for BG what's the final round that
will decide it all
it's philanthropy who gives till a hurts
I'm sure Steve Jobs has privately given
to a lot of charitable causes the fact
is he terminated all of Apple's
corporate philanthropy programs in 1997
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
has donated tens of billions of dollars
in every US state a more than 100
countries the bottom line B G is
changing and saving lives we're giving
him a triple point score in this round
so total up the final score and it's six
to five making him your prize by winner
thanks for having fun with us and I hope
I didn't hurt anybody's feelings cuz at
the end of the day both of these guys
are billionaires
I'm Brian Tom and we'll catch you guys
next time on another prize fight what
