I'm Brian Tong and you've all been
asking for this one it's a battle
between the heaviest hitting touchscreen
phones on the market in this week's
prize fight it's a showdown Throwdown
between the Samsung instinct and the
Apple iPhone 3G you know the drill it's
five rounds to the finish and round one
goons bring the sexy the Samsung
instinct has a slim profile and it's a
sexy phone with the problem the iPhone
3G is the epitome of sexy
the iPhones body oh it's worth more than
a double take and it's curved booty is
hot let's just put it this way if the
instinct is Jennifer Aniston then the
iPhone 3G is Angelina Jolie now you feel
me the iPhone 3G strikes first with up
of five and the instinct gets a four we
like the sexy but we also want it easy
to use next round is navigation when it
comes to ease of use the iPhone 3GS
interface is straight gorgeous it just
makes sense when you pick it up it's
multi touching at its best and the
touchscreen is super responsive now the
instinct has an easy-to-use interface
and the menus look great with the touch
screen and keyboard just aren't as
responsive and snappy as the iPhone 3G
the iPhone gets the edge again up with a
5 and the instinct gets a 4 now after
two rounds the iPhone 3G is sitting
pretty with a ten to eight lead round
three coming up it's all about the
features the iPhone is loaded with Wi-Fi
GPS and Bluetooth and the iTunes App
Store makes the development
possibilities endless
now the instinct lacks Wi-Fi but it
makes up for it with a full GPS solution
and all those basic features that are
missing from the iPhone like multimedia
messaging voice dialing and stereo
Bluetooth it really comes down to weight
the iPhones Wi-Fi and App Store versus
the core features that instinct is
bringing this one's so close but the
instinct up gets the 5 and the iPhone 3G
gets the four Samsung is getting its
legs back and the next round is all
about who's packing the multimedia
Samson's instinct handles music just
fine
now their sprint TV service is a nice
add-on but the video quality just
doesn't cut it for me and the web
browsing experience this standard like
most cell phones it's kind of cramped
and it's clunky Apple's iPhone 3G is
multimedia on a cell phone at its
highest level now the music quality is
great and sure there is no live TV
service but the video quality is so
ridiculous that watching a full-length
movie is straight-up enjoyable oh yeah
it's also the best web browsing
experience on a phone hands-down the
iPhone 3G throws another heavy blow with
the 5 and the Samsung instinct does an
admirable job with 4 now going into the
final round
Apple's prized possession leads 19 to 17
it ain't over till it's over the final
round is called quality the instinct has
good call quality overall but we did run
into some background noise and some of
our calls sounded uneven now the iPhone
3G has significantly improved its sound
from the original model but it still
isn't perfect either plus those drop
calls they're still happening this is
the round that decides it all and we're
handing out fours to everyone making the
iPhone 3G your prize fight winner Apple
came out swinging early and Samsung was
never able to get over the hump
I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching and
we'll catch you guys next time on
another prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
