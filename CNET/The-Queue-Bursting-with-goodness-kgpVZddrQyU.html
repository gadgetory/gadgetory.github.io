Cena TV in New York City so one of
Mobile Alabama was named rainiest city
in the u.s. you're covered cuz you're in
the queue first your must see moment
look between the two giant melons or at
least just watch this cool slo-mo video
of a watermelon exploding video produced
by SVS I a manufacturer of high-speed
cameras for slow motion digital video
analysis details are out on the
hotly-anticipated next version of guitar
hero now you too can play more than just
air guitar and just about every gaming
system the new game featuring a
multiplayer action inspired battle mode
and authentic rock venues new songs
include paint it black by the stones a
version of schools out and other tracks
by smashing pumpkins and weezer there
are also new Gibson guitar controllers
the game available on PS 2 and 3 xbox
360 and the week from this fall there
comes a time in a 25 to 34 year olds
life when you just have to ask yourself
the question are you feeding the pigs 60
inch screen high-definition football
season is coming up come watch it right
here what do you think okay ah that's
what I'm talking about
you're right I don't need it a new
series of PSAs encouraging us youngins
to feed the pig teaching us to take
control of our finances and make saving
a part of our lifestyle according to
their study thirty-eight percent of
young adults put off things like buying
a home or getting married because of
financial reasons hmmm walk down the
aisle or watch the NBA Finals in all
their high def glory tough choices
moving through the queue time for the
site finding a free FM frequency to
transmit your tunes from your mp3 player
to your stereo can be tougher than you
think thankfully my best FM knows the
Clear Channel in your area it's as
simple as popping in your zip code the
site spits out the best stations to tune
your transmitter to that way songs come
through loud and clear for the tech
aholic its satellite TV anywhere while
wireless carriers fumble with tiny
mobile TV screens directv satco gives
you everything all at once wherever you
are as long as you're not in a new york
city hotel room as i was when i recently
tried out the set go the 26 pound device
slightly bigger than your average video
iPod the all-in-one briefcase includes a
17 inch display standard def receiver
and flat satellite dish for 1,500 bucks
you too can be the talk of the tailgate
you tech aholic and just imagine how
happy your kids will be to take that
next family vacation to the middle of
nowhere one line of sight to the
southern sky they won't be complaining
and that means more time for you and the
missus to mingle at the RV park I'm rich
Demuro would see that TV in New York
City don't say I didn't tell you so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
