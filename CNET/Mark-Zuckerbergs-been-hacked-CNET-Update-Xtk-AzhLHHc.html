accounts were hacked a group calling
itself our mind team has taken credit
for this how did the group do it the our
mine team says Zuckerberg has
information was in a LinkedIn database
that was leaked a few weeks ago a hacker
by the name of peace claim to be selling
117 million LinkedIn details LinkedIn
contacted those affected and told them
to change their passwords so how did the
LinkedIn password work on other sites

multiple sites including Twitter and
Pinterest

curious as to what password the founder
of Facebook used in other sites that
information was also shared the hackers

password da da da da M for proof that's
right
da da da was the password used by Mark
Zuckerberg on a number of other social
networks at the time of the hack Twitter
suspended Zuckerberg account but that
has since been fixed the tweet posted by
our mine team was also deleted by the
way people are selling t-shirts with
Zuckerberg password on it already

everyone including me do not use the
same password on multiple sites that's
it for this tech news update
