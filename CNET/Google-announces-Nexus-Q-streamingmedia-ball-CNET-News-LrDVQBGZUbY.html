it's a small android-powered computer
that's designed to live in your home it
plugs into the best speakers in TV in
your house and it's always connected to
the cloud Nexus Q tightly integrates
with Google Play so you can easily
stream music and video you use your
android phone or tablet to control it
but you're not actually streaming
content from your device to it instead
Nexus Q pulls your content directly from
Google Play here we can see his entire
music collection we can see his
playlists as he Scrolls around we can
also see his artists albums and so on
all stored in the cloud now Randall is
going to choose a room to start playing
music in and he's picking the living
room let's see what music he picks and
it looks like he picked the need
superficial by Odyssey a very good taste
random and it's very appropriate because
building q has been a bit of an odyssey
you know mobile devices have made music
more of a personal and sometimes
isolating experience but music is often
best enjoyed with friends that's why we
made Nexus Q the first-ever social
streaming device it's a cloud connected
jukebox where everyone brings their own
music to the party and so matt is going
to use his device to add a song to the
queue and there it is look so Chris what
do you have to add I think I'm going to
add this really great new rockabilly
guitarist JD mcpherson but i'm not
interested in waiting around so i think
i'm just going to take right over so so
this is a great example so at any time
anyone can move songs around the cube
and anyone can take control of the
listening experience everyone can see
the cube in real time on their devices
it's pretty cool that my friends can now
play their music in my living room so
that's music on Nexus Q with multi room
playback and social streaming a great
amplifier built right in with digital
outputs so you can hear music on the
best speakers and TV in your home and
speaking of TV wouldn't it be cool if
you could bring all your movies to a
friend's house well with
play you're always carrying your entire
digital library with you and as a social
streaming device Nexus Q lets anyone
connect and start playing videos from
their phone right away have you guys
seen any movies lately what do you guys
think about Transformers Dark of the
Moon do we have that movie I have it in
my library right here I was watching it
at home last night i'm going to start it
up here and it's going to pick up at the
very same spot where i left off when i
was playing it at home last night
now it's always fun to watch youtube
videos with friends and Nexus Q works
great with YouTube just like with music
you and your friends can play your
favorite YouTube videos right on Nexus Q
and again the content comes from the
cloud there's this cool video of these
guys beat boxing on a Google+ hangout on
their Galaxy Nexus let's play that cool
so that's Nexus Q amazing hardware with
an integrated app it streams music
movies and TV from google play as well
as youtube and what's really cool is
that it's the world's first ever social
streaming device Nexus Q will sell for
two hundred ninety nine dollars it'll be
available in the u.s. to start and
you'll be able to purchase it right from
google play you can place a pre-order
