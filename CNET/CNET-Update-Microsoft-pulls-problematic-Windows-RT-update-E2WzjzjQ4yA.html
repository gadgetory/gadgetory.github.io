bug I'm Jeff Bakalar filling in for
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update microsoft pulled the windows 8.1
update for those with the RT version of
Windows 8 and that's the version for
some surface tablets it seems the update
may have crippled some windows RT
machines leaving them unable to even
start up Microsoft has released a
recovery image for service RT owners to
download to fix the errors but it's
going to require you to download it from
another computer and then load the fix
onto a USB Drive prepaid carrier Boost
Mobile will be selling the new iphone 5s
and 5c starting on friday november
eighth but right now there's no details
on pricing now of course sprint owns
boost as well as virgin mobile and
virgin began selling the new iPhones
this month they charge five hundred
fifty dollars for the high-end iPhone 5s
and the colorful 5c starts at four
hundred and fifty dollars of course off
contract US Cellular will also get the
new phones on november eighth as well
microsoft's limited time promotion that
gave away free downloads of games with
an xbox live gold subscription is now a
permanent thing the games with gold
program was launched back at e3 earlier
this year and was set to end in December
but now it's going to be ongoing for
every one that pays for a full year of
gold membership right now halo 3 is one
of the free games that's offered and
this is a direct response to Sony which
also offers a really impressive
selection of free games to those that
subscribe to the PlayStation Plus
program it looks like LG is preparing to
make new products that work on Google's
Chrome operating system the company
filed for trademarks on laptops and
tablets with the names chrome one chrome
desk and chrome station now of course
LG's already teamed up with Google to
create the Nexus 4 smartphone and the
upcoming Nexus 5 which should actually
be out any day now if you have an iPhone
iPad or iPod touch you can make free
voice calls with googles hangouts at
Google updated its iOS app so those with
a google voice number can place and
receive calls from the app directly but
it's only free for numbers
within the US and Canada it doesn't cut
into your carrier's voice minutes but it
will cut into that data plan that's your
tech news update for more details and
head on over to cnet com / update and
you can follow me on twitter from our
Studios here in New York I'm Jeff
