the Giant Bomb studios in san francisco
california it's the apple byte extra
country podcast with your host mr. brian
Tong hey what's up everybody welcome to
apple byte extra crunchy extra munchy
episode 56 I've been gone for about a
week and a half I was off site so that's
why we didn't do anything on Friday so
we're gonna kind of do a little makeup
show Monday with some of the updates
that were talking about everything
that's buzzing in the Apple world again
the show is all about you please make
sure you call us you are a huge part of
our show 1 800 61 62 63 8 is that number
your name where you're from and your
message 20 to 30 seconds tops we did
squeeze I think a couple one minute guys
in yes but it's really important to at
least get to your point let's not ramble
on let's get to it so I'm going to get
right to the show and we know it's been
about a week since the iPhone and Apple
watch have come out actually in the
hands of people it's been released in
other areas but we're gonna talk about
some new product rumors because you guys
are probably tired of us talking about
the iphone check this out how about
apples echo like device there are echoes
style smart home device now this has
been rumored for quite some time I have
been the number one proponent of the
Amazon echo Jews from standpoint of how
it was one of those game-changing new
platforms that is literally changed how
we use our gat you know something like
voice control in the home home
automation and obviously Google is
jumping on board but Apple has also been
jumping on board now this report from
Bloomberg and mark Gurman says Apple is
pressing ahead with the development of
an echo like smart home device based on
the series assistant that's according to
the report it started more than two
years ago so that was about the time
that Amazon echo launched do you
remember when the Amazon first game echo
came out like were you like what is this
or how did you feel about yeah I thought
it was super awesome I was like that's
the future right there let's talk to
stuff talk two things but not only that
like you know I also thought Syria was
the future you know yeah Siri first came
out I was like I can talk to my phone
now it was pretty it was the idea was
sweet adjust that Siri wasn't as good as
other stuff like Google right but in the
very beginning
was she was she was I'd be like play
metallica oh and you were okay with her
yeah yeah i like i like i mean i've
always been a fan of google voice is
just from a speed and accurate and point
it may not have as much of a personality
serio yeah yeah but it's always been on
point so no Apple is taking this concept
of an Amazon echo like device but it'll
be an apple smart home device and again
it's been going on for two years the
device will be designed to control
things like appliances locks lights
curtains and via voice activation the
finalized plans are still not done and
they could potentially scrap the project
which they really shouldn't only because
apples ecosystem is so huge you have so
many devices the other cool thing about
this is let's talk about other hooks
that it could be involved what if it
read your emails or your text messages
just because you asked them to yes
because it was hooked to all those
services now if it reaches the market it
would really be its most significant
hardware piece since the Apple watch
which has come out to lukewarm reviews
the echo has built all these third party
partners one of our friends I devices
inc com is one of those people I was
gonna give a shot working was working
with smart device already got it you
gotta give a little bit of a shout out
but Google's home is coming out
reportedly next week at their keynote on
October for so it'll be interesting to
see where they stand how they
differentiate themselves from amazon and
then really is there space for a third
model because i always feel like there's
I think so well for Apple users there
always is right sure their land and but
the thing that I've been hearing about
this device is that people are worried
because it has a camera in their
supposed to be like some sort of face
recognition yeah and it knows who walks
in the room and maybe I'll start playing
music from your purchase songs or
something yeah yeah you know that you
have on iTunes so that that raise that
raised some privacy scares for a lot of
people you know I would think so they
Apple earlier acquired facial
recognition startups a phase shift and
emotion not to be if not facetime faced
face shift and emotion over the past two
years on that kind of leads the
connection of how are they going to use
this visual facial recognition besides
always serving as a controller for some
of these smart home devices which
used to scene we could process a lot of
different siri commands we talked about
emails text messages what about tweets
streaming content from Apple music you
can see how their ecosystem hooks would
be really nice with this device know for
sure so we don't expect to come anytime
soon the report also says the standalone
speaker was initially going to
potentially work with some sort of Apple
TV functionality were attempting to
actually integrate it into the apple TV
but then said um I think we should make
this its own device like the Amazon echo
yeah I was just going to say like why
would they do that because it already
Apple TV already has sort of that
built-in you could talk to Siri and say
their watch right yeah I want to watch
such and such so yeah it doesn't make
sense you could almost if they could
adopt the technology and just basically
pop into that Siri remote that would
actually be really nice but to have an
always-on listening a speaker type
device like the echo you can do so many
things with it totally you can get cnet
podcast oh look out hello who so that's
going to be really cool to see how that
all kind of comes together another thing
that we've been talking about is the
Apple watch too but another report from
Bloomberg Bloomberg's alex webb is
talking about how Apple is working
actively on kind of the next generation
of health kit now we know health kit
collect some of those metrics you do
while you're active you're running your
heart rate your steps but they're hoping
that health kit can evolve and do more
things like come up with apps that are
part of the platform for things like
sleep tracking your sleep patterns
another one would be actually gauge your
fitness level how you do that measuring
the time taken from your heart rate to
fall from its peak to resting level
that's how they can measure your actual
Rhett your overall fitness level we
already know they have apps that measure
heart rate but this to actually take all
these data points and then create kind
of a profile or be able to read them and
combine them and give you an overall
view diagnostic of your health that's
what they're hoping to do with this next
evolution of health kit really turn it
into a diagnosis based on these multiple
metrics and apps that are hooked into it
that's cool so and then Siri can know
when you're sick right I'm sick Siri
Siri I don't feel good Apple's Siri I'm
feeling down i'm feelin town
that's like I don't know I feel like
apples gonna have a lot of information
on us they're like okay Steven Beecham
sick right now he might you they might
they have played they probably already
have that without you knowing they
probably do you know what I mean so um
they've they've you know bought apple
bought glimpse incorporate it was a
startup that was built for pulling
electronic health records from different
databases and the hope is that in
addition we've always heard about Apple
getting involved in the medical field
Apple is hoping to use all of these
different pieces of the puzzle put them
together and then help them build
electronic health records in a simple
digestible format pretty much directly
from your watch using software that's
cool so it's kind of they really want to
be part of that healthcare platform
we've already seen them use it um you
know and experimentally the iphone more
they've talked about how they use it for
like diabetes tests and things of that
nature and pilot programs so it's
bringing the kind of bringing the Apple
watch the next level we'll see how that
plays out I do have to say about the
current Apple watch too I got one but I
just at the end of the day I don't
personally don't care about GPS enough
and I'm gonna return it like oh really
my my current gen one Apple watch with
watch Oh trace is more than good enough
for me right now that's cool the
waterproofing someone actually called
about yeah yeah the waterproofing like
hey it is the first gen apple watch
actually waterproof it's not officially
waterproof but it is water resistant
there's no actual official metric we
like took showers with it for fun but it
doesn't have like the same waterproofing
actual coated seals inside like the new
series two dozen if you really care
about water water sports yada yada you
probably should lean towards the series
too but you can I'm not gonna say it's
guaranteed but it's pretty darn good
with just the first gen apple watch yeah
it also doesn't have the squirting
mechanism out of the speaker right this
waters good yeah the speaker edge what
is the water ejection speaker yeah that
was crazy in the Apple watch too i did
find out though that before you go
swimming you actually have to turn on
that mode so it closed so you better not
f up and forget to activate the water
ejection speaker that's funny and then
potentially get water inside of your
your Apple watch that cannot be ejected
wow so you do have to turn on
essentially like a mode for it I think I
had no idea I did not know that until i
read that like many things on the
internet i did not know that i did not
know that i did not know that but so for
me now you know i like to test the stuff
out i think that will watch 24 me as a
no go right now they are using an actual
bigger battery but the returns on the
overall battery life have been shown or
reported to pretty much be the same so i
have been scolded for saying oh it has a
better battery fine it has a bigger
battery but you don't actually see those
gains in the end so um that makes it
interesting but again if your gps person
runner or swimmer that's the only reason
I really think you should even look at
this otherwise look at some of the
better deals on the series one are you a
GPS person no I don't run I don't run on
trail so I don't really care yeah I mean
even even if you do go run on trails now
you have the gps enabled then like you
look at it you're like oh there's a
bunch of little colored lines like sweet
awesome i mean it's like my colored
lines guys I like the Nike+ app allows
you to watch your trail but again if you
have to really be a trail runner too i
think feel get the best advantage of it
if you just run around residential
streets and some no one cares but yeah
to kind of see your path can be funny
useful i'm sure is what people think
about it they might be listening to like
no I totally love it let us know like
what you would really use the GPS in for
the Apple watch at one eight hundred 61
62 63 because i don't know if it's just
me I think it's nice but it's not I
gotta have exactly I'm something that
you might want to have mac OS Sierra hey
lock go see ya I got it on my work
laptop or you I love it is it working
just like it yeah you know what to me it
honestly feels a lot like El Capitan but
I I haven't really seen anything
differently I notice you just feel like
it's a lease fastest faster it's looks
more slick new startup screen that's
yeah that's really about it subtle
subtle new shading and buttons in there
you know a transparencies and things
like that it's here it came out on the
20th some people um at least a couple
people told me that it it overheated
their logic board oh yeah so I've
noticed that I don't know if it's a
widespread issue but again like anything
there's no need
rush it I was out on a trip so I able I
was able to install it on Friday night
but it took or saturday sorry Saturday
night so I was behind but I didn't you
know when I started using like I'm not
missing much just just doing just doing
some updates with machal Sierra so let
us know what you guys think about it you
know you have the built-in um Apple pay
you have the Siri functionality you have
the ability to unlock your Mac with your
Apple watch if you're within vicinity um
you know you have a few little bells
with that there's the iCloud Drive that
is kind of like thing that your desktop
that can now be used on pretty much or
access on any Mac at any time it's like
a that's like a cloud drive basic yes
that's what I use Dropbox all the time
so that could be useful for me i'll
probably still use drop Yeah Yeah right
just cuz you're so yeah I'm totally it's
like yeah it's ingrained it is it
totally is so we have that just a few
other small updates we talked about the
iphone launching a worldwide it's
launched in 30 more countries now the
Apple watch series 2 is arrived in 20
plus countries and then iOS 10.0 point
to the rule the update it fix this
little lightning headphone issue where
if you are using the Lightning earpods
on your Apple iPhone potentially it
could stop functioning the remote could
stop working you couldn't control volume
so they have fixed that in there okay
good very nice oh yes what's even nicer

but love for you all and you all should
check it out we have used them and they
are pretty sweet just a few quick hits
before we get our voicemails Apple will
begin selling the sonos wireless speaker
systems online starting today and then
in stores next month if you're familiar
with sonos and there's smart speakers in
your home ability to play music in
multiple rooms a same songs in different
rooms different songs in different rooms
a really cool really cool platform and
it's all I think what it might be behind
it i I'm sorry I blank for saying I
believe Apple music is now finally it
was running a beta on sonos ah and so
that's probably most likely why they're
coming out to retail stores now that
they fully support it totally like
different question than this sonus
hitman you can you use these so no
speakers for like 5.1 surround
wirelessly well you can place them oh I
know that at least you can do a 2.1
surround setup I don't off the top of my
head I don't recall if you can do a 5.1
I feel like you can't but someone's
gonna correct me because I haven't I
don't have a so-so no set but it's
really more for like that medium-sized
to bigger size home speaker in different
rooms that then can link up they have
like a I believe they have a sonos black
sound bar but not like a 5.1 if I recall
but if I'm wrong just you know give me a
bad apple okay also this this is a apple
patents are very exciting here for the
Apple white extra crunchy I mean the
patents really tell us well you know
what what Apple is looking to do down
the future
oh yeah what about this one Beecham you
want to talk about this yeah I'm trying
to get it up here on the website on the
cnet com website but Apple has patented
a new design for paper bags why they're
reinventing the paper bag brian Tong
this is a big deal let me find that
paper bag article I can tell you some
specifically about me please tell me ok
so this bag right it's literally an
apple retail store bag and what makes
this this is a patent application that
was applied by Apple the paper bag may
include a bag container that's basically
the shape of the bag formed of white
solid bleached sulfate paper with at
least sixty percent post-consumer
content that is that's the hook sixty
percent post-consumer content so if you
it's like a you know way more efficient
it's easier I think it's also easier to
break down as well yes better the
environment this is an apple patent
ladies and gentlemen so I would run to
your stores immediately and ask them if
they have the new apple apple pie bed I
bag yeah I bags yeah i was reading the
article it's interesting like bags
airbags the apple has a history of
patenting random stuff and I guess they
patented a fabric with laser etched
words on it oh yeah they should pretty
sure like that and then a five-axis
robotic arm which seems like someone
who'd already have a patent on I bet you
know what that 5-axis robotic arm is for
I have no idea do you remember when they
launched I believe it was the iphone 6s
possibly they showed off that robotic
arm that kind of dismantle owns yeah
what was wrong angle them had a name
like naughty or something like but I bet
you'd that he's related to that patent
somehow someway totally he just might be
and since we're talking about kind of
goofy quirky gadgets how has the tech
game gone a step too far has it because
check this out this is called the loo
della it is a smart candle yeah but
that's too far it's an iphone controlled
smart candle that it's not like a
LED light it's an actual flame it's the
first it's a world's first real flame
smart candle it's called Lou della it
retails it will retail this candle
buddies ladies and gentlemen will be
going for 149 are you kidding me they'll
start for pre-order at $99 those candles
better last for a lifetime Wow so it's
it's not it never melt is it i guess
knocks it looks like wax it has a
changeable scent and has a real it has a
real legit flame candle light baby
liddell ax lu de la look it up there's
got to be like some like you know
disposable cartridge inside I don't know
putting out gas or some I do not know
but uh yeah Wow I do not enter all right
should we get to our awesome voicemails
yes remember y'all can call us on the
apple byte extra crunchy wow how who
what when where why how I have the
number 1 806 162 638 let's get to the
calls stopped the song here here we go
call number one hi my name is Josh I'm
from ambler Pennsylvania I absolutely
love your show thanks for doing it my
specific question is about the future of
the ipad air I have the I'm sorry the
ipad mini i have the ipad mini 4 i
really love the size form factor but i'd
really love an ipad mini that was
basically an iPad Mini Pro you know the
a processor is kind of weak for this day
and age so I'm wondering if you think
that'll get upgraded in the spring or
whether they'll just do away with the
ipad mini considering people are buying
ipod pluses thanks again bye bye i think
they're gonna keep it around as long as
they possibly can just because the form
factor i really hope that we see
something new but no there have been no
actual rumblings that appointed to
anything iPad Mini related like you kind
of talked about it looks like because of
the larger screen iphone taking up some
of that big screen stuff at the moment
it looks like next year's iPad release
will be a 9.7 a 10.5 and a 12.9 that's
everything
we've heard so far so we will wait and
see I think the ipad mini still has a
place you know in the product line but
at the same time they just aren't
selling that many ipads so we'll see
where Apple believes that they're making
their bread and butter because quite
honestly and as sad as it is for me to
say because I'm a huge ipad pro junkie
the ipad pro ipad line in general just
isn't getting much love yeah because
people aren't buying them as much you
don't need them you can you can do fine
with like a 2nd gen 1 yeah first gen 1
even and and once you buy one you can
keep it for like years and years and
years and done it forever so okay next
call hey Cheech and Chong this is John
Collins from spotsylvania Virginia as
curious if you guys thought then iTunes
radio AKA i do music now pretty much is
it going to ever have a web interface so
that we get to it when we say at work
it's that I haven't have itunes
installed not possible for a lot of
people just curious what your thoughts
are on that all right okay I have some
device it's a good question i do have
some advice for my buddy I think they
really actually would prefer that you
use your like phone or your other device
to go to iTunes and buy music from it
instead of using a web-based store yeah
because it's like it's in your pocket
it's there anytime I get what you're
saying I'd like to serve the desktop but
and your say no you can't install itunes
on that actual physical machine well you
got itunes on your gadget and i'm
assuming that he probably has an iphone
otherwise he wouldn't be using itunes at
all yeah i was thinking like he's
thinking more like you know like a not
like a spotify but like um what's the
other one starts with a gorgeous like
quick musics like just music radio kind
of application you know what i mean i
think he's talking out musically uh
rhapsody I'll bragging Rhapsody Ramsey
we're just like am online music radio
service that's playing that its just its
own app you know so you don't have to
have itunes and all that stuff so yeah
why don't they do something they did for
a while then now they just direct you
directly to the app but he's saying but
what if I can't download the app on the
machine yeah because a lot of people
that were like we couldn't get Mac Oh
Ciara
oh no you no no no not it's not allowed
not allow sir not a lot yet not a lot we
were like I always feel like we're like
six seven months after they they bring
it out were then allowed to use it but
you know we're on a corporate network
and they want to make sure they keep it
tight they don't want to get hacked yeah
that's a good question they say I think
they should why why not manpower will
don't download that I think they would
but I'd well I think it's it's just more
of a man power issue I think there's a
lot of things that they'd feel like um
yeah I think we're going to work on
updating the software to x y&amp;amp;z before we
do this yeah if they did that they
should have done it when they launched
the radio stations that they did what
were those when they beats down and just
like that and just in general and they
when they update an OS just or you know
release it release it then yeah yeah
just do something with that within
aligning with the software so at least
you have a good story to tell so all
right thanks for calling buddy okay next
call hey Brian and beach this is shane
from Sioux Falls South Dakota just
calling to say love your show thank you
guys for keeping me company while
driving for work with the apple
lightning headphones do those work on
previous generations or is it something
just the iphone 7 also curious if we've
looked at what are the benefits of using
that driver using the Lightning driver
for headphones is that something of
benefit or is it just gimmicky thanks
love the show how about this i won't
call it gimmicky but it is a pure
digital audio connection yeah so that's
one benefit but i will tell you using an
iphone with a lightning connector
earpods and a dongle for regular earpods
it has created a lot of subtle nick
picky issues that you just never would
think of really so for example how about
this i plug in my ear pods with
lightning to my laptop I'm sorry to my
phone but I can't plug him into my
laptop I'll need to use add adapter yeah
or I'll just buy another pair of
headphones from my laptop how about I
juice I don't want to lose the ear pod
headphones because to me it's annoying
I'd rather
bring a dongle converter with an actual
real audio headphone so that it's more
versatile when I try to use them
anywhere else right once you have a
airpot headphones you can use own any
other device only an Apple device yeah
yeah but if like maybe it sounds silly
but if you want to hear something from
your friends maybe you're at some sort
of kiosk or maybe you're in a car or
whatever the hell you want a real
physical audio headphone connection I
there's so many subtle uses and I'm like
oh man there by getting away with that
it's not gonna work and how about
plugging your phone and listening to it
at the same time and charging at the
same time not gonna happen not gonna
happen there's all these little things
so um I think that really the major
benefit is it is Apple's telling us that
it helps slim their products down which
no one is necessarily asking for but
that's okay and then create a pure
digital audio connection cool cool cool
cool all right last call for alcohol hi
this is Martin from North Carolina I
want you guys to talk about apples
neglect of the Mac lineup like for
example the mac pro from 2013 out when
it came out are they had outdated
hardware nevermind now and it's way more
expensive for the performance than
anything you could get a custom built pc
with all the professional software you
need to UM the mac minis from 2014 the
dose dual cores the top the high-end
ones they perform worse than the quad
core mechanism 2012 I'm but very
frustrating and then the imac baseline
starts at one point six gigahertz of
dual core processing power with a 5400
RPM hard drive and that's 1099 now is
just unacceptable I thought I thought
apple would have moved on to higher
power higher base clock speeds and all
flash memory by now but you know anyway
let me know your thoughts on these
things thanks bye my friend as the great
Michael Jackson once said you a not
alone I am here with you I'm gonna stop
that because people like all right I
just got to the end of this pockets on
him singing once i'm gonna turn it off
now you know before
okay I am y este okay I'm gonna stop or
just voice no thank you thank you Oh
Michael Jackson not mine but uh no you
are you are not missing it we are
expecting a potentially see some max
getting upgraded in October hopefully I
don't know if they're gonna even upgrade
the entire line but they really
desperately need to do something even
just the mac pros like their high-end
you know desktop workstation I don't
think it's been updated in at least two
years and our editors are like um yeah
this is not the best video editing
machine we talk a lot of our editors are
not and running and really happy with it
yeah totally that's the garbage can
right yes it's yes attraction trash
receptacle the the jet the jet engine I
think we will definitely see new imacs
you know it'll be up bumped up with
graphics cards and processors um and the
mac mini good lord 5400 RPM drive you
gotta get up on that oh yeah yeah
there's so many factors I i have to i
think it's like the building a car
they're building too many reenabled
thing they're built you know their focus
on the phone they're trying to innovate
the phone the headphone there's so many
things they're building this massive
cupertino headquarters base building you
know so they got my think it's a lot of
stuff then maybe they're just like
neglecting you can see I think more than
anything you can see the neglect in
their software focus yes because all I'm
saying I kind of pointed out I can't
remember if it was last week of the week
before but I point how the iOS 10
podcast app versus music app versus
movie app they're all media players yeah
but they're all completely different in
how they totally pletely different
they're laid out how they're used yes
straight up the music player is like a
column on the far right side that looks
like what your phone is it's not filled
to the screen on an iPad I'm just like
what are you guys doing yeah so you know
felt their stretch then let's just put
it that way yeah I accidentally updated
my phone to iOS 10 yeah like I plugged
it in in the computer like yeah sure why
not yeah I thought it was updating
itunes but actually updated but it you
know it's I'm living with it and it's
okay the music app is little better the
buttons are bigger it's so still just a
more streamlined I do like the music app
is the icer it's a little bit easier
it's easier to get to stuff so that's
not as crazy but you know I've been
using the iphone 7 and I've got to tell
you I don't have a 7 plus okay that home
button that's like a flat you know
taptic feedback touchpad kind of like a
laptop um touchpad it took time to get
used to but I'm used to it but man I
really feel like I'm just using an
iphone 6s really I really do really
other than the fact that there's a
lightning cable that bugs me in the home
button but I'm not complaining about
Italy and gentlemen the speed of it is
nice but you know these phones already
so fast when you start dealing with this
every day you're like huh I don't really
feel much of a difference yeah yeah in
fact I feel like I'm missing something
well which you are what I've noticed is
just the lift to wake you know when I
just lift your phone and it wakes up how
do i turn that off because I don't like
it I'm afraid it's gonna there's my
battery life yeah it will most likely
does let's see here someone could just
like tweet me or someone could just like
say yo oh no I'm gonna I'm gonna look in
the settings on that I can't remember I
was looked all over the place and they
could not find how to turn that off
because now every time I looked on my
phone it lights up and I do not like
okay here we go go near display and
brightness I was trying to find out what
it was actually calling some like I
think it's called any different it's
raised to week raised to wake up or turn
