seen it and i'm here with Glen Laurie
18t we're here in a hundred-year home in
the Garden District of New Orleans to
talk about a team teas new digital
connected home so Glenn tell me more
about it well it's called digital life
the goal here is that we make
everybody's lives better and more
simplistic and we're launching a
platform that will allow and take over
all security all through full automation
in the home all IP all digital first one
in the u.s. problem and you mentioned
security I me you're 18 TS getting a
security business absolutely absolutely
oh it's not we don't look we always look
for opportunities that are adjacent to
our business number one we want to look
to grow revenues for our shareholders
this business is is really write a lot
of small players you got the largest
player at six million subs we really
think we can come in and really change
the game and I mean that from pure
innovation brand new type of offerings
all IP so very flexible and then allow
us to really change people's homes and
you talk about all IP network talk about
multiple devices that are connecting the
home give us some examples know what
what can you do with this digital life
so I got here in actually show and you
can take a look at this this is the
interface and by the way this is the
product this is what the face of digital
life will be we have painstakingly built
this to be simple to be easy so anybody
can use it this allows you this shows
you the kitchen of the home or in this
allows you to look at some of the
programs you can set so you can actually
set a program when you walk in in the
morning one button push turns on your
coffee maker which is actually right
back there unlocks your door which is
right over here and also would bring
down your Sun Shade all in one program
for example the key to this event Haley
this can all be control with tripod I'll
be control with your iPad your iPhone
your Android phone your Windows Phone so
we're going to use all os's and build
this beautiful application that is again
super simple also if you look close to
this you can see the two cameras that
are right now rolling outside so you can
actually look out your front door
another example might be the doorbell
rings and I'm back
here in the kitchen this is a very big
home and I could press a button to use
that my front door and talk to them
because it's a camera with a microphone
out front decide if I want to let them
in or decide if I want to go over the
door and talk to them so this is does
everything garage doors thermostats
helps you keep track of that the energy
you're using so we are going to
completely digitize the home right we're
going to offer full security A to Z full
automation all-in-one platform and we're
going to put it on application that
makes it simple well and so I don't live
in an eighteen t territory I've actually
live in a verizon am I able to get this
idea cat u-verse TV yes so this product
we're launching first of all we're
launching our trial markets which we've
announced we're going to launch those in
atlanta and in dallas at the third
quarter yeah why we haven't said yeah we
said we'll launch it this year in 2012
and then we will this will be a
nationwide offer so the beauty is this
is a wireless product the controller
that controls us it goes in your home is
bring your own broadband as well as has
3g wireless connectivity and as well
redundancies important and security so
you have two pipes and also who's going
to use those those pipes for different
applications so this is a nationwide
offer so we're going to go anywhere that
we sell 18t wireless services you'll be
able to buy this and put this in your
home excellent thanks a lot Glen it's
