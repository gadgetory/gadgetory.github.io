this week's guest host and welcome to
rumor has it the show where we round up
the week's biggest tech rumors and vote
on what sounds legit and what seems like
it just won't happen and remember that
you can vote on all of the rumors too so
keep your eye out for the pole in the
interactive player if you're watching on
cnet first up a rumor that just won't
die might finally be put out to pasture
last week Facebook sent a rather cryptic
invite that said come see our new home
on Android on April fourth according to
TechCrunch sources familiar with the
matter have said that the social network
plans to debut an HTC smartphone that
runs a modified version of androids OS
and uses built in native facebook
functionality I thought we already had a
facebook phone right but that was the
HTC chacha and the salsa which have
little Facebook buttons that take you
directly to the Facebook app but this
phone will take it a step further by
better integrating Facebook's messaging
photos and contacts features I'm not
sure I want all that sounds horrifying
it does but then it also sounds awesome
so I've probably been brainwashed
congratulations you're a facebook zombie
next up another phone rumor sort of long
time Microsoft employee Charlie Kindel
joined Amazon to work on a secret
project according to his LinkedIn
profile one of his roles at Microsoft
was general manager in charge of
rallying independent software developers
to its Windows Phone platform his hire
at amazon could stoke more speculation
that the online retail giant is readying
a mobile phone of its own or maybe they
just hired him because his name is
Kendall you know like Kindle yeah I got
it anyway according to his LinkedIn
profile he's building a new team going
after a totally new area for Amazon
sounds like that fabled Amazon phone to
me yeah next up a new report from Pocket
Gamer says Apple is once again said to
be planning the release of the game
controller according to the report Apple
booked rooms using a pseudonym
hold secret meetings at the game
developer conference last week and that
the device could be unveiled sometime
next month don't most iOS games already
have touchscreen controls yeah but you
have to admit there's no substitute for
the tactile experience of a controller
especially on first-person shooters or
even sports and dungeon crawler type
games yeah but are you going to be
holding a controller with your iPad
propped up in front of you it seems like
it's more trouble than it's worth agreed
but I guess I'm hoping for an Apple TV
tie-in where games can be played
anywhere or maybe it would mimic the
razor edge allowing you to dock the iPad
and have physical buttons and shoulder
triggers that might be cool what do you
guys think is Apple planning a gaming
controller what would you like to see in
it don't forget to vote and leave us a
comment and we'll check in with the
scenic council the cnet Council is
composed of five editors who cast their
votes anonymously their opinions are not
an endorsement by cnet or CBS
Interactive obviously because these are
rumors folks and the cnet council's
verdict is an almost unanimous no 4 out
of 5 editors don't think Apple is
developing a controller winner says yes
but says it's debatable about whether
they'll actually release it that's our
show everybody please share your rumors
that rumor has it at cnet com or call us
at 1 800 750 cnet and tweet us and
thanks to Jason this week's co-host tune
in next week for more tech rumors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
