warhorse the Panasonic HD X 900 the 900
this is a pro camera it's a pro news
camera technically speaking and pro
means expensive the body of the camera
the camcorder part is about $30,000
lenses like this fujinon zoom lens can
push 30,000 dollars pretty easily
that doesn't include battery pack
wireless audio receiver you've got your
choices of view finders this is the real
deal those pro view finders by the way
are almost always black and white
because the pros know that critical
focus is easier to eyeball without color
now as I mentioned this guy is a
camcorder so it's got a tape deck over
here you can run a dvcpro HD tape in
there we only use that for backup
instead for primary we have what's
called a samurai these days it mounts on
top of the camera and that's got a
built-in hard drive for full res capture
and also a touch screen for control of
recording as well as being a built-in
preview and playback monitor you really
can't say too much about this camera it
has a beautiful image however with its
roots as a news camera an Eng camera
it's not given to the shallow depth of
field effects everybody likes and it's a
handful to lug around this is why
Charlie's vertebra all make noise when
he moves these days he's been lugging
this in cars for a long time oh and when
you're out using one of these someone
always seems to ask you through the
comment now next down the stack is this
guy the panasonic hv x 200 this is our
favourite run-and-gun cam you can see
it's a lot more compact and it's way
cheaper than a 900 this guy costs them
several thousand dollars a fraction the
price of the big boy notice a few
differentiating features from the 900
though this zoom lens is fixed to the
camera it's permanently mounted you
can't change it out as a result we often
use this giant pro quality wide-angle
adapter that screws onto the front of
the lens like so but it weighs almost as
much as the camera itself but with this
adapter on there this guy is really wide
and a wide lens is also very stable so
this is a great lens for shooting those
interior
the cars you often seen or just running
around without a tripod grabbing details
on the outside of the car because wide
angles take out shake now in the back of
the camera you'll see one of the key
features these are p2 memory cards we
record - they're kind of like a very
expensive version of an SD card but
these allow you to get the video on here
in really high res and then transfer
quickly to your edit machine without
having to dig in a tape which this does
record - we just never use it and lastly
like the 900 this guy's sensor design
lends it to getting everything in focus
or a lot of the field and focus it
doesn't really like to do short shallow
depth of field now of course everyone's
in love with the shallow depth of field
look these days and two cameras we use
at nail that are this sony fs100 this
kind of odd box looking body here and of
course the Canon DSLRs 5d Mark 3 is the
one everyone's in love with what's
interesting about these cameras is they
have sensors that allow you to use lens
and sensor combos that give you very
shallow depth of field or shallow depth
of focus if that's the look you're
trying to achieve and just about
everybody is these days you can also use
a wide variety of pretty affordable
lenses both zoom lenses that are
basically still lenses as well as prime
lenses like this one it's actually a
cine lens and prime lenses are
interesting because they're very fast
they gather light really well because
they're very simple and that lets you
use aperture more creatively to handle
focus and composition and not just
exposure look at this same shot done
with our 900 and a DSLR because we can
do such tight selective focus we can
really call your attention to one part
of a busy scene with the DSLR on the
other hand working with shallow focus
can be very picky especially for
something that moves like a car and you
need to use the look sparingly since
everybody's doing it and overdoing
next up is the action cameras this might
be the biggest accessible revolution in
HD video in the last couple of years and
we of course use a slew of them now the
best-known of them all partly because
they throw money at marketing is GoPro
they have several models of these right
now they're all kind of in this cube
shape and these are great cameras they
have an amazing array of video settings
and types they can capture and generally
really good image quality the thing I
don't like about them is the ergonomics
you got to work with this clearcase to
get a tripod mount which isn't the only
camera like that but once you get it in
there and start to fiddle with these
buttons on the top and the bottom I find
it's a real pain to access the one you
want and this included mount always
swivels in every way except the way you
need it to which brings me to the
contour camera I like the simplicity of
these guys we're of a bullet shape than
a square cube in the air
simple big old switch here that tells it
to start rolling or to stop and the
other cool feature about this guy is
it's got a rotating objective on the
front you can rotate this almost all the
way around the compass so no matter
which way the camera is pointing the
lens can be lined up the way you want it
without worrying about critical
alignment of the body of the camera now
couple that with a nice pan of ice mount
with a ball joint on the top and you've
got unlimited flexibility on top of
unlimited flexibility just as long as
you get this thing stuck somewhere the
cameras gonna follow and eventually get
lined up the way you want it either
through the objective lens or moving the
body around this is really convenient
for a fast setup now new on the scene
and I'm really big on these are Sony's
AF 10 and AAS 15 these cameras are noted
for really good optics they got that
typical Sony Zeiss lens the 10 is the
basic model the 15 here has this Wi-Fi
ability which I find is a waste of money
it's cumbersome to deal with and doesn't
really get you very far but if you want
to be able to frame this thing up and
start and stop it from your smartphone
you have that option I pass on that get
the a s10 and step by the way both of
these have really good image
stabilization which is important with a
camera like this that's going to be on a
car getting lots of vibration instead of
getting the Wi-Fi model spend your bucks
on this optional LCD case for
either model when you dock that guy in
there you've now got the option of a
traditional flaming LCD that you can
also turn around to face yourself and it
also gives you a tripod not which the
camera itself does not have on it kind
of like a GoPro action cameras can get
the shot easily from places you could
never mount a camera before they all run
real wide so vibration is minimized as
well as the need for critical
composition on the downside they often
shoot at fisheye angles which can kill
detail in composition here's an odd
little camera I use from time to time it
can be a lifesaver it's a samsung DV 300
what's interesting about it is it's got
a front-facing flamin monitor see that
one right there it's actually in the
panel of the camera that's great when
you're using it and you have to frame
yourself up in the car thank you on the
driving read all the way through you can
actually see what you're pointing at
which is tricky on this one because you
typically use it zoomed a little bit
that's its advantage over the typical
action camera so when it's zoomed you've
got to make sure it's pointing the right
way and that little monitor helps you
plus having that zoom lens means you can
use it for detail work if you see a shot
of a gauge or an instrument doing
something while the car is driving you
couldn't get that with a contour a GoPro
it's too wide a camera like this can
nail it on the other hand when it's
zoomed in you've got a manage vibration
because it gets real shaky now by the
way regardless what the manufacturers
will tell you all those action cameras
sound like hell they have lousy built-in
mics you can connect an external mic
that's really cumbersome with what is
supposed to be a very easy to use stick
and go camera so when I'm using an
action camera I always capture sync
audio on a portable recorder I like this
one a lot does the tascam dr-05 tried a
lot of these this one is my favorite
partly because it has two articulated
and very good quality microphones here
on the top now of course these mics need
to be covered with these little wind
screens almost every situation or they
pick up a lot of wind noise in a moving
car but they work really well also I
like to use a little foam boot like this
whenever I'm mounting it on the car
whether it's taped or up in the
windshield visor which I do a lot that
isolates the body from vibration which
would be picked up by the mic
and in those cases where we have a car
with a great-sounding exhaust we want to
record that sound we use the
unfortunately named dead kitten which
slides over the top here it's a small
version of what's been known in the
business forever as a dead cat and this
fluffy thing blocks wind noise outside
the car amazingly well you will pick up
exhaust sound well and almost no wind if
you've seen the time-lapse we run during
the credits on SEANET on cars that's
done with a brenno 200 time lapse camera
it has an articulated lens that makes it
easy to frame and it seems to run
forever on for doublea's I don't think
I've ever replaced them coupled with a
magnetic Gorillapod you can make this
thing a fly-on-the-wall almost anywhere
so there you go a look at the tools
we've learned to love in almost a decade
of shooting cars here at CNN and it
matters less than you would think
if your camera cost 200 bucks or 60
grand if it gets the shot you need to
tell the story and the video quality is
good enough to not call attention to the
camera you used you're in pretty good
shape all right good deal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
