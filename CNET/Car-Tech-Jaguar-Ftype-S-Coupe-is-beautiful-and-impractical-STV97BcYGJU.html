coupe and want to save $1,500 you can
now get this cheaper version with a
manual transmission of course Jaguar did
not include that manual transmission to
save you money they did it for the
sports car enthusiasts who demand a
three petal driving experience and this
2016 jagger f-type s coupe is more
sports car than most it's an absolutely
gorgeous looking car with big rear
haunches a low cabin and a long nose for
the f-type I'm pretty sure Jaguar told
its chief designer don't worry about
demographics price or anything other
than coming up with the best thing car
you and sports cars like art should be
kind of impractical and this Jaguar
f-type certainly is it's only got two
seats so the rear seats here we do have
a little bit of cargo space but it's
just enough to hold about $100 with the
groceries from Whole Foods and this
f-type S Coupe has more power than it
reasonably needs under the hood we've
got a three liter v6 engine supercharged
that means a blower pushing air into the
cylinders they get 380 horsepower 39
pound-feet of torque now you might think
a man transmission is a pretty simple
thing it's just a box full of gears you
use the shifter to select the right one
for your driving situation and mood but
this one's kind of special tag your
describes it as a semi dry sump so that
means a pump that's phrase oil on the
gears just when it needs it that helps
reduce friction this thing has really
short throws and it pops the end each
year really neatly it's really easy to
row through all six gears getting the
precise one you want
nice link manual driving enthusiasts
will like this but I really love about
this car is the handling I took it over
an undulating curvy road and I'm just
amazing how well the car handled it the
choke flat rotation on the corners and
it just damped out those bumps and just
forgot about the media with the f-type
coupe you get an adaptive suspension
standard so I push this little checkered
flag button on the console and that
cycles between comfort and dynamic modes
although the f-type coupe is an amazing
sports car it also comes with a little
bit of a practical side the standard is
this infotainment system in the dash
this touchscreen the navigation system
looks pretty good it includes traffic
information and routes around traffic
jams I like that but what I don't really
see here is an online destination
feature in the destination options and
it should have that especially at this
price point things get interesting with
the app integration I've actually got my
iphone cable to the cars USB port
running the in-control apps and that
actually enables up to the few different
third-party apps on the screen here
music in this car plays through a
standard Meridian audio system that's
770 watts 12 speakers that's such a big
sound system for this small cab and I
absolutely love it it sounds fantastic
now the bad news the Jaguar f-type coupe
maybe one of the smaller cars in
Jagger's lineup but it is not cheap the
f-type s cube goes for seventy eight
thousand two hundred ninety five dollars
base remember you're saving fifteen
hundred dollars by getting the manual
this example here has a few options that
bring the total to ninety five thousand
five hundred ninety five dollars the
Jaguar f-type coupe is such a beautiful
car that I think it's an instant classic
I can't really decide whether I like the
handling or the looks better
taking that manual transmission means
0.4 seconds slower to sixty miles per
hour
than with the automatic but I can live
with that mandrel transmission gives an
engagement to the driving experience
that's perfect for the dagger legacy and
perfect for the f-type coupe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
