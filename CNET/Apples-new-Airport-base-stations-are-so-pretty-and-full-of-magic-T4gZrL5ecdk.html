news
finally Apple have just opened this huge
can of magic on the 802 playing in a C
or a C for short Wi-Fi standard you know
the one that gives you the speed up to
1.3 gigabit per second on my left here
is the own new Airport Extreme Base
Station and on my right is the old new
time capsule you know what let me do a
trick there you go
I just switch them around without moving
them arrow now I could do that because
these two here are basically identical
the only difference is that the time
capsule comes with internal storage and
the Apple extreme doesn't that means
without the boxes here you have no idea
which one is which really but don't
worry you have this very clever way of
making sure that you do well the price
now the Apple extreme here cost $1.99
one of the most expensive home router on
the market and the time capsule out does
that be costing $2.99 or 399 depending
on the storage need to table by or
three-tier by now if you pay that much
I'm sure you know which one is which
really unless of course if you had them
both like me we in that case you don't
care it's just money you know now what
do you get for the money a lot first of
all these two are two dual band Wi-Fi
routers meaning they support all
existing Wi-Fi Kleinert market
regardless of their standard or
platforms the time capsule here can also
be used for a Time Machine backup
wirelessly and also for data sharing on
the back both of them come with three
LAN ports and one one port all of them a
gigabit and there's also an USB 2.0 here
to host another SOI device or I printer
now for the first time these two devices
come in exactly shape and size now Apple
coned is the top-down approach to design
adequately bottom-up either way it's
just really beautiful take a look at the
previous design like this one here this
is the O Apple extreme as you can see is
kind of square ease Y and
short now the new one here is thinner
actually very thin up to 75% smaller
footprint and take a look at the time
capsule here actually is barely really
barely larger than the internal drive it
has on the inside as you can see here
it's amazing really now the new designs
also a lot taller or longer if you want
to use this this way up to six point six
install generally I believe that thinner
taller and longer are very attractive
just look at me despite the new design
these devices are still very easy to you
Apple make sure that this is a case by
offering the airport utility as the only
way to set up and manage these routers
you can use a computer or an iOS device
to manage your network another reason
why is is to you because that's not much
for to change or customize as these
offer less feature and option than other
similar products now about the
performance in my testing the actually
work very well but since when have you
decided to buy an Apple product because
of its performance exactly for more
performance check out the food reviews
calm in the end in failure cell rush to
the store to buy one of these pretty
fast even if that means you have to take
out a second mortgage on your home
probably no judging I did that too I got
this both but I did pay with castor and
that's only because I'm don't know and
this has been the first look at the all
new airport base stations from Apple
your Wi-Fi and possibly your life will
never be the same okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
