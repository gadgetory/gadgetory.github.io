I'm Dan Ackerman so Dan you're here to
talk to us about some of the newest
laptops that have hit the market in 2018
let's start with her the big kahuna
because it's Apple so Apple bit of a
surprise came out with a new version of
the MacBook Pro with the touch bar
earlier this month tell us a little bit
about it yeah it's always interesting
when Apple says hey we got something new
we want to tell everybody about oh what
could it be
it turned out it was a set of updates to
the MacBook Pro the super expensive
laptop 13 inch 15 inch the touch bar
models this is the 13 you can give it at
the touch bar but they didn't touch that
one on the outside exactly the same as
it's been since late 2016 actually have
it right here let's show it off oh you
could look at any man 2 years and
frankly it'll it'll look exactly the
same but almost everything inside has
been subtly updated so if you've been
holding off on getting one of these new
designs cuz you're waiting for newer
parts well here you go here's some stuff
if you have one that looks like this
from late 2016 on I don't know if it's
really worth you know upgrading the
biggest change is you can get a core I 9
processor from Intel now so that's new
that's what I wanted to ask you so with
the with the faster processor you've
obviously used the previous versions and
this one is their notable differences
well if I'm a regular you sure well
these are not aimed at regular users
there they're really trying to appeal to
that creative professional Video Editor
the photo person the designer stuff like
that they had a bunch of people who like
to use these in real life standing
around for
you know people to talk to on on behalf
of Apple and somebody was a music video
director and somebody was a scientist
who did like 3d modeling of like cells
and stuff so is this really sort of
intense intense stuff in our initial
test this core I 9 version right here
was much faster than the core i7 version
from last year but some people are also
reporting issues with very heavy video
workloads on the kora 9 version causing
the chip to become too
hot therefore the clock speed on the CPU
throttles down which slows your
performance this is something that just
started popping up last week we're
looking into it we're gonna do some more
intense testing and and we're gonna see
what's up with that let's talk about the
keyboard I'm mostly the same they said
oh it's a little quieter I'm like so you
didn't do anything to change the fact
that people get dust and debris in this
super tight keyboard and and and the
keys get stopped no we didn't do
anything to change that
turns out it's it seems like they
probably did and I just didn't want to
talk about it to acknowledge the fact
that there's an issue
under this keyboard there's a little
rubber membrane now over the butterfly
mechanism that goes like when you press
the key that's supposed to keep stuff
out I offered to do a a cookie crumble
test over the keyboard but that was uh
probably not that's probably not the
best idea
mmm number one I don't need any more
cookies in my life and well we'll keep
looking working with this and we'll see
what happens I've had stuck keys on
these new style Mac books a couple of
times over the last few years I've never
had one that became unusable because of
it usually I was able to fix it using
our CNET how-to methodology for how to
unstick a macbook keyboard which
involves turning it upside down on a
certain angle you think your fingernail
to get in there on the key there's a
couple of you can just google like how
to unstick a macbook key from seeing so
much for this so i also with the short
time we have i also wanted to get to
another laptop that you brought with you
oh yeah Acer swift 7 this is one of the
thinnest if they claimed to disallow
this laptop so I always like you from
that 8.0 there's probably some that are
eight point nine nine millimeters and
some that are nine but you know that
it's right into your refractions of a
millimeter difference but very thin
eight point nine eight millimeters
fourteen inch screen usually in the
super thin ones you have a 12 or 13 inch
screen so I like that it's so big screen
wise and we're testing this right now so
far I'm liking it a lot nice it's it's
not cheap $16.99 less than a MacBook Pro
though well unfortunately we're out of
time so if you want to read more about
these stories check us out on CNN I'm
Ben Fox Ruben and
I'm Dan Ackerman thank you very much for
listening
before you get before you get to the
show notes yeah we got to thank you for
joining this is a show note for thee cuz
I want to hear the streamer audience
weigh in on this okay go ahead go ahead
so we got four minutes and in those four
minutes we have a grand total of four
name announcement you say your name I
say my name the end you say your name I
say my name in four minutes I feel like
we could we could reclaim a couple
seconds of conversation that's it listen
you say that because you were the one
that suggested we get rid of the like
the tag in the beginning it used to be
that when we first started the podcast
we said well what was what was the
little like fun jingle that we said no I
don't know other than the 3:59 we were
talking about the top tech news of the
day and all the other crap you want to
write and you down to 340 right exactly
I got a lot of tables and it was doing a
lot of sales we got three names this
this criticism coming from the guy who
decided to stage his name introduction
today like Jimmy Stewart yeah I'm always
caught unaware as the guest I I always I
always have expect Ben or whoever to
introduce drew it's true and then when
he throws out to me I'm like oh I'm
supposed to say it myself and Mike okay
okay this is so we're done with the show
notes for now it's getting a little too
meta one of the questions that I wanted
to get to that we didn't have time for
in the podcast wise what is the point of
such a thin laptop like are you gaining
something as a user for that and in
addition to that question connected to
it
are you losing something from having
such a thin laptop is it is it flimsier
I said is it more likely to break the
main benefit is if you are in the laptop
business or the laptop PR business
you're able to write a press release
that says the very top world thinnest
laptop that seems to be the main the
main point there that you can say you've
got it okay so in that regard do you
think that this thing could I don't know
get crushed more easily or something
yeah it seems pretty sturdy I'm just
worried about it I will say I kind of
even though I'm making fun of it I kind
of like it
but our our friend Laurie Gruden who
works with me on the PC
has wisely pointed out that in the
battle between thin and light
you should really opt for light so this
is not the lightest laptop it is the
thinnest you'd almost rather walk around
with the lightest that's interesting
that you say that because I just assumed
that when you have a thinner laptop it's
lighter but you're right this thing is
mostly metal mm-hmm so it's pretty heft
and we've seen some very light ones made
out of different alloys combinations of
different materials a lot of carbon
fiber a lot of yeah yeah that get down
to like two pounds and change this is I
think two point six maybe maybe 2.5 2.6
you can definitely shave a quarter pound
you know we're more off that the
lightest I think we've ever seen is like
1.9 pounds but it wasn't a great machine
okay one other question and then we'll
we'll open it up to the Q&amp;amp;A do you
anticipate any other MacBook line
announcements for later this year I mean
probably they usually go through once a
year and give everything a little spec
bump they did it last year so they may
do it later this year we still got the
let's see what isn't up and changed in a
while you've got the MacBook Air which
is somehow still alive it got the
tiniest tiniest tiniest change from one
old CPU to a slightly better of still
old CPU last year and that's edge
everyone everyone says oh they're gonna
have a whole new MacBook Air or
something to replace that it's gonna be
great I think that's yours I think yeah
I've heard that for years - I think
that's a lot of pie-in-the-sky wishful
thinking but it certainly could happen
and if it does it'll be very exciting
and every one Rako I got to get bad
obviously the 12-inch MacBook hasn't
gotten an update this year the Mac Mini
has not been updated in many years
people still like that though it's the
cheapest way to get Mac OS 500 bucks for
a Mac Mini a lot of people like those
iMac they just had the iMac Pro in
December of last year so maybe an iMac
update and I think that's the whole line
yeah good all right let's jump into
questions okay I think first and
foremost we were talking about the build
quality of this laptop the Acer we
should go back to the conversation we
had last week about what appropriate
tech you could use to plug in an
intruder ooh what like
what scenario do you think that the Acer
Swift 7 could be useful for I'm thinking
like maybe gaming a shallow grave
digging the shallow grave of the
intruder that you may that would that
would definitely hurt yeah I thought
maybe it would snap right into but no
actually it's actually it's pretty cell
you know why could it Scott even though
it's very thin it has a very large
battery inside and the batteries tend to
be very dense and heavy but because you
want to have good battery life even in
the new MacBooks even though the body
shape is the same this is really the
best murdering laptop out there first of
all I mean we quote you on that so a
bigger battery in here they squeezed a
little bit more physical battery into
this same sized compartment to make up
for the fact that the new processors
draw more power right and the quieter
keyboard makes it easier to get away
with legend your victim and get away
with it they'll never hear you typing
those are the important details here
coming from CNET in a related note and
Sanjay says if you sit in lava
the MacBook problems might start to
mitigate I thought that would be kind of
relevant to the discussion about lava if
you sit in lava well then your then you
probably have more heat problems not
less I saw somebody on a YouTube video
put there a new MacBook in a freezer
that's right and they got better
performance out of it cooling is always
issue you hit a thermal that is what I
think Craig federighi said a couple of
years ago about the Mac Pro which was
the trashcan cylinder a computer where
it was not upgradable enough it wasn't
powerful enough and you couldn't like do
anything to fix it because it was packed
into such a compact space that I think
it was ready to read he said Apple had
backed themselves into a thermal corner
which is why in the PC lab you guys
always have those giant gaming towers
that have internal cooling systems and
they learn really cool well that's also
why we have our own separate climate
system in that lab we have a giant
separate air conditioning system runs a
little thick because we're running all
this big hardware and there all the time
we want to keep the temperature down to
a reasonable degree but I used to review
many years ago laptop cooling pads
everyone made these little lap desks
like fans built in and stuff oh yeah
yeah I haven't seen one in a long time
but for
people were making those and we reviewed
them and we got a temperature gun which
I still have and we take like five
points of temperature along the back and
some of these got very hot
we reviewed an ace are a different Acer
eh a gaming laptop I think last year and
it had a glass panel on the front above
the keyboard that also doubled as the
touchpad it moved the touchpad above the
keyboard and me to the glass panel off
all all that aside the glass panel got
very I think it got up like 117 degrees
and you're supposed to put your finger
on it and and move then move the cursor
around with it so you if you ever want
to go into hiding you can use that to
burn your fingerprints off also for
those looking for a budget solution with
these high-end cooling systems just dip
your laptop in ice water it'll take care
of the problem and you won't have to
worry about your laptop problems will be
solved that's right alright we got a ton
of questions filing in Michael Brown is
just bogarted the chat as we should have
expected today good to see you sir
question number one who do you think
these MacBook Pros are priced and
performed for would it make sense for an
average user to buy these new MacBook
Pros their price for people with expense
accounts or big companies who are
willing to buy you anything you want so
you keep cranking out videos zing ya
know there's I mean that's why they call
them the pros cuz they're not for
everybody if you're a regular user get
up I mean I guess getting there people
still like those used to like your air
this is for work actually I have a
MacBook Pro at home okay it's damn near
ten years old and it's still me and rich
- just for the record we were just
talking about this before we got started
like mine's from 2012 or something and I
think rich citizen from 2011 yeah I mean
the good thing and and it's worth
thinking about from from a budget
perspective that on at least for me my
MacBook Pro lasted a long time so is it
worthwhile to buy something that is
above and beyond what you actually need
and there's everyone always says that
you should definitely future proof you
know future proof your purchase a little
bit mm-hmm so in I I would say maybe
thinking about that from your
perspective Michael but there's also a
lot that you can see is like a best I
mean the 13-inch Pro without the touch
bars like $12.99 that's a pretty good
deal of what
yet look and I would nice and Sheen but
I love the 12-inch MacBook even though
some people don't it's so small it's so
light I carry it around everywhere it's
definitely my favorite laptop of the
last couple years a controversial choice
I know but I stand by it
a man of conviction Dan Ackerman here on
the 359 plot never convicted just I like
this observation from Matthew - or the
pendulum swings we haven't needed a
laptop cooler in years and now we
suddenly need them again do we think
this is gonna open up kind of a new
market for cooling systems portable
cooling systems or devices or whatever
the hell really falls out of it awful I
mean they just got to get these thermals
under control nothing dies anymore
nothing nothing goes away forever so it
is entirely possible that these are
gonna come back I mean they put too much
processor into a laptop body that was
you know too small without adequate
venting you have liquid cooling though
you're gonna active heat pipes there's a
lot of things you could do and a lot of
these gaming laptops are very thin now
and managed to stay cool like the Asus
zephyrus when you open the lid up the
whole back of the laptop lifts up and
opens like a big fan vent in the back so
like that's really clever the other
thing to consider though is is that if
you could figure out a way to make the
laptop keyboard double as something that
you could cook an egg on then you solve
you solve the problem you know some of
them have vents to actually send up heat
through the keys mm-hmm there's a lot of
I mean cooling is definitely the
thermals behind laptops it's one of the
most complicated bits of engineering
it's something people spend years
working on for a particular system it's
so hard to do right if you get it wrong
people's systems are gonna seize up
they're gonna die they're gonna run slow
that thermal management is incredibly
incredibly important but it responds to
I imagine sure yeah definitely for I
mean you see what happens your phone
gets hot I was I had a 12-inch MacBook I
was in a coffee shop this past weekend
and the Sun was coming through the
window right where I was and the Machine
heated up so much just from that that I
got an on screen Mac OS note saying my
performance had been reduced until the
laptop cools down just from the Sun
coming in and hitting the aluminum body
laptop got almost as hot as it is here
in New York City today hey by the way
Dan are you that jerk who just camps out
at the coffee
doesn't buy coffee III make sure to make
adequate purchase there we go - to fund
my portable office spaces as I call them
good man good man
this seems like a relevant comment to
what we were just talking about even
though there are way more from a few
minutes ago flooding in that we still
need to get to so let's let's let's pick
up the pace
deandre says would you prefer a thicker
laptop and fan cooling or thinner laptop
poorer performance due to throttling I
think there's other options besides that
we're gonna make this a speed round here
we're moving towards I mean people
generally don't need as much processing
power as they think they do and there
are a lot of cool designs now that are
actually totally fanless and work really
well it's just good engineering good
thermal management I think eventually
fans will go away because laptops are
moving more and more towards having no
moving parts as in no hard drives that
platters that spin and basically nothing
of the fewer moving parts you have the
more reliable your laptop is gonna be
long term so that's where you got to go
all right from let's take one from Josh
moita on the acer laptop is the battery
life terrible we are saying right now so
far it seems pretty good that's just
anecdotal I'm gonna be able to get back
to you in a couple days with some with
some real battery scores I think it
helps that it's a larger screen so
there's a larger footprint therefore a
larger superflat battery inside so just
more batteries always the answer make
sure to check see Netcom for the full
details and coming days from Caesar -
toril oh I'm sorry if I'm butchering
your name I'm Caesar
Dan how about the Costco pre-sales
surface go with four gigabyte in 128
gigabyte hard drive and the freetype
cover for $549 thoughts on that pricing
that's interesting yeah well a debts
that doesn't sound like a free type
cover to me if it's 550 bucks cuz
they're gonna sell this thing for 399
and the type covers like 129 to 159
depending on which one you get we
haven't tested the go yet I'm concerned
that the processor in it is too slow
people want something a little bit
better than I think it's a seller on
maybe a Pentium we can check but it's
not a core iSeries processor I'm tiny
guy it does you can you I guess so you
can do write other guys do it so I'm a
little concerned and that's certainly
for 500
50 bucks you can get some very nice
small laptops I'm gonna say the surface
go is a wait-and-see for now especially
with that type cover issue solid answer
here's another one from Michael Brown
does it seem like Apple has a laptop
that's recently released for average
laptop users they would call that two
12-inch MacBook they think that's the
that's the mainstream casual laptop I'd
like I said it's an acquired taste some
people hate it I love it now that people
are used to having USB seaports and used
to those flat Apple keyboards I think
it's a more accessible choice for more
people now and a slightly cheaper option
is obviously the MacBook Air but it's so
out of date it's so completely not been
upgraded in a very long time this bezel
is rather well my biggest problem with
it is the screen resolution which is
like 1440 by 900 right it has retina
insane I haven't gotten it it's not even
full HD IIb I would say weight on a
MacBook Air for now man I'd say let's
see what happens in the fall it's a
tough one you know I always refused to
make a lot of Apple but I feel like
people who are in the Apple
prognostication business or generally
just it's more wishful thinking than
than smart thinking so I generally
refuse to get in on that or if think
Apple is gonna have next week I
generally refuse to answer those
questions cuz unless there's a lot of
leash you don't really know fair enough
from Raheel now I don't know where this
is being sighted from so apologies in
advance for for lack of context but you
says any comment on this quote owners of
those new MacBook Pros are finding that
their computers are having a difficult
time reaching the advertised 2.9
gigahertz and speeds again I don't know
where he's citing this from Dan yeah
that's you the stuff people were talking
about with certain workloads causing it
to get really hot causing the CPU to
throttled down which is something that
happens automatically to keep the heat
within an acceptable envelope that's a
brand new issue we are looking into it
many other people are looking into it
also we will hopefully have something
more to say about that soon but
certainly if you bought the top end core
i9 version of this and it's not
performing the way it's supposed to
that's not cool
that said the basic core i7 version
should be fine that's almost the same as
last year's which was a super great
performer the core 9 is a very expensive
add-on so even those people buying this
new MacBook Pro we're not getting that
ok we're almost out of time let's crank
through just a couple more before we
wrap it up for the day from Jacob
Lombardo this one's just throwing a
little shade but always fun to do that
so Apple continues today to show their
innovation is form over function
Microsoft seems to be much more
adventurous with their surface line is
Microsoft the new leader in innovation
for the foreseeable future I'll be
honest my paranoid nature thought this
was going to be some shade about me fact
that it's not I'm all cool I think
Microsoft is doing very interesting
things but they're not in the hardware
business full-time it's a hobby for them
they make the surface laptop which got
which has the fuzzy keyboard dag they
make the surface studio which is the big
own one that tilts down and obviously
the surfaces will see all the surface go
does I think the pricing and component
mix is not where I would want it to be
but I haven't tested it yet so I'm not
gonna pass judgment that said they're
very creative but a lot of other
companies do very creative stuff too and
and as you pointed it out they to a
certain extent can afford to be more
creative or adventurous because it's not
really the way it's not the core
business that said if you have a MacBook
Pro you're generally putting aside
whatever happened in the last week to
power users they're pretty darn reliable
and everybody loves them and like I said
that 12-inch MacBook is one of my
favorite laptops in the last couple
years from DC 1 4 7 does Dan have any
insights on how the new pros perform for
software development that's a super
specific question it really depends on
what you're doing we did in the very
brief period of time we've had this we
did some basic multitasking tests using
a geek bench using Cinebench and there
this i9 version now performed a similar
i7 from last year that's about as far as
we've gotten on the benchmarking front
yet we we continue but I did talk to
some software developers who who seemed
bullish on it that's nothing new though
we've seen that now voting that's not
that's not a super you know that's not
the kind of thing you need a cry 9 for
one more from my
Brown question number three besides the
display what changes are there for the
touch bar and does it seem like the
touch bar is a good enough note issue
some in touch bar if you didn't use it
before you're not gonna use it now I
happen to think there's like two or
three things it's good at you don't need
them but as long as it's there I use the
touch bar for volume and muting and
brightness and that's 99% of what are
you so the things that were the buttons
before yeah Wow don't kidding oh you
know what the fingerprint logging is
actually pretty good okay pretty log and
that works really well in the new ones
also I think you can get up to a 4
terabyte solid-state hard drive in the
15 up from a 2 terabyte maximum still a
very expensive anton and then they also
doubled it on the 13th yes from one
terabyte to two right you know and a few
other little tweaks here and there but
but still largely the same system
alrighty new CPUs and new storage limits
and that that's the big news open up the
gates final question what laptop this is
coming from hunter what laptop would you
recommend to the average consumer like a
college student or a teacher or even an
accountant mmm-hmm there are a bunch of
good choices if you need now a lot of
people who are in school especially want
a Mac so I would say for those guys
don't get the air it's gonna feel really
old if you're certain college or
something look at the 12-inch MacBook or
the 13-inch non-touch bar probe of those
are $12.99 still expensive but a good
investment for for more budget II stuff
I really like some of the lenovo less
expensive laptops like the flex line
which is like their yoga line and that
the screen goes all the way back but
it's less expensive you can actually get
a dental XPS 13 fairly inexpensively if
you cut some of the extra features like
$8.99 something like that those are some
of the ones I've liked recently we can
look up some more like from from a
perspective of Chromebooks are you a fan
of those at all yeah I think if you can
get away with a Chromebook it's
perfectly fine I like that I like the
slightly fancier ones because they give
you a little more fit and finish and and
they won't get quite as buy-down the
Samsung Chromebook plus and Chromebook
play
Chromebook + and pro our flip sides of
the same thing they just have a
different they just have some different
processor options they're about 500
bucks and then they're pretty good last
question from me on that regard the
MacBook 12 inch
what's the processor on that now because
I remember it used to be it was
important
no core em wasn't mobile it was like
kind of in the middle was Intel's
attempt to make a chip that was super
power efficient for fancy high-end
machines now it's a core I maybe i3 and
i-5 but it's basically a renamed version
of the next gen core M so it's the same
type of chip renamed in a new generation
but actually performs better and I do
not have the same qualms with the second
and third generation 12-inch MacBook as
I did but the first one which was a
little performance let me did these new
ones are actually fine for fret for
everyday use that was a packed show
fantastic Q&amp;amp;A everybody thank you so
much for very much thanks everybody for
the questions and I wish we had never
listened to anybody's laptop questions
just tweet at me at the in Ackerman
there you go I'm always here for you
yeah and that does it for us we are out
of time
we'll be back tomorrow same bat-time
same bat-channel Ben you want to go
