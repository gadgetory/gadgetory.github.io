lawn care mowing the yard sucks
it takes a lot of time and energy and
here in the Ohio Valley high
temperatures and even higher humidity
make mowing the yard a chore a company
called robo-moe aims to make cutting
your yard a little bit easier with its
line of battery-powered connected robot
lawn mowers I've spent the past few
weeks
testing the robo-moe RS 612 and I'm not
gonna lie it's made cutting the grass
super simple but you still have to pitch
in every now and then and the product it
isn't perfect to get started with the
Robo mode you have to install perimeter
wire around your lawn so tell the
robo-moe where it can and cannot cut
then it needs to charge in its space
station before it can get to work
cutting your lawn the robo-moe works
best as a lawn maintainer especially
when it's an automatic operation mode
but you can change the settings in the
Robo most connected app which uses
bluetooth to control the robot month you
can also use the app to remote control
the Robo mode which is great if you have
areas of grass that just need a little
cut but you don't want to set up a whole
perimeter wire around it and the Robo
mode is really responsive to the apps
directions when you tell it to move back
and forth and left-to-right however it's
not all sitting back and lounging with
the robo-moe you still have to put in a
little work you still need a weed
whacker to get the edges of your yard
and spots that are close to your house
or other big obtrusive obstacles and
because you can't use a hose or a power
washer to clean the undercarriage of the
robo-moe you still have to keep a stick
handy to clear the debris and cut grass
from the Robo mows wheels and blades
and the app so it's really cool when
it's in range doesn't work if the
robo-moe is too far away
overall the robo-moe is a good product
that does exactly what it says but I
can't ignore the fact that it costs
sixteen hundred dollars to get some
automatic brass cutting especially when
you can hire somebody for a lot less
than that but if you want to cut out the
middleman and relax a little bit more
during the summer start saving up your
money for a robo-moe of your home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
