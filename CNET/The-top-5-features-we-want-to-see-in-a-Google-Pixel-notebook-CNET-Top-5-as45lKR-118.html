in a Google pixel notebook reports say
Google is working on a new Chromebook
and it will carry the pixel branding if
Google really is working on a laptop it
needs these features to be great at
number five a stylus think about the
surface or the Samsung Chromebook pro
both work with styli a Google pixel
notebook could have the same feature so
you can scribble on the screen when it's
in tablet mode which gets us to number
four number four is some kind of tablet
mode the Samsung Chromebook pro has a
hinge and then let you fold the screen
all the way back so you can use it as a
tablet but Google doesn't have to follow
that model if it doesn't want to maybe
it can rip off Microsoft Surface book
where the screen can be removed from the
keyboard base either way a tablet mode
would be great on a pixel Chromebook at
number three is a super high res screen
the pixel is a premium brand so Google
better not stick a paltry 1080p screen
in there the pixel C is a pretty good
start with is 2560 by 1800 resolution
plus Android apps would look great on a
high res screen which brings us to
number two at number two is really good
Google Play integration a number of
Chromebooks can access the Google Play
Store to download Android apps however
not every app works on these notebooks
who better than Google to figure out how
to make a laptop that can fully take
advantage of all of those Android apps
and the number one feature we want out
of a google pixel notebook is a
reasonable price do you remember the
original Chromebook pixel it started at
$1,300 for a Chromebook that was insane
don't even think about hitting $1000
Google unless it comes with a free pixel
to phone or something thanks to CNET's
