it's got some cool new features we'll
take a look at today i'm jason parker
for cnet and this is a first look at Mac
os10 Yosemite the latest version of
Apple's desktop and laptop operating
system comes with a whole new look
sporting flatter icons a new font and
new design elements across all the major
apps you'll notice right away for
example that Safari has a much thinner
menu bar but all the apps try to keep
the interface to a minimum so the focus
is on the content as far as features are
concerned spotlight gets a major
overhaul in Yosemite with more info at
your fingertips when you do a search as
well as web results right within the
spotlight window now you'll be able to
search for locations and restaurants and
get results near you along with
directions from Apple maps and even the
ability to call directly from your mac
via handoff features speaking of hand
off apple's new continuity features make
your mobile and desktop devices work
together along with being able to work
on one device then switch to another to
keep working you'll also be able to
answer calls on your Mac as long as your
iphone and mac are on the same Wi-Fi and
logged in with the same Apple ID you'll
get a notification for an incoming call
in the upper right and you can answer
right from your Mac next notifications
just like in Mavericks you can do a
two-finger swipe from the right edge of
your trackpad to open up the
notifications sidebar here you'll see
the new today view that gives you a
quick rundown of what's next on your
schedule but you also can add widgets
click the edit button at the bottom
you'll be able to add default widgets
such as stocks weather and a world clock
there's not much offered now but expect
to see tons of third-party options as
more people are using and developing for
Yosemite the mail app also got some
useful upgrades in Yosemite new markup
features let you quickly make notes or
Corrections on a document or you can
call out something in a photo use arrows
and other graphics to mark up the
attachment mail also gets mail drop
letting you send files up to 5 gigabytes
for free bypassing ISP file size limits
by using iCloud to temporarily store the
file next msgs new features in the main
Mac chat app make it easy to manage
group conversations
you can give a title to a group chat so
it's easy to remember and you can add
new members to your conversations on the
fly probably the best feature is that
you can remove yourself from a group
chat when you get busy or the replies
are starting to pile up there's a lot
more that's new in Yosemite there's not
enough time to show it all here check

cnet for the full rundown of all the
major new features i'm jason parker for
