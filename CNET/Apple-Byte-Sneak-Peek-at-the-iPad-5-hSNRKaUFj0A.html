pie for all the good and bad inside the
world of apple i'm brian Tong your
friendly Asian skunk who smells a whole
lot better now let's get to the show and
we kick things off get it because of
Super Bowl weekend well alright well the
latest story is the first unconfirmed
pictures from nine to five Mac of what's
believed to be the rear shell of the
next gen ipad 5 the photos do match up
with the initial reports from ilounge of
its dimensions and iPad Mini esque
beveled edge design that we've been
expecting now one reader even overlaid
the purported photos on top of a current
full-size iPad to show the difference in
size thanks to the rumored slimmer
vessels around the screen October is
still the current target for the next
release but that could obviously change
but you guys want some real official
apple juice well the big a has announced
that the 128 gig ipad 4 with Retina
display will be available for sale on
februari the fifth starting at seven
ninety-nine for the Wi-Fi version and
929 for the cellular version now i'm all
for more options and this storage sets a
new bar for competing tablets to step up
their game but now we're seeing
incremental upgrades with the ipad new
then six months later to the ipad 4 and
now this new 128 gig model that we're
calling the ipad new new new and then
the ipad new new new new that's coming
in october so it's just getting a little
out of hand now I lounges latest report
claims the rumored low-cost iPhone will
be a mix of the iphone 5 and the ipod
touch with ipod classic curves basically
it will look like an apple design device
now they say it will be primarily
constructed out of plastic with the
device reportedly half a millimeter
taller and wider but also one millimeter
thicker and that's just way too big of a
phone the report also says the sides and
the rear we'll all be flat and connected
by distinct curves so we'll see all
right let's get back to reality and new
schematics of what appeared to be the
next gen apple TV showed the device
being half
centimeter smaller in a US regulatory
filing but slow your roll Apple has said
it had to file new paperwork with the
FCC following the change of one of its
internal components that would not
affect any of the product features the
component in question appears to be an
updated a5x processor and an updated
internal antenna according to an antec
but this will not be a brand new Apple
TV all right let's take a quick break to
show you two after the week this week
it's all about the new social app vine
and the game Temple Run 2 now Temple Run
2 is the sequel to get this temple run
it brings new graphics new environments
new obstacles like this sweet sliding
rope more power-ups and a bigger monkey
seriously now the best thing about it is
that it's free now our other app vine is
a new free social app that lets you
create sharp looping six-second videos
and share them on your social networks
just hold on the screen to record
segments of video to create your
masterpiece see we even made this one of
the entire apple byte staff that just
loves working here you know it's really
great to be part of a committed team so
make sure you check out those apps now
Apple will finally have a new fruity
rival after Rim the company behind the
blackberry phone officially change their
name to can you guys guess it blackberry
now they launched their new phone called
the z10 which is BlackBerry's next-gen
all-new 4.2 inch touchscreen phone it's
a solid first entry in something
blackberry fans will be happy about but
it doesn't really do anything different
that stands out enough to make someone
switch over to a blackberry phone at the
moment in this very competitive market
now the berry Boyz also announced the
q10 which still retains the classic
tactile keyboard and a smaller 3 inch
touchscreen but it's expected arrive
later sometime in April all right guys
let's get to the quick bytes and then
over the air update for iOS 6.1 is here
if you haven't done it already
improvements include the ability to now
purchase movie tickets with the help of
Siri through fandango it brings new LTE
carrier support internationally and you
also might notice a revamped look to the
player controls when you're using them
with your
a lot also the big a recently fired one
of their China basin labor suppliers
after an audit found 74 underage workers
at one company apple reported it in
their latest supplier responsibility
report showing that they're actually
making changes with their manufacturing
relationships also the Steve Jobs biopic
starring Ashton Kutcher was shown off at
the Sundance festival this past week two
very lukewarm and middle of the road
reviews our own Casey noon saw the film
and said it fell flat with the viewers
spending two hours watching cardboard
cutouts losing arguments to Kutcher even
if you were developing this for freaks
like us and I doubt you are nobody wants
to buy a computer nobody how does
somebody know what they want if they've
never even seen it now I'm still willing
to give it a try even though the teaser
clip didn't really give me anything to
get excited about but online reactions
ranged from he's no Noah Wyle to dude
where's my ipad now Kutcher was so
committed to the role that he decided to
try going on the SJ all fruit diet but
it landed him in the hospital and he
said his pancreas levels were completely
out of whack you know it might have been
a sign that no one can pretend to be
Steve Jobs all right guys now we asked
you about siri last week and a lot of
you said you still talk to her thomas
miller says I use Siri regularly to set
reminders calendar events timers make
calls and do quick math problems Thomas
17 times 5 minus 2 plus 60 equals 1 for

try I really try to use Siri but it's
not worth it it's awkward in most
environments and Eduardo Lopez rights in
with I only use Siri when my friends are
busy so I talked to her so she's your
friend alright guys that's going to do
