headphone and you may be wondering
what's different about it from the
earlier around gear one so I'm going to
show you the biggest changes to the
headband it's about twice as wide and
the headphone feels sturdier overall the
ear cups have also been redesigned to
match the noise canceling and wireless
models in boses around-ear lineup and
this model comes in black and the navy
blue you see here you can also choose
between a version that has an inline
remote designed to work with Apple iOS
devices and another that's fully
compatible with Android devices those
headphones have always been known for
their comfort and this model is no
exception
while it weighs about an ounce more than
the around-ear one it's still
lightweight at 6.4 ounces or 181 grams
and has nicely padded ear cups it's not
an active noise-cancelling headphone but
the ear cups do passively seal out a lot
of noise though they will steam up your
ears on hot days this new model sounds
similar to the old model but I thought
the bass was a little tighter perhaps
due to the design changes overall this
is a pretty accurate well-balanced
headphone that offers good detail but
not a ton of bass so it faces your thing
this probably isn't going to cut it but
it's a smooth sounding headphone that's
designed to work well with a wide range
of music types and $180 the round ear
too isn't cheap but it's a very likeable
comfortable headphone that can be worn
for long stretches I'm David car noise
