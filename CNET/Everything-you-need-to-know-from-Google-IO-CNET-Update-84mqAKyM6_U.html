living room in your car and even in the
middle of your text messages with
friends here's a quick summary of the
biggest news google announced at its
annual io developers conference first up
google has created its own smart speaker
for the home that answers voice commands
it's called google home and although
there was no price announced it is
coming later this year this smart home
hub directly competes with Amazon's echo
smart speaker the Google home looks
snazzy with no buttons and the design is
customizable with different colors but
you're putting Google in your living
room so will people be concerned with
privacy amazon has seen success with its
echo since it launched in 2014 and it
already works with many outside products
and apps but Google could pull ahead by
connecting two popular apps like it's
calendar it also streams music to
multiple speakers with chromecast Audio
and it could talk to other nest homes
smart devices because don't forget
google owns nest google is also working
to boost the smarts of it's
voice-activated digital assistant google
wants to jump into the chat bot game
alongside Microsoft and Facebook and to
start it's launching a new instant
messaging app that puts the search
engine inside of your chats it's called
ello and if you're not creeped out by
having Google watch over your
conversations it will suggest what you
should say next by trying to recognize
what is being talked about there's
another app called google duo it's a
calling app it lets you see a video feed
of who is calling before you pick up
it's like a digital peephole before
answering the door yeah there's no way
that could go wrong or be awkward google
also talked about new features coming to
android soon there are some small perks
like being able to work on too upset
once in split-screen mode or reply to
text directly from a notification it's
code name is Android n and the end it
will stand for whatever fans want it to
be Google is running a contest for
people to suggest what sweet treat name
the end will represent could it be nut
brittle nectar or Neapolitan ice cream
go to android com / and to submit your
idea the next version of android also is
adding new features to work inside of a
car dashboard so your
car could run android apps without being
connected to a phone and that means we
can see Google's assistant inside the
car in new updated ways of course
virtual reality is a big area of growth
so to encourage more VR headsets Google
created this software and hardware
platform called daydream it's not a
physical headset but instead it's a
blueprint for other companies to make
better VR headsets just like what Google
did to encourage others to make Android
phones this is the same concept but for
VR that's it for this tech news update
