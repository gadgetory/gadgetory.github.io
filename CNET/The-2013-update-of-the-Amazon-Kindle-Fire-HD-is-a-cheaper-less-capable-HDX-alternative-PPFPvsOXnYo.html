Kindle Fire HD it's essentially a less
powerful version of the fire HDX the HD
ditches the camera and microphones it's
a little bit thicker larger and slightly
heavier other than that is pretty much
the same tablet from a design
perspective there's a headphone jack and
a micro USB port and just as with the
HDX the power button and volume button
are seated on the back of the tablet it
still takes some getting used to did I
say some getting used to well actually I
meant a lot it's pretty awkward
internally however there are plenty of
differences the HD features a lower 1280
x 800 resolution screen and a slower
processor thankfully it ships with the
latest version of the fire OS and a new
more sensible interface web performance
is a huge improvement over last year
sites load quickly and there's smoother
navigation however Riptide gp2 struggles
to even low in the timely manner and
doesn't respond well to turning on
additional graphical effects if you keep
things simple though it runs just fine
the fire HD starts at one hundred and
thirty nine dollars for eight gigabytes
of storage there's also a 16 gigabyte
version for thirty dollars more I
recommend you get the more expensive one
hundred and sixty nine dollar version a
gigabytes is just too little space to
store your apps and media especially
when that eight gigabytes is actually
only about five gigabytes or less of
real space still if you're only planning
to stream movies and TV shows one
hundred and forty dollars is a pretty
great price for a portable streaming box
that is if you can always ensure you
have constant Wi-Fi access check out my
full review for more details i'm eric
franklin and this has been a first look
at the amazon kindle fire HD
