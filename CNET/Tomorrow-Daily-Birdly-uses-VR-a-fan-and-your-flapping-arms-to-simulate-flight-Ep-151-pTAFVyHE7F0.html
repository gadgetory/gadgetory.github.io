reality set up that makes you fly like a
bird and the Transformers finally here
yes they're in China though but so
lookit we'll get to that oh okay and
Boeing patents something that looks
mysteriously like a force field exciting
tomorrow daily
greetings citizen to the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe Rios
Ashley skeletron me as always
uppercutting the sky kill anonymous so
that was a slum 125 hired 20 FPS that
was on a gopro yeah it's really good but
yeah so I you did you get a chance to
play any video games lately I know is
I've been playing final fantasy 14 a lot
still um look out Louisville I got an
axe like a bug power leveling right now
sounds like trivia crack add me as I'd
so boys we're about to all start playing
trivia crack together and we're late to
the game super whatever runs late to
that game but that's it's fine uh we
have some I'm a story this first story
is so exciting that you might you're
gonna freak out so you haven't seen the
video for it so let's hit headlines okay
so we talked about handy at South by
Southwest the hand I was powered by the
smartphone okay I thought that was my
favorite thing coming out of South by
Southwest oh how wrong I was because I
saw today birdly and we're gonna talk
about birdly because it is an oculus
rift which you know okay fine gives you
an experience of like being a bird no
this is an entire machine that you get
in and you put your hands on these
little slats at the end of the wings and
you flap them like a bird and there's a
fan in the front that blows air onto
your face Kayla you're missing it look
please look at this amazing machine your
it's gonna be I'm gonna buy you this for
Christmas this is what I'm gonna do so
this was at South by Southwest oddly
enough in front of the Google Fiber
booth is little fiber like I don't know
what this has to do I mean maybe fast
internet like a bird like I'm not really
sure what that correlation was but this
is from the Institute for design
research at the zurich University of the
Arts and again use this oculus rift
sonic feedback a fan and a rig that
mitla hey you lay face down in it you
have your oculus rift on and your arms
are extended you have to flap your your
wings Oh physically yeah if you look
around you can even see your wings yeah
you can see the wing
and stuff so that's what it looks like
it looks insane it looks totally insane
it looks like something crazy that your
grandpa built in the garage and it's
like a girl come see this black in
contraption i made like but with virtual
reality it's like amazing it looks so
fun do you want one i kind of want one
no really good exercise I'll tell you
what I'll tell you what this would be
really cool if they build in like some
sort of superhero simulator that's our
imagined like you're like your ships man
and then there's like little buttons you
can sign man you're like flying we're on
man um yeah the bird element is kind of
weird well I'm sure that's like that
sort of straightforward easy kind of
accessible did anybody that you know in
the articles try it and they were like
no you may look dumb but it's really
cool so we have footage of somebody who
was at South by using it and they say
that footage this is not ours not ours
okay uh but the woman inside this kit
like seemed to really enjoy it she's
like wow she was pretty excited all
right and there was a guy to I think
that didn't he enjoyed it as well so I'd
like they seem to be very fascinated you
know all right so it's a different way
of using google maps totally kind of
look remember fly over the place see
your house you pick what barbecue you're
gonna write and then you swoop down and
you steal it and then you fly away
that's it that's an incredible that's an
incredible leap in virtual reality while
the bird was just an interesting could a
weird application though I wouldn't have
thought of but now that I see it it
seems so obvious yeah that's what it is
it's again it'd be really cool if it was
like a superhero thing but yeah and I
guess now you can you can really make
that joke like I just flew in from
whatever wherever and boy my arms are
tired cuz your arms will actually be
tired and that was the worst joke that's
the worst guys that's the low point of
the show I promise okay girl tell me
about transformers okay so you know
everybody loves transformers dad they do
right well no more than this man in
China okay who decided I'm he's just
gonna start making transformers and he's
using he's basically using used car
parts and stuff to make these these uh
transformers because you know
transformers are made as you do there
are parts yeah oh my God look how big
that one is yes so these
these are gigantic it's like a 20 foot
tall transformer holy crap yeah so he
uses scrap parts from a bus and Carson
make these transformer models the first
model he made took three years to finish
Wow so it was the labor of love but now
he's actually selling them profitably
sold um what where do i send a check
okay so he's making over 1 million what
is this you you want oh yeah you want
chinese yeah sorry every year now and
yeah they're gigantic so they're
actually making a profit what started
out is kind of like a hobby is now like
a business for these guys he's not a
Chinese farmer anymore yeah transformers
was the biggest movie in China ever so
it's like it's the biggest Wow the
biggest like grossing movie in China
yeah that's I mean because quite it was
actually it took place in China and was
like one of the most recent one was the
transformers 4 interesting with Mark
Wahlberg so yeah there you go wobble
what so that the big giant transformers
I mean they don't transform down into
like a car I don't know what the scale
is unbelievable giant statue it's like
having it it's like that city in Japan
that has a 150 foot Gundam like in front
of the city it doesn't do anything yeah
there yeah it's incredible I've
distorting your house so there you go if
you want one of them you can contact him
I don't have to contact information will
have the show with old notes trainee
China transformer builder builder sure
you'll find it yeah thank our builder
ma'am that's pretty cool it's just it's
just cool to see people love that craft
engines oh so that's making money all
right hash tag of the itd junk TD junk
what would you if you had a bunch of
scrap parts and you can build anything
let's say we actually had any kind of
building knowledge we could make
something cuz i have legos okay all
right let's say you make anything what
would you make I'd make an asshole from
water world's oh I would I would I would
make a little water world village in the
middle of the ocean holiday and just by
myself because nobody else wants to live
in water world except for me Kayla stand
the sight of a post apocalyptic stuff
the sovereign aquatic it was either that
or Megaton I'm going with the fact that
its Megaton from fallout um I'm going
with that that's gonna look crappy
because we're using
I look terrible so either megaton but
I'm gonna go with the asshole because
the from water world's is a floating
island like a crap I like it so what
about you I would go with a i think i
would go with a spaceship like a giant
weight i build a studio for us to do the
show in on a spaceship it like and make
it look like a spaceship like made out
of junk like that's what i would make
the the place where they live in mystery
science theater 3000 yeah there we are k
yeah let's do that yeah or we can real
my first idea was like oh Millennium
Falcon you can make that out of crap cuz
that's a big hug big hunk of junk big
hunk of junk this is I feel like there's
a lot serenity from firefight yeah kind
of it I didn't want those who were kind
of the obvious answers I wanted to like
yeah I wanted to get a little out of
that let anybody that was thinking
inside the box so very that but they're
really good at thinking outside the box
so TD junk t junk that's for you um okay
we got to talk about force fields Boeing
Boeing just filed for a patent okay and
I don't know if a lot of you guys know
this Boeing you probably know makes
planes but they also are a security and
defense company so they do a lot of
stuff for military purposes like they
make stuff for military use vehicles
things like that so um they just got a
patent granted to them named method and
system for shock wave attenuation via
electromagnetic arc and that kind of lay
man's down to the force feels a little
bit it's a little bit like a force field
so this is obviously not this this page
is actually from Boeing I found okay so
on cnet we have this article up about
the same thing and this guy made this
patent yogi video guy made this video
and it's actually it's like not a bad
video and it kind of shows the patents
and stuff so I thought guys are
generally good job of illustrating
exactly what it means so here's we're
not quite in the realm of sci-fi movies
it's not going to create a little force
field around you that you're gonna you
know oh no like no one's ever going to
be able to shoot me or stab me or
anything because I have a force field
around no this is for protecting things
that are near explosions so let's say
there's a vehicle or a structure that
you want to protect this patent has a
sensor that would detect the explosion
shockwave
if it thinks that it's going to hit the
target that you're trying to protect an
arc generator would create a plasma
field between the target you wanted to
protect and the explosion and that
plasma field would be made with lasers
electricity and microwaves and they
would heat and ionize the air so then so
it would make it either a different
temperature a different density or a
composition then the shock wave coming
at you then atmosphere around it so when
the shock wave comes at it it basically
acts as sort of like a an invisible
buffer between the explosion and the
target so it puts something here that
changes the density of the air and makes
it less likely that this target will be
damaged by an explosion fuses it in a
way it doesn't like block it complete
this important completely this is it
that's still cool by the way amazing
video I know yeah it was really good i
saw and i was just like ok this actually
illustrates it very well so I good job
Patti nice so so that's so no did boeing
respond and me like hey wait a minute
it's the patents granted granted it
they're working on it and that's a thing
that I mean obviously there are a lot of
applications not only for you know maybe
not only for military but maybe even
just for building so let's say for
example there is you know some sort of
explosion and you want to protect your
building from say a gas explosion or an
earthquake and that that causes
explosions things like that like I mean
I could see where this would be a very
handy piece of tech not a place is that
this would work I'm sure it's just the
beginning for Boeing just reach
different applications for this sort of
electromagnetic arc which i think is
rough future military stuff it's like
way beyond like what we even know it
really has had got like laser gun have
you heard that theory that like I heard
it once when I think I was like 12 years
old somebody told me they were like
whatever you hear about any military in
the world like developing there they're
literally like two days plus BPO oh yeah
yeah no I think we've all heard that I
just dont worry yeah they actually have
a visibility soon they actually can
teleportation that's yeah they got
rocket packs it's just they're up in
space right now fighting space wars and
we got no
idea exactly exactly no I love this this
is old news yes totally like really
really but I think it's cool that they
got this patented and they're they're
gonna move forward with with this sort
of technology so good for you bowing
this is awesome yeah nicely done alright
we're going to take a quick break we're
going to come back with into it because
it's the last day of our show this week
and of course we have your user feedback
a lot of you guys want some canceled
shows to come back and we have our phone
tiger for the day and it's a note for
picture just like you asked so stick
around is tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we have
returned is Thursday which means we're
obsessed with stuff just like every week
on Thursday when we're obsessed with
something so it is time for into it all
right killed would you like to go first
yes okay so not only does in May do we
start the summer movie season but we
also start summer music festivals get
out your flowers Rams whole bunch of
music festivals odds I mean this is a
this is a big thing in California
especially we have tons of music
festivals all the artists that are
promoting albums and some of them that
are just trying to make a little a
little small come back so uh yeah so it
now it's a mad scramble to try and buy
tickets for these everything $400
tickets for stuff like that so here's
some of the ones that that we're excited
about work said about outside lands a
kind of excited by dte DC electric daisy
carnival are generally excited about
Coachella yeah Milan Coachella's one for
celebrities it's okay um yeah it's great
because you know a lot of videos come
out on youtube of like oh my God look
who showed up at such-and-such concert
or look who died on stage or whatever I
don't know what's happening Logan what's
the one you're going to okay he's gonna
hang out fast so hit up Logan if you're
going to hang out yes meet up with them
can follow on Twitter yeah and so yeah
we're really excited about a lot of
these if you are going to any of them
let us know we're going to the we're
going to them and I'll say what's up
yeah so like kale and Logan are really
big music like you guys are really into
going out I just like rats yeah not all
sorts of stuff so I'm a lazy homebody
and so I don't get out as much but I do
go to places every now and again I like
that i'm a lady i go to places every now
and again i might go i might go out I
don't know and take my dry cleaning
somewhere I might leave the house and do
that okay like sometimes I'll leave the
house all right do you want to know what
I'm into it better be fast uh every
music fest it's not um but it does speak
to my my willingness to be a lazy
homebody it is called fan TV and fancy V
reminds me a little
bit of herbs our TV fan reminds me a
little bit of can I stream it the
website can i stream it yes which is
great it's good but it's hard to
navigate on mobile it's kind of a
nightmare and it loads a little bit slow
so um TV fan is a nap by fan TV that's
why I mix them up fan hatton owns them
so we did this I film this on my on my
iPhone I literally captured straight
from iphone this is the app and here it
as you can see like what's in theaters
now what's opening this week there's
trailers you can see what free movies
are on the internet I thought that was
really cool if you go into the second
column you can check out all of the
different stuff you can search for
whatever you want so I look for breaking
bad and I'm going to tap on it and you
can see it's going to show me literally
everything I ever needed to know about
breaking bad it'll give me an episode
guide it'll tell me when it's on TV if I
am logged in like and pick my isp my
service provider it'll show you exactly
where you can watch it so we'll see Oh
Netflix you can play it right now you
can stream it right now you can buy it
on itunes for this price you can do this
you can do this so it'll tell you
exactly where everything is it's really
crazy you're just format I love how
everything is set up it's just really
stunning and one of the other things i
really like is you can go in the app
Logan can you pull up Mike my own
individual camera really quick so you
can go into the app and I'm just going
to show you really quick you can go into
my services and you get all of the
different services from like all the
different channels like Hulu and a and E
and AMC like every single channel or
service you can think of is on this list
Wow and you can say I don't use that
service so I all unchecked like a
Cinemax like I don't subscribe to
Cinemax oh okay I'll uncheck that so now
it just won't show up in my surgery
that's incredible it's a really
intuitive it's a super good app and as
it's free um and I really I dig it and
it'd be your ads or something no no not
the next and it's only for iOS or is
also free Android they okay so it's only
for iOS right now they had a
thing though this is the refreshed like
they rebuilt this app like from the
ground up okay so this was the brand new
kind of relaunch of TV fan and what
they're doing is they're working on it a
not only are they working on other
versions for other os's mobilizes but
they're also working on a web compatible
one so you can pull it up literally on
any device even if it doesn't have a nap
so Windows Phone or a lot of devices and
you'd be able to use it for rather have
a nap so they're like we can use it from
the web I'd rather have an apt to but
but if you have let's say a Windows
Phone and maybe they're not making an
appt then you'd be able to go to the web
version of it and you'd be able to pull
up the and use it just a working yeah
this is fine but I dig it you can no
doubt they have a they have an online
like a website version of it so if you
go to fam TV it's there but add that's
what I'm into right now like i dig this
so much i think it's so cool and I love
that it's all at my fingertips and I can
just say like oh is that streaming like
oh I gotta I gotta find out if that's
like actually on netflix or if i have to
rent it this is gonna this app is gonna
stress you out soon but like I have so
many things cool i know you can put
everything i what am i going to do with
my life you can also put it on your
staying and i go to any fest you can you
that's true i won't go to any fest
because of this but you can put in um
things that are out that you are waiting
for to like show up on streaming
services and it'll notify you when they
pop up dad I like which is really really
cool they can be like you and you can
choose like daily or you can choose
weekly so it's like if you're like
please don't bother me like you can have
it just send you every week just say
okay these are on these things on your
watch list are now which is pretty cool
so I got everything covered alright
totally like it that's what I'm into
good nice hopefully you guys if you try
it and if you enjoy it if you hate it
you can blame me that's fine um alright
you ready to talk about you ready to
talk about what everybody wants all
right let's go into this you go you go
okay so two days there's a lot of good
ones I'm sure there are two days ago we
have so many responses on YouTube
Twitter everywhere email of people
saying what show they want to bring back
for a little TV event because of the
x-files being brought back so um Rob
wrote to us and said TD event millennium
another Chris Carter series which it was
very short-lived you don't remember it
did you watch pop rock you did I showed
you yeah I did put some move on okay did
I pick one from YouTube okay so from
YouTube we have John paddocks at pushing
daisies should be brought to netflix for
Gracie's and people that definitely
watch it there thank you thank you um
and then we have mark he says more
sci-fi the ended too soon v from ABC
needs a real ending plus the aliens were
just super model humans that was a good
show mark do you member that show didn't
watch it that was a really good show it
was and it was a reno but I get there's
a look there's my just about to watch
now I'm a big TV like history but like
I'm all about it's okay okay Eric Hayden
from from YouTube said Batman Beyond
finished too quickly oh good I don't
know the return of Joker was a nice
little button on the end of that one
okay I could man I think you think that
was at the end but anyway okay i'll give
you that no days off tweeted flash
forward I understand most shows that
make people think there we go our pin
band canceled since reality TV kills
brain cells but please those guys are
playing with fire though the flash for
there's like this show will never end we
won't answer any of your questions and
then it got cancelled people are like so
then what happened I got it can I have
one more for you there's tons we have
times we've tons of but so em from
YouTube and I don't have it if you can
watch okay pull up pull up my screen Oh
huh em you just you see just made that
thing go to sleep Senate game genie
cousin and game genie coach we always
ask for Game Genie coach so now you have
to have something about it to that cuz
we also got some in our email okay so um
Frederick says I would love to see
fringe come back I
sure Shannon says I would love to see
the greatest american hero brought back
to see where the characters are now
everything all right right Nick said my
vote for TD event is almost human and
wife wants to vote for Star Trek Voyager
yeah almost human didn't get its chance
they're like mixed up the episodes and
kept moving the day they fireflight it
John says two shows they should bring
back as terra nova staying with fox
shows that got canceled because they
need to finish the boat and math simple
storyline and surface because i would
like to know what happens after the east
and west coast camp flooded so it seems
like sci-fi really gets screwed over a
lot of people search by a lot of people
sci fi and then lastly david wrote and
said when I was a kid 100 or so years
ago all the shows i really liked
inevitably got canceled after one season
1 i'd like to see was a superhero comedy
called captain nice and then he sent in
the wikipedia script anxiety never heard
of this police chemist Carter Nash a
mild-mannered mama's boy who discovered
a secret formula that when taken
transformed him into an explosive burst
of smoke into Captain nice as mentioned
it star william daniels a great actor
better known now for his work as the
voice of Knight Rider and mr. Feeny mr.
Feeny I was created by book Henry the
comedy writer who hosted SNL a bunch of
times it was funny stuff on its own but
love to see it going after the current
superhero craze even its packaging could
be a parody of the comic book miniseries
concept love that one that's a deep dive
that's going way back yeah that's a
reach basically a new IP they like a
fresh CIP that's a reboot to bittorrent
I like it uh and then of course Joel
Schumacher sent in a game genie code and
he said joel schumacher thank you I said
oh thanks for Batman and Robin um
thought I was done in my favorite Super
Mario Brothers game GD code for the NES
and ul TKA this turns all enemies added
toads hard to find online but I included
an image for reference love the show I
like that he included an image that
really brings it together kale and then
he said kale and Ashley 4 2016
presidential election so no no I don't
want that job I like this one I'm too
busy not doing anything I really like to
take care of the nation yep Chester also
sent us a huge load of Game Genie code
so here's what we're gonna do we're
gonna post all your game genie codes on
our tumblr and you can just anytime you
just go referee screwed with me why all
of a sudden we've been mentioning the
game show you gene codes thing
like months but we've said yesterday I
haven't gotten any we were like we're
complaining about it and everybody sent
in Game Genie now we have to do a live
stream where we use your game genie code
can we do that I don't think we can no
Cena hates when we play video games no
that's not true you know that's not true
I mean I mean rigging and NEX to stream
on Twitch lien here's a modulator guess
I gotta figure yeah we got I got that no
problem excellent well uh ok so that was
your user feedback there was so much
more we're really sorry couldn't get to
everybody it was literally a it was it
was like Hogwarts like getting the
letters if they were just coming in like
comments were coming in all through the
ceiling huh it was insane oh I'm not it
was it was so good and thank you for
that great sorry we couldn't get to all
of them um ok time for our very last
piece user feedback photogra for the day
the very delightful Mary sent us a
picture from a note for ok so here we go
are you ready she said utterly love the
camera on my note for here is a quick
picture of the first daffodil of the
spring from my front yard she didn't
send it in response to yesterday's are
you just picked it no she sent in
response because it it came in that
email came in after we said like sending
pictures of you know yeah so she said oh
I act early love I am on board with this
camera it's looking out a bright and
cheerful that daffodil looks it's there
so much hope yeah for the spring I don't
even I don't even want out anything to
it it's just so cheer it makes me so
happy the color though like see that's
it cuz so rich again I'm very into this
net like very very into this cuz I just
went through the like process of buying
my new phone yeah I don't like my camera
now no I was thinking about getting the
note and I kind of wish I did know he
almost I could get my daffodil pictures
in and I marry kill almost got a note
but then decided it was too big to big
hand it was cuz when I was holding it
like there's a little unwieldy I don't
like my grip isn't that strong and so
when I held it up to my head I borrowed
somebody's itself by and I was like this
is if this slips out of my hand even
just cuz I hands are greasy from BBQ no
it's just like so ended up in the m8 i
will say if you are not sure
you want to get a large phone like a
tablet as where I hate that phrase but
if you want to get a large phone and
over like a 5-inch phone or five and a
half inch phone or even a 6-inch phone
my suggestion to you is if you really
like large screens yeah you will get
used to it I was I don't know or the six
i went from the iphone 5s to the 26 plus
which is a little bit taller than the
note but also the know is a little wider
notice wider and that's the issue
honestly but the thing is is you get
used to it and like I almost took this
back at least twice there were days work
for two weeks I was like I think I don't
think I like this I think I gotta take
it back and then but then I got you
saying now I don't ever want to go back
like I know exactly why i like i love
the larger screen like I don't want to
go back the six plus is kind of the
sweet spot honestly it'sit's not to what
