better well maybe not but that's how
much this one costs the happiest baby's
new is developed by two famous people
first the influential tech developer
Yves Behar and second the famous dr.
Harvey Karp who developed the 5 SS for
soothing children to do benefits from
both from Behar it gets this great
design this really fascinating
naturalistic look that's really
heavy-duty but it also has really good
principles backing it up from dr. carp
like swaddles that hold the baby in
place so they don't flip on their belly
and a white noise machine that emits
different frequencies of noise depending
on whether the child needs to be soothed
to sleep or needs to be soothed while
they're crying
it also rocks at different rates and in
different directions and all around it's
a really cool device the problem is the
price tag of eleven hundred fifty
dollars is just kind of absurd for a lot
of parents the reason it costs so much
is because of the years of research that
went into it but the developers also
think it's worth it for parents if they
think of it more as a service something
that the parents pay maybe six or seven
dollars per day for the first six months
of their child's life whether you buy
that or not is up to you and honestly
I'm kind of skeptical I'm looking
forward to testing it out but for now it
definitely looks like a really
interesting device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
