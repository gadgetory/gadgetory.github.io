played it's perfect artificial wave get
shocked by the full-body Tesla suit and
lift plenty of heavy boxes this is beta
test live on the scene at stage at CES
and I'm Lexy CBDs if you're wondering
what I'm wearing it is an exoskeleton by
airframe it's that's the name of the
product and the company is levitate I am
joined by Joseph so why did Joseph
welcome to see us thank you so much for
having thank you for bringing in this
exoskeleton now for people that aren't
familiar with exoskeletons what exactly
is it and what does it do yes this is an
ergonomic technology that supports the
upper extremity of factory workers
surgeons consumers in general so it's
worn as an ergonomic device that is
considered like any other personal
protective equipment so in a factory
building cars or airplanes you can come
in put in your earplugs put in your
safety shoes your safety glasses and
your airframe to protect the
musculoskeletal system of your upper
body like the shoulder and neck and back
that you would suit up with it another
day on the factory assembly right right
so let's walk through some of the
components I mean obviously it's kind of
like a backpack in how I put it on maybe
I'll turn around and you can kind of
point out each of the components that
I'm wearing absolutely it's very much
like backpacking backpacks so you've got
the frame that is rigid made out of
aluminum
that goes all the way down the spine to
the outside of the hips so what this
rigid frame does is it takes the load
off your arms through a spring and
pulley and cable mechanism inside what
we call the cassette and then that
weight of your arms is offloaded onto
the spine not to your lower back but to
the outside of these struts to the
outside of the hips so this is taking
all of that weight for me essentially so
I'm not exercising much of my muscle
capacity correct correct instead of
using a hundred percent of your muscle
you are using 70 to 80 percent of your
muscle so when we take ten to thirty
percent off the edge that's what makes
the big difference in reducing injury
reducing fatigue
and not impacting productivity so what
you're saying is really I could
potentially be Ironman Ryan
potentially potentially excellent okay
so where is this being currently used
like do you have clients that are using
it in factories like real world
situations right now we absolutely do
we've been deploying hundreds of them
at single factories we have 80 global
customers in the US central and southern
America Canada Europe and Japan one of
our biggest customers and unfortunately
a lot of them don't allow us to talk
about our sales but I can name some
great companies like Toyota Textron
aviation BMW manufacture we are in five
plants in North America Toyota so it's
being used a lot in a lot of different
places to help and also the whole point
is to help workers stop getting injured
and to help them work more effectively
essentially okay so you and I are
wearing slightly different models aren't
we so this is the regular airframe this
one it looks a little different I can
notice there the fabric is a little bit
different it's blue what is this one so
this is our latest innovation and
addition to our product line and it is
our fire retardant airframe oh I could
you get sparks or anything
it's totally fire retardant absolutely
it is either covered by fire retardant
fabric or all the buckles all the straps
all the soft goods are fire retardant so
all the material you see here is
different than the material you have you
don't want to have a welder put this on
and have the sparks create fire so they
put on their welding jacket and put on
this airframe on top of it and it's just
like the one you're wearing functional
just the same but it can be used for
welding and what we call hot work such
as grinding and sanding and so forth so
it's a whole new line of products that
we're introducing one of them is this FR
version I'm kind of scared to know the
sort of testing that you had to do to
make sure that it was really fire
resistant the US Navy was kind enough to
actually do the testing they looked at
all the specs they made sure that we did
everything right and they validated it
and they actually approved its testing
that
in Seattle by the Navy so we got the
green light from them to start
manufacturing and providing them the
product we're looking at some of some
footage of it actually being used in
current settings in factories right now
so there's a lot of overhead work there
like drilling and things like that and
obviously this is going to support the
arms in order to make that easier right
correct correct
excellent okay so obviously that's a
factory specific situation but we've
kind of simulated something a little bit
factory like here we have some shelves
and I think you're gonna put me to work
yes I think okay so let's start turning
turning things on right now it is
deactivated okay and if you could get
your arms I will just activate both
sides and I asked you to swing your arms
back okay and now it's active okay my
arms are just totally just being held up
automatically like I I don't feel like
I'm doing anything I'm just you know the
force goes away so you can okay so I'm
moving around normally now yes and my
arms are up and I can stand here all day
I don't know why I would yes in a normal
situation but if I was in a factory
doing things involving a lot of reaching
out that would be very handy absolutely
it's like a helping hand you know when
you raise your arm and you start to feel
that fatigue yeah that's when the
mechanism kicks in and it goes away when
your arms are dropped so I notice there
are cartridges here and is that for a
different level of strength it is you
have six different levels of strength
and the number that you see there if I
can point that out you are wearing a
number three cassette so that's in the
middle of the range of the support level
we you can have the right size arm rest
right size cassette right size frame
these frames come in four different
sizes the cassettes come in multiple
levels so they're the armrests once we
configure it for you it's set that way
and you never have to change it again
nice and so what are these components
that we have here this is all part of it
this is these are all accessories that
our customers have actually asked us to
do okay so we are there always finding
new needs for their exoskeleton this is
the mini version of the headrest that
you are wearing
sometimes they're wearing hard hats in
the factory the idea of this headrest is
if I'm doing something over hello it's
quite comforting
actually I couldn't just sit here and
look at the ceiling if I wanted to yes
and it wouldn't put any strain on my
head
if you look up more than two minutes
without a headrest you'll start feeling
the strain it takes that away again it
doesn't take away all the muscle
activity it takes away 20 to 30 percent
of the muscle activity and that's
crucial in order to help prevent injury
right it's that excess inflammation you
know at the end of the day when the
worker goes that aching is what we get
rid of okay let's try this out I
actually want to try this out because
that's the whole point of this show is I
get to try things yes okay so what am I
going to be doing here picking and
packing all right yes one of the latest
entries into the exoskeleton world for
us is picking and packing at fulfillment
centers so what we wanted to do is
simulate a picking and packing
environment which people do all day long
at fulfillment centers like Amazon
Walgreens whatever the case may be and
we want you to do exactly what they do
which is put the bottles as and you can
imagine these being any type of
merchandise put them in here just close
it as if you taped it and you push it to
the conveyor belt alright we'd like to
do the cycle once without the
exoskeleton being activated so let's
deactivate if you get your arm out one
more time alright so if you don't mind
then go at it with five bottles in here
and five all right here we go putting me
to work packing I mean three four five
take it out seal up the box push it
aside and two three coming in okay so
it's not that strenuous right now
because I only did eight bottles correct
but if I was doing that for eight hours
a day five days a week that would be
incredibly strenuous that same
repetitive motion okay so now I have an
idea of what that's like we're gonna put
them all back yep that was without the
exoskeleton was out without the airframe
so let's try this again one more time
see there's a lot of fiji water here
yeah I saw you were going off to the
Golden Globes name
alright let's reactivate okay we go and
repeat the task okay oh yeah it's so
much easier because it feels like I have
very little activation in my upper arm
very very little like I I feel like most
of the work and it's not even work it's
just coming from my hand just to grab
yes so it's not strenuous at all if I'm
not so clumsy and drop the water bottle
okay that is yeah incredibly so much
easier I mean it doesn't place your arm
right it just arguments it just enough
to take the edge off exactly exactly
right sorry that's for like picking and
packing what about lifting and other
kind of motions like that will this help
with that it does not help with lifting
it is not a lumbar support technology
what it does is it's for movement of the
arms whether it's static or repetitive
so if you're welding all day long or
picking and packing one other type of
work that you referenced earlier is
overhead work this happens a lot we are
currently working with a fulfillment
center that is being built and you have
to install the water sprinklers in a
million square foot facility that's a
lot of installation a lot of
installation so they use it to build the
fulfillment center and then they use it
for their picking attackers and Pickers
when they get in there but I want you to
just hold this up for a couple of
seconds with the airframe activated and
then I want to remove it from your arm
and you tell me the difference of what
it does for you I mean this is very
comfortable like I could stay here
feasibly for I think I could probably
lost ten minutes in this position easily
I was pleased yeah I mean it doesn't
feel uncomfortable at all
okay so if I'm gonna put it down now no
actually leave it there okay leave your
arm in the same position and I'm just
gonna do this at all that is not so
uncomfortable I can feel it all there
and my bicep I mean great if you want to
be doing some weight training but doing
this every day at work so incredibly
repetitive and so
very painful it is it makes such a
difference it really is you know these
these workers work so hard companies
like Toyota they don't call them workers
they call them team members because
these people are building the cars that
they are selling so they want to take
care of them as much as they can because
they know that they a can get tired the
end of the day so with us we feel it
right away with these people they live
with it every day so it's making a very
big difference for them so let's talk
about price if I wanted to buy one of
these and I'm an everyday consumer what
are we looking at so we are currently
not marketing into the consumer world
[Laughter]
we're you know we we have a lot of these
big companies that are constantly
working with us to do studies and to
improve the technology and they're
buying them in large numbers for their
workers it retails at the distributor
level for five thousand dollars just
under five thousand dollars and
obviously is there a bulk discount
because probably you're buying hundreds
of them at a time correct when we work
with a company like Toyota for example
there's definitely some special pricing
this is being fantastic thank you so
much for coming in Joseph and showing me
all about the airframe i levitate it's
been a pleasure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
