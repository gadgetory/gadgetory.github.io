prizefight ring i'm brian tom and we're
here to find out who's the top dog when
it comes to the hottest music video game
franchise in this week's prize fight
it's a battle of the bands between
Guitar Hero 3 and rock band for Xbox 360
we've got five down-and-dirty rounds so
let's rock first up it's about the music
now both of these games have a diverse
group of songs you'll get your fix of
classic alternative modern rock and they
don't ignore punk rockers or metalheads
either
Guitar Hero threes tracklist has been
touted as one of the best ever and over
half of the tracks or original
recordings you can download more content
but that's kind of sparse rock bands
just as diverse and even more of its
songs or original recordings but the
ability to constantly purchase new
tracks every week through the in-game
store keeps your music list fresh if
you're just talking standard tracks that
come included gh3 would win but the
constant flow of content gives rock band
a boost we're handing out up fours for
everyone next round gameplay fans of the
Guitar Hero series will get exactly what
they expect with gh3 hammer-ons
pull-offs and whammy action is all here
except for one thing this year's game is
significantly more difficult I mean I'm
not a noob but at the hardened expert
levels it's tough enough to be a
turn-off for some players
now rock bands gameplay involves not
only guitar but a kick-ass drum set and
a microphone the guitar gameplay is very
similar to gh3 s but it's less difficult
which makes it more accessible to
newcomers singing is similar to karaoke
revolution where you sing along with the
lyrics while matching the pitch meter on
screen you can improv and using it as a
percussion instrument is fun too can you
say more cowbell and the drum kit
bonkers hit the color-coded pads and
foot pedal to match what's on screen and
your drumming like Travis Barker there
are drum fills for improving and I
actually feel like I've learned how to
play drums from the game rock bands
gameplay is super fun but also easier to
pick up and play rock band up gets a 4
and Guitar Hero gets a 3 the band is up
1 next round
hardware Guitar Hero's Wireless so you
could jump off your sofa and the fret
buttons and Strummer have a distinct
clicky feel that's super accurate and
responsive but being Wireless means
having to replace the batteries rock
band brings the most diversity and
innovation when it comes to hardware the
drum kit is possibly one of the best
peripherals ever made for a game and the
mic does its job well but the guitar
doesn't have the same responsive feel as
gh3 s everything is wired and there are
also more reliability issues in a battle
between quality and innovation both
sides get their hits in and we score
them even boom with a pair of fours next
up online game play and features Guitar
Hero has never been online before so
it's a feature fans have been drooling
for you have several modes faceoff pro
face-off battle modes and a co-op play
where you can team up with a buddy and
rock the lead guitar and bass lag
doesn't get in the way and having voice
chat while playing is super cool rock
band brings its rocking gameplay online
to now you have co-op to join buddies
and play for high scores and there's
also competitive play you have basic
scored tool which is the same instrument
and difficulty with the same song and
tug-of-war mode where you alternate to
win over the crowd now lag isn't an
issue with rock band either and we know
about new downloadable tracks every week
rock band edges Guitar Hero um 5 - 4
because both of these games are loaded
with every
we want but the downloadable content
makes all the difference
rock band leaves by 2 going into the
final deciding round what will come down
to well the last round is party factors
both of these games were made to party
so let's break down the difference
Guitar Hero allows you to have not one
but two guitar players legs rock and
everyone else gets to stand around or
sit on the couch listening to the music
rock man lets you have a lead guitarist
a bassist a drummer and a vocalist
it's like gh3 on steroids for people get
in the action and no one is left on the
couch but let's face it people aren't
really getting together anymore to play
guitar hero it's all about rock band
when it's time to party all right guys
let's tally it up so this is the one
that decides it all in the final round
we're giving rock band um a 5 and Guitar
Hero 3 making rock bands your winner
with a total of 22 points in the prize
fight for music dominance thanks for
joining us I'm Brian Tong and we'll
catch you guys next time on another
prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
