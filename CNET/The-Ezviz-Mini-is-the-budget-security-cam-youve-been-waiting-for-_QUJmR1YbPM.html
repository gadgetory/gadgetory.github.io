camera anomaly for starters it has night
vision 720p live-streaming motion alerts
and it costs just 70 bucks but it has a
couple problems the main issue is that
its motion alerts are unreliable often
times I would get a push notification
and watch the recorded clip only to find
out that no discernable activity had
happened maybe it was a shadow passing
or a bug flying by but whatever it was
the sensor is way too sensitive and
there's no way to customize it so that's
kind of a negative if you want to use
this as a reliable dependable motion
detector it's really not the device for
you but then again like I said it costs
just 70 bucks so for a live streaming HD
camera it's actually incredible it also
has free cloud recording for the first
year that you use it after that you have
to pay a monthly fee but I think that's
really reasonable and it also has local
storage so it actually comes with a 16
gigabyte microSD card so if you want to
look at your videos locally instead of
through the cloud you can do that too
one other thing that could be a
deal-breaker to some is that this camera
doesn't integrate with third-party
devices and it doesn't have an if
channel so if you want to do some more
advanced automations between this device
and some other devices in your home you
won't be able to do that but again for
70 bucks I think it won't matter to a
lot of people you can read more of our
