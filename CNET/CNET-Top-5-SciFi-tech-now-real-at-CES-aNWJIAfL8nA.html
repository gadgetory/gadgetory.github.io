couldn't help but feel a sense of deja
vu as I wandered through the exhibit
halls looking at gadgets that at some
point I'd already seen on my TV hey guys
it's vanessa hand ariana from cnet
espanol in for Donald Bell who currently
collapsed after CES and this week we're
taking a look at the top 5 TV shows and
movies that best predicted the tech
trends of CES 2014 coming in at number
five we have minority report this
futuristic thriller came out more than
10 years ago and wowed us with touchless
gesture controlling who can forget the
scene where Tom Cruise swipes through
screens of information as an agent who's
been accused of a crime he hasn't yet
committed and while we can't yet catch a
criminal before he strikes touchless
controlling is now a reality at CES we
saw elliptic labs using ultrasound
technology to click through a windows 8
display on a laptop and they weren't the
only ones at number 4 the names bond
James Bond in the franchise
double-oh-seven is always debuting the
latest technology thanks to
quartermaster cube the king of gadgets
himself in 1997 Pierce Brosnan gets a
phone with a fingerprint scanner and a
touchpad to control his BMW and while
the brick of a phone seems outdated now
and the movie was subpar the actual
technology was spot-on last year we saw
touch ID debuting on our smartphones and
at CES this year we saw a driverless
Audi and a Range Rover fit into tight
parking spots with the touch of a phone
app and coming in at number 3 star trek
remember the scene where Captain
jean-luc Picard materializes a cup of
tea on a replicator with a surge of
consumer 3d printers you can now buy
your very own replicator that prints
everything but the Earl Grey MakerBot
showed off their replicator mini at CES
this year for less than 1500 or the next
model up for around 3 grand second on
our list is a movie that 80's kids like
myself will remember fondly back to the
future two in the sequel the DeLorean is
added again taking Marty and the doc 30
years into the future the year 2015 now
I don't have a time machine but I'm
pretty sure i can tell you what 2015
looks like remember the McFly family
dinner table the kids decked out and
wearable tech answering calls with their
glass
is now compared to the Google glass
these things look chunky and dated but
they do have a slight resemblance to the
oculus rift the virtual reality gaming
headset making waves at CES the movie
also predicted flat screen smart TVs and
video chat but in all seriousness we're
in Great Scott is my hoverboard and
ringing in at number one the Jetsons the
show was a novelty in 1962 when it first
came out as the first program ever to be
broadcast in color The Jetsons were your
typical family of 2062 with their trusty
made Rosie now we don't have a robot
with an apron doing our chores yet but
we do have video chat robotic vacuums
and smart appliances that can be
controlled remotely with our phones
samsung and LG were a few many to show
off these connected homes of the future
at CES and there you have them the five
futuristic flicks that first imagined
the technology we actually saw at CES
there are a lot more that didn't make it
on this list so tweet me with your
favorite or post comments below and
don't forget to check out all our
coverage from CES and more top 5s at
