Championships it is the pitiful event
for the year for the Pokemon competitive
play scene people compete all through
the year they move through their local
events and use the regional events and
then they get to the international
championships and then whoever moves
beyond that comes to the World
Championships we have over 700
registered competitors we have over
2,500 spectators our competitors come
from over 30 countries
we have three ages of businesses junior
seniors and masters juniors is from six
to twelve seniors as 12 to 16 and
masters at 16 and older we have no upper
age limit these events are just all
about the banners it's everything
Pokemon but it's all friendship is not
camaraderie it's about sportsmanship
it's about seeing your old friends
there's a lot of these people come every
year and see the same people they've
made friends through this program and
you definitely see the longevity the
brand in the generations of people that
play pokemon we have some very intense
