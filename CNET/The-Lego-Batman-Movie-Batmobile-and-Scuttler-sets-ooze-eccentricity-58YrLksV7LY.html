brings a tidal wave of new sets for
Caped Crusader and Lego fans alike here
I've got two vehicle sets the new
Batmobile
and the Scuttler
they're both really cool so let's build
we've now got the base of the Batmobile
the best of all we have Batman himself
he is absolutely adorable for a guy
that's a crime fighter
no printed bricks with this set it seems
but the stickers are pretty cool and we
have this figure man-bat and some reason
he's holding some dynamite
check out the poseable spoilers we've
got Robin look I put his hair on and
that's also his geeky glasses
so here is the Batmobile and look at it
roll and these are the Kabuki twins
which are actually the Penguins hench
ladies I think they look like Vega from
Street Fighter 2 so far for the Scuttler
set we've got Dick Grayson and this
Batman comes with a ridiculous rocket
pack and we've got Commissioner Gordon
here and poison ivy look at that hair
it's got leaves in it lastly for the
minifigures we have the Joker
complete with bang pop pistol thing and
this is Barbara Gordon that she looked
badass
she'll they've been holding a weapon
from I'm still intimidated
everyone meet the Scuttler hmm
it's basically a vehicle version of a
bat that's not flying
but crawling around the floor and
climbing up cave walls the four poseable
limbs allow Batman to climb around a
crime scene and fire his catching net
out of this cannon I must warn you of
the stickers though some of them are
extremely long and thin and because
they're transparent it makes them very
fiddly to attach without getting
fingerprints on them that said though
look at this Batmobile it's great you
can fire the roof off and turn it into
an all-terrain vehicle it's also nice
that Batman and Robin can actually sit
side by side without their arms getting
in each other's way keep an eye out for
more Batman sets released later this
year and stay tuned to see net</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
