CENTCOM and I'm here with a couple of
classic Sony over the ear headphones
that have been around for a while that
we're revisiting because they're
currently very good deals at under $100
online the one on my left is the MDR v6
which first hit the market in 1985 and
the one in my right is the MDR 7 506
which came out in 1991 other versions of
this headphone include the MDR V 600 and
the MDR 7 509 HD as you can see from
their extra long coil cords both are
studio monitor headphones and both have
long been very popular with sound
engineers and other audio professionals
as well as audio files on a budget
they look nearly identical and are very
comfortable and relatively lightweight
for full-size headphones they fold up
into a more compact form factor and come
with a simple vinyl protective carrying
case while the ear pads aren't
incredibly durable they are replaceable
and cost around 10 dollars for a pair of
replacement pads well the two headphones
have the same design and sound similar
they don't sound identical both offer
very well balanced sound and excellent
clarity for their modest price points
but the v6 makes a little more bass and
sounds more laid-back and mellower all
the 75006 is leaner with a more
accentuated treble range which makes it
a little crisper sounding and livelier
our audio guru Steve Guttenberg
preferred the v6 but I like the 7 506 a
bit more these headphones don't deliver
as rich or full sound as the audio
technica ath M 50s another one of our
favorite mid-range monitor style
headphones but they do cost
significantly less and sound great for
sub $100 headphones well you can
certainly use them on the go the heavy
long cord makes them less than ideal as
walk-around headphones they also don't
have an integrated remote and microphone
for making cell phone calls my guess is
that more people will prefer the sound
of the 7 506 s but it's hard for me to
tell you which headphone you'll like
better because everyone's tastes are
different the other thing I can't tell
you for sure is whether the v6 has been
discontinued every few years is a rumor
that it has been and Sony doesn't sell
the v6 on its website anymore but
ten use to be available at several
online retailers whatever the case both
these headphones are excellent values
and even though they are old headphones
they've endured for a reason I'm David
karna and those are the sony MDR v6 and
NDR seven 5:06 headphones thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
