Las Vegas at the Samsung CES booth for
the family hub refrigerator this is a
new smart fridge from Samsung with a
gigantic touchscreen on the upper right
door here it's 21 and a half inches much
bigger than the 8 inch LCD touchscreens
of Samsung's previous smart fridges so a
big step forward there and also a nicer
design to with the four door flex
styling that we saw on last year's chef
collection model now on that touch
screen you'll be able to do a lot of the
basic smart fridge functions from before
access Pandora to stream music be able
to mirror your Samsung Smart TVs feed
onto the fridge you'll be able to access
a calendar app and even order groceries
through an integration with the
MasterCard grocery out the fridge itself
is a 28 cubic foot model available both
in standard depth and counter depth with
different finishes you can get stainless
steel or this nice black stainless steel
here that's one of the big new trends
that Samsung is really pushing for 2016
another interesting thing inside the
fridge you see when the door is closed
you've got these cameras on the inner
rim those will keep an eye on your
groceries and snap a picture every time
the door gets closed you'll be able to
see that most recent picture in
Samsung's app so if you're at the
grocery and you can't remember if you
need milk you can check one last
interesting thing about this fridge down
the road Samson is looking into the
possibility of packing Alexa from Amazon
echo directly inside so you'll be able
to enjoy all the same functionality as
the Amazon echo smart speaker from the
fridge in your kitchen people love using
Amazon echo in their kitchen good
kitchen timer accessing music while
they're cooking that makes sense for
this fridge and putting that in your
kitchen so we'll be interested to see if
Samsung goes that route
the Samsung family hub refrigerator is
expected to arrive at US retail this
spring and will sell for five thousand
dollars that's about as much as we have
seen from a major manufacturers fridge
but this is a pretty interesting one so
it'll be interesting to see how it plays
with the US market here at CES I'm
seeing that's right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
