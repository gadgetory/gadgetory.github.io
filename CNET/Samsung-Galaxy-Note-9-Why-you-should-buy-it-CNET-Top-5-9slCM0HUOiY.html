the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 you saw the
note 9 and then started looking at your
current phone then you started wondering
how can I justify buying the new note 9
well that's why I'm here one thing
though this list could change after we
do a full review let's get to it coming
in at number 5 is decks without the duck
in the past if you wanted to use certain
Samsung devices as a desktop computer
you'd have to buy a duck this time you
can use a USB see two HDMI adapter
no dock necessary that means you can
turn your note 9 into an Android PowerPC
with a tiny accessory the note 9 can act
as a trackpad and keyboard once it's
plugged in to at number 4 is that big
battery four thousand milliamp hours
that's the note nines battery capacity
the note 8 and had a 3300 milliamp hour
battery the galaxy s 9 plus 3500 Samsung
says you'll be able to run the note 9
all day now if you start having
flashbacks about the note 7 and its
battery issues samsung says it has put
the note 9 s battery through its
internal tests these are the same tests
performed on the note 8 and s 9 series
so the note 9 and it's monstrous battery
should be safe we've made it to number 3
and that is the fingerprint sensor
location hooray
it's been moved to the center I own a
note 8 as my personal phone getting used
to that off-center fingerprint sensor
took a while but then I tried out the
note 9 with its centered fingerprint
sensor and yeah that sensor belongs in
the middle the odd part is if you're
coming from a note 8 you might have to
relearn where to put your finger however
if you're coming from any other Android
phone the central placement should feel
very natural coming in at number two is
the s-pen improvements the new s-pen can
act as a remote in lots of different
ways clicking the button can call up an
app like the camera once you're in an
app you can click the button again to
activate a function like taking a
picture or changing which camera is
active the S pen's button is remappable
too you get to decide what it launches
Samsung is also putting out an SDK so
that other app makers can build its own
as pen actions
and the number one reason to get the
Samsung Note 9 is it is powerful the
top-of-the-line model includes 512
gigabytes of on-board storage with 8
gigabytes of RAM like the s9 it runs a
Snapdragon 845 processor combine that
with a doclist text feature and a little
bit of patience and the note 9 could
probably serve as your one device for
everything even if you didn't want to
use the note 9 as your one and only
computer you know it's hardware will be
quite capable for a couple of years that
does it for us are you getting a note 9
or are you waiting for the flexi phone
let us know I my as a colonel see you
