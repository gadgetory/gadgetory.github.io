if you're interested in shooting
hands-free video but don't feel like
dealing with housings and mounts you can
pick up a pair of these the Cyclops gear
CG life 2 HD video glasses this tiny
protruding camera in front right between
the eyes is capable of capturing video
at up to 1920 x 1080 at 25 frames per
second and snapping 15 megapixel photos
though that's an interpolated resolution
as its CMOS sensor is 5 megapixels still
you need only press this button on the
left to start recording video in avi
format to a micro SD card the default
recording resolution is 1440 x 1080 at
30 frames per second and the results are
ok nothing you'd want to look too
closely at but passable for viewing on
mobile devices and its small sizes it's
not great in low-light so you'll
definitely want to have as much light as
possible too and quite possibly keep
your head tilted to the left as all of
my video was slightly slanted down to
the right you can record at 720p or full
HD but to change settings you have to
connect them to a computer and save a
text document to a microSD card also
while it has a micro USB port it's not
the kind used by most mobile devices
they are lightweight though and the
polarized lenses are easily removed if
you want to record when you have less
light cyclops gear sells these for about
a hundred and fifty dollars on its site
but if you can do without the branding a
quick ebay search for HD video
sunglasses turns up a generic pair for
around 90 bucks regardless of where you
get them for no fuss hands-free video
they'll do the trick I'm Josh Coleman
and that's a look at the cyclops gear cg
life to 1080p HD
