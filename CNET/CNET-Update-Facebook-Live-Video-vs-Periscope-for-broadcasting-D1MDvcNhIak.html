to become a broadcaster I'm Bridget
Carey this is your CNET update Facebook
has finally opened up its live video
broadcast feature to more people right
now everyone with an iPhone in the u.s.
can stream live video to their friends
on Facebook right from their phone the
network is still working on a version
for Android you'll find it inside the
status update just click the icon of a
person with a broadcast signal halo I
like to think of it as the holy saint of
video blessed be that live stream you
create a title and choose who you want
to see it when you're ready go live BAM
there's no going back it's happening you
are live friends can comment in
real-time and when they do you should
answer them or say hi that's the point
of live video to be able to interact
with questions and comments in real time
you can also like a comment you can see
how many people are watching too the
concept is the same as Twitter's
periscope but the comments do not pop up
on top of the video on Facebook it all
just sits under the broadcast I think I
like how periscope does it better it
makes it more interactive and lively and
of course they're the hearts too
Facebook has been testing and gradually
rolling out live video for the past 5
months as it tries to play catch-up -
Twitter's more popular periscope app and
of course meerkat started this live
streaming buzz first when it launched
last year but the biggest difference is
that Facebook videos will live forever
to be watched by your friends who missed
it live unless you delete it on
periscope the videos last only about a
day before they vanish on meerkat the
iPhone app does have the choice to save
a stream to your profile meerkat has
some neat tools like being able to let a
friend jump into your broadcast from
their phone but most people abandon the
app and now everyone's just using
periscope these days poor little meerkat
in other news what was once free is no
more on iTunes Apple's iTunes radio
stations used to be free but now they
can only be accessed with an Apple music
subscription which costs $10 a month
after the trial period the only thing
left free
beats 1 radio and some news stations
like NPR BBC news and ESPN Apple music
and Spotify are at the top of the paid
music streaming food chain with a little
service title launched by jay-z Madonna
and other music celebrities is still
fighting on it hopes to get some
attention again with the help of Rihanna
whose new album anti just made it's
unexpected
exclusive debut on the surface and it
did draw in more than a million trial
subscribers the album is coming to other
services in a week that's it for this
tech news update but if you're still
hungry for more you'll find a tech feast
