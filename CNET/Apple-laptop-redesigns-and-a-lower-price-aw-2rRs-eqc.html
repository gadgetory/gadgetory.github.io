macbook on top of our white plastic
MacBook and here it is again there it is
it's an all new MacBook if the changes
look subtle they are but that can be
said for all of apple's CEO Steve Jobs
announcements at this media event on
tuesday we've got some exciting new
notebooks that we want to tell you the
story about how we created these things
and what they are and why we're so
excited about them both the macbook and
macbook pro models will be housed and
sleeker and lighter aluminum bodies I
really think that aluminum macbook is
going to appeal to a lot of people who
aren't necessarily looking for the
cheapest laptop they can buy but want
like a quality premium product and I
think that macbook is going to fall
right into the sweet spot for them here
a couple of hardware features that you
know consumers are going to love first
of all we've got this touchpad made of
glass that functions as one big button
also you'll notice these really
beautiful shiny LED screens and the QA
Steve was asked if they're ever going to
do matte screens again and the answer
was no they've definitely switched over
to these shiny beautiful LED screens on
their new laptops and we've added some
four finger gestures now so expose a
great way to get in and out of expose
also all new apple notebooks will
include chip maker in videos graphics
card geforce 9400 m five times faster
graphics switch between integrated
graphics which will conserve battery
life and the dedicated graphics which
will give you better graphics
performance but maybe eat a little more
battery for the first time ever steve
jobs announced that entry-level white
plastic macbook will be available for
less than a thousand dollars but we're
going to reduce the entry price today to
999 make him a little more affordable
you were hoping for nine hundred dollars
and we heard 999 instead that doesn't
impress you know we think that they had
an opportunity especially with that
plastic mac book that they could have
gone to the 98 99 dollar so we didn't
get that that would have been great for
demand but ultimately they're trying to
push people to higher end max jobs also
announced small modifications to the
macbook
her and a 24 inch LED monitor that
smoothly connects with any apple laptop
of course no apple event can happen
without some sort of talk about Steve
Jobs health right before the Q&amp;amp;A session
of the event he put up a screen
announcing his blood pressure asking
reporters not to ask him any questions
about his health or it may cause his
blood pressure to go up I'm Kara Tsuboi
