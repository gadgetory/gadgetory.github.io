review of the hdhomerun jewel if you're
sick of paying a hundred dollars or more
for cable access every month there are a
few options available to you if you're
one of the growing number of people who
watch television on your mac or pc then
you may be interested in the hdhomerun
jewel unlike most USB TV tuners this is
a networked tuner meaning can be used by
one or more different computers in the
house at the same time one cable
connects to a TV antenna and the other
to your router and setup is super easy
there are two versions starting at $99
one comes without software and is
designed for windows and there's a
version for mac which includes our gatos
itv at a hundred and seventy nine
dollars the device has two tuners which
means you can record one show while
watching another or if two computers are
using it once they each use a tuner each
windows media center found the tuner on
the network straight away and we were
able to record from the guide and watch
TV with decent quality if we used a
wired connection that is while this
performance was pretty bad weather we
watched SD or HD channels mac on the
other hand involved a bit more setup but
wireless performance was excellent on
standard definition channels if you plan
to watch and record at the same time or
watch HD channels we'd still recommend a
wired connection you can also use the
elgato iphone app to stream TV and the
quality is adjustable as a result of the
wild's problems the hdhomerun jewel is
recommended for desktop PCs and not
laptops this has been ty pendlebury with
the hdhomerun jewel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
