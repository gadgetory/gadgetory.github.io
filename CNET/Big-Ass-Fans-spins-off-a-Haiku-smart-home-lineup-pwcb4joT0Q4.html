sent me a connected ceiling fan was a
very cool smart tech this year at CES
they're showing off an entire new haiku
branded line of smart home products they
spun it all off and it's something now
it's not just fans either they've got an
IQ HVAC unit that's coming later this
year along with a hiking wall control
switch and a haiku branded recessed
lighting fixture that can sense when you
walk into the room and also change color
temperatures the star of the show is the
new fan that they're putting out the
haiku l-series this is a lot less
expensive than the original haiku costs
four hundred and fifty dollars now the
interesting thing about this fan is that
the smarts aren't in it anymore used to
have motion sensors and humidity and
climate detectors inside of it none of
that is in the fan now it's all
relegated to the Haiku wall control unit
here it's about the size of a doorbell
it's got four buttons on it and all that
sends me texts in the middle you need
that switch in order to use the
connected features of the fan it sells
for 125 so with the price of the fan
that brings the total of a connected
ceiling fan to 575
that's still a lot of money but that's a
lot better than the original haiku which
cost over $1000 the new high QL series
fan will work with the Nest Learning
Thermostat and it'll also work with
Amazon echo the connected smart speaker
with a LexA packing slide as for that
haiku light it comes to the number of
finishes and cost one hundred and forty
nine dollars the haiku home division
will start selling the new fan of the
switch this month with the recessed
light coming a little later this spring
after that cool-looking haiku HVAC unit
there's no price or release date set but
we expect it later this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
