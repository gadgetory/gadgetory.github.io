do you see now don't be distracted by
the iridescent backing that basically
makes this phone look like the mobile
version of a Starbucks unicorn
Frappuccino no the three camera lenses
on the back of the p20 pro are what
really deserves your attention Huawei
has gone big with a 40 megapixel main
camera a 20 megapixel monochrome lens
and an 8 megapixel telephoto lens for
helping you zoom in really close that's
a that's a lot of cameras and the p20
pro has a ton of photo features to match
it can take pictures in color or in
black and white it has 5 x hyper zoom
you can take portrait photos with
different lighting scenarios which is a
direct copy of the iPhone 10 Huawei says
the camera can take a usable photo even
in an extremely dark environment and its
software can take much better pictures
over a long exposure time without you
needing a tripod to keep the image from
blurring because let's face it your
hands just aren't that steady but wait
there's more you can take a shot in
under half a second when you double
press the volume down button though you
won't be able to frame it yourself
artificial intelligent settings within
the phone will detect objects like food
people and flowers and automatically
apply the right settings to help photos
look their best
there's also super slow motion video at
960 frames per second just like on the
samsung galaxy s 9 and all that's with
the rear cameras you can take a selfie
portrait too using a 24 megapixel
front-facing camera and apply beauty
mode if you'd like the camera also gives
you the option of saving your selfies
flipped or as you see yourself in
preview there's also a pro mode HDR and
the usual sub settings to play with will
have to fully test the cameras to see
just how well they do now if you don't
think you really need three cameras on
the back always got another phone to the
regular P 20 and this shares many of the
same specs like Android 8.1 Oreo and
lots of internal storage and the ability
to notch or not to not what the Pete's
when he doesn't have is that extra
telephoto lens and the rear cameras
boast fewer megapixels so to break it
down the p20 gets you a 12 megapixel
camera and a 20 megapixel monochrome
lens compared to the p20 pro which gives
you a 40 megapixel main camera and it's
when you make a pixel monochrome lens
the two phones have a few other
differences besides for example the p20
is a little smaller it's not quite as
water-resistant and it has a smaller
battery as well but don't worry you can
still get it in that mesmerizing
Twilight shade check out our first
impressions for even more details and
differences between the P xx and P xx
