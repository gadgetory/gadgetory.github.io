next generation of how we reimagine the
creative process with the unveiling of
both adobe creative cloud as well as
groundbreaking creative suite 6 releases
we hope this will fuel your creativity
through the cloud anywhere anytime and
with anyone the goal for us is to be
able to deliver rapid ongoing innovation
through the cloud for our print web
mobile and application developers our
goal is to be able to attract the next
generation of creative professionals who
demand access to the software in a
mobile environment our goal is to be
able to reinvent the creative process
between creatives and between
enterprises in the agencies that serves
it one of the things that we've been
really hard at work at is taking all of
the pieces of CSX as well as a whole
bunch more services and really stitching
it all together an integrated and
seamless experience the creative club
website is really the place where all of
your cloud-based files will live and you
can manage them there you'll be able to
download and install all of the apps
that you've seen here as well as manage
all the services that we've pulled
together for this and I think probably
the best way to show you all of this is
over at Creative Cloud com so let me um
well let me show you the website you'll
see all of the files that I've started
storing in the Creative Cloud here
there's there's these beautiful previews
that we're doing to give you a very
visual way of browsing around I can sort
things in folders there's a bunch of
tools here for just all kinds of file
management and searching and things like
that but I'm going to go over to the I'm
going to start at the absent services
section now this is a place that we've
built to pull together everything you've
seen so far it is clear and
understandable away as possible you have
access to all of these desktop apps all
you have to do is click to install and
show you that in just a moment it's
everything that comes in CS 6 plus edge
and muse like David mentioned just right
here
fingertips also all of the services that
we've included in Creative Cloud are
listed down here 20 gigabytes of file
storage is included with your membership
you also get to host up to five websites
that you can publish out of any one of
our tools that that does website
publishing that's using our business
catalyst service for hosting and then a
full Typekit membership which makes me
very happy that that comes along with it
as well all of our touch apps are right
down here as well I'm going to show you
some of those as well and all of those
are integrated in the creative cloud
service and we have links here so that
you can get all of those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
