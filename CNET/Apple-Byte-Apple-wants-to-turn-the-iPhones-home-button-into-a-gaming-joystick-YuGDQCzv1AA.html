to the apple pie for all the bits and
bytes good and bad inside the world of
Apple now do you all know that today we
are shooting this on national hugging
day so if there is someone near you yes
I'm talking to you you have to give them
a hug I'm waiting oh okay good job now
as for me I just have to hug myself but
it still feels nice all right let's get
to the show in one of the new products
we expect to see this year is the
unconfirmed 12 inch iPad pro according
to a report from KGI analyst ming-chi
Kuo who makes sure he gets in the Apple
rumor news at least once a month well he
says that an apple stylist will be
available as an optional accessory to
the iPad pro and not bundled to keep the
total price down there's no word if the
stylist will be compatible with other I
devices but it better be some special
magic wand if it actually ends up
costing too much to bundle it now we all
know how Steve Jobs felt about a stylist
who wants a stylist you have to get him
and put him away and you'll lose him
yuck nobody wants a stylist and yes I
know he was talking about a phone in
2007 but the Galaxy Note pretty much
squashed that thinking now the rumored
iPad pro is still expected sometime in
the second quarter of 2015 all right
iphone sales have surged in Asia
according to counterpoint research where
Apple made gains in China Japan and
South Korea for the month of December
now obviously the new big screen iPhones
were the reason why but the biggest
surprise happened in Samsung's own
backyard in South Korea where apple's
market share exploded to thirty-three
percent more than doubling its fifteen
percent market share prior to the launch
of the iphone 6 and 6 plus now even
bigger no foreign brand has gone beyond
the twenty percent mark in the history
of Korea's smartphone industry and Apple
currently sits in the number two spot
ahead of LG but behind Samsung whose
market share dropped from sixty percent
to 46 in the same period ouch so what
else can Apple do to keep their iphone
line relevant well
patently apple recently posted a patent
application from the big a that reveals
apple is hoping to have their current
home button on I devices to double as a
gaming joystick so check this out in the
first mode the home button would act
like it always has but in the second
mode the home button would transform
into a pure gaming stick and the
transition would be simple by pressing
hard enough on the home button with the
help of a pressure sensor to pop it up
who wants this anybody yeah I do and if
you want to control your mac or iphone
or ipad with your eyes that could be
coming in the future as well the US
Patent and Trademark Office recently
granted Apple a patent for a specific I
tracking technology that can be used to
control a user interface on a computer
or smartphone now it's different from
Samsung's that tracks eye movement to
pause the video or scroll through web
pages this invention make sure that
users would not lose their cursor while
controlling the devices with eye
tracking movement again all these
patents aren't guarantees but it's a
peek inside the minds of the smartypants
in cupertino all right to some quick
bites Apple posted a new photo of its
spaceship campus to that's still
currently under construction just to you
know keep us in the loop you get it one
infinite loop is up their address okay
never mind and for all of you that want
to make your own Blythe or Barbie dolls
all fitted with Apple products check out
etsy com and the good people from lelu
miniature they've created a
one-eighth-scale set of Apple devices
that include an imac macbook pro ipads
and iphones for this 45 bucks so you
know maybe you're just a collector or
someone who really loves playing with
dolls hey Brian hey what's up Charlie
hey John Lennon darling the moody talked
about um ya know uh this is jobs Steve
Jobs you can um go now thanks Jen liner
notes Steve Jobs
okay a good amount of you have been
riding in asking what happened at
Apple's free single of the week on
iTunes well I'm sorry but Apple has
quietly decided to end that promo I
stopped downloading them after a while
because really they did add some value
the service but I don't really care
about all the songs but really we'd like
to take a moment to remember the itunes
free single of the week
now apple also went a little cheapy by
discontinuing the 12 days of gifts
chroma as well and yeah for all of you
that weren't happy about it I'm giving
them a bad apple for you but you know
who really deserves a bad apple these
people from a recent episode of The
Price is Right the other goes over if
it's closest to the actual retail price
without going over and uh Kenisha 7,500
what seven thousand dollars with a
one-year contract are you kidding me but
wait it gets better over 7500 7501 no no
come on you dum-dums you guys have
failed humanity and I get it it's the
heat of the moment you're on the price
is right but you know what I'm thrown
out at you bad apples oh alright that's
gonna do it for this week's show keep
emailing me at the Apple by to cnet com
or tweet me at brian Tong and i'll
answer when i can thanks so much for
watching we'll catch you all next time
for another bite of the Apple oh there

all those hard-to-reach places I know
it's a little cold but oh that a little
lint in your belly button here let me
get that out okay oh no no no did we get
soap in your eyes again knows oh stop
struggling with me okay and now Stevie
