in which users don't pay for service
senator we run ads if I'm if I'm mailing
emailing within whatsapp is that every
form your advertisers no we don't see
any of the content in whatsapp it's
fully encrypted right the is there some
algorithm that spits out some
information to your ad platform and then
let's say I get a senator we don't
Facebook do not see the senator I think
the answer to your specific question is
if you've messaged someone about Black
Panther and whatsapp it would not inform
okay there been reports of Facebook can
track and users internet browsing
activity even after that user has logged
off of the Facebook platform can you
confirm whether or not this is true
senator I want to make sure I get this
accurate so probably better to have my
team follow up but you don't know these
I know that these people use cookies on
the internet and that you can probably
correlate activity between between
sessions we do that for a number of
reasons including security and including
measuring ads to make sure that the ad
experiences are the most effective which
of course people can opt out of well
Facebook offered to all of its users a
blanket opt-in to share their privacy
data with any third party users
congresswoman yes that's how our
platform works you have to opt in to
sign into any app before you use it
could somebody call you up and say I
want to see John Kennedy's files
absolutely not
could you if not not could you not would
you do it could you do in theory you
have the right to put my data a name on
my data and Sheriff I do not believe we
have the right to do that we have the
ability senator the data is in the
system so you have the ability
technically I think someone could do
that but that would be a massive breach
so we would never do that
thank you thank you
