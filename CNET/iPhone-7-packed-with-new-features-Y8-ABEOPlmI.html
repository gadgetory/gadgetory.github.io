recognize the iPhone 7 apart from the
iPhone 6s one is that that camera is a
little larger a little bit different
looking and if you slide it to the
bottom
no headphone jack there are a couple of
other things too the antennas are
redesigned and there are a couple of new
color schemes but a lot of what the
iPhone 7 does is on the inside first of
all this is water-resistant
finally a water-resistant iPhone you
should be able to drop in any amount of
water for a short period of time
IP 67 don't go swimming with it but
maybe you could drop it in a toilet if
you wanted it's also got a new home
button so you can't see this right now
but if you click this is not actually
clicking at all this is solid-state so
it's a lot like force touch trackpad
that you've seen on the Mac books and if
you press in you get a tactic feedback
that can be used for pressure sensitive
applications this also has a new
processor the Soundlink faster but it's
more battery efficient so you should be
looking at a few more hours of battery
life not just on the 7 but on the 7 plus
so should it a new mark for battery life
maybe also be a faster phone and finally
that camera if you want to spend up to
the 7 plus you're going to get to 12
megapixel cameras that are going to
Nabal depth of field and zoom and some
some extra camera tricks this will still
have the image signal processor and some
of the other enhanced camera features
that are on the 7 plus so she can
improve photos and faster photos and
more intelligently stitched photos that
pull some of the best features together
so you'll get that the iPhone 7 is
coming out September 16th and it comes
in up to 256 gigabytes of storage is
probably going to be shooting a lot more
photos and maybe a lot more video on
this one
