in barcelona LG has announced a new L
Series this is the L 90 l 70 and l40 all
three phones for an android 4.4 kick
head and they are all running free g not
for gene the l 90 is largest of the trio
at 4.7 inches it's got a 4.7 inch qhd
display a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
processor on the back you have an eight
megapixel camera and there is a 1.3
megapixel camera on the front the phone
has eight gigabytes of storage stepping
down a little bit you've got the l 70
which is ever so slightly smaller at 4.5
inches but it's display is only 800 x
400 pixels it also has a 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core processor it does have the 8

depending on which market it's going to
be in and the front facing camera is vga
storage is also cut by half at four
gigabytes the most entry level of the

70 however the camera is just three
megapixels and it also has four
gigabytes of storage things roll off
with the l9 d launching first in russia
and March with the other ones to follow

you can't guess that the l 90 is going
to be the priciest ngl 40 will be the
least expensive i'm jessica gulfport
