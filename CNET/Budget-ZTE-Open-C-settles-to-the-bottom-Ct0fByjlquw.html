might want to think about looking at the
ZTE open sea this is a Firefox
smartphone that we first saw at Mobile
World Congress and it is inexpensive in
fact unlocked you can get it for eighty
dollars about 80 pounds and 84 euros now
overall you are looking at a bare-bones
phone which is why the price is able to
be so low the specs are just enough to
survive you've got a 4-inch display
right over here you've got a 3 megapixel
camera on the back no flash no front
facing camera and annoyingly no auto
focus now that isn't ZTE s fault that is
just not turned on in the operating
system yet but we'll get to that in a
minute the phone itself is small like i
said and pocketable it's got a soft
touch matte coating on the back I've got
it here in black but in Barcelona and we
also saw it in bright blue and a bright
orange and those were very pretty we've
got some silvery accents along the Seine
volume rocker here you charge up your
phone here and when you pop off the back
cover you've got a microSD card slot
that will take up to 32 gigabytes in
external storage 1400 milliamp hour
battery and a full size SIM card slot
now the phone only supports gsm + 3g
speeds for now but the next version of
firefox is going to turn on cdma support
for those networks and also 4g LTE
support the Firefox OS is pretty easy to
navigate you've got your static icons
here on the bottom including an FM radio
you have a lot of collections of apps
and folders and you can even add your
own when you press and hold down there
called smart collections there are other
games and apps you can access through
the marketplace you also have your
social networks like Twitter and
Facebook a note-taking app calendar and
alarm clocks plus maps this is
definitely not a high-performing phone
the resolution is a little bit weak
image quality was pretty poor and even
though there is a dual-core processor on
here I found the phone pretty laggy so
again this is mostly for first timers
who are just looking for a very
inexpensive starter smartphone I'm
