only my passport pro purple drive phone
deputy w has been busy putting one
together for a while for example a while
ago admit these black to do on drive
right here to drive in one and now of
course this new drive right here if you
put 11 together eventually something
will happen it gets bit this exact the
case of the new my passport pro it is
basically the biggest purple drive I
have the scene there's more to this it
also the very first bus power
thunderbolt port bow dr that offer for
terabyte of storage space and because on
the inside has come with what not one
but two internal drive to tell by each
they are actually combine into one
volume in a rate zero configuration to
offer the maximum space and also the
fast speed but you can also use them in
red one in case you worry about the data
loss in case one of the drives fail now
like all purple dries you're not
supposed to replace the into a drive by
yourself they are both laugh inside
these all aluminum casings very rugged
sole it and quite heavy now if that
scares you you can actually offer the
two terabyte version that is some
twenty-five percent thinner and lighter
how do I know well how about because I
have one right here which is the last
one I can pull out for behind this there
we go the tute a bar right here take a
look it is significantly thinner now
personally I don't buy the thicker one
but if you travel a lot the thinner one
might suit you better now this is a
thunderbolt drive so where the
Thunderbolt port well that's done and
that is where I love about the desire
this drive right here take a look around
the edge it here you can see there's the
lie wrapping around the drive that in
fact it is a built-in attached
Thunderbolt cable you can peel out like
that and a comply get to a computer and
you are done and when you're done with
the work you can actually hide it back
okay I've seen there is no extra
Thunderbolt port you cannot pluck
another Thunderbolt device to this right
here but you can still use it in a daisy
chain set up as long as you use it
at the end of the chain our nori over
here there is small ventilation fan that
runs only when the drys get hot but in
my testing it never became hard that to
trigger the fan and for that the dry is
very quiet now the new my passport
prosupport only Thunderball and that
means is very much a mac only device in
my testing was really fast offering the
sustained copy speed up some 180
megabyte per second for writing and
almost Hannah 17 megabyte per second for
reading now that's about the fastest
among all Thunderball hard drive bays
korbo drives I've seen there are other
dry drive faster but they all use
solid-state drives on the inside now the
use of the regular hot rod on the inside
here means the my passport pro is quite
affordable for now it costs about four
hundred thirty dollars for 45 or three
hundred sixty dollar for two terabyte
the price includes a three year warranty
now if I more than you drive here check
out my full review I said calm you know
is one of my favorites and it has
nothing to do with the find it comes in
yellow package it's just a great drive
for Mike user and by saying that I just
made it even a little bit better and you
had no choice but to agree with me and
that's because I'm don't know and this
has been the first look at the my
passport pro from WT</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
