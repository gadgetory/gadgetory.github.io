years now but
ecobee is latest thermostat the two
hundred and forty nine dollar eco before
has officially bypassed nest as the best
premium smart thermostat the eco before
retains the same responsive touchscreen
design and third-party partners as its
previous models but this version also
has Alexa capabilities no I don't mean
it works with Alexa the device itself is
an Alexa speaker not only can you
control your thermostat with Alexa you
can also say all the same stuff you'd
say with an Amazon echo echo dot or tap
like Alexa turn on the great room fan
okay this may not be a great value if
your thermostat isn't centrally located
but it's still a really clever
integration especially if you don't want
to stand alone Alexa device the Eco b4
also comes with the remote sensor we
stuck ours in the smart home bourbon
room to track temperature consistency
hey Siri what's the temperature in the
bourbon room the morbid room temperature
in your CNET smart home is at 66 degrees
Fahrenheit if you're already familiar
with eco be everything else is pretty
much the same access your thermostat
settings in the Android or iPhone app or
in the web app and use if to smart
things apple homekit or alexa to add
advanced functionality it won't be worth
the two hundred and forty nine dollars
if you aren't interested in these
integrations but the Eco before is
definitely the smartest smart thermostat
we've ever reviewed that plus it's
reliable performance makes it our top
pick for smart thermostats today and an
Editors Choice Award winner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
