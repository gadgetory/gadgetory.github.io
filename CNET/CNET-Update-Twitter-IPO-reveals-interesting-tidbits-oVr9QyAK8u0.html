Carey and this is your cnet update
twitter is going public the
micro-blogging site is on track to make
its stock market debut in November and
it's hoping to raise 1 billion dollars
from investors in its filing with the
Security and Exchange Commission it
shared its financial data for the first
time and there are a few interesting
tidbits for one twitter is not
profitable right now in the first half
of the year it brought in two hundred
and fifty four million dollars but it
spent more than that currently it has a
net loss of nearly 70 million in no year
has twitter made a profit however that
could change the network is on track to
double its revenue from last year we
also learned twitter has 218 million
users which is less than the fifth of
the size of Facebook Twitter is better
than Facebook at making money from
mobile users about 75% of active users
on Twitter each month access it from a
mobile device and that's where it makes
most of its ad revenue but when people
use other programs to access Twitter
like TweetDeck or some mac programs it
can't fully calculate member activity so
that means Twitter doesn't see the full
picture and in other social media money
making news Instagram will soon be
inserting photo and video advertisements
into the stream for us members Instagram
said users will notice the occasion
we'll add in the next couple of months
here's another reason why you should not
use the same password on multiple
websites three million accounts of Adobe
users or a hacked and usernames and
passwords were compromised adobe says
it's notifying everyone impacted and
resetting passwords the hackers will
likely use those passwords on other
websites and email accounts to see if
Keys can open other doors so to speak
anyone affected should change other
logins that use the same password the
attackers also got credit and debit card
information but they were encrypted
nevertheless anyone affected should keep
an eye on their bank and credit accounts
Adobe will provide one year of free
credit monitoring membership for
compromised users this also goes beyond
passwords the hackers got source code
for Adobe programs including Acrobat and
cold
usion getting the source code means
hackers can study it to find flaws to
make malware or exploit it in other ways
the iphone 5c Apple's colorful new
iPhone has been on sale for two weeks
and already it is discounted for fifty
dollars at best buy the retailer will
take fifty dollars off the price of the
5c but it's also applying the sale to
some galaxy smartphones like the s4 and
the note to the deal lasts through
Monday that's your tech news update but
you can get more details at cnet com /
