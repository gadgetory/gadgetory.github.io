the room well done someone called me a
snorlax today yeah you're like oh I said
what pokemon do I remind you of he goes
Snorlax I look up Snorlax free coconut
sleeps all day and it's like a fat mess
it's a big one yeah thanks friends
Pokemon go has had a huge week and we
just have to talk about it just a little
bit if you've got a question or comment
about Pokemon go you obviously do
because you've you're playing it right
now probably on your other phone who
knows anyway make sure you chime in and
we'll get to as many questions and/or
comments as we can so Sam Jake tell me
about your thoughts your passions your
dreams your hopes your futures with
Pokemon go Oh specifically about Mongo
yeah okay no not like not my love my
dreams yeah there's another show for
that okay what yeah what have you been
playing I specifically have not been
playing because then I wouldn't do any
of my work okay however I went out and
two of my friends left the bar to go
find Pokemon and then what I'm thinking
that was at these gyms is that what
they're called yeah just don't you like
can't you meet other Pokemon players yes
i'm waiting for the first love story to
come out of it oh that's definitely
happened like it's definitely been like
one night pokemon ghost and oh yeah
there should be like oh I can't wait
till inevitably someone there will be a
couple against Mary the hot kids do and
then like how did you go okay mom and
dad how did you meet well there was a
Bulbasaur Central Park your mother just
couldn't let it go yeah looks just like
that I love blossom and that's how it
all worked then you came around five
years later hahaha yeah so I I haven't
been playing a lot I've seen it I it's
not on my phone because like you said I
need to have a life I can't be bothered
with like you know squirtles and whatnot
um and jigglypuffs which is happy take a
listen
manager kocaman to be put but what about
you Jake and I haven't played i
downloaded yesterday if you went out and
we kind of did like human to pokemon
story so yeah we went to do that some
people were like really into it we met
some people from Italy who like came
over and like we're waiting for it to be
really we don't have this they don't
have to have a very excited but some
people like saying there's like a whole
community or attitude pretty crazy to
see like I tell I think it's something
worth appreciating the social phenomenon
that it has created right where you have
a thing that everyone can play right
mostly if you've got a smartphone you
can do it you can be a part of the whole
party right so I think that is something
really kind of special that most games
don't really nothin really that was a
big thing is that you get out and like
it somebody said it gave them something
to do while they were like walking
around so it's kind of like a walking
for walking in your life regularly and
seeing a beautiful city like New York
that's boring yeah I can't do that can't
do that but their branding it as a are
like augmented reality but it's not
really a are because you have to be in
the app all the time well and it's like
yeah and you're walking in it needs to
be open when you're walking for anything
to evolve sure and it only goes into a
are when a Pokemon approaches yeah a
regular overlay it like a map that Rory
show which makes sense i mean kill i
think the whole sort of accessibility
like most people if two weeks ago if you
said hey what's a are they like i have
no idea how long about at the very least
if this is done anything to educate the
public it is that Oh AR this is what it
is like whenever I now need to convey
that idea that concept to somebody like
you did Pokemon go right that's a our
chat do you overlay on top of the real
world which which i think is pretty cool
well I mean what else how long do you
think this last let's be honest I same
months I think you think we've got a
month left I think so okay so I say
three and a half weeks we're gonna love
it I feel like in two weeks it's not
really gonna be like much of a thing I
don't know I feel like it's just taking
up too much time like it's yeah you know
people are leaving work someone got in a
car crash I mean miserable awful things
happen yeah that stuff's been happening
unfortunately and it's kind of evolving
i know we we there were some stories
yesterday that business owners are
paying to like have like the owners of
the gyms come to them right but then
like I feel like it's interrupting
experience you're like the true players
in the game they don't have to go and
like have to pay to like ketchup okay
now that's real bad it's not gonna be
good for an item at its and I think like
see I think for the next two weeks will
over three weeks up to a month we'll
have that sort of hangover but then
don't forget all the copycat stuff oh
yeah like if your developer or mobile
developers you've been and you've been
even thinking about doing something with
a are you're all over it now that I'm
rushing to go to that out and coming out
get it certified and get it put in the
store so I'm excited about that though
to see more a our game yeah I mean I'm
all down for that okay very cool we got
some questions about Pokemon go some
comments let's toss it to Mike in the
control room alright so Jason and our
chat commented on that his wife is 29
and pregnant but it's not stopping her
from hunting Pokemon in this game Cesar
wants to know what you guys think about
the the Pokemon go plus the wristband
accessory and Pablo is also asking how
how far do you think Pokemon go we'll go
yeah I think we answered that last one
um I mean personally and I don't want to
i wanna be like to go hating on
programming because that i think it's i
think they kind of cool but I just
needed it's at a ten I needed to be like
a six yeah it's a little little too much
in my favorites that's all maybe I don't
know think about real life for a second
oh and there's gonna keep it going as
long as they're valuing up by Oh
millions of dollars yeah yeah they're
gonna push it as much as they can yeah
even if it dies down there still gonna
be putting out updates for it and trying
to fix Oh it'll definitely be up there
there'll be new features and whatnot
what about the risk accessory they're
going much about that for I think
they're ready like 35 40 bucks but
they're on ebay for like three hundred
five hundred dollars and essentially it
adds like another element to the game
all right you know what it does it cuz
I'm not super I think it allows you to
catch pokemon when your phone is not
there see that's actually good that's
what it is okay yeah to have something
while your phone's not on right or at
least not yeah you know open with the
app that way
be and it looks like a Peruvian so if I
kind of like what did you know that
Pokemon means pocket monsters what's
that yeah pop Pokemon means pocket
monsters oh ok i thought it was a Maya I
could see that yeah that's pretty cool
pretty good the more you know thanks Sam
yeah that little nugget of info uh let
speaking of nintendo nintendo announced
a brand new micro console oh it's so
cool i believe the nes is probably older
than the both of you which just need a
moment of silence for that's really
weird anyway um so there was this game
system in the 80s and it was called the
nes and it was like the first major home
console and they're releasing this as a
sixty-dollar little device packed in
with 30 games this is really cool stuff
have you guys played I played the games
I mean doesn't that seem like a good
deal to get that many games I've a
pretty good deal I think like for me you
know you look at the games that they're
offering its 30 games a lot of that
stuff is sort of spread out on the
Virtual Console stuff that they've been
offering the last couple of years on the
Wii the Wii U the DS the 3ds I think
it's like a really nice idea to get all
that consolidated into one thing another
cool thing the the little mini nes has
the same port that the wii controller
has so you can likely plug in any of
those old pro controller or any of those
accessories that you might have for Liam
will you pop it in there you're good to
go it also comes with the original
square rectangle nes controller you can
buy another one I feel like yeah it's 60
bucks but it's like that $60 like I
almost want to call it a stocking
stuffer sort of thing it's got the
packaging first up and so it's like a
lot of stars and graphics and you're
like oh I get it this is like at the
checkout line at target something like
that so I think it's actually a really
cool idea you guys are you guys into it
I think it's going to be I'm excited for
Donkey Kong yeah I think it's gonna be
popular do you a lot of my friend to
college xiamen oh yeah I'm college gonna
put their money on just plug it right
into the to it right in the size it's
gonna perform and they'll probably
release like a yellow one with 30 years
and a blue one they'll do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
