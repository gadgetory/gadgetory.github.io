welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
the new iPad pro is available now and
check this out I got the brand new
spankin twelve point nine inch model and
I got to tell you fast don't lie come on
it's easily apple's fastest mobile
device and you can feel it look I'm just
like sliding through my comics like that
boom moving through the apps like that
boom boom oh let's go check out Twitter
boom yeah it is fast now the new
promotion screen lives up to the hype
Apple wasn't kidding when they called it
buttery smooth and if you're someone who
has ever owned a previous iPad you'll be
able to instantly tell this is a
different beast now we just have to wait
for the official release of iOS 11 but
I'm more than happy with the new iPad
pro and you should be too in fact new
benchmark tests from their feats show
the new a 10x based iPad pros may
outperform the new 2017 MacBook Pros and
2016 models in some cases based on
Geekbench and GFX bench tests now the
new iPad pros can't top single core
processor performance that's just not
going to happen but in their tests the
iPad pros beat out the 2016 MacBook Pro
in multi-core performance also in
Geekbench metal GPU tests the iPad pros
outperformed the 2017 and 2016 MacBook
Pros and in addition the GFX bench
graphics test the iPad pros edged out
both MacBook Pro models again now this
doesn't reflect true real-world
performance and the higher resolution
displays on MacBook Pros also factored
in but the fact is that the new iPad
pros are even close and in some cases
outperforming MacBook Pros from this
year and last year shows that it's a
beast of a device now there's always new
rumors and developments around the
iPhone 8 the Japanese website Nikkei
Asian review reports that the CEO of
iPhone assembler whisperin says the
assembly process for previous iPhones
hasn't changed much but new features
like waterproof and wireless charging
now require some different testing and
the waterproof function alters the
assembly process just a bit those new
features yeah not confirmed yet now
improved water resistance to an IP 68
rating and wireless charging have been
rumored for the new phones but this
could apply to both the flagship iPhone
8 and the updated iPhone 7s and
evanesce plus models all right more
alleged leaks keep coming and the latest
posted on reddit thanks to a friend in
the industry shows what is believed to
be the rear shells of the iPhone 7s the
7s plus with its dual lens camera and
the next to that the front and rear
parts for the iPhone 8 that feature a
thin bezel on the edges on the front and
a vertical dual camera lens on the rear
side now the big thing to notice no rear
touch ID sensor on these purported
shells as well these parts match up with
the latest concept renders from eyedrop
news and as we put all the pieces
together it's getting more and more
clear exactly how the 10th anniversary
iPhone will look like I'm pretty sure my
five-year-old nephew could drop by now
hi Tyler I'll write another Nikkei
report says larg on precision a
well-known Apple component supplier
announced that it will be shipping 3d
depth sensing lenses in the second half
of 2017 for an unnamed company you know
hmm I wonder who that could be for now
Larkin supplies most the rear camera
lenses used for the iPhone 7 and 7 plus
and these new lenses will help with face
recognition capabilities to allow us to
unlock our phone with our face but
another use could also be for augmented
reality now Apple showcased its AR kit
at their WWDC keynote and developers are
finally showing some of their first
cracks at it Kody Brown showed off a
demo using AR kit unity 3d and the widow
maker from overwatch ne told motherboard
it's more elegant to use and he added
one of the incredible aspects is how a
arc it handles lighting adjustments in
real time you can see that here now you
can also find a bunch of these types of
demo videos online to see what people
are doing the team from view AR shows
how you can map objects to in an
environment and they say exactly in
their place no matter where you go but
come on how about this rain forest
garage by 8/9 where he torches this
garage door to make a cutout and what's
behind it a rain forest I want to go
there
now this is just the start of how people
are learning to play with Eric it and we
can only expect some great stuff to come
to us in the future now also I'm still
trying to think who exactly the home pot
is for other than someone who buys
anything Apple makes we know Apple is
positioning it as a music speaker that
happens to also be a smart speaker but
at 3:49 if someone is buying that isn't
that the same person with money that
already has a great
speaker home theater system or even a
sound bar setup already and won't they
probably have an Amazon echo or Google
home already
plus if you want stereo sound you're
paying $700 for two of them now a recent
poll of 2,200 adults from the morning
consult found that 33% of those people
were interested in the home pot but that
number dropped only 30% when they were
shown a comparison to the echo or the
home now among those surveyed who
already owned Apple products their
initial interest was at 45% and then
dropped to 40 percent after they were
shown other competitors as well now when
it came down to it 17% they would most
likely buy the echo 11 percent said the
cheaper echo dot Google's home was also
at 11% and only nine percent said they
would buy a home pot now 57 percent of
respondents said price is very important
when considering a smart speaker you
don't say
now we also ask for your WWDC keynote
thoughts and here a few of Apple byte
nation's responses Jay Rodolfo Rodriguez
says Brian Brian
are you blind it's a pine apple holy
crap now that's worth 349 mark
Christopher emails us with now that WWDC
happened and we saw what i OS 11 is
going to look like I think this has made
me finally want to go over to Android I
just don't see anything truly new with
iOS I mean look at control center what's
up with that
iOS used to be clean and sophisticated
now it's just the same thing different
day and in my opinion uglier hey mark
you make a point but we'll see if you
really jump over because you know
there's this power of the ecosystem that
is quite strong all right James Conner
writes in what's up with the Mac Mini
sorry bro but still not a single piece
alright that's it for this week's show
you can email us at the Apple byte at
Cena comm or tweet me at Brian Tong but
before we go I just want to congratulate
my Golden State Warriors for winning
their second NBA World Championship in
two years nothing but respect for LeBron
and company but the dub showed us off
they are truly Ultimate Warrior
all right thanks so much for watching
we'll catch y'all next time for another
bite of the Apple
Moo's Ultimate Warrior's Cleveland
Cleveland you did not pass the test
before you for it is the ultimate Wars
the broad you cry baby the broad you got
what you asked for
hello it is our time our time for the
ultimate boy aah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
