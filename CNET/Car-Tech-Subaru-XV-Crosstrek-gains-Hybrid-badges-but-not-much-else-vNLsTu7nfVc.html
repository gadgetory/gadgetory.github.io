symmetrical all-wheel drive system and
the legendary 2-liter boxer for with a
hybrid twist could this be the most
crunchy granola Subaru of all time
let's hop behind the wheel of this 2014
Subaru XV Crosstrek hybrid and check the
tech now the interior should come as no
surprise if you've ever seen or sat in a
current generation Impreza because like
I said it's basically the same vehicle
inside we've got an interior that's nice
it's not gonna convince you that this is
a luxury vehicle but that's not really
the point here what we do have is
materials and a design that reminds me a
lot of what Volkswagens doing right now
it's simple its understated it's not
gonna wow you but it's also not gonna
feel really cheap when you touch it and
that's a good thing at this price point
in the center of the dashboard we've got
the standard in a faux tainment system
and it's not really gonna wow you but it
does have a lot of good inputs we've got
an auxilary input we've got USB and iPod
connectivity
we've got bluetooth for hands-free
calling and audio streaming now at the
top of the dash sport we've got our
multi information display and that's
gonna be a small screen up there that's
gonna basically show you a variety of
information about what's going on with
your fuel economy and the hybrid system
so we've got not one but three different
fuel economy screens one's gonna be
historic to are gonna be instantaneous
we've also got the all-wheel drive
screen that's gonna be on a lot of these
current generation Subaru vehicles and
that's gonna show you what your
all-wheel drive system is doing but
because Subaru all-wheel drive systems
are symmetrical all-wheel drive full
time it's pretty much just gonna show
you that it can all wheel drive all time
it's a pretty useless screen in this
situation and then finally we've got an
interesting screen it's the fuel savings
scream and what that's gonna do is show
you how much time your engine has not
been running and then one of the
benefits of a hybrid is that you're able
to shut that engine down and run an
electric mode every now and then and
then also shut it down when you're
idling so this is going to show you how
long the end has not been running when
you're behind the wheel and how much
fuel you saved now under the hood it
doesn't look very different from what
you would expect to find underneath
pretty much any other impressive
plataform vehicle right here in the
middle we've got our boxer 4 it's going
to displace about two liters and it's
going to punch out of either side so
it's wide but not very tall that's gonna
be made it would Subaru symmetrical
all-wheel drive system that's gonna put
power to all four corners now up front
we've got also two batteries that's a
little confusing usually only feed one
under hood battery and one in the trunk
battery but we've got three in total
here I'm not really sure what Subaru is
doing here and even though Subaru is
frequently a partner with Toyota this
hybrid system has actually been
developed completely in-house by Subaru
Toyota had no hand in it that probably
explains why it's a little weird in
between this engine and the all-wheel
drive system is an electric motor that's
been tared with a continuously variable
transmission and that's actually going
to give this car a fuel economy bumped
thanks to a nickel metal battery pack
that you'll find in the trunk
fuel economy here it's 33 on the highway
29 in the city and that's gonna average
out to about 31 miles per gallon now
that average is only about three miles
per gallon more than the standard XP
part of that is because this vehicle is
about 300 pounds heavier here we're
looking at about 160 horsepower and 163
pound-feet of torque that's about 12
more horsepower than the standard XV and
about 18 more pound-feet and if you
wanted to have a little bit more fun
with that extra power you could actually
shift virtual gears with the paddle
shifters you got sort of 6fo gears there
but I wouldn't really bother because
fun's not really the point here I've
been able to cruise in pure electric
mode at speeds about under 20 miles per
hour you're in stopping to a traffic
here creeping along at under 20 miles
per hour you'll be able to take
advantage of that easy mode to save fuel
she won't be able to do it for very long
it's not a very big battery on this
thing but at highway speeds the CVT just
sort of holds your rpms at a weird sort
of droney level and so you kind of get
this weird
constant humming and it's even worse
when you're trying to do is zero to
sixty run the revs just kind of jump up
to about five or six thousand rpms and
they just hang there you don't really
get that sort of status by shifting and
of course you can shift yourself but
they're fake shifts so why even bother
and the transition from gasoline to
electric power can be a little bit less
than smooth and even though this car has
about ten more horsepower than the
standard XP it just doesn't really feel
like there's a performance gain it
doesn't really feel like there's a big
efficiency gain and so it seems a bit
like you're just paying an extra four
thousand dollars for a car that's
quieter when you're idling and has a
hybrid badge on the outside now pricing
your 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek hybrid is
easy because they're Li two choices to
make there's the standard model that
starts at twenty five nine nine five and
then there's a limited model that's
going to add navigation leather and a
power sunroof for about thirty thousand
dollars either way it's a dubious sell
because the advantages that you gain
over the standard XV are minimal at best
and if you're looking at a hybrid you've
got the c-max
and the Prius V that are going to give
you a lot better fuel economy here the
weird thing about this XV Crosstrek
hybrid is that it kind of over
complicates Subaru simple message so for
my money I think I'd go standard XV or
I'd get a real hybrid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
