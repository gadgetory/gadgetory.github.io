I'm Bridget Carey and this is your scene
that update the competition is heating
up in the streaming music world this
week Spotify is launching a service to
its mobile apps called browse it
features playlist put together by
computer calculations and Spotify
employees and these music playlists are
labeled for different moods and
situations like when you're going on a
jog or trying to set a romantic mood
sounds like Spotify is trying to do the
same thing as Songza which also has its
staff put together create a playlist for
different situations and moods there
will soon also be another music service
that does the same thing the revamp of
the subscription service mog code named
daisy will also focus on curated
playlists this new mog or daisy or
whatever they're going to call it is run
by beats electronics and the company
hired music industry experts to come up
with playlist including trent reznor
from nine inch nails it's expected to
launch in a few months so clearly the
concept that got songs a popular is
going to be featured in more services
attention phablet fans the new Samsung
Galaxy Note will be revealed on
September forth during a technology
trade show in Berlin bigger than a phone
but too small to be a tablet the samsung
note was the original phablet and this
note 3 is expected to have a 5.7 inch
1080p high def screen with a stylus but
the note hasn't been the only phablet on
the block a photo was posted online that
said to be the HTC One max sporting a
5.9 inch screen this phablet could also
be released next month and Microsoft
lower the price of its surface pro
tablet by 100 bucks so the 64 gig model
now starts at eight hundred dollars this
discount comes three weeks after
Microsoft dropped the surface RT tablet
prices by thirty percent although the
pro is more expensive it will likely be
the surface model you want to go with
since it has the full version of Windows
8 and it isn't limited to only using
programs in the Windows app store the
pro model also comes with a stylus but
you got to pay extra for the keyboard
cover and for office software
Google is finally releasing a free app
that helps you find your lost phone it's
called Android device manager apolis had
find my iphone four years now and
android users have had to deal with
using third-party apps and not all of
them work well but google says it will
release this new feature later this
month and it lists phone owners ring
their phone at a max volume or c word is
on a map and if your film can't be
recovered you can erase the data from
afar that your tech news update you can
