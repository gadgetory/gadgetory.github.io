term for vaporizing maybe as we talk we
can come up with something better than
that you don't like they think I don't
love it just in case you haven't heard
of vaping it let me tell you all about
it those wait guys to help me they fit
up these are smokeless cigarette ahead
state the word sucking the tech
industries attempt to re-engineer
smoking do I inhale at the same time as
it like a cigarette like a cigarette I
visited silicon valley-based thermo
essence technologies where they are
designing and manufacturing their own
high-tech vaporizer it's kind of warm no
it's not not supposed to hurt you it
does not involve combustion which is
taking a flame to tobacco and burning it
underneath it instead what happens here
is the tobacco is heated that's where
you would put it and turned into vapor
you can inhale and exhale that vapor but
you don't get combustion so a you're not
destroying the material that you're
trying to inhale anyway and be you don't
have the negative side effects and
consequences of smoke we're not
regulated by the FDA but we in a way
suffering it it helps us sleep at night
knowing we're not giving people
something that can off gas or can melt
would people look at this and say it's
an electronic cigarette some of our
products are certainly what we would
consider a performance electronic
cigarette and we actually build our
atomizers the little magic part of the
device that generates the vapor is our
technology that we build right here you
know 10 feet over that way have a clean
metal tube that is electroless nickel
plated there's no solder no plastic no
unknown materials
it's this precision technology that has
made thermo essence vaporizers popular
here and around the world I'm trying to
figure out if I can hold it in a cooler
way you look pretty cool you're just
saying that feel kind of Sherlock Holmes
e looks fun right but that was without
nicotine chin you want to try some
nicotine of course I mean no I do
actually cuz I want to know how it
tastes how about a dose that a lifetime
smoker would consume seriously so this
missing you I swear to god that's not
killing me because it was awful after a
few more puffs I realized this maybe was
not my thing I'm sweating like that is
haha are you happy but the folks at
thermo essence technologies clearly see
a future where tobacco and other
substances like medical marijuana could
be delivered in a safer way than smoking
and then there's way way into the future
when who knows what we might inhale
people are looking at flavored liquids
there's a way to kind of state your
desire to eat a sweet you know and so as
a potential weight loss or as a
potential curb your cravings method you
get that flavor and that feeling so I
could just have like a little espresso
and then I let gaya the guy at Harvard
made inhalable lobster I don't want to
inhale that but maybe in the matrix like
feature where we just can't or if we
can't farm them anymore paper doodle doo
we're always on at cnet com I'm
Hollywood I don't know I'm scooping up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
