and this is the prize fight you've been
waiting for between two of the top
android titans it's a prize 5-foot shout
between the Samsung Galaxy s4 and the
HTC One our judges for this fight are
senior editor Brian boom-boom Bennet
senior editor Jessica the people's soul
quartz and myself reeling a ding dong
that will take all three judges scores
and average them out to the nearest
tenth each round the final prize five
score will be an average of all rounds
using the same system let's get it
started
round 1 is design the Samsung Galaxy s4
brings its biggest screen yet with a
5-inch HD Super AMOLED display with 441
pixels per inch but it's screen is
dimmer compared to others some people
still complain about its plastic style
body which really isn't that big of a
deal but it keeps a very similar design
to the s3 and still can't compete with
the build of other phones now the HTC
One is sex on a phone with its beautiful
contoured aluminum body polished metal
edges and it's the best built Android
phone you've ever seen it brings a
slightly smaller 4.7 inch screen but it
has a higher 468 pixels per inch density
that's brighter and less reflective the
HTC one's designed still can't be beat
and it takes this round with a perfect 5
and the X 4 gets a 4 next round is user
interface and control
the galaxy s4 brings its snappy TouchWiz
interface running on top of Android
4.2.2
it really looks a lot like previous
versions except there's even more UI
bells and whistles tucked in here that
you'll have to dig for deep into the
settings now if you don't know what you
can do just pull down the notifications
bar and you'll see everything and I mean
everything
now we don't think the interface is bad
and the UI is still just as customizable
but it's not as clean anymore because
there's a lot going on here
HTC is next-gen since UI is just as fast
and snappy running on top of Android
4.1.2 it's super clean and easy to
operate but time will tell how quickly
it will receive future updates their new
blinkfeed panel shows you all your
social media updates and it's a sweet
Flipboard like edition but if you don't
like it you can't really get rid of it
now you'll still get all the androids
customizations for creating folders and
widgets but between the two phones this
is the cleaner experience these tasty
see one gets a 4.7 and the galaxy s4
gets a 4 doctor averaging two rounds the
HTC One leaves big 4.9 2 for next round
is features samsung galaxy s4 is truly
the king of features with its powerful
1.9 gigahertz core quad processor so
let's just tell you some of the unique
things that can do even if you won't use
them all it has a replaceable battery
and memory expansion two things the HTC
one doesn't have it also takes a page
from the note and brings multi window
support to run two apps at the same time
it has air view from previewing content
like blowing up text on a website by
floating your finger on top of it if you
want to be a Jedi scroll through
pictures with the wave of a hand with
its air gesture support eat your heart
out Yoda now watch a video and then turn
away and the video clip will stop until
your eyes return to the screen
it also has an interface built s voice
drive to keep your eyes on the road and
it can even be used as a fitness device
to track your steps oh yeah it also has
the watch on app to act as your TV
remote and that's still not everything
the ACC one brings a blazing quad core
1.7 gigahertz processor and its power
button is also an IR blaster that can be
used as a TV remote now the ACC ones
biggest distinguishing feature is its
boomsound dual frontal stereo speakers
that sound better than anything I've
heard on a phone so far and it's that
good now you can add on all the Android
jellybean features like Google Maps for
turn-by-turn and speech-to-text for
search and directions NFC for sending
content from one phone to the other and
Google now for happenings around you but
both phones can do this the galaxy s4
really can do almost everything and it
gets a perfect vibe and the HTC One gets
a four next round is web browsing no
time
both phones have their standard browsers
and chrome so you're pretty much getting
the same web quality experience the
galaxy s4 is a larger screen is nice but
I take a ccs dual boomsound speakers
over a slightly bigger screen with
excellent deal playback on both now as
usual this tends to come down to the
camera and its really Samsung's 13
megapixel camera and cornucopia of
shooting modes including the drama mode
for action shots or beauty mode which
I've been advised to use and the dual
shot mode that uses both the rear and
front facing cameras and I guess that
can be fun and it's editing features are
just as extensive ACC has its own
special camera tricks with its 4
megapixel ultrapixel that does the best
job of handling low-light situations
without a flash the Zoe feature can
remove objects from photos take action
shots and has its own batch of cool
filters as well now there's a lot of
bells and whistles and it comes down to
image quality I personally prefer the
HTC One overall but really majority
rules here and the galaxy s4 edges out
to the HTC One 5 to 4.3 so after
averaging four rounds the s4 has a
slight lead and this decision comes down
to the final round its performance both
phones are snapping performers and their
processor performance is basically the
same using the phone we tested graphics
performance for gaming and the s4 edged
out the ACC one but the results were so
close it was pretty much negligible now
the big find here is that the s4 is 200
megahertz boost didn't yield any clear
performance benefits battery life will
be different for everyone but the HTC
One has a power saver mode to save you
more juice now in our battery video
drain test both bones were close to 10
hours of juice and that's pretty much a
push call quality will vary on your
carrier and location but from our
testing both phones were solid these are
two great performing smartphones but not
the best when it comes to battery life
and we're handing out four
each side let's average out all five
ramp in a prizefight where a CC jumped
out early samsung stormed back with two
perfect rounds but this prize fight ends
up in a tie at 4.5 points a piece now
you know we can't end it like that and
we couldn't even end it with hundreds of
a point so we had to take it the
thousands of a point and the Samsung
Galaxy s4 takes this prize fight four
point five three two two four point five
three and is your prize by it winner
will fool you guys you can't deny that
these are two amazing phones and if I
had to personally make my own pick it
would be the HTC one but really the
final decision is always up to you
I'm Brian Kong thanks for watching I'll
catch you guys next time for another
prizefight
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
