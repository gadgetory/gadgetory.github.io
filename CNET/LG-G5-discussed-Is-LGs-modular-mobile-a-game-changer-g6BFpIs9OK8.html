smartphone dream so it's basically made
its new flagship phone with different
bits you can slide in and out a kind of
taken apart and put it back together
again design with removable bits but is
that any good Jessica what I'm you know
I think it's really interesting this is
something that nobody's done before
they've talked about it Google talked
about it and that phone number came to
fruition so the fact that LG has
actually done this is noteworthy that
doesn't necessarily mean it's good so
the part that comes out is actually the
battery that slides off the bottom on
the chin of the phone that's the very
bottom you can pull that off but the
battery and something else or some of
those modules have their own extended
batteries and then you put them back in
I think it's a really interesting idea I
think you know we saw some of the extra
modules and I think some of them could
be useful some of them are maybe a
little bit sillier but in order for this
to succeed I think that we're going to
have to see a lot more third-party
modules that really offer some extra
value in something new so one of the
things I kind of liked about it is there
was like a camera case that you sort of
slot the phone into and and it gives you
a physical shutter button and like zoom
controls and stuff so that actually
slots into where the battery goes is
that right you sort of pulled the
battery of the chin out and then the
phone goes into this camera case exactly
it would attach through the battery
almost that's sort of the contact point
and then everything else would be sort
of built around it so you could really
do anything with it I think as long as
it is extending the value of what the
phone does like in your case you take a
lot of pictures Andy I do so for you
being able to kind of take pictures in a
different way or have those more
physical controls I think would be value
add for that now one thing with the
module of course is that it is a pain in
the you-know-what you kind of remove and
put back in this isn't something that
people are going to do a lot because you
turn off your phone every single time
you do it I think we would all praise LG
for trying something different
especially in a smartphone era where
we're seeing loads and those are very
very similar bits of technology but the
real question is should Samsung be
worried Andy is this a game changer yes
or no no this is not I don't think this
is near enough the modular dream that
we've been wanting it's not the project
ara that we've seen where you can swap
the camera unit completely or the
processor or the RAM or the storage it's
it's it's a nice phone with some good
accessories but that's it I'm just
briefly what's your verdict it's risky I
like risk I like doing something
different but Samsung just has the
market share they throw a lot of money
at marketing and I don't know if it's
going to move the needle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
