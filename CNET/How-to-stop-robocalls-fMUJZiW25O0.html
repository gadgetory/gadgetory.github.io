Rachel at cardholder
Rachel isn't real but she's hard to stop
she's a robocall a pre-recorded
unsolicited sales call it's not only
irritating it's illegal but you're not
helpless there are some steps you can
take to block these pests if you get a
robo sales call you need to hang up
right away
don't press numbers don't ask to speak
to a person it will only lead to more
robo calls if you engage it encourages
them to try you again some programmers
have created software to fight back but
it only works for certain types of phone
lines the most effective robocall
blocker out now is called Nomo Robo it's
free and endorsed by the Federal Trade
Commission this is for landlines that
work on an internet connection when you
sign up incoming calls ring on your
phone and also on nomorobo servers if
the number matches a known Robo caller
their servers will grab it to hang up
and end the call your phone stops after
one ring it's blocked more than 33
million robo calls to date robo killer
is similar to nomorobo but it's for your
smartphone it screens your calls and
stops the robo call numbers from going
through the app also records the call if
you want to review it later it's still
in beta tests you mail is an app that
tackles robo calls a little differently
it's essentially a voicemail service if
it recognizes a known Robo call number
and you let it go to voicemail it's
going to play the disconnected tone you
know the one where sorry you'll have
reached a number that has been
disconnected or is no longer in service
and you can also set that tone to play
for any phone number like someone you
never want to talk to but remember not
all robo calls are illegal just sales
calls these services will still let you
get the calls about your prescription
that's ready for pickup or alerts from
your child's school there's no cure for
automated calls from charities or
surveys or political campaigns
unfortunately they can still bother you
and the National Do Not Call Registry
sorry it's not a shield against any
unwanted calls that's only to stop real
live humans calling you to sell stuff
and shady companies will ignore it any
way you can help the government hunt
down illegal sales calls by reporting
your experiences the more details you
give the more they can find patterns and
track down violators making answering
your phone a lot less scary oh it's you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
