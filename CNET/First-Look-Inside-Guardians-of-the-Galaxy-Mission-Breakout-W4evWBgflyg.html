the galaxy mission breakout this is an
amazing experience I can't wait to check
it out in a Oh Road I brought my friend
al are you ready for this all right
let's do with this arm this is Walt
Disney Imagineering 'he's most ambitious
right to date and from the start it's a
fast-paced ride with high accelerated
zooms to the top with big drops and
surprises along the way
like any attraction here waiting in line
tells you the story of how an alert
Yvonne
the collector is finally imprisoned
star-lord Drax baby Groot and Gamora
Rocket Raccoon has escaped and is
enlisting you to help break them free
from the collectors fortress of course
the entrance will greet you with a
golden statue of the collector then
you'll enter two bonds exhibition roof
and it is literally a nerdgasm of glass
cases holding artifacts and prized
possessions that fans of the comics and
the movie franchise are going to freak
out about want to see an Ultron sentry
robot check how about some Kree
artifacts in the middle of the room got
that and Cosmo the space dog he's here
too with his waggy tail and don't worry
there's plenty I didn't even spoil then
we head into the collector's office with
glass cases easily full with over 100
trinkets both large and small there's a
lot of love that's really been put into
this including arguably the best
animatronics we've ever seen and you
know who it's rocket racoon you want
dark corridors with exposed pipes and
steam vents got it
you might even find an abominable cameo
lurking above you as well
but you want to see this ride right
there is so much going on I can't even
explain really exactly what happened
there was ups and downs and downs and
ups and a lot of screaming like little
girls
you know them not
Joe rody from Disney's Imagineering
tells us some of the technical tricks
that make this right special the crucial
thing here is all about time because
you're coordinating timing between ride
mechanisms projection sound lighting all
that stuff has to coordinate to hit you
know fragments of a second so that you
get that humorous punch what's the
verdict of course you have to go on this
ride and multiple times because there
are six different adventures that are
accompanied by six different songs
pulled from the 60s to the 80s in
classic Guardian style so go find out
for yourself Marvel and Disney
Imagineering have another hint with
Misha breakout and if this is just the
start can you even imagine what Star
Wars land will even be like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
