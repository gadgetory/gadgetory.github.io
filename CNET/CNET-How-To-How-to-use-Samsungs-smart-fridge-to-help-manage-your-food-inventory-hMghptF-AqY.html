standing next to the samsung RF 48 9h
ARS refrigerator in today's how-to video
we're going to be showing you how to
utilize the grocery manager app on the
LCD touchscreen so I just got back from
the grocery store with this sauce so
that we could demonstrate for you how to
use the grocery manager in a real-time
way
so from this dock at the bottom of the
LCD screen you're going to select
grocery manager to add food press this
button so you're going to go here and
click the sauce button and drag it with
your finger over to the fridge and then
you'll see a purchase date and an
expiration date that you're supposed to
key in so we are going to input that
information and then hit save and it's
as easy as that to add more food you're
going to click the same add food button
and the same food menu will appear so
hypothetically if we had bought
vegetables we would take the vegetable
button and drag it and place it anywhere
on the fridge and repeat the same
process
so after you've added all of your food
and click to save you'll come back to
this screen which will be a
representation of the inside of your
refrigerator and its contents so we have
our vegetables and our sauces here we
can click on it and it will show us the
expiration date and tell us in this box
how soon it expires we can also set a
reminder for ourselves about the product
whether it has already expired whether
it expires today in one day or in three
days with the Samsung RF 4 to 8 9 h ARS
