wouldn't want to buy this laptop I'm
sorry I'm going to start with that this
is the lenovo ideapad z400 touch no
offense to lenovo but this thing looks
like it came out of a time machine
there's nothing technically bad about
the specs here you got a core i5
processor this has six gigs of ram one
terabyte hard drive which is nice it is
a touchscreen so you've got a little 14
inch touch splay here but that's the
only thing here that feels modern
there's a big thick laptop this is
called a thin and light laptop on some
of the product listings this is over an
inch thick and it weighs over 5 pounds
it does have a DVD drive for those who
want one but is this thing's heavy it's
heavy for a regular laptop what do you
want you have ultrabooks out there that
are 700 bucks and you have ones that
have touchscreens really good ones that
are 800 the price of this sometimes in
some listings is 730 ish the starting
price on lenovo's website form of the
core i3 is 599 if you can get wanted a
really good value maybe that there's
nothing in this package a lower
resolution 1366 x 768 display in this
model the keyboard is good you're
talking about a very generic type of
laptop that doesn't have super powered
processing it doesn't have any extra
graphics capability and you know you
have an acer m5 that is thinner than
this very competitively priced and has
graphics options and also you have the
toshiba satellite you a four or five T
which they really nicely priced in thin
in portable laptop this'll novo just
feels lost in the middle wait a few
months and see what comes out over the
summer and towards the fall I think this
one is going to be forgotten sooner than
later I'm Scott Stein and this is a look
at the lenovo ideapad z400 touch
