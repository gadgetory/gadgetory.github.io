device is having to transfer over all of
your old data
this is especially difficult when moving
from an iPhone to an Android device
luckily Samsung has create a tool that
makes it a lot easier for you to switch
I'm dan Graziano and I'm going to show
you how to transfer data from your old
iPhone to the brand new Galaxy s5 the
first thing you want to do is back up
your iPhone to iCloud then download the
samsung Smart Switch mobile app from the
Play Store on your Galaxy s5 after
launching the app select iCloud from the
list of options enter your Apple ID and
password and select which content you
would like to transfer to the s5 this
method allows you to transfer your
contacts photos calendar events alarm
and Wi-Fi settings call logs and even
select apps if you're not comfortable
giving Samsung your Apple credentials or
if you're interested in transferring
music and videos you can also restore
content to the s5 from an iTunes backup
that is stored on your computer to do
this you must first download and install
the samsung Smart Switch desktop
software on your PC or Mac if you don't
already have a recent backup you can
create one by connecting your iPhone to
your computer
opening iTunes and clicking on the
backup Now button once that's done
launch the Samsung desktop software and
connect your Galaxy s5 to the computer
from the drop down menu select the
backup you would like to use and hit
next
on the following page you'll be able to
choose which content you would like to
transfer when everything looks good hit
the start transfer button this will
probably take a while depending on how
much you're moving over I also recommend
disabling iMessages on your iPhone
before making a switch to an Android
device keeping it enabled sometimes
results in messages not coming to your
new phone to disable it enter the phone
settings select messages and toggle the
on/off switch to off for more how-to
like this one check out how to Tina calm
