Hollywood who's out on jury duty even
though she told the judge she considers
sneezing to be a hanging offense that
didn't get her excused so some poor
bastard is sitting at the defendants
table in a pool of sweat wondering if
you'll get the death penalty or a
personalized Molly rant and wondering
which would be worse first up the gadget
of the week the geyser of the week are
the twin Titans of titillation from CES
the show we just got back from I'm
speaking of the dueling 55-inch oled tvs
from LG and Samsung the LG you on our
best of show award but both made people
stare and grin like they just saw a
three breasted stripper the image
quality coming off these guys was good
enough to make you hate whatever is on
your living room wall right now but the
best part was around the side yard where
the cases on these sets are as little as
one sixth of an inch thick yes at CES
these 55-inch oled make the biggest
impact and when the LG model arrives in
q3 it'll do the same thing to your
checking account at an expected price
we're guessing of maybe 8 grand I'm
still in now the news the SOPA blackout
is happening as we are on set today with
sites like beer and mowing dark for a
day in protest of this proposed law that
would be pretty heavy-handed tactics to
shut down alleged pirate outside the
reach of us laws and do so in ways that
seem to have few if any of the checks
and balances afforded by process I don't
know I don't download pirated I can't
imagine SOPA would affect me right Bill
Gates is ending malaria and Apple is now
targeting scoliosis as we tape today
we're awaiting an announcement from
apple that is expectedly one of the
biggest moves ever to digitize textbooks
relieving kids of 40-pound backpacks
full of books with 40 year old
information ironically i'm reminded of
the phrase what's wrong with education
can't be fixed by technology Steve Jobs
said that Jerry Yang has departed Yahoo
where he stubbornly held on to the title
of chief Yahoo even a
the 90s ended now that he has a lot of
time and a lot of money on his hands it
begs for a special lightning round of
top five please say things that tech
bigwigs do next number five build a new
home with a studio so they can jam with
John Perry Barlow number four find a VC
firm to join and stroke their chin
thoughtfully at new ideas number three
launch an incubator and inflict the next
Sean Parker on us number to start a
rocket ship company and number one do
nothing as big as they did the first
time around please Jerry break the mould
and finally the Zappos site got hacked
this week exposing like 24 million user
records probably to some shoe fetishist
who's also an IT admin who gets off on
scale as much as Souls not only is the
Zappos culture a little funky but so is
their response they shut down phone
support and went all email they set up a
special site for changing your password
which didn't work at least not at first
and everyone on their support staff was
immediately issued two joints per shift
well not that last part but their
reputation as the tie-dyed side of
Amazon didn't exactly serve them very
well when this very real very boring and
very serious crisis came down that's the
buzz report for this week everybody I'm
Brian Cooley molly's back next week with
the verdict
