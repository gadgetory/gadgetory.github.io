Natali del Conte and it's time to get
loaded Samsung is launching a new line
of galaxy phones today the samsung
fascinate will run on verizon these are
all android phones t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T and
Sprint will also get their versions
t-mobile's version the samsung vibrant
has a heavy emphasis on multimedia with
a 4-inch am o LED screen it has
applications like slacker radio kindle
for android and comes pre-loaded with
James Cameron's movie avatar and the
Obama administration is trying to double
the wireless communication spectrum
available for commercial use in the next
ten years President Obama set to sign a
memorandum today that would put
approximately 500 megahertz of spectrum
up for auction that spectrum is
currently controlled by federal and
private companies this is part of the
SCC's National Broadband Plan and amazon
launched a new version of kindle for
iphone and ipad that can play embedded
video and audio so say you buy a book or
a newspaper that has multimedia content
your iPad iPhone or iPod Touch can now
handle that last week we reported that
the Twitter application within Facebook
would let you find Facebook friends
Twitter accounts and automatically
follow them well apparently that's not
working out so well Facebook has
admitted to blocking this feature we
don't really know why these two aren't
playing nicely and to follow up on the
pornography domain that we reported on
Friday I can or the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and numbers has
tentatively approved the dot xxx
top-level domain to be used for the
pornography industry this will in effect
create a red-light district on the web
although it's estimated that only ten
percent of adult sites on the web will
adopt it still might not be a bad time
to think about cybersquatting and we'll
end with a rumor dig founder Kevin Rose
has posted about a new possible social
network from google called google me it
could be a competitor to Facebook but we
really don't have details about it of
course google has tried to succeed in
social networking time and time again
but so far no dice that's
news for now thank you for watching i'm
natali del conte with cnet TV and you've
just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
