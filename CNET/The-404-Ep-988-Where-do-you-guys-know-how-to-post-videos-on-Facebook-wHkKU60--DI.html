404 show on Sina TV thank you for tuning
in my name is Jeff Bakalar I'm Wilson
tang and I'm trust in you and this is
the show where do you guys wanna post
videos you guys know how to post videos
videos to facebook that commercials
funny we were watching that before that
commercial implies that it takes to
bring out of a second yeah it's ready
bring it up it implies it except tenth
of a second yeah to post videos to
facebook is what that very thing implies
i mean it is funny it is fun it's more
funny the way the guy says it yeah i
think that's what we're laughing at I
don't think we're laughing at the idea
that it's just really it's not sure it's
not a fun thing to think about 4G how
fast does it take to upload a video to
face I've never done it okay I don't
think I've ever uploaded a video to
facebook i link a lot to facebook and
yeah i mean i imagine 4gb a lot faster
with three genes it's slow as hell to
get 20 minutes plus you can only upload
like the SD version yeah if you're on
just 3g not gonna lie 4G LTE kind of
change my life especially in Vegas what
do you mean change your life oh just I'm
just never worried about having super
fast internet anymore my phone I was
like us legitimate well every time I you
know and you know what I found also as
well when I'm gonna have a subway with
my evo on sprint there would be like
this 45-second handshaking period you
think forever for my phone have to be
like oh it's like you know you did you
made you put a blanket over someone's
head and spun them around and what is
going on this you know the handshake on
verizon's real quick like a the subway
it's like Oh check where were you been
we've been waiting for you so what do
you do at their 4g I'm just you know I'm
browsing the internet I'm streaming off
much as I the showing off my own Nass
class really easily all my movies all
700 my movies are streaming from my nest
24 7 365 so you got your own TV network
is Richards no I've I've gone over my
band with the things that are faster
welcome back chat room
yeah I can hear this for the 15 seconds
but but that's fine yeah there's a
little bit of a delay cuz the buffer has
been increased but if you want to join
us back in the chat you can do that now
because the stream is live yeah it's the
streams live it was like yesterday hope
you know that right it was like as well
Bailey uh but it seems to have improved
in terms of quality so we're really
excited about that it's an ongoing sort
of process little trial and error if you
will yeah but you know the interesting
thing to come out of this uh let's just
call it a debacle is called the the
entire office apparently is getting one
gigabit internet yeah I did within the
next month or two how sick is that so
talking two thousand down there's no
that mean yes i think so i don't know
our workload has to increase my
productivity we can't use that excuse
anymore oh man treasure I'm no
mathematician but I think that means 1k
down yeah okay I don't know when kill a
bit 1001 kilobit that and 1000 down to
be downloading lines I mean 500 up then
I have no idea what it is up but I know
coming down we're gonna get one gig
what's all about going up anyway in it
although we were made jealous this
weekend apparently a bunch of people
send in like uh pics from their own
Wi-Fi router and their 4g service and
their their service providers over there
they're at school yeah we guys like I
got 250 megabits down yeah down and he
literally took a screen grab this son of
a gun he took a screen grab of his
college connections like check this out
is without dealing with can you hear me
back in 1996 I don't know notables
videos to facebook anyway there's a lot
of fun stuff going on I want to jump
right into this story that just begs to
be covered we're talking about
congressman john fleming who recently
cited an onion article as fact right how
often does this happen number one and
number two sir you are a representative
you need to know that the onion is not a
real news source everybody knows is my
grandma knows this I'm curious is like
how out of touch are you well that's the
question for me like from a political
standpoint like okay how outrageous was
this kind
this this uh onion article and then I'm
assuming he's living a quart of it in
support of something well he is does
that mean that he has just as radical
and ridiculous view so here's what
happened the this is an old onion
article to was very funny it was titled
Planned Parenthood opens eight billion
dollar abortion plex a boy abortion ok
so then congressman john fleming
recently on his facebook page rights
this is the comment to the link to that
story more on planned parenthood
abortion by the wholesale are you
freaking kidding I almost hope this is
fabricated also possess I hope we're
getting duped right now these is like a
story within a story to because that
abortion Plex article actually spawned a
blog called literally unbelievable yeah
which is a home for uh like people that
post onion stories on Facebook that
don't realize it's satire sure but it
started with that abortion flex story
and he fell into it he's just the
probably the most political person
that's ever fell for that well another
casualty all right so uh apparently
somebody grabbed the screenshot from
John congressman's John Fleming's
website yeah his Facebook page where he
posted the link and the first comment is
that the onion is satire how exactly did
you get elected yeah sir how exactly
have you made it this far that's blows
my mind if you're that out of touch
that's what's crazy and and I again I
hope this is fake if it's not how do you
have the mentality to even believe that
such a thing would be created he
probably didn't read the article right I
but it's the headline is very clearly I
think that he believes that it's
actually true he posted it like abortion
by the wholesale that's like the fear
what do you think is I guess assembly
line well then you can walk into a
Walmart and get an abortion like just
ran in there no I was being John Fleming
you billion hate billion dollar like
Walmart feels like this is an outrage
we're killing babies that are crazy rate
right here oh man that blows my mind
definitely a story worth telling I mean
I just says it for me it says a lot
about the twisted world view some people
and our elected officials have now
think that this can actually happen
right though and I I agree with that
commenter sir mr. Fleming onion love
scout the f how the hell did you get
elected thinking the onion is a real
publication there's no he's listening to
this podcast stream goes away we could
say anything about it right now yeah
it's a farce speaking of forces
apparently there's a new study here
that's grading the online dating
industry right turns out some positives
but there's a lot of room for
improvement in terms of online dating
yeah um so this is like a new scientific
report from the psychological science in
the public interest um they're pretty
much taking issue with these algorithms
that online dating websites use to match
up users with each other sharam you know
you're obviously given like a set of
matches based on a survey that you fill
out but the questions for the survey
aren't really about your core
personality it's more about things like
I don't know like what what kind of food
do you like to eat a night or like what
kind of music what kind of music do you
like but those aren't necessarily good
indicators of your match with somebody
else and they're claiming that it's an
algorithm but this scientific study is
saying if you want to do that you'd
adhered to the rules of science and and
prove that your matches so this is a
single out any particular services that
sort of um they're singling out websites
like OkCupid and match.com which are
actually owned by using are they really
yeah I bought okay okay that's here but
you guys remember we actually talked
about another story last year on okay
trends that's like the statistical arm
on the weather is saying there are
certain questions you can ask on a first
date that will prove you're too late
yeah great know it will it's basically
that like hahaha behind your
compatibility with somebody else maybe
guarantee ya know um I feel like I'm
gonna really upset a few people with
what I'm about to say okay but that's
what I read lately I'm not in any way
shape or form I want to preface this day
been saying that online dating is not
good I'm not saying if you have had
success with this right more power to
you everyone no matter what sexual
orientation should be allowed to enjoy
love and be in a
relationship there have that said don't
you think that there is something a
little compromising about you know
giving what's been a sort of organic
process of finding somebody I'm saying
I'm and I'm saying that organic process
can happen online as well yeah but when
you talk about introducing algorithms
you're essentially replacing the organic
falling in love sort of thing that has
been happening for hundreds of years
Wilson has one finger all I mean I'm
just as that sounds to me honestly to be
very very sentimental same cuz I don't
think anybody's really done the study
like Oh finding a person traditionally
yeah at a bar work meeting a church that
kind of thing the do those relationships
work out for the better right like what
that other was that right exactly I
don't think anybody's really done the
sherry on that on cuz cuz you know there
everybody has seen plenty of couple
right who met the traditional way that
aren't particularly those same
conclusions that you would but it just
takes so much longer right yet to find
out whether or not you compatible if you
meet somebody in a bar you could you can
kind of figure it out within five
minutes right whether or not you have
the same sense of humor the same
interest whatever but all biker you have
acquired the person first then you have
to talk to them you have to message them
if they messaged you back then you
exchange then meet up in person it
doesn't work out that's a lot of wasted
time yeah you know I think I feel like
this is the problem with Internet in
general also is that like when you're
out and you're just meeting people it's
it's bit random you need people that you
don't necessarily think that you would
necessarily talk to hmm and then you end
up discovering that like hey that's
really cool i never knew that or never
experienced that before uh and so you
kind of lose that change whereas like if
you go on a site like OkCupid feel like
okay I have a type I need asian girl 25
you know mix this amount of money and
does this for a living I'm not going to
consider anybody else and it's at
self-reinforcing thing it's the same
thing with politics like it's great that
we have all this free speech anybody can
write whatever they want sure but what
ends up happening is that you only read
things that reinforce your own personal
I also think that at a certain point
when you go through so many pages of
matches it becomes more of like a
shopping
experience rather than dating so it's
commercializing that you're not looking
at people as humans making them as
products that you could potentially back
now i can't speak from personal
experience I met Stacy in real life arm
but I have people you're using I have
people that's truth all those basically
you know Jasmine college before when we
actually we grew up together before
there is an inner pre-internet Jeff 65
arm you would but I'd we do have people
on both sides of our family that have
not only met on online services but are
now married yes kids on but so it's I'm
in no way shape or form and I cannot
reinforces enough do you know putting
that down right yeah that's great no but
at this point I feel like especially New
York that stigma is like gone yeah I me
I feel like especially modern life with
the recession sure um if you have a job
you are putting in you know 812 hours
because you want to keep your job yeah
but that leaves very little time to get
all the rest of the stuff done in your
life right and then go on like meet
people yeah I'm not gonna name names but
I've definitely walked up and down the
aisles of our office and seen people
quickly closed the okay just when they
see me walk yeah and like I don't know
you keep it wasn't me those are instant
yeah it's also it's almost dangerous to
like the deer how quickly they like
close things is almost like they're
about to throw the computer out the
window right wait what do you guys think
about you hear a lot of reports about
people cyber cheating they call it or
whatever it is where they're married to
someone and then they have these online
quote unquote Ashley Madison related
relationships or maybe are you asking if
it's cheating if you're only talk to
them on low I'm not asking I'm just
talking about opening it up I'm not
seeking validation a German weird is
like you we start getting to really
really super gray area where is like is
it cheating if you meet someone online
but you don't actually do anything yeah
yeah you do something like virtually or
how it's really cheating if you can't
tell the other person right if that's
what it is it's cheating if you wouldn't
like your spouse to see what's going on
because like some people think that like
you know if you get in these long-term
relationships and then you start to talk
to someone else right but as like a in
an intimate way not just a sexy but way
but like an intimate way that a lot of
people think that's like crossing the
line yeah probably is you know and even
if it's for work and you're just trying
to really get in good with a PR person
in their attractive and anyway no I so
much stuff talk about with online dating
but i think the funniest story was about
the involuntary flash mob see like sites
like OkCupid another dating websites
aren't uh they're not immune to hackers
people that like to troll yep you know
member we talked about this story I
think last year it was uh people were
creating fake profiles of hot girls and
messaging nerve and then telling them to
meet at the same place and so like 30
dudes just met up in Times Square where
there was a camera you could look at
online and color the voluntary forever
alone flash mob that just is depressing
that's makes me this is yummy mean
that's just straight up cold-hearted me
it is but kind of yes yes it is funny
it's very me what's its dopey these
people are maybe a little delusional
right you know they're like whoa this
really hot chick wants to meet me in
Times Square yeah I mean hindsight's
twenty-twenty but come on we should
really get a female here I want to talk
to a female about her experience on
these websites i'm sure it's so much
different know it in the mail experience
I message 500 times a day and by the
creepiest dudes I think actually our own
cars ooh boy might have done a little
investigative piece couple years I i'm
curious because the the other you know
you mentioned okcupid that's like the
big one for like the 20-somethings match
com I feel like it's further ado
something er me is would like that guy
that really really wants to get married
tomorrow and they advertise like a very
very scientific like questionnaire that
they developed over years yeah does the
article say anything about eharmony H&amp;amp;E
buddy harmony or anything like that but
I don't know do you think maybe they use
like a myers-briggs type of personality
test to match you up with other people I
well I mean according to them they use
like a very like a heavily vetted uh you
know questionnaire and if you've ever
been on one of those it's like oh do you
leave your laundry out all right like do
you like spicy
we r T I think the best method is just
if you're on one of the sides move in
together no Jesse someone that you might
want to hang out with I am them and be
like let's meet up right now or as soon
as you can like don't spend too much
time on it otherwise you're at risk of
wasting I I I have to take your word for
it you know that's awesome we'll take a
break when we come back much more 404
stick around we'll see in just a second
this is the 404 f'ers the show where we
all sing
this is margin from Denmark you're

softy we meeting people yeah meanwhile

Valentine's Day mmm i couldn't could
i've done that would have been like the
lamest thing I've ever done i'm not

it lamer to get engaged on friday the
13th the day before he's got a portal
able to get married on Halloween no I

you guys better get it in check my lads
are better already have them I think I I
really wanna you know seek out advice
from people who are really good Atticus
I'm not good at being Roman item it just
doesn't register I'm just not do like
the Hershey's kiss on the floor on what
is that I'm gonna kiss the floor that
you walked on no you don't do any wow
let's see that's amazing stuff like that
those I think of other things I think
like movie ideas and you know I don't
think of like here not be romantic I
think of like all the cool video game
yeah here's what you do you get a toy
boat right okay you realize that I can't
do this cuz she listens any get a toy
boat right and you put a bunch of these
toy boats in the bathtub with like
flower petals and like candles and stuff
and then and then you have a little sign
that says it would float my boat if you
would be my valentine you have that
little little sign on top of the boat as
the sale way too many rom-coms oh I'm
just saying I don't know you have to do
to maintain a healthy relationship is
trading off years like this year really
yet this year is gonna be her you know
don't tell Jeff what we're doing and
then next year I'm gonna have to come up
with the Valentine oh that's a good one
that's kind of cool so I'm free for a
year right and I gotta worry about it 12
months now Daisy back let's do something
by she really no I'm Carly I've it's her
year this year you still have to do yeah
I don't care what she did you have to do
you have to do something that's why I
married her because we have a cool
relationship like that weezer do you
think talk to me on februari 16 would be
staying at your out on the trouble I
intro hello couch I missed you that'll
be interesting uh let's talk about this
is really cool I think Bonnie char wrote
about it the other day but its prototype
headphones that can detect which side of
your face there in right so which means
are in yeah so doesn't matter you know
usually there's like a left and right
loyalty now you're though you're the
audio file you're the resident has phone
expert I know that at the end of the day
it's the ergonomics of the of the bud
right that that you know dictates which
sounds get hurt right but are you really
missing anything if you accidentally
swap left and right well you're not
listening to it the way that the
producer wanted to break the sound
through each individual sure I i feel
like the beer issues if you ever decide
to watch anything like a movie right
right that make that is definitely a
business spatial cues of course like
someone walks off off camera to the left
and you hear the sound on the right
what the hell's like a t-rex comes you
know the sound comes from one side right
and like the you get scared because the
t-rex hops out on the right exactly it
would really upset me if the sound came
from the back in the face right sure
this is definitely one of those
technologies we like how come this is an
exists already because every time you
put in a pair of headphones you have to
look at those little markers well I like
the ones that have a feel sort of cues
there I was like a Braille sort of thing
where you know they dotted on the thing
and you know that's the right you're so
these aren't actually out yet these are
like a prototype okay thing but they
have proximity sensors inside that can
detect which ear you're putting them in
based on the angle um and then also it's
kind of cool they can sense when you're
sharing it with somebody else if the ear
but it's further away from the partners
which tamano and then it'll switch
tomorrow so that people can hear the
same sounds that's really cool
absolutely it's all built into the
headphones although matter what you're
using to play yeah exactly or you know
what else would be really cool as if it
paused automatically when you get your
earbuds yanked out yeah right i hate
that's the worst feeling in the world
interesting yeah it's kind of cool it
might be coming out soon but uh these
japanese researchers are looking for a
partner right now i mean like it sounds
like great technology sounds expensive
but yeah it's gonna be one of those
things where it's like oh yeah to be the
next sign heiser 500 hd's right retail
$350 yeah but you know what I mean the
monster headphones that people you see
wearing on the subway every day cost
$350 I just reviewed the 50 cent
headphones 399 dollar worth it not at
all wow they're piles of garbage really
yeah I don't know I'm scared of 50 cent
either he's not the only one with a gun
so water comes out of it yeah but now
honestly they're really bad if you've
ever felt a pair of monsters they creak
because the plastic isn't bolted down
one robbery and they just they're
basically put together by four bolts on
the side and even Joey uses those and
one of the bolts came out these things
don't feel like they're worth really
they have you got warranties yelling 350
no that's the thing to have your
standard one-year warranty same with the
SMS sync by 50 cent yeah you know you
break them after a year you don't have
to buy a whole new pair Wow well you
heard your first SMS right is the sm
audio sync by 50 the reviews up on see
never would have eaten what was the
score I was like a two point five out of
ten at no no no I stars Wow yes I
honestly feel like they should divide
the headphone you know category up into
I mean I don't even mean like internal
politics I mean like in general right do
you want just way too much bass and to
feel like you're in a club all the time
right and then speaker like headphones
for when you want it to sound like what
the producer intend like those are like
that's pretty much the bifurcation yeah
in that area right because like yeah
it's great like if you want to listen to
dr. Dre with like the heaviest be
possible for your eardrums burst uh yeah
that's great if that's what you really
got your India how much are those beats
headphones the beats headphones are 300
350 you co mo see Don I mean maybe cuz
they're so obnoxiously large those are
the ones I see all the time you're
obviously pay more for style because for
350 you can buy a reference parapet
phones that you know audio engineers use
directs the music yeah and that'll give
you much more natural sound the way the
producer intended it to be but you know
people want to have that look when
they're hanging off their shoulders for
sure it blows my mind to like every time
you actually put on like a real good
pair of professional audio engineers and
hit headphones you hear stuff like
people is like the coughing coughing
just like they're sure closing at you i
love here is the sound of the guitars
fingers yet on the fret oh yeah i hear
that or the squeak of the chair that
here on it's crazy it's really crazy but
then it's one of those things people are
willing to plunk down a lot of money on
headphones yeah so you know however
expensive those uh proximity sensor ones
will be people pay for it yeah this
isn't this is really cool I want to talk
about this McDonald's uh ad campaign
that I saw just now actually brought up
in the rundown tell us Justin what
they're doing and why it's the most
effective viral campaign ever certainly
yeah so this is actually hasn't happened
yet this is a proof of concept by a
designer by the name of sean click but
he's suggesting that mcdonalds could use
a form of advertising in seed bombing
have you guys heard about what seems
like an environmental guerilla tactics
for to basically Rieger minate platforms
right all right so like basically you
use these seed bundles and you throw
them in
to anywhere like any kind of field and
they'll just pop up after a while so
it's really easy to do usually it's done
in the air through you know out of an
airplane or something like that also
it's not so okay so what we're talking
about and they gave sort of like an
example undress is this is this real or
is that this is not real yet okay this
is just a photoshop so explain what
we're looking at so we're looking at a
side of the road in California it's like
some random freeway and this designer is
suggesting that California's should use
or McDonald should you see bombs made
out of California poppies but the genius
part about this is that in california
since it's the state flower it's illegal
to pick up destroy or dig up poppies so
this is basically an advertising
campaign that would never go away unless
someone break the wall so planting these
poppy seeds in the shape of a mcdonald's
logo along the side of a highway right
right okay like that's the advertiser
reason like imagine somebody a little
bit more dubious deciding to do i don't
know like a d topping right you looking
for sure yet you could put any message
you want and how how enforced is this
law though I mean yeah it's pretty easy
to step on a flower right right right so
you gotta look at it like that like a
swastika like on the side of like a road
like you oughten policies weekend
biggest symbol of hate ever campaign job
is it to police these exactly my mental
protection maybe I think the police
would definitely look the other way if

fill in this watch to go like yeah I

they decided to do always this one

let themselves be liable in this way of
course not and similar tactic yeah so

have nickel back on stage and give 10
lucky fans baseball back oh of course oh
my god he's like a let nature take its

course means the death of never know is

aware of the increase in Spanish
population listen to your podcast really
you guys don't have any Spanish are you
I'm gonna win the Spanish version of the
44 here we go all over these you so get
back everything will be beyond
I saw something you eat a new TV
chiquito you say Wilson Talia neem a
ghost and those PP get the shows on that
level de pipi think again all right no
idea all right uh I didn't get really
big girl honors I heard we don't like
something yeah I heard we talked I think
that's what Obama's is my home go I
really hope we didn't just play
something terrible yeah yeah let's go
wait 15 seconds for the Chairman to hear
then I'll see what they have to say
speaking of delays and how well we are
live now someone called up and says
there are some advantages to you not
being live let's hear a 404 this is Long
Island from Christians I just wanted to
give my take on you guys not being alive
and you know what I think it's a good
thing and in a way you know it's a bad
thing I just was saying that let's say
if you you know through the bandwidth if
bandwidth issue that you can't lock
spirit lives that compromise would be to
get your the way to get it you know from
either i tuned for peanut com have it
more available earlier and you rarely
have it all right so he's saying that
when because we're we're not going live
which we are now and then all that is
mood I guess we could we still couldn't
brick get the show up earlier if that
has nothing to do those two things are
totally unrelated so just to give a
little transparency here that's not the
case but you know things are working
well so far so we'll see Justin your
eyes are getting super wide yeah the
translations are coming in through the
chat room I don't think those are we
should I don't think that was that no I
think they just heard that in there I
heard that too yeah they heard PP I
don't think the spanish word for penis
is PP okay maybe what if it is not he p
like what if he's talking about p just
like you're in yeah we didn't block that
moving a beard i will figure it allows
you to bed at that pic just live like a
young spanish speaker in the author oh
good google this is the most passive
aggressive negative call we've ever
gotten
maybe for for its Connecticut from Greg
look I've been listening for a couple
years now and I love the show and that's
why it kind of hurts me to hit on you a
little bit I Wilson you sweetie three
please just stop laughing into the
microphone show up kind of become Wilson
Tang class teaching to be dies on the
background I love you guys anyway I'm
really sorry that's good criticism has
been a balance that's good person you
know lean away from the mic like that
guy from chocolate rain like you got it
like Tay Zonday you gotta lean away when
you laugh yeah yeah I noticed you don't
live pitched but it's pretty good though
not nevertheless right it doesn't work
the same way without the lab right yeah
I love it dude don't you dare I just be
like a laugh Mike maybe yeah this is
except i wish we got like a sitcom track
get some emails this is uh Kevin M from
Chicago says I'm one of the guys who
clicks on facebook ads we've been
talking about this a lot lately I must
have shared enough info that i get
photography ads graphic design jobs
engineers software engineering software
adds his eyes eventually go to the right
side of the face book launch page
facebook pretty much knows my activities
in interest and they're doing a good job
at marketing to me better so than google
wow still not clicking on that love that
kool-aid and I don't know this is uh at
facebook.com/ email addresses that would
uh I don't think anyone uses one this
guy's saying if they're gonna mark it to
you anyway you might as well give them
all information to have more relevant as
well no I don't make sense maybe in your
twisted little mind um Takashi and Jane
from Tokyo say yesterday show you guys
talked about castle in the sky now
having the Twitter record and we sounded
a maze that it was the rerun that
smashed the record but in actuality it
was an organized mess tweet among the
Japanese anime fans and Twitter addicts
that try to break down the Twitter
service so it was like this organized
Twitter bomb that uh that meant cause
the the record to be broken so i guess
that still counts technically but it
comes from a much less organic place
right
all right uh and finally we got a email
from Andy of course we talked about the
Odyssey Lower East Side speaker dock the
other day have you heard anybody play
company yet know and they don't know not
that I'm aware of yeah those getting
bounced back me maybe I'm just haha
they're probably trying to get in touch
with 50 cent right yeah and make their
way over to you know I'm more worried
about him in a UH but he I guess you
know we obviously took a very comical
snarky skewed approach at covering that
but Andy maybe took a more realistic
approach at he says uh the Lower East
Side device is probably not intended for
New Yorkers I think that's fair i think
that's a given right in fact he thinks
it's for those people outside of New
York who think that having something
with New York references somehow makes
them more hipstery and chic that makes
sense I know that in my culture
wasteland cultureless wasteland in
Australia bogans will clamor for things
which somehow define them as more
fashionable what better way to do so
than buying something which has a
tenuous link with the culture capital of
the world these may be on to something
there uh yeah that was the whole thing
what don't send this to the New York
address yeah you know you shoulda said
is that the San Francisco me write a
review hey come on even San Franciscans
aren't that bad no you guys jump you
