the iphone well sort of I am Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update
Microsoft has released an office mobile
app for iphone users but there is a bit
of a catch you have to be a subscriber
to Microsoft's Office 365 service which
starts at a hundred dollars a year and
it gives subscribers the ability to
install office apps on up to five
devices like pcs macs tablets and phones
the iphone app includes word excel and
powerpoint it's not really meant for
creating documents but it does make it
easy to quickly edit or fix an existing
document you can sync it also to
SkyDrive it's not optimized for iPad and
there's no Android app yet so owners of
other devices you'll have to access
Office Web Apps through the mobile web
browser Android is invading the living
room as yet another Android based video
game console enters the scene the latest
is project mojo by a company called mad
catz you plug the Mojo to your TV and it
brings up a direct link to the Google
Play Store and amazon app store and you
can just play whatever games you already
purchased with your existing accounts
it'll ship with a wireless controller by
the holidays and it'll be competing with
other Android based systems like the
Ouya and gamepop when you're searching
for something on Facebook you won't see
any more ads in the search results
facebook says most advertisers don't see
the need to pay for a search ad when
their product already showed up in the
search results it was redundant it's
always a good idea to double check the
app you're downloading on Android to
make sure it's legit because a hacker
created a malicious app that masqueraded
as the popular game bad piggies and had
the same photo and description as the
real game but it was just called bad
pigs and it was downloaded more than
10,000 times before it was taken down
one other clue it wasn't the real game
the developer was listed as Dan Stokes
rather than the game publisher rovio
today's featured app is Google Plus
which just got a few upgrades the
biggest change is two notifications now
it syncs your accounts across all your
devices so when you read or dismiss a
notification on your phone
it won't keep bothering you on your
tablet or PC there will also be a new
bell icon and a new notification tray
that separates old items from new ones
that's slowly rolling out to everyone
starting with Android users and on the
web and then later iPhones and iPads and
the Android google+ app now can let you
delete photos from the photos view and
if you tap a post you can see the number
of comments shares and Plus Ones that's
your tech news update you can find more
