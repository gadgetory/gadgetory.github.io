gonna take a look at the revolve smart
home solution so this is a wireless hub
designed to be sort of the central
nervous system for your smart home
devices connect this to your home
network download the iOS app and through
that app you can control variety of
smart home devices all in one place the
ideas that is supposed to add
convenience saving you from having to
jump back and forth between various apps
and giving you one place to control all
your various smart home devices so
revolve actually has seven different
radios built into it out of the box it
will support Wi-Fi Insteon base smart
home devices as well as z-wave coming
next quarter it will have ZigBee support
it also has three other radios in it
that will come online when more devices
come to market so it revolves taking a
curated approach the devices it will
support out of the box right now you get
philips hue support support for nest
thermostats yale smart locks entity on
devices Sonos music systems as well as a
few others and i'm happy to report that
all those devices and their different
standards connected to that are evolved
with pretty much no trouble now you get
into the app and you'll see it's pretty
bare-bones you only get basic on/off
capability as well as maybe some
brightness or volume controls for so
most example you can't build playlists
in the app and for hue bulbs you can't
set some of the more specific
programming capabilities there's no if
support so you can't tie various
functions into it say facebook
notifications or twitter there's also no
conditional behavior capability and
revolve at least yet the company says
all those things are coming though
eventually the company hopes to
eliminate hubs entirely like the one
that comes with philips hue for example
now this is no cheap add-on to the smart
home it costs about $2.99 right now and
I also expect to see more competitors
come to the space of stay tuned expect
prices to drop overall though this is a
great first entry for this company and I
really like this device I can recommend
it Farmer Brown this is the revolve
smart home solution
