that much better than last year's iPhone
10 on paper the hardware actually looks
pretty similar between the two phones
both have 12 megapixel cameras with the
wide-angle lens at f1 point 8 and the
telephoto at F 2.4 but here's a trick on
how to tell them apart without tearing
them apart if you download the highlight
app you'll see that the 10s actually has
a 26 millimeter wide-angle lens while
the 10 has a 28 millimeter wide ergo
lens if you want to see the full
technical breakdown I'll put the chart
on the article on CNET apples said there
are plenty of software and performance
tweaks to improve HDR images video and
portraits on the iPhone 10s so let's
test it out all photos in this
comparison were taken on the default
camera app and HDR was turned on unless
otherwise stated while both phones have
portrait mode only the 10s has the
option to adjust the blur or bokeh after
the photo has been taken the depth
control slider shows you just how much
you're simulating stopping down the lens
the wider the aperture or lower the F
number the greater the blur you can do
this on photos from the front and rear
cameras but don't expect this to have
the same qualities as bokeh from a DSLR
lens it just increases the blur effect
around your subject
if you virtually stop down all the way
to F 1.4 it's almost like a blurry halo
effect around your subject for some
photos when your subject is far enough
away from the background it looks great
but on others it can be a little too
over-the-top if you don't make any
adjustments to the f-stop both phones
render the blur in a similar way photos
from the iPhone 10 do have a bit more
contrast the 10 s does tend to capture a
little more detail in portrait mode
overall as you can see in this image on
her hair but the biggest difference is
how each phone deals with HDR there's a
new setting on the 10 s called smart HDR
and apples
the combination of sensors and image
signal processing helps keep more shadow
and highlight detail in shots compared
to the iPhone 10 having smart HDR on
does make a big difference in this photo
you can see much more detail in the
window and here on the portrait the 10 s
gives a much more pleasing effect on the
face without the glowing highlights from
the 10 here's an identical shot from the
10 s with smart HDR on and off there's
more detail retained in highlights with
HDR turned on and here with the light
coming in from the window
but even without smart HDR the 10 s
still appears to capture slightly more
dynamic range and usable detail than the
iPhone 10 with its regular HDR mode
active for selfies both have the same
true depth camera on the front but each
phone processes photos in a different
way
photos from the 10s are more even with
smart HDR turned on the 10 on the other
hand blows out the background completely
for general photos in good outdoor
lighting conditions you won't notice a
huge difference between the two colors
are nicely saturated on both but to my
eye they are slightly more saturated on
the iPhone 10 overall I found when
looking at photos on the phone screens
with true tone turned on images do look
a little more true to life on the 10s
than they do on the 10 of course the
screen you're viewing this video on will
also make a difference to how these
shots look when you're taking photos
indoors smart HDR on the 10s helps keep
highlights and shadows more balanced
according to Apple the 10 s has an
extended dynamic range in videos up to
30 frames a second on this 4k clip keep
an eye on the light sources from the
windows to the lights and you can see
the detail retained in the highlights on
the same video from the iPhone 10
highlights do blow out a bit more when
it comes to audio the 10s can record
stereo sound
and with headphones on audio definitely
sounds richer and more spatial compared
to the same mono clip on the iPhone 10
the larger pixel sights on the iPhone 10
s means it also has an advantage in
low-light at least on paper in
real-world situations the 10 s does
produce more even shots with less blown
out highlights but you might prefer the
more contrast II saturated look from the
iPhone 10 overall there's slightly less
noise on images from the 10s but me the
biggest change in the camera on the
iPhone 10 s is the improved dynamic
range whether or not you turn on smart
HDR that being said while smart HDR does
look great most of the time some people
I showed images to prefer the photos
from the iPhone 10 because they had more
contrast so image processing has
definitely improved on the 10s but if
you already have an iPhone 10 it's
unlikely you'll want to upgrade for that
alone so there you have it the iPhone 10
s and iPhone 10 both capable cameras but
the 10 s definitely has a big advantage
when it comes to HDR shots but let me
know which one you prefer and of course
stay tuned to seen it we'll have plenty
more camera comparisons coming real soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
