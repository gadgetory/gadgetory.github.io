wants to tell you what news you should
be reading I'm Bridget Carey this is
your cnet update twitter made a big
change to its website it added a section
called moments you'll find it under the
lightning bolt icon it highlights top
news and entertainment stories share it
on Twitter sometimes the tweets come
from official organizations or
government agencies a fewer from
journalists and when you click on a
story you only see a few posts on that
topic so Twitter isn't showing you all
the posts on a particular topic like you
would see in a search instead it's
cherry-picking what photos and vines and
tweets you see essentially it's shaping
how a story is told or what voices are
heard for developing news you have the
option to follow a moment which takes
all new feature tweets on that topic and
it puts it in your timeline you see
Twitter's been looking for something to
help make it more appealing to the
mainstream so brand new users can
discover interesting tweets easily

entering the news realm Apple has a news
app on iOS 9 it features stories picked
by Apple staff snapchat discover
highlights stories by 14 media companies

articles which hosts stories from
publishers like the New York Times

read it without leaving facebook twitter
is going through a time of change right
now with Jack Dorsey taking the reins
again as chief executive making him the
CEO of both Twitter and square his
mobile payments company some believe
he's a smart leader that can grow
interest in Twitter but if you're
looking for a real smartypants I have
just prepared for you lumo now makes
high-tech running shorts called LUMO run

waistband and it measures cadence bounce
ground contact time decreases in speed
as well as pelvic rotation and stride
length the sensor battery lasts a month
before you have to recharge it and it's
machine washable the men shorts in the
women's capris are one hundred dollars
now for pre-orders but the price is
going up in two weeks to a hundred and
fifty dollars and if you're looking for
a smarter TV streamer roku has a new
model out that supports 4k video it's
also known as ultra high-def
you can find some ultra high-def video
on netflix and amazon but you'll need a
4k TV to see the difference the new roku
4 is a hundred and thirty dollars it's
priced higher than amazon's new 4k fire
TV streaming box but it's cheaper than
the new Apple TV Roku is also rolling
out new software updates to various
devices over the next two months and
there's a handy new feature for
travelers it's called hotel and dorm
