it's time for episode 186 of the 359
podcast with elf reading and Ben Fox
Rubin good morning guys how are you good
morning good morning yeah you did oh I'm
doing good I'm doing really well here
yeah are we excited about today's show
cuz I am cuz we're going to space we are
going to outer space that's that's gonna
be really interested please go to my
Kickstarter or a go fund me for 25
million dollars so i can go to the moon
no i can i can do a round trip around
the moon i am curious to see so this is
spacex is planning on sending to private
citizens to the moon sometimes i late
2018 we're going to talk about that
there's also an interesting scoop from
the wall street journal which full
disclosure i'm a little skeptical about
starting off that they're going to get
rid of the lightning connector and
switch to USB type-c which a lot of
other phones have actually switched to
already mostly in the android universe
of course and then we also want to go
through Roger Cheng our fearless editor
who's currently in Barcelona has an
interesting scoop about blackberry
coming out with some additional phones
ah later this year so we'll see if we
still care about black do we still care
about but I don't I will not be getting
any of well we'll talk about it anyway I
mean it sounds kind of interesting so
all right yeah we'll see so send in your
questions and comments we'll get to as
many as we can at the end of the show
and without further ado let's get this
thing going alright podcast recording
time we'll be back leave us your all
your notes and questions and comment and
hate in the chat and we'll see in three
minutes and 59 seconds from 32 welcome
to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Rubin I'm Alfred
Inge among the rumors floating around
about Apple's upcoming iPhone this one
is certainly a doozy according to The
Wall Street Journal the tech giant may
get rid of its proprietary lightning
connector and replace it with USB type-c
which is standard connector that's used
on a lot of Android phones what yeah
that's never gonna happen they they're
making a ton of money off the lightning
cables now and they're actually pretty
decent cables it's not like it's an
obsolete you know piece of technology no
it's pretty similar to USB type-c it
also
as you can see with the iphone 7 it also
has audio capabilities why would they do
this especially after they came out with
the Lightning headphones too for the
folks that didn't want to ditch you know
right there headphones yeah yeah you
would have to get another set of edges
it is interesting though that on there
you know on the latest macbook pro it's
all USB type-c which we did which makes
it a type of situation where if you get
a brand new iphone and you get a brand
new macbook pro that you would actually
need a dongle to have them work together
which i find completely infuriating
considering you would have to spend
thousands of dollars for those two
pieces maybe this rumor is true though
because they're they're trying to build
you know sell more dongles now they're
trying to break into that dongle market
so we get Regice time market yet another
dongle to convert from lightning to USB
seed this time so if you had an old
headphone you could get a lightning
cable dongle and then a USB type-c
dongle so you could keep your old
headphone jack and then just keep
dangling it up that it's like a dongle
pyramid scheme this is totally totally
easy does it make any sense by the way
to switch the new like a new macbook to
lightning cables like is that something
that they could possibly do I mean they
could but again I don't think it would
make any sense yeah anyway um next TCL
which is the new owner of the blackberry
phone brand may come out with three
count em three phones this year
including an all touch screen version
this is Lee yeah this is honestly every
time you know blackberry comes out with
a new phone that's Thai people love the
keyboard come on it's no just stop there
you that is the whole point of
blackberry though is the keyboard that
has been there differentiating yes and
that differentiator is what makes a
difference between a phone that sells
and a phone that doesn't how much the
different oh oh my gosh well to me
what's interesting about this is is that
it really does show that TCL is making a
serious bid on helping blackberry
continue to grow and to actually be
something significant the problem is is
that it's had so many repeats and starts
and stops and it really hasn't been able
to reinvigorate
right so and I'm skeptical this is
actually going to work and the thing is
they're kind of only going off name
alone you look at the hardware and it's
essentially you know they're going off
an old Snapdragon processor when
everybody's looking forward to the
Snapdragon 835 process that's coming out
and it's just you know it's not the
problem that people don't like keyboards
or anything it's more so essentially
make good phones yeah that were so hard
yes and if you can't make good phones
make the nokia 3310 which maybe i'll buy
last word dozen came forward last up
SpaceX says it plans to offer a charter
flight around the moon for to paying
customers as soon as late 2018 Alfred
how much would you pay for this well
it's worth millions of dollars but I
always feel like maybe it's just because
i'm a pessimist but i feel like the moon
is one of those like lackluster
disappointing you know tourist
destinations kind of like one was like
the first time you went to time square
like what were your thoughts on that it
was very bright there was too much going
on there that's what I feel about the
moon come on come on I want to go out
I'm sure how much I want to have like to
pay that much to go to the moon out on
its baby-steps it's just the start so a
decade ago a similar trip costs about
twenty-five million dollars maybe
they'll knock off the price a little bit
we'll see if you want to read more about
these stories check us out on cnet I'm
Ben Fox Rubin I'm Alfred Aang thanks for
listening we didn't have enough time on
the podcast to talk about it but I
totally would not go to the moon for
that much money if you have the money if
I you had them on ok but like what is it
I have the money and that's my entire
bank account or if like I have the money
but I also have like another billion
dollars to spare cuz that there's a
difference there is a huge difference
there's a huge difference if I had known
ahead that's all the money I had boy
would I my stupid I think low it all on
us yeah in trip that's the thing like
whenever I go on vacation I like I'm
always thinking about like this is cool
but there is this like six hundred seven
dollars cool like that's how I would
feel if I spent that I was going to
going on vacation with you okay but
that's how I make my vacations
worthwhile or it's like okay I'm not
feeling like this is where
700 nah let me do all this other stuff
that like and then then it becomes fun I
think I'm excited about it from the
future perspective you started a certain
point you know we're only talking about
this is like 2018 late 2018 so we've
we've got a while to go and maybe
eventually let's say like 10 years from
now 20 years from now we're both and
Brian will still be alive God willing
and maybe welcome to go to the moon tail
looks like how long would you even like
be like would you even be on the moon
would you just be going on no you would
go around the moon you would orbit them
it would take a while for them to open
like a Nathan's hot dog stand or
something yes so yeah I would it would
take a bed so a question to all the
folks out there how much would you pay
to go to the moon and do you actually
think this is exciting or you like
Alfred what is I mean not a suck one of
my favorite um futurama episodes is when
the moon is a theme park mmm that line
they go to and he goes and it turns out
to just be like kind of like this like
Disneyland kind of thing where it is all
mundane yeah and everyone just jaded to
it yeah we're whalers on the moon
haven't seen that way I did really like
first season I i I've missed that one I
guess this is I i have been reading a
book of moon is a harsh mistress where
the moon is a penal colony that tries to
take over that tries to overthrow the
mother planet so we have to be very
careful that might happen yeah it might
be a different deal if i paid like 25
million dollars to be on the moon but to
just go around it okay yeah sorry i like
super disagree with you i would love to
go into outer space but i know that's
going into many of them per se the moon
the moon the moon is so tell me when we
land on Mars tell me when we plant on
Mars you're horrible person alright
you'll never guess what everyone in the
chat wants to talk about oh my god yeah
i'm talking about outer space for God's
eggs yeah let's get to come back to
space because that it's still more
fascinating than then connectors yeah
but I I'm kind of surprised like
personally my perspective is this is the
smartest thing that Apple's done in a
long time and that's not saying much but
if they were to actually integrate us bc
makes more sense but they have such a
long track history of suing their own
proprietary command
yeah but and they've created a whole
ecosystem around it there's a there's a
lot of folks in the chat that that
believe that USBC is not as flexible as
lightning I I mean like they might know
more about engineering than I do I don't
know what the primary differences are
between USB type-c and lightning but I
think they both have audio capabilities
yes they both have data transfer so
there are a lot of similarities and if
Apple did want to swap it out there are
obviously multiple examples in the
Android universe that that you know
these are flagship phones that they
could potentially do it and all the art
the argument is is that you know they're
just going to get rid of the headphone
jack in the next year or two across like
the entire smartphone Calgary of Brian
they totally should but they're not
going they're not going to but they
should it's interesting too because the
right thing to do hey buddy this isn't
run by customer yes which again it goes
back to my point it's the right thing to
do and they could stand to lose some
money obviously even though like why
would they they're not their business
they're not a charity so why they would
do something altruistic like this it
might benefit um their macbook line
because then their macbook line could
actually yeah more with with the iphones
but i don't i really don't see it
happening but i do want to reiterate the
fact that this isn't from some like no
name random website this is from The
Wall Street Journal so that's why we're
talking about it because they are more
legitimate news publication a little
blog I mean it happen they have been
since we're on youtube I will say they
have been known to get things wrong
sometimes or at least touche get a
little off on things klaren I like the
point that she raises that the Apple
should just simply step up the quality
of their cable manufacturing they I
don't know about you but I've probably
gone through like six or seven charging
cables for my phone's over the years and
they're just not a bug it's a feature
yeah right i mean like they make they
make a lot of money off of this stuff
and it's really not rocket science like
why would they give that up they get
they get a lot of money which is just
passive income from licensing this stuff
switching to USB type-c i mean i just
don't see it happening part of the issue
though is that
a lot of fake lightning cables out there
that like that they don't make my have
yeah I'm us also like destroys their
reputation that's that's definitely a
very good point and I there's like I see
that happens we see us yeah but then it
wouldn't be only like applicable to
Apple devices very good point this
thought from UCR Apple is going to keep
their lightning connector for one more
addition to the phone after that they'll
most likely switch over to magnetic
charging yeah now we've the idea of
wireless charging has been floated down
there right and wireless audio so you
could potentially get rid of the
connector and no ports yeah it's gonna
say that if adds something if Apple's
like making this whole move towards you
know we want like a wireless society
because we have courage you know I mean
first of all I get rid of the headphones
sure but then you know the next move
would probably be for wireless charging
to me that's the next like big
innovation in like phone technology and
phone hardware right and to be clear
that is not something that we've been
hearing as a rumor for the upcoming
iPhone in September wireless charging
has been like one of those perennial
wishlist items for years related to the
iphone and it just has not come come up
so i don't really have high expectations
that that's what's going to happen what
we have been hearing relating to the new
iphone is is that they're gonna get rid
of the physical home button entirely
it's going to be a bigger screen this is
also in that wall street journal story
most of that story by the way what
you're just carrying a class in your
pocket right but like a shank yeah yeah
yeah i guide it topples doubles as a
shank the other thing they the wall
street journal most of the story
actually referenced the idea that they
were going to have a curved OLED screen
which is essentially playing catch-up
with samsung so that is another
potential rumor and you know you get a
slightly better screen instead of an LCD
screen um yeah i would love to see an
apple device on the whole I'd honestly
it should have happened already that's
my point that's why i'm saying i would
love to see it you know it's just you
know the quality of like the the screen
is so much better on oled yeah yeah
shout out to slide and matthew in the
chat let's get ready to dungal totally
without a life this is that but uh yeah
now that we're talking about it it does
kind of feel like wouldn't it be great
if they actually did get rid of
lightning cuz then the macbook situation
would actually be resolved you know what
this don't see it it all just sounds
like wouldn't it be great if the Samsung
I mean if like the Apple iPhone was the
samsung galaxy SI values that are on the
galaxy ended that's true that's true but
you're talking about a completely
different operating system and a lot of
people that are in the Apple universe
you know the the operating systems work
with each other whether it's on a bus or
you know just think about all the rumors
where it's basically like oh we're gonna
make it um curved screen right Oh led us
BTW USB type-c these all are armed with
samsung 0 one of the primary reasons I
continue to have an iphone is because of
iOS yeah don't license out iOS so but
your point is totally accurate that if
the s8 is everything everybody hopes it
is then it's going to continue to do
really well and Samsung sells those
phones really well and yes seven is done
well the note 7 as far as i can tell has
sold fantastic there's nothing wrong
with that a bone right yeah it's a
perfect phones perfect phone I'm sorry
best fun there's some endearing comments
about blackberry people are optimistic
about blackberry bouncing back it's
unfortunate that i have to mention the
fact that we've been here before and it
hasn't happened before and there have
been efforts to revive the blackberry
band for brand for years so if black i
think that's great if they make a
comeback and I'm wrong I'll eat a
blackberry eat yeah yeah I'll also eat a
blackberry I mean like that's done you
don't want to say like you want to eat a
bug or you're gonna like smashing I
ganya laid a blackberry I mean like
that's not that's not saying all but ok
i will also you know blackberry how long
do is is that they've got almost like
zero market share that's the thing like
so they have they have a lot of coming
back to at the end of the day it gets
down to like you can have the best phone
you know in the world but it gets
knotted like do people want to buy it
and
that's what a lot of people said about
Windows Phones is that like the windows
phone operating system was not bad it
just was a little late to the market
yeah and that's exactly how I feel about
BlackBerry's just nobody is interested
in this phone and one of their like
bigger selling points in it right now is
one their keyboard and to their their
security which you know Apple already
has that market cornered as far as like
phone security goes and then the
keyboard aspect like I love keyboards on
a phone I've talked about this in
previous podcast but it was just one of
those things where you know I swipe is
way better than using a physical
keyboard and there's just so many more
advantages and not having a keyboard
like blocking like half of your screen
mm-hmm wait but you do love a physical
cue yes because I I love being able to
type without looking at my phone which
is like easily one of the best features
like best benefits of a physical
keyboard oulad modular portlets phone
that's why modular cuz then you can add
and remove that keyboard at will yeah
that would be cool if they had had like
the blackberry where the keyboard is
like a modular aspect than they were
yeah that would be interesting you're
weirdly onto something gee things that
people that would actually benefit
customers I'm a genius y'all props to
Angela in the chat to who says I'm
stoked to go to the moon but can we
leave the Kardashians and Kanye West
behind now we have to take them why
can't we just send them to the moon Oh
everybody stays here okay but they would
have the hottest moon album of all time
they would have a break now and what I'd
like to see what they name the twins
wait is she pregnant with twins out
holidays beyonce is pregnant with twins
and George Clooney's wife is pregnant
with twins boom cello RV and then end of
that conversation cuz we don't need the
call to talk about crap let's talk more
about the moon let's talk more about the
mood and not the guy I can't wait for
the first music festival on the moon mmm
that would be absolutely terrible that
really is just a futurama episode it
should be basically like our lives are
going to be a futurama i hope this
podcast is going on long enough that we
can bring zoidberg on because that would
i not grade though we haven't met any
aliens yet but when we do you're invited
on the podcast if you don't colonize us
i'm trying to think like what a trip
like how long would that trip be did
they say
around the moon no but they've done it
both that's perfect right I just I just
think it's like super boring if you're
just fly imagine if you were like if you
paid a bunch of money to see like the
Grand Canyon right but you didn't get to
see you literally your plane flew over
it and then you went back home I think
imma Grand Canyon or the moon or two on
two different tears here by like
seriously like my childhood dream is to
like go to space like if I don't think
I'm not be more excited by the fact that
average Joe can go to space in the near
but you can already go to space
currently just kind of not really you're
like low orbit can't you you can go to
low orbit but it still costs an arm and
a leg and space not space it's kind of
space yeah it's not really space not
till you break the atmosphere I want to
do that I want to do that I want to get
out of Dodge I mean like my kids are
probably gonna get to do that they'll
get to be like bored with their kids
they'll be they'll have like they're
bored millennial Alfred Incas healer go
to the moon again vegan but like we're
not even there yet get excited if it was
in a price point yeah i mean i would
totally consider this like i made like
five hundred bucks yeah like if it was a
forward our trip I totally go I'd go to
the moon like I was scheduled it right
now yeah um if you want to make it so I
don't have to pay for I'd be way more
excited if it were a free trip that's
what I'm saying go to my GoFundMe a
gamma rays 25 million dollars to go to
the moon courtesy of a sec so uh if you
go to the moon I'll eat a whoopie pie on
air Wow I know right I heard it here
first he said he was gonna eat a
blackberry I mean like that's hardly
like a dare or anything you're not uh
you're not putting a lot out the hell
are you talking about I got really
derailed really quick so at least have a
moon pie a moon pie fine still stupid
all right how much yeah how much what
our viewers pay to go to the moon yeah
how much would you pay calling out to
the chat what would you throw down out
of your own bank account to go room not
to the moon holidays and around the moon
do an actual trip to space curious go
like 10 grand I don't have a lot of that
Trevor would probably take so long that
you would probably be like too tired to
even like look at the moon like the
breathe too much you think so rocket
I courgette like I guess that gene says
10 grand oasis 55 bucks slides is not a
dime Matthew says double good cruise
Chad says 10k James Cook says a million
dollars I'd like to congratulate guy
Valentin grand chances 10 grand yeah
that sounds like the about the average
there's yeah 10 grand yeah so a decade
oh no we're talking 25 mil it's gonna
take a really long time renard Joe six
packs like us to get to them 10 grand
wouldn't even pay for like the fuel to
get there today yeah today but you know
things things could change it could have
I saw a great Facebook post of twenty
dollars mm-hmm to the highest bidder
that's how great Facebook post war is
like we didn't even land on the moon and
these guys are gonna try to fly around
the Mo's I yep this guy is not smart I
mean you know that what's what's his
name said the earth is flat which one
that basketball players and I don't know
names I don't know if we are so bad Oh
Oh Bobby you're talking about I mean I
find that's all over here as soon as a
dude says the earth is flat I'm just
like you automatically don't exist to me
anymore yes I mean I guess it's possible
I'm kidding no it's not possible um all
right do we have any other questions
more uh more more bids for the trip but
that's about it okay I think that's a
good place to stop yeah let's do it
let's start saving our money everybody
hit up Alfred's GoFundMe thank you we
got our start that go and fund me you
might actually get some cash out of this
um alright that sounds good all right
thank you a buddy thanks everybody for
watching 359 is available on iTunes
