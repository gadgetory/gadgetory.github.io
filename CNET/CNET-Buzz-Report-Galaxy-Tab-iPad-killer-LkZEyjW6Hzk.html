buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
it's more CEO scandal the almost
complete erosion of your electronic
liberties and search that reads your
mind but first it's the gadget of the
week the gadget of the week is the
samsung galaxy tab on paper it looks
like the best ipad competitor yet it's a
7-inch slate with a high res display
android 2.2 with flash support and the
android market 16 or 32 gigs of ram gps
a 3.2 megapixel camera on the back that
takes video and a front facing camera
for video chat it's got Wi-Fi 2.5 g and
3g wireless capability and a stated
seven hours of battery life so you know
it's the sex pricing has not been
announced and it's making me nervous
reports say it will go from anywhere
from 200 to 400 dollars with a contract
or a thousand dollars without and if
it's a thousand dollars point ipad come
on samsung don't screw this up and now
for the news good drama in tech exec
land this week first oracle CEO larry
ellison went ahead and offered his buddy
mark hurd a co-president job there at
oracle just a few weeks after HP booted
him over doctoring expense reports to
cover up the most sexless affair in
history apparently one board sin is
another boards competitive opportunity
but then HP sued heard saying look buddy
we paid you millions of dollars to go
away quietly not say a word about our
corporate trade secrets and now you're
planning to go give them all to oracle
hell to the no in response oracle said
that HP was just making it really really
hard for them to work together what with
all this hostility in the wild
accusations it's just not cool Oh rich
white guys you should totally get a
Bravo show
the real rich white guys of Silicon
Valley every thursday at nine eight
central every x Bravo's watch what
happens in other news this week Google
showed off a new feature it calls
instant search instant so when you type
Google predicts what it thinks you're
looking for and it pops up searches
until you find what you need and it is
amazing and it's clearly a super
incredible technological feat to serve
that many results pages one after
another in real time as you type I mean
wow but admit it are we all just waiting
for the Easter eggs where you're typing
a little innocent thing and then you get
a super dirty results page i know i am
in more serious news this week the ACLU
wants a federal court to make it
unconstitutional for border guards to
search your laptop's phone electronics
for any reason whatsoever ya know they
are currently totally allowed to do that
the border searches are an exception to
the Fourth Amendment which would
otherwise require some sort of suspicion
or reason for a warrantless search the
exception has been around since 2008 and
it's being fairly definitively abused so
that's working its way through the
courts now go ACLU hey unrelated note
you guys know all about truecrypt and
creating hidden encrypted partitions on
your computer's right okay just checking
speaking of warrantless searches an
appeals court said this week that the
FBI and police agencies do not need to
get a warrant to use your cell phone to
track your location or to get records
from your cell phone provider about
where you've taken your phone in the
past the court agreed with the Obama
administration which said that you have
no expectation of privacy when it comes
to um where you are Wow what has
happened to you America it's enough to
make me go off the grid if it weren't
for the fact that i'm kind of like one
of these college kids in this university
of maryland study they took away their
cell phones and their social media for a
day and most of the students reported
actual withdrawal like symptoms like
anxiety in the shade
I know I totally understand it's gonna
be okay can I actually borrow your cell
phone though because we've been taping
in here for a while and haha yeah no
reason I just was haha that's the buzz
report for this week everybody I'm
Hollywood and thank you for watching
somebody get me a droid come on samsung
don't screw this up the pad looks
awesome the tab looks awesome actually
no we can cut it after don't screw this
up okay note to Sarah yeah cuz that was
like a lot of tech specs I don't want to
read again mm-hmm okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
