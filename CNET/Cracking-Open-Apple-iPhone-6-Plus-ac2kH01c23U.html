like a scaled up iPhone 6 but the
internal hardware tells a slightly
different story as I'll show you today
the phones are very similar but far from
identical I'm buildin Waller and this is
cracking open as Apple will tell you the
iPhone 6 plus is big it's noticeably
larger than the regular iPhone 6 and in
my opinion it's 5.5 inch screen puts it
very close to phablet territory now
luckily cracking open the 6 plus is
identical to opening the regular 6 which
means it's easier to open than previous
iPhones now you'll still need to remove
the two pentalobe screws along the
bottom edge with a special screwdriver
but Apple relocated the ribbon cable on
the home button which means you no
longer need to worry about tearing it
when popping open the front panel now
with the front panel open the first
thing we're going to do is remove
several metal plates which cover
connectors for the battery front panel
and other components then we'll
disconnect the battery and remove the
front panel the overall hardware layout
is the same as on the regular iPhone 6
there's a speaker and lightning
connector assembly at the bottom battery
along the left side motherboard along
the right and the camera assembly at the
top now attach the front panel are the
display front camera and sensors
earpiece speaker and the home button now
there's also a new metal plate that sits
behind the screen while I would usually
begin our teardown by removing the
battery I'm going to leave it in place
as I remove the other components now
this will keep me from having to glue it
back in later on so the first piece to
come out is the new rear facing camera
it has the same 8 megapixel count as the
camera in the regular iPhone 6 but it
also has optical image stabilization the
vibration mechanism comes out next and
after removing a few screws and
standoffs and detaching the remaining
connectors we can lift out the logic
board now unfortunately
the shields that cover the 6 pluses
logic border soldered in place obscuring
our view of the new a 8 processor in 8
motion tracking chip and NFC chips as I
want to put this phone back together in
working order I'm going to leave the
shields in place so the last piece to
come out is the speaker assembly still
attached to the case are the headphone
and lightning connector assembly volume
buttons ringer switch power button a
small antenna and a slew of ribbon
cables now most of these components are
held to the case with both screws and
adhesive if any of these pieces were
damaged removing and replacing them
wouldn't be too difficult but I don't
want to risk damaging them during
removal so I'm going to leave them where
they are now as I said at the beginning
although the iPhone six-plus may look
like an oversized six there are some
significant differences inside the case
now first off the overall layout is very
similar but not identical
for example the vibration mechanisms are
different and are located in different
spots likewise the external speakers are
different now the pluses 11.1 watt our
battery is also much larger than the
regular sixes six point nine one watt
hour unit and the logic boards are
different as with the regular iPhone 6
if you only looked at the 6 plus on the
outside you'd miss some really
interesting and important design changes
that lurk inside the phone now for a
complete list of specs pricing and
real-world tests check out Tim Stevens's
