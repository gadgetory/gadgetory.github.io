built like tanks offer well-designed
lighting scheme and controls and you can
get a reasonably fast configuration for
the money they're not necessarily for
folks who like to embassy fiddle to eke
out the last drop of performance though
with no software tools to monitor adjust
CPU settings for example L anywhere
doesn't make it convenient one of the
Alienware 17 only options is the Tobii
eye tracking system tobey's system
currently works with about 90 games not
a huge number given the breadth and
variety of games that exist it consists
of two sensors blode screen and software
controls in theory it should feel more
natural than other forms of game
navigation but I find my eyes wander too
much as I discovered when I enabled the
gaze trace feature the system also works
in conjunction with power management to
for instance wake when you gaze at the
alien head the two series have basically
the same designs pretty basic boring
brown but they have nice lighting design
and the softer to program both the
chassis and the keyboard works well and
speaking of the keyboard it's still
reinforced with a decent feel not
mechanical but not wholly membrane II
that unlike a lot of gaming laptops is
also comfortable for typing the display
options include a 120 Hertz g-sync
better than cheap TN monitor which is
fast and it's decent for games with its
92 93 % srgb ganon both have the same
set of connections including alien wears
dedicated connector firts
external GPU a handful of USB ports mini
DisplayPort to support to sync out the
17-inch at least has room for a lot more
USB connections which would come in
handy for VR and fans are allowed on
both and they seem like they're always
on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
