welcome to the Apple bite for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
last week we looked at the best moments
for Apple in 2017 and this week it's
going to be about their worst ones now
warning if you're the type of person who
gets motion sickness shortness of breath
or diarrhea when any single negative
thing is said about Apple don't watch
this now I know you're out there because
I read the comments all right let's get
to what had to be the biggest loser for
Apple in 2017 i OS 11 I Oh s was plagued
by bug after bug week after week with
one fix after another and these weren't
small ones we couldn't see I know
mistakes are made we get that but this
was a whole nother level now it started
with the letter I bug the most
front-facing bug that changed letter I
into a letter a with a symbol in a box
and everyone could see it on Twitter on
Facebook really everywhere so Apple fix
that with iOS 11.1 but that had the
crack Wi-Fi vulnerability that could
give access to your files from anyone
then that was patched with iOS 11 1.1
which then brought us the it and is bug
that autocorrected some users to the
words I dot T and I dot s which was
quickly fixed with eleven point 1.2 that
also fixed the cold weather bug where
iPhone tens would become unresponsive in
cold weather then came I Oh s eleven
point two that would bring Apple pay
cash but that switch wasn't flipped on
instead iOS eleven point two was rolled
out early to prevent a looping bug
associated with December the second okay
so they finally turn on Apple pay cash a
few days later and then a new zero day
bug iOS homekit vulnerability was
discovered that would allow remote
access to smart accessories like your
door locks it was plain embarrassing and
who knows what else might show up by the
time you see this but it's been that
kind of a year for iOS 11 and it's the
sloppiest and buggiest iOS we've ever
seen you could see why it was a loser
and it was a bad bad apple alright
another low moment for Apple the delay
of the home
to early 2018 and yes I want them to
make sure they get this product right
but they're already a distant third in
the voice assistant speakers and that
gap is only grown after the holiday
season with deep discounts on Amazon to
echo and Google home platform now if
there was a time to be part of the smart
home push it was this year an Apple dude
they completely missed it on top of that
everything we know about the home pod
doesn't tell us that we need to have it
it's compatible with fewer smart home
products there are no skills or
abilities Siri has grown up but it's not
as smart as Alexa or the Google
assistant and it looks like it will only
support Apple music natively on lunch so
it comes down to it its biggest
differentiator will be its sound quality
for 3:49 and I never I never
underestimate the power of the Apple
fanatics but I've had an echo in Google
home since day one and three plus years
later Apple still hasn't given me a
reason to change that okay are you also
with me or is this a you know just too
painful right now Apple by nation here's
a hug to make you feel better thanks
Brian I needed that see I know you feel
good next up the iMac pro it's out now
and Apple delivered on their December
timetable nothing is really wrong with
the product itself it's a beast but I'm
pointing a finger directly at Apple's
leadership this one this is the grand
vision that they had for the
professional desktop of the future for
Mac users a beefed up iMac not a modular
tower that allows professionals to
customize it on the fly with graphics
cards sound cards and memory they turn
their back on that group with the
garbage can design Mac Pro but then
Apple didn't release a legitimate
upgrade or really anything significant
since December of 2013 and what do we
get an admission from Apple leadership
in April of this year that they are
completely rethinking the Mac Pro and it
will launch sometime beyond 2017 like
when exactly is that who knows I'm happy
they realize this now but they alienated
their creatives the people that put them
on the map without anything for over
three years plus now that's light-years
in the tech world and the iMac pro is a
result of their Mis
guided vision of what professionals
really want maybe they'll prove me wrong
but starting at 4999 bucks
I don't think so so what did I miss
everybody Oh hold on don't let me forget
about the knotch on the iPhone 10 not
the iPhone 10 as a whole but
specifically then knotch
I won't get over it because I'm not
gonna settle like Samsung even went in
for the jugular
I made a TV ad about it but Apple by
nation you know how I feel I don't like
it at all
all right so what were your biggest
losers from Apple in 2017 would you put
an emoji he's on that list I'd love to
hear what you think in the comments and
you notice I didn't put the iPhone 10 on
either the winners or the losers list I
think it's one of the most interesting
things that Apple is released in recent
years I enjoy it and it's also kind of
frustrating at the same time but it
isn't an outright success or failure and
everyone has different opinions about it
guess what that's what makes us all fun
for all of us who love tech and if
you're angry right now just watch our
best moments for Apple of 2017
okay that's gonna do for this week's
show we've got more coming for you to
keep you warm during the break email us

me at Brian Tong drop your thoughts in
the comments below thanks so much for
watching we'll catch you all next time
