past their 60s they begin to get a lot
less good at it now that concepts
nothing new but technologies that can
help our I'm Brian Cooley with the top
five car technologies that you might
want to nudge your folks to consider
when they buy their next car number five
is failing to yield failing to yield at
an intersection or blowing a stopper red
light is charged in some thirty-seven
percent of elder accidents but I rank
this low because technology to help a
lot is still pending that would be
vehicle to vehicle communications that
will let cars signal each other to avoid
a collision the US government is set to
launch rules likely in 2014 but it
wouldn't be in cars for several years
after that meantime remind dad it
doesn't matter who had the right-of-way
the real win is not getting into a crash
number four inattentiveness or lost in
thought definitely the most poetically
described thing I've ever seen in
government research it's not a huge
portion of driver distraction most older
drivers actually don't drive distracted
but now we do have tech from Ford
Mercedes BMW and Volvo to detect and
alert driver drowsiness what we are
missing still is something to get inside
the head of drivers older otherwise and
just refocus their attention when
they're wide awake number three side
impacts left and right side hits amount
to about thirty percent of all elder
crashes when sorted by impact angle to
technologies can help here the first is
passive or active blind spot technology
now if it's passive make sure the
warning lights are big invisible like I
find in Audis if mom and dad seem to
always be cutting off let's say a bike
on the right hand side then look into
hondas cars that have a camera that
looks down the right side of the vehicle
when you signal that way my second tech
tip is kind of low tech it's a car that
has clean sight lines out the a-pillars
these are the ones that hold up the
front of the windshield now there are
big differences in these between cars
generally the more slope and thicker the
a-pillar the more stuff you can complete
who's behind it until it's too late
number two rear-end collisions this is a
big one for older drivers a few years
ago mom and dad would have had to have
been fairly money to get technology help
here today no longer the case it's not
just Volvo's Mercedes and infinity to
have forward collision tech look at
Subarus eyesight a great example of an
affordable car with camera technican
sense of forward collision and break all
the way down to a dead stop if need be
to prevent a rear ender and it works at
closing speed Delta's at up to 19 miles
per hour which is quite a bit before it
gets you to number one evidence that
sixty really is the new 50 drivers in
their 60s are actually not involved in a
lot more accidents with other cars in
fact they're less involved than people
in their teens and 20s now it's the 70s
and 80s where things get rough and
drivers over 80 have five times the
accident risk compared to people in
their 40s and 50s that's the red zone
the number one place where tech can help
your folks is backing up whether their
necks are too stiff to turn around and
look or their eyes are too bad to see
anything if they do backing up is a
problem for old folks adding up to some
twenty three percent of crash impact
points a rear cam in their car is a must
now they are likely to become required
on new cars in a couple of years but
they already show up on most new cars
already so this will be one less
argument you have to have when your
parent says oh I don't need that yes in
the meantime convince them that they
have to have it and a surround camera
option might not hurt either but i find
the display zones on those tend to be
awfully small that rear cam is the big
