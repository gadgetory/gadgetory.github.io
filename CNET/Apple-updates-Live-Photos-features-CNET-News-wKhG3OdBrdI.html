beautiful portrait photos but also these
great live photos and you know live
photos capture is still but then also a
bunch of video automatically captured
around it and sometimes the best shot
wasn't the still well now we can go into
edit mode we could trim this video if we
want but we also can capture just the
frame we want and make that our key
photo now
we can do other really fun things with
live photos now here's one great shot
this girl blowing a bubble but would it
be greater great if she could just keep
blowing that bubble well now she can we
actually use computer vision to compute
a seamless loop around this live photo
it's really fun yeah we can really do
some artistic things with live photos as
well so you see this is a shot where we
have still landscape but then this
movement in the water now if you wanted
to capture this kind of motion
traditionally you'd have to get a tripod
and figure out how to configure a long
exposure on your high-end camera but now
you can actually just go into the
effects here and select long exposure
and check it out it's really gorgeous
yeah let's take a quick look at memories
because you see memories can now capture
things like activities like scuba diving
can spot your anniversaries these really
touching memories of your children
growing up and most importantly your
pets let's play a movie about these pets
and what we'll see is that we play them
of course traditionally here in
landscape which is a great way to watch
video and of course
memories is using computer vision to
actually identify photos of your pet and
pick the best scenes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
