I'm just wondering if you take a look at
this list of four companies who do you
all think is the most vulnerable or
who's the first one that might be bumped
off the list in the future that's hard
to tell i would say amazon ecommerce
there's something interesting that's
happening in e-commerce that I think
none of us expected say nine months ago
I'd say everyone thought ecommerce was
done and there were two major players
amazon and ebay but really it was done
for i would say nerds it's a ginormous
product catalog and the interface isn't
all that beautiful but if you want to
look at all the cameras and no you're
fine yeah well now you look at fab guilt
pinterest you know there's curated
variants more curated curation it looks
like you're shopping on fillmore street
much more than your shop angry you know
on geeks Adam you we had something to
say about vote who's vulnerable in this
list well every company is vulnerable on
the list that's one of the beautiful
things about the technology industry i
offered two observations Apple
absolutely is vulnerable because Apple
has a bet the company model Apple has
bets big makes huge investments and if
it fails which it hasn't for 15 years
it'll be really bad now they have a
hundred billion dollars which they're
going to try to whittle down but they
won't be successful even in whittling
that down and they also have the mac
business which is an annuity for for
Apple right now so they have a lot of
cushion but they do have plenty of
vulnerabilities which is getting the
next product right and alum I've been
saying this for years and I've been
wrong every time but I just want to
offer an observation about Facebook I do
not think that Facebook has changed the
world I do not think that Facebook has
reordered the way everybody lives their
lives i think it's a very successful and
very interesting publishing company that
has created a new model for advertising
and that's fantastic but I don't think
it's changing are you on facebook Am I
yes okay
selling a but I don't think your own
life look like I'm on face no I'm sure
I'm not that I am I get it in other what
we're not I do I would argue though that
Facebook is in a precarious position I
think that Facebook changed behavior on
the web so if the internet is what
changed our society fundamentally and
it's the greatest thing we've probably
done as a you know a species that
Facebook change the way we interact with
the that was hyperbole I'm oh okay don't
worry um there's people who believe that
you know that's true well you know it's
pretty good not going to go through the
whole list but the Internet's pretty
good i think that facebook probably
changed fundamentally the way that we
interact with the with the internet
right it created a closed system that we
were ok with it created you know safe
space it created this idea of connection
where i think that that hadn't existed
as concretely before but i think
facebook i created identity that is a
huge which is huge i think though that
facebook is a little bit vulnerable
right now I think that they're in a
precarious position especially as they
go into an IPO without the growth
potential that they had when they were
maybe only 400 million users and I think
that that part of creating that identity
part of creating those connections is
creating a little bit of backlash
facebook you know unlike actually a
computer a search engine or a commerce
engine facebook is utterly optional and
easily replaceable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
