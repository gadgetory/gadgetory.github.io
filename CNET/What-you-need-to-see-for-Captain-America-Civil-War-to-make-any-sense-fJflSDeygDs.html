oh my goodness look how many of them
there are how can you possibly watch all
this how could anyone good grief how are
you ever going to understand Captain
America Civil War well don't panic we've
seen Civil War and we can tell you it
will make sense even if you haven't seen
every Marvel thing but there are some
movies you'll need to see first we've
crunched the numbers and we reckon this
is the least you need to see to get the
most amount of sense giving as little
away as possible and in the spirit of
doing the bare minimum here's the bare
minimum you need to have seen for
Captain America Civil War to make any
kind of sense
Captain America although Civil War
features loads of superheroes it's still
very much a sequel to caps standalone
outings even if you know the basics of
the wartime origin story it's worth
watching the movie that started it all
because there are side characters you'll
need to know about Captain America the
Winter Soldier the Civil War to make
sense to you it's essential that you've
seen the Winter Soldier because the
titular soldier is frankly crucial to
the story as is a certain winged
superhero as a bonus you'll also learn
about Hydra and more of Steve Rogers
friendship with Black Widow which is
useful Civil War backstory Avengers age
of Ultron put simply if you haven't seen
the second Avengers film you're going to
spend a lot of time in Civil War going
who's this guy you really need to check
it out first
age of Ultron also digs deeper into Iron
Man Tony Stark's fears and insecurities
around global security which is useful
Intel and you'll want to know why
everyone keeps talking about the
fictional Eastern European country of
sokovia look ant-man is in Civil War
okay and you don't want to spend some of
civil wars 147 minutes trying to figure
out why Mike from friends is the size of
a grain of rice
now get your tickets sit back and enjoy
the chaos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
