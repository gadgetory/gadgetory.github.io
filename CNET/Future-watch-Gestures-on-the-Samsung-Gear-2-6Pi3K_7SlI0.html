proceeded here at the Tizen developer
conference in San Francisco what I've
got is a demo here of gesture control on
a regular ordinary Samsung gear 2
SmartWatch so Samsung's research team
out of Spain has put gesture control on
this device and with it you can play a
game you can turn music volume up were
down you can maybe turn on and off the
light switches air conditioning that
sort of thing so it's pretty simple you
basically engage the app and you want to
use you tap on the screen make a very
clear decided motion and return to the
start position and that tells whatever
app contextually that you're working
with that you want to fulfill that task
so for an example we're going to play a
little game it's called evil fish so to
play the game I start the fish goes down
my wrist goes down and back up to the
start position and I'm knocked him out
take that you evil fish I'm really good
at this game apparently today apart from
developers and apart from the engineer
as I'm the only person who's played this
game so in the future they're going to
add pushing and pulling but for right
now we've just got the four directions
north south east and west
I want them to add actual punching so
right now I'm in the music player remote
I tap the screen i make my movement the
right to either turn on the song or to
advance it if it's done I can press the
screen again and raise my arm to
increase the volume I can also lower my
arm to decrease the volume and if I want
to stop I just tap the screen and I move
my arm to the left and then back to the
start position once again this is all in
preview phase right now when are we
going to see the technology and real
devices like the gear too we don't know
yet but hopefully soon I'm just a good
ol court for cnet you can catch even
more great videos at cnet com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
