monitor certainly looks the part that's
relatively unusual for a company that
doesn't have a dedicated gaming brand
with fast well performing IPS panel high
refresh rate she synched and a roomie
slightly curved screen it's a nice
package for many types of games the
resolutions a sore spot though 2560 by
1080 is low for a display this size you
can always scale a high-resolution
monitor back for faster gameplay but you
can't make a low resolution monitor
magically add more pixels and for work
on a white background the pixel grid is
pretty obvious the stands well-designed
connectors are easily accessible in the
back and there's a snap in piece for
cable management or hanging your headset
on you can also raise and lower it
sufficiently to accommodate most people
and tilt it back about 20 degrees like a
lot of monitors the 34 you see 89 G uses
a single joystick control for its
settings and menu navigation LG's is
particularly nice located right in the
middle of the bottom under the logo so
you don't have to grope for it
it's easy to maneuver and the on-screen
menu display defaults to the bottom
middle rather than stretched across the
bottom or on the side LG doesn't offer
any particularly novel features but it
includes all the basics at least for
gaming black stabilizer is LG's name for
it setting to change the gamma and
shadows for games where enemies lurked
in dark corners under low in medium
settings the effect is pretty subtle but
it's quite noticeable on high it can
display a crosshair or dot in the center
which helps quickly orient a target in
your sights
but you can't tie them to profiles and
they're always globally on or off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
