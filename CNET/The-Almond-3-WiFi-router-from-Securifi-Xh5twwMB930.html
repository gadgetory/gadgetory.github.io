now this is a dual band Wi-Fi router
with the top speed of up to 830 megabit
per second but don't care I know you're
all looking at this screen right here
that's right it is one of the few on the
market that come with a touchscreen you
can use the touch screen to manage and
say it up alright it is like my finger
we take a look it comes with this stylus
right here and with this it works much
better basically each of the icon here
represents a function of the router just
like an app on a smartphone I take a
look there's an ad almond function what
is for why it turns out it can also work
as a system of three identical unit you
can you any of this here as the main
router and then the other two will work
as extenders that extend the Wi-Fi
network of the router but there's more
there's an add sensor button here well
it turned out this one he can also work
as a hub for smart devices you can
actually manage your entire home via the
almond apps right here so basically this
system does it all
Wi-Fi smart devices and it can also work
with Amazon Alexa if you want to void
control it it's great right not so fast
now in testing a power system here kind
of booking now for example this screen
here is supposed to turn off by itself
and lock out after 100 seconds but that
only happened if you live it on the home
screen if you live it on any other
screen such as the status it will stay
on forever
another thing is when working as an
extender most of the function on the
screen here are not available yet is
still in there so they seem to me a lot
of thing about the system yet not really
well thought out Allah is still in beta
state and in fact some of the function
of the router here actually has the work
better on it and that means some time
yet to keep tapping and hope for the
best now in will will testing as a
single router the omen
pretty well but as a system it's not
really reliable basically you can set
the web with it or even stream some
movie but if you play online games the
disconnection would drive you nuts
so my tech is for now the over system is
trying to do too much and then kind of
fail in the core mission which is being
a reliable Wi-Fi system maybe after a
few firmware updates you're gonna work
better but even then who do you want to
pay $400 for it for that price just to
be sure
I recommend the nerdy or B or the arrow
instead and them both in fact have them
both right here the or B the arrow I
know you never taught me bragging about
what I have and that's because I'm dumb
go but this is all about the allman
three put sacrifice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
