Mobile World Congress we're checking out
Nokia's 301 so as you probably sussed as
soon as you clapped eyes on it the 301
is not your normal fancy smartphone
instead it's a very very basic mobile
but that's no bad thing because it's
very cheap indeed Nokia tells me that
this phone is going to cost not too much
more than 65 euros it's got a 2.4 inch
display that's not a touchscreen so
you'll be relying on these physical keys
down here it's got a 3.2 megapixel
camera at the back it's got this
brightly colored Nokia style looks a bit
like the Lumia phones design-wise and it
comes in a range of other colors pink
and blue black and white are also
included because it's not doing very
much because it's quite basic you should
get decent battery life and the phone
also feels quite sturdy so hopefully it
would be able to withstand a drop onto
the floor nokia is very proud of the
browser on this phone and that's because
it compresses data down using Nokia's
cloud server so because you're using
less data that should save you some
money the 301 is coming out between
April and June it looks like quite a
neat little device very basic so if
you're looking for something
uncomplicated this might be it there are
loads of really cheap Android
smartphones out there now as well though
so when this comes out it might be worth
doing a bit of shopping around I'm the
west rave cnet and this is Nokia's 301
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
