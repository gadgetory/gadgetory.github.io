because like I said that's all you do
here that's it and then you can
eliminate me that's it I'm done well cut
the break hourglass is running out so
tell me about like what is popular with
wearables in your life like what are you
doing that has you like turning to
wearables and saying oh this is the
thing I need yeah well they're
definitely not popular in my family like
if I stopped using them I would do be
welcomed sure you know buddy this is
going yeah that's one more thing I'm
coddling you know in my life so you're
saying you like that exactly it's
fantastic I did there's definitely a
time to wait on getting anything unless
you want to spend like $100 but like
what I use them for it I kept saying for
some use a pebble it's basically like a
pager on your wrist okay
and I don't think it's changed much
since then the best thing a wearable
does is buzz you and give you a reminder
which sometimes can be really helpful if
you think you might miss a call or
there's something you know you don't
want to pick up your phone right there's
also obviously the the fitness tracking
part which you know if you stick to a
routine the problem is it's a carrot on
a stick that it's got to go with like a
regular gym regimen right fishing and
I'm glad you brought up the fitness
thing because I think we this a lot of
stuff I don't want to say what I want to
say but what I'm going to say is like
hey maybe all this fitness crave stuff
is not something anyone should really
like completely you know rely on for
getting healthy yes because well no
doctor thinks of these as an answer
right
they're not medically approved he looks
at the charges like look Larry the
reason you're a hundred pounds
overweight yes you don't have a Fitbit
gotta get yourself a fix right it comes
down to like when I've been able to lose
weight or that gained weight again and
I've used two tummies things firstly got
to stick to ones if I'm switching from
one to the other that's not gonna work
yeah and yeah it's just a weighted so
it's a motivator it's like if that works
if you've got some other system that
works but these all cap out generally at
the step tracking and they do some
things like like you know running or
some heartrate stuff but the the deeper
you get the more more active you try to
get the more fitness trackers tend to
fail you sure so if you're just trying
to see you oh was i alive and walking it
makes me kind of dismissive but it's
true that's great really like if you're
gonna go to the gym three or four times
a week you know that and you know what
you're doing watch isn't gonna do so the
tracker is just like extra motivation so
use it for that use it for those I use
it for things like checking the weather
which actually things like I mean dark
sky is actually a great app let you know
like when the weather when it's gonna
rain within like five minutes so you
seem like Doc Brown and oh cool yeah so
that that I love that app yeah I'm
saying micro weather reports and I want
everyone watching on YouTube Facebook
wherever you're coming from comment on
what you're seeing right here we're
gonna answer as many questions as we can
or take your comments or do what we need
to do to help you out to ensure that you
have a successful July 4th weekend and
if you're not in the country and you're
celebrating something else you can have
a good weekend also so make sure you
interact with us and we'll get to some
of those as they come in but Scott I
want to pivot to specifically the Apple
watch the pebble the the smart watches
shirt is right now a time to own a
SmartWatch new ok moving along we're
done you know and basically if you can
spend as little as possible right now
the reason I say that is because we're
expecting all these things to get
updates in the fall like pretty much I
mean you think Apple watch should
Android wear is gonna have observable
coming out yeah new pebbles coming out
we already know about that you expect
all the other watchmakers probably gonna
follow suit so you want to kick yourself
for spending several hundred dollars and
something it's gonna get updated now
summer is a good time to wear one
because you're probably out and about
but just not a great time to buy one
unless again pebble actually makes a
couple of very affordable ones that's
probably a pretty good way to go for
something where you're not spending a
lot of money or if things on sale like a
hundred dollars where do you feel
comfortable think if it's buying a pair
of shoes right and you're okay with
getting a new pair of shoes later but
just it's like I don't want to tell you
you know don't come to me later tell me
that oh there's a new version out that's
the problem and I think they all need
improvement so there's no perfect
SmartWatch right now definitely what are
you gonna say Jeff I think I'm one that
he's invented that
looking forward to is the Microsoft band
3 I just learned that there is something
called the Microsoft band 3 tell me
about it
there the two is current right now right
that's what you're wearing but I would
like may not be aware of the Microsoft
band 1 into it right well I mean in the
smart bin smartband sense I like a
regular watch on my left and of course
and I like something that doesn't look
like a watch on my right hand okay but
you do look like you do look like some
time travel you look like a LIVESTRONG
Armstrong now my testing gadgets move
you're not fooling anyone I love this
because it has GPS and I ride a bicycle
and a lot of them don't have GPS except
for like some of the other Garmin ones
and Garmin wines and then increasingly
some of the because I started out with
the Nike FuelBand loved it was great for
steps it was great because of community
it was great because it was great for
steps in the community because it had
little motivational flags at you yeah
you know fortnight right cetera right it
was horrible if I rode my bicycle
because I would ride my bicycle maybe
ten miles and somebody to run two miles
and they'd kicked my button in the
so-called Nike Fuel measurement system I
like this because it actually logs my
distance because it has GPS okay I like
it it also has UV I can lose my movie do
you use the UV future I will this
weekend something that appeals to mind
where I mean let's be honest it's got it
under your wrist I mean you can wear it
the other way around the back hold on
let me see if it's sunny you are men so
the Microsoft band that make your you're
kind of meant to wear it flipped around
with the band with the screen oh you're
wearing your wrong you know no because
I'd rather scratch this because I'm
typing all the time wise you're like
that was ending your arm another reason
another another benefit to having it
underneath those you even have your text
alerts and tech when Scott right you
just come on the top and everybody look
like my son is always like I gotcha you
can like put your note you can use your
nose but I would like to see in terms of
futures it's great I would like to see a
better battery life yeah and maybe a
little more refined of design but I'm
content with all the
all right you're welcome I said as long
as you're not the venue oh my god
because no because it's because it's a
good time but they also had they also
added sports community as a sleep
tracker so now like like Nick Healy is
my only other friend with it
piss off too bad so I can see how well
Nick did and in the end the community
you guys you guys holding another
meeting
well no because I know you could get
competitive yeah
Nick's not doing more steps in Australia
than I can do a new year olds gravity
yeah so total is if you're gonna give
those finished band stuff now one of the
main points is he do it to compete with
people if they had a game of fire
yeah game fight and like I mean finally
Apple watch is getting on board with
that but Fitbit that's the main appeal
Fitbit I think is that you say oh you
have a friend that does it's alright it
was like I mean if you have like 10
friends that all are like using
Jawbone's right you're like the job but
exactly is they be got the club then
join that Club yeah because you you know
you got your jawbone club but hopefully
it's a platform that a lot of other
people are using that's join that job
own Club what's like people used to
spend all sorts of money on other like
diet plans and things everybody buy a
gadget just to do those things back in
that what 70s or whatever that period of
time was I didn't have you know more
advanced pedometers but that what I'm
just saying is well listen let's hear
what that has to say about this fine
stuff I believe we have a couple
questions from the internet Dominic on
Facebook loves his pebble for its long
battery charge
R&amp;amp;J said he's tried several of the smart
watches out there but he likes just an
old-fashioned watch for the basics and
Jorge had a question he wants to know if
if GPS if you think he GPS could come to
a future version of an Apple watch or if
there's any speculation that you guys
have heard about an Apple watch to in
the future
Scott what do you think about the GPS on
an Apple watch biggest problem with GPS
the iPhone just wrap that around your
wrist these problem of GPS is the
battery life hey cuz you're gonna get
like what six hours maximum of GPS used
before the most of these devices die and
so the battery life is already pretty
low
on the Apple watch er like a day and a
half and you know do you want to cut
that down further that's the only
problem and then you also make it a
little bit bigger probably because a lot
of these things have to find a way to
get that mechanism that I can write like
man they just need to make the Apple
watch automatic huh huh that's what I
think is just focused on making it more
automatic and more and more seamless so
when I say automatic I mean like powered
by the motion of your wrist oh I see
you're saying yeah exactly
like I get it that's an insane amount of
of energy you're producing but like yeah
watch isn't kind of neat to have that
that's why I like the automatic watches
of the world are amazing right and just
kind of like laughs in the face of all
these smart ones it's charging is the
most annoying thing and it's amazing to
me how many people seem okay with
charging their device the problem is
this if we had some sort of universal
charging there is there's Qi I mean like
a universal charging mat or stand right
but what happens is that all of these
wearables don't use it or they use it in
some way you have to use a special
little oh it's or two attachment you
can't just you can't just chuck them on
the table you're driving - we were
promised them that yeah where you just
light them in your charging table if you
can just take off all your stuff and
your shoes your your hat your smart
glasses your smart pants wherever you
put those on the charge table sure
that's great but I'm not gonna hunt
around for these dongles and carry them
and it gets frustrating pebble I do like
is the battery life yeah like that's a
thing look full disclosure full
transparency i pre-ordered a pebble time
- yeah on Kickstarter I backed it I
always wanted a pebble but I convinced
myself to wait and I feel like I'm
finally gonna be rewarded for my
patience this pebble time - I think
looks like you know I like the size of
that screen they really doubled up on
that they did uh yeah and I think that
they they've been making a lot of these
watches of making gains if you do care
about fitness tracking right the basic
fitness tracking has all been getting
better on those watches okay
Android wears been getting better over
time pebble has been doing automatic
step and sleep tracking so it kind of
almost does the same thing that you
would get out of a Fitbit - again the
community uh-huh
but some basic features are already in
there so you you might find yourself
pretty happy with a lot of what it
just don't expect again like the idea of
apps on a watch if you even want that
that stuff's not there some of the
things like you know payments return to
show up but again like how often do I
use this for payments I've always got my
wallet and it's not showing up on every
terminal so yeah what do you think the
next big step smartwatches have to
achieve for them to hit this sort of
like critical mass Mike had dinner in
San Francisco when I was at there last
time it was like sitting next to this
couple and it's like the classic average
you know person they were in text was
different right
but I thought that their comment was
gonna be something about like battery
life and basically they just said yeah
you tap all by one of those when does it
cost $700 as price and yeah price and
like I can use it away from my phone
yeah what you have to sever that
connection yeah so yeah I actually think
those two things that actually hits I'm
saying its price and you know people the
more people realize how much you need
your phone around these things do a
little bit without your phone but not
enough and that really breaks the like
magic super watch thought sure what what
am I using this for yeah I think you
could make do it more with that now 3G
connection some of these watches already
have cellular Samsung gear s2 3G again
your times and other radio it's and
other powers so cuts on all these things
cut down when I wear them times the last
49 hours
it's battery LG has one that it's 3G
Android wear but you know you have to
pay for the extra data your it they're
bigger they they don't really make much
sense a lot of a lot of the apps don't
really feel hooked into it right so it's
kind of interesting idea but it's not
really an interesting idea but at some
point you do want it to work just just
like work and I know that sounds dumb
enough but no that's it is that you
don't want to spend a lot of time under
watch everybody's onto that we're just
not there yet no we're just not there
and watch faces I think finally somebody
said that's a great point but watch the
360 you just make all these things
should be your cool wine laces and let
me do it on the computer like letting
give me the great set of tools pebble
motor whatever it is even Apple I'm
Hewitt I let me build it let me build it
and do what I want and add as many if I
want that scream application film yeah
with like 20 all the state capitals I
don't know I wear I just like a look at
the microscope a jeweler's loupe so what
I want that X I agree
all right we're all right well there's a
question from YouTube more smart watch
batteries getting bigger like physically
or or they weren't specific I guess they
have to get bigger if they're gonna get
take up more real estate you mean they
may have to or I think you're gonna have
a hard time making even more efficient
process you're up against a bit of a
wall right uh they might have to get a
little bit bigger yeah I'll come up with
this I mean I actually think a way to go
would be maybe sauce or a battery
wristband
yeah maybe more I that makes sense I'm
like I don't want to see that apples put
batteries in everything put it in the
wristband well pebble did that whole
smart band thing which I've never really
turn into anything and so why don't you
have like smart strapped accessories
right all right good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
