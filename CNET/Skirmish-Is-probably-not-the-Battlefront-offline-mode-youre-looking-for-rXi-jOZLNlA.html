we're here at Star Wars Celebration 2016
play a little better star wars
battlefront a brand new mode called
skirmish yep it's an offline mode so
it's pretty much what everyone's been
asking for for ages but it's not quite
probably what they want it's just took
two modes that already exist the Walker
assault and the fighter squadron except
now you can play with AI let's talk a
little about AI we played all the modes
to play them split screen we played them
and go off the play them by yourselves
the AI is it's functional so it's very
objective driven you'll always find a I
like scrambling all of objective and it
just keep the game moving but I found in
particular like when they weren't doing
that they were about as useful as a
chocolate teapot because there's this
points where they'll just line up and
just stand still
yeah yeah today its lucky said they seem
to like the AI Dyson clearly built the
AI they just keep pushing them out much
bored and if you played a battlefield
game which is also another game from
dice and been in a multiplayer match
when nobody's actually following the
objective they're just killing each
other you get that same kind of vibe or
it's going on a bit too long and it
seems to be dragging out so i think they
focused on making sure the AI is always
going to capture points taking over and
then when the walker appears to assault
it all kind of you know keeping you
support if you run up against any
enemies on the build nine times out of
ten you will kill them because they
probably yes they won't they barely will
chew at you they might shuffle to the
left or the right to try and avoid some
I mean there was one game when you got a
hundred plus kill ya my final match I
got 104 kills and that was pretty much
because they were just running towards
me and just staring at me the entire
time so yeah not the most challenging
but I'm really not sure who it's for no
if I think it will give it and launched
when the main game launched it would
have been a great precursor like to
prepare people for and I multiplayer but
I think what you really lose when you're
playing skirmish is this fun random
moments that you get with playing people
online
you don't get like skillful players you
don't get people you wouldn't get like a
Luke Skywalker or one of the hero
characters coming out unless you did it
and you know it's that's part of the fun
rider like layers on the field you got
to take her out Oh a lot of what made
battlefront good to play it's not a
terribly deep game it's very simple as
base level multiplayer shooting or what
made it fun is when you group up with
some you know friends and kind of work
together to push objectives it's a very
like simple type of kind of experience
multi experience without that it's kind
of empty you feels a bit like you're
wandering around the field on your own
not really doing much and like you said
you don't have these amazing moments you
know where x-wings are coming in or
layers jumping in or Dolph data up is
because there's no one else to kind of
make that happen that isn't you and if
it's just you doing it every time gets a
bit boring off for a while that's kind
of a shame but you know there are more
dlc coming out later this year so we've
got death star coming out but if you
find you're giving skirmish ago you can
download it today July twentieth and of
course we know we've got battlefront 2
coming so get excited I maybe maybe the
offline mode will be a part of a
frontier launch hopefully can
but the Marcos on Star Wars and
battlefront make sure you stay tuned to
