Sumi das and joining me is Josh
Lowensohn senior writer for seen it Josh
thanks for being with us my pleasure so
I've actually been talking all day about
Instagram basically they've backtracked
here right they changed their policies
and now they're saying no that's not
what we're going to do after all sure so
the controversy yesterday was all about
who owns your photos and where those
photos are showing up people were
worried they were going to be sold yeah
I mean a big thing that people worried
about is this is that photo of my kid or
my friend or wherever I am gonna get
used in an advertisement without my
permission and rightfully so yeah I
think we are in the world of Twitter and
Facebook and Instagram where we're
putting out content and other companies
are making money off it so this is a
classic case where something like photos
which can be a really lucrative industry
for photographers but also a big privacy
issue for people like parents kind of
converge so it's this perfect storm okay
so everybody was up in arms and then
just this afternoon on tuesday what
happened kevin psystorm issued a blog
post at your bed I mean this is a
co-founder of Instagram basically saying
just kidding we're gonna make some
changes so there's two real things
happening the first one is that they
said no you own your photos that's not
going to change we have no you know no
big i grand ideas of selling these
photos is a stock service and the other
thing they did was they basically said
that anything that you posted wasn't
going to show up on an ad that wasn't
really there idea but they weren't
really specific about how that's going
to happen right they use some language
about experimenting with advertising in
a way that's appropriate on Instagram I
mean that's really open to
interpretation and could mean any number
of things sure the big takeaway is that
that photo you took on your vacation
isn't going to show up on some ad
without you knowing or without you're
getting paid for it but they did kind of
hint that there would be a way for
someone like a celebrity or a brand to
kind of get their photos in front of
more people and more users something
like we saw with twitter with their
promoted tweets right right right right
and we've seen that on facebook as well
yeah i mean it's it's the big stories
these companies really trying to grapple
with these free services that a lot of
people are using but might be really
hard to
ties okay so there are going to be some
revised terms of service but we're
probably not going to see them in the
next 24 hours yeah I mean they said that
some more changes are coming and they
still have time to update that the big
kind of deadline that's looming is these
30 days when these are up it's
mid-january really for when these go
into effect so there's still some time
for things to move around okay the blog
post also mentioned something about
privacy options and what is that about
sure I mean one of the big concerns are
people have private accounts these are
people are taking photos but they're
only sharing them with a limited group
of people it's not public there was some
kind of questions based on the way they
worded the new privacy terms on who gets
to see that and what happens to that
content and today that the company
basically said no of those are still
private and it'll always be private we
want you to share anything you want but
to who you want okay so that was
basically another reassurance yeah I
mean the whole thing about this letter
was them saying you know what legal
terms are sticky we kind of messed up
without saying that explicitly ok got it
well thank you for breaking down that
legalese for sure for inside scoop I'm
sumedh us see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
