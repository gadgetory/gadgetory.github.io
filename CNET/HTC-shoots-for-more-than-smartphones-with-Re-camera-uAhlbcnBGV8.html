but in a turn to become a full-on
lifestyle electronics brand it has
released this Larry I'm Josh Coleman
we've seen that and know the REE isn't a
periscope for a toy sub or an inhaler
for stylish asthmatics it is a camera
designed for one-handed use to get you
from behind your smartphone and keep you
in the moment even if that moment
involves water since it's waterproof
down to a meter without a housing like a
lot of small cameras these days there is
no screen but it's wide angle lens means
you can pretty much just point eight
your subject and start shooting and as
far as shooting goes you can just pick
it up and press the big button there is
no power button but instead sensors in
the body turn the camera on when you
pick it up so you just give a quick
press to snap pictures up to 16
megapixels or a long press to record
video at 1080p or 720p and this button
here under the lens lets you record 720p
video in slow motion if you do want to
see what you're shooting you can use a
direct Wi-Fi connection to an Android
device eventually iOS devices and using
HTC Sri app you get a live view finder
and you can see and download your
recordings to your device there are
camera controls too and you have access
to settings at a time lapse mode as for
photo and video quality well their best
enjoyed on mobile devices but that makes
sense given its shoot and share features
it's also priced a bit out of impulse
purchase territory at 199 and the shape
is awkward for mounting and pocketing
you can read the full review on cnet com
but quirky design aside it's a nice
little camera for when your smartphone
gets in the way of capturing your good
times I'm Josh grobin and that's a look
at HTC's read
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
