Eric Mack live from sunny Taos New
Mexico and joining me live in the cnet
studios are our regulars Kelsey Adams
Bonnie Burton Jeff Sparkman and behind
the controls it's Steven Beecham and
also from somewhere in Texas also via
Skype we got Danny Gallagher on the line
whoa wait to Danny freeze okay that's
his motion face uh so as Americans
prepare for thanksgiving this week we
have much to be thankful for from the
new jessica jones out on netflix and a
mystery science theater 3000 reboot
hopefully coming up soon and of course
the endless on sot onslaught of star
wars the force awakens hype that's truly
the gift that keeps on giving this
holiday season uh we're gonna be
discussing all that relative awesomeness
but first I'm gonna hijack the show to
give a shout out to the hundreds of
people that so far have checked out
cnet's very first crowd-sourced sci-fi
novel for the entire month of November
which is a national novel writing month
although it should really be global
novel writing month over the past three
weeks I've been kind of functioning as
editor and had some really interesting
discussions with people from Brazil and
Nepal and all over the place and we've
still got a week to go to get to the
goal of 50,000 words which is the the
National Novel Writing Month go over
thousands of people do this every
november and so we're trying to
crowdsource 50,000 words of a sci-fi
novel that is surprisingly complicated
and takes place in multiple universes
and so there's about a week left and
anyone can join in and there's i think
at least one chapter left that hasn't
even been started yet if you want to
write a chapter or people jump in and
edit and you know just bounce ideas off
each other it's really a fascinating
thing to watch me you can
also just log in and watch the thing
developed live which I know a lot of
people do it's at cnet.com / crowd
sci-fi cnet com / crowd sci-fi and that
will actually take you right to a live
Google Doc and you can just start
jumping in and suggesting changes and
additions it's been nothing if not a
fascinating social experiment we'll see
how the the final draft works out we're
going to take quite a while to edit what
we get from this month and try to
produce a nice final product that we can
publish later probably next year on CNN
so stay tuned for that and we'll come
back to that a little bit later but
first let's just go ahead and jump right
in to jessica jones which is out a new
series out this month on netflix um our
own rich trend home wrote a review and
Bonnie you wrote more of a preview right
yeah i wrote a preview about it a couple
weeks before so here's the trailer yeah
that's a trailer oh good you could talk
attacker okay that what that was jessica
jones played by christian Ritter and
with Luke Cage who's played by Mike
Colter and that's her jumping and then
what happened and then well here's the
thing we're gonna probably be talking
about a lot of stuff that our spoiler if
extent watched jessica jones yet or you
want to stay completely virginal for
star wars which sounds dirty now that
I've said it out loud uh that you
probably should just you know mute this
and listen to other music while we talk
lalalalalala for an hour because here's
the thing jessica jones is awesome shows
on Netflix you can binge watch it one
night like i did all the episodes the
whole seasons on netflix right now and
jess used to be i'm going to use like
i'm going to talk as oh i know where it
like we're friends Jess used to be super
hero but she had to basically stop being
a superhero because she came in contact
with this horrible guy named kilgrave he
was known in the comics the Marvel
Comics as purple man uh and he was like
a Jedi mind trick guy so he
convince anyone to do anything and he's
played by the lovely david tennant as
you see right there that brings up a
great point with the kids shoving the
kids in the closet I'll bring that up
again that's one of his victims I feel
like a mystery science theater 3000 s
you'll never be extreme Bonnie I know
the wider half of the podcast so the
whole point i I've been big fan of
Jessica Jones add the comic um I'm still
hearing voices are you guys hearing what
other it is so yeah he Jedi Mind Tricks
everybody into all the policemen into
pointing the guns at each other so he
could like prove a point I mean how do
you stop a guy who can do mind control
that's the big problem with the big plot
line yeah and a big a big element of
this story and also in the comics is
that it's basically the story of someone
recovering after a violation yes yes so
the whole point of this is more and
luckily there isn't if you are very uh
you know just don't want to see a rape
scene don't worry there's no rape in the
episode it's mental it's well well yeah
he did health and yeah if someone can
mind trick you into having sex with them
against your will that's right so that's
not consent I mean basically consent but
there's no rape scene in it and no dogs
died those are the two things I can hear
about movies and TV shows and that
doesn't show up in Jessica Jones what
does happen is she has a post-traumatic
stress traumatic disorder I'd never say
that right post post traumatic stress
just a PSP STD PST together you have
acronyms trustus oh my god I can't do it
anyway so she has this residual trauma
going on because in the comics and they
don't really explore about this and I
kind of hope they do in the second
season a little bit more maybe they
won't maybe second season have nothing
do with kilgrave but in the comics
kilgrave not only forces her to sleep
with him and date him he forces her to
commit crimes and forces her to try to
kill one of the x-men and in the comics
she come pretty close to doing it till
she stopped and then she has to get
through rehabilitation but because she
did all these horrible horrible things
the rest of the superhero community
doesn't trust her so she just decides
she's not going to be super here anymore
and she's going to be a private eye
kitchen and this is the same world
that's post Avengers destroying New York
trying to save New York right this is
the same New York the Daredevils in this
is the same that's that realm so and
it's oh I'm sorry and so the cool thing
is with the show is that you have dared
down she mentions the vengers she
mentions daredevil comes into it Rosario
Dawson's in it that's not a spoiler
that's been known for a while since the
show was greenlit so she comes into it
so there's that daredevil connection and
then after this season will be Luke's
show Luke Cage has a show that's the guy
that she's romantically involved with in
this and then after that is the
defenders and they're supposed to be
another season of daredevil yeah i'm
confused if there's a second season of
daredevil i assume there is yeah i just
don't know when it shows us january is
it I remember it wasn't very soon okay
but he does have a nun and the defenders
is the one that brings them all together
defenders brings them all together and
it's just interesting how I mean this is
why I love Marvel so much is that
they're connecting everything so they're
connecting the dots to all these
superheroes and all these different
shows and if your squirrel girl fan in
the comic she is the nanny for the child
that jessica jones and Luke have but I
don't know if they're ever gonna bring
that in test that might not happen on
the TV show inconvenient why not in that
TV show and there's a lot of things on
the TV show that aren't what happens in
the comics clearly because Marvel Comics
is a huge huge many many decades worth
of storylines they can't shove
everything in their perfect example of
that is just a good Jones best friend
pansy Walker who's played by rachael
taylor and that and she is Hellcat in
the comics but they don't really talk
about her being a superhero or anything
on the TV show they just talk about her
past as a child star so it's just
interesting how they left some stuff out
and they incorporated other things and
i'm a huge jessica jones fan so anyway
so riches review you can go read it you
can read my preview and see that if you
want if you haven't seen it yet if you
want to just have a taste of what it's
going to be about or you're just
slightly interested in the show I talk
about how excited I am for the show and
the comet connections and all that stuff
if you want to read the comics and then
rich wrote a review after watching
season
and his commentary was that he thought
it was more about kilgrave and less
about Jessica Jones even though the
title of the show is just a cajones even
though the main characters jessica jones
he his criticism of the show in a
nutshell and he could watch the ritas
whole review which is really interesting
that it was more about kilgrave and less
about Jess I don't necessarily agree i
think because she was violated by
kilgrave that's the point of the show
not that it's all about kilgrave we're
all about jazz it's what happens when
you are super hero that basically is
defeated in the worst most violated way
how do you survive that and how do you
come to terms with that in the comics
there said a few years further on and
it's more about she's still dealing with
a kind of feeling of loss of specialness
like there was a time when she was free
and beautiful and strong and that's gone
forever you know she's dealing with that
whereas the the show is immediately
afterwards it's more about the violence
that fear yeah and another good thing to
bring up to is this is a world now where
humans don't really like superheroes but
they know about them yeah but they don't
know what to do so if you're watching
agents of shield right now that has a
story line of there's people that not
only do they know that aliens exist
they're super afraid of them they think
oh they're going to take over and you
know kill the humans and then and then
some cases they are killing some humans
and then in daredevil he's still kind of
keeping his persona hidden yeah um and
also in Jessica Jones it comes up quite
a few times in the series of humans that
don't really cut her a break yeah and
she's having a rough day she's having
she's trying to save people and she
constantly gets attacked by the worst
neighbor ever who's just in that case so
there's many different parts of jessica
jones one I really like that she's a
heavy drinker I was does one i said okay
i need this show I need her to be a
sloppy drunk who sexually aggressive
yeah reason oh no I need those two
things for this to be jessica jewel and
here's the thing if you i think is that
Melissa Rosenberg is the showrunner I
feel like that's her name if ya if you
look her up on Google she's done a lot
of interviews with Esquire and glamour
and all these different places about why
she made jessica jones this jessica
jones like why you didn't need to see
the actual
trauma you do see flashbacks of what she
was like with kilgrave but you don't
actually have you don't need to see the
trauma to know that it existed she is
sexually aggressive which is great I
love that I love that it's not like this
thing where she has to at the end be
demure or anything and I love that she
drinks a lot of whiskey but here's the
other thing and this we learned this
from air did we learn this from arrow I
feel like with no flash mmm alcohol
doesn't affect superhero it depends on
your powers from your parachute
that's an American you sir Captain
America could drink yeah well here's the
thing you were not in the movie well oh
you mean you mean he can drink back in
drink that's what you're saying no I
mean I remember him talking in the in
the first movie he would he was you know
at the bar with the boys and was trying
to get drunk and like yes yeah I know I
mrs. super super metabolism power right
right and same with flash right flash
can't get drunk yeah it depends and say
it depends on your precious it was like
a Jessica can drink more than a normal
person yeah and I think the same with
Luke Luke owns the bar he's invulnerable
he's yeah nothing can harm him so I
don't I don't know I don't know if
alcohol but here's the other thing if
you're a big doctor who fan and you love
David Tennant this is a perfect example
see this guy's range he was already evil
in another TV series called secret smile
he played a stalker so you should look
that up on youtube if you want to watch
it I think you see one doctor who doctor
but there's moments in jessica jones
were you almost almost feel sorry for
him almost and then you don't so i'm
just gonna leave it there i don't want
to spoil it for anyone else but i just
want to say that you should all check it
out specially if you're into superheroes
if you're into daredevil if you're into
marvel and if you're into a female
badass superheroes and i just want to
say before i forget that one aspect of
the comics of jessica jones is they're
very d glamorizing they show you the the
unglamorous side of various famous
superheroes and also a world in which
people know about superheroes but they
don't necessarily respect them yeah so
she's kind of in the position of someone
who's been targeted by revenge porn or
something like everyone knows her
business but nobody has stoli respect
her she never knows who she's gonna meet
who's gonna know something private about
her and feel like it gives him some
right to talk to her about it you know
and i will say there's a great scene
where she makes fun of a costume because
they're there are flashback scenes
especially with her and her
turn Patsy who's called Trish Walker in
this where she tries to get her to wear
a superhero costume because they grew up
together because in the comics and in
this Jessica Jones gets her powers
because they're her family are on their
way to something like Disneyland type
place and they get into a car wreck and
of course it's a radioactive truck that
run trans they ran into and she gets her
powers but her family's wiped out and
she's guilt about that that's very well
shown yeah she has survivor's guilt all
the way through the season and so it's
just interesting but they do make fun of
the costume which I think it was a great
touch because they do that in Supergirl
a little bit too when they go through
the different stages of costume they do
that every superhero show arrows gone
through that she's just pointing out
Sparkman as we come was just putting on
weight great I'm jawed of design they've
done on the flash like those costumes
could have been super dorky but look how
good they are oh yeah well daredevil
went through that to where he had kind
of a super dorky costume and then
eventually turned out okay but here's
the thing she doesn't have costume her
costume is basically what I would wear
on a day to day basis which is just like
a coat yeah which is just like dark
jeans dark shirt dark and she's always
like disheveled Shanna's michelle stern
it was knitting her own jessica jones
scarf by the way how they say i think i
have i think i had the male version so i
would be just I'll be Jessica Jones if
she was at know if she had a fibroid
problem and and no superpowers oh and if
you always have a messy apartment you
will appreciate the series of that oh do
you want me to turn the camera no no I
wasn't assistant I wasn't specified
niches are right there there's things
living in it I've named some things in
that sink yeah gunshot the nearest
window superheroes in danice's there we
go and to be fair I didn't say they were
superheroes uh to be fair to rich we did
invite him on to defend his review but
he had to go to a football soccer
football game instead opinion like I
don't unnecessarily say rich is wrong I
just don't agree with it he said she'd
be anybody and that isn't interested I
could yeah yes can I add one thing to
what Kelsey was saying earlier because I
had this thought and I was like and I
haven't watched it all the way through
so I didn't want to throw my pig I kind
of like this cuz it doesn't feel like a
marvel
property interest on say I mean I
understand I didn't know it was a
comment before the show came along
because I'm not as up on comics and most
people but and i'm not anti marvel at
all i love more movies and comics and
characters but i'm a DC guy and because
they're a little darker and a little
more brooding and this does not feel
like a marble property to me and I'm
sure there are other examples don't give
me yeah Daredevils / you know good but
this feels like I mean it feels like a
like a dark kind of film noir detective
noir which is my favorite style of film
you know set in the modern age with like
I said with a lot of you know modern
elements you know about like this woman
who's coming back from this very
horrific incident and I kind of just I
like that style of I like those kinds of
stories and and and it every time I look
at the title screen I'm like there's a
Marvel logo there that doesn't feel like
it belongs there sure it's just no I
mean you're right it was it is really
dark and another comment that rich put
in his review which I actually do agree
with is that he said he wished that it
was more about her using her powers to
solve other people's like cases brought
to her and there wasn't really a lot of
people bringing cases to her it wasn't
like a proper detective show where each
episodes a case you know it wasn't kind
of like that it was an overall story arc
and it's a lot of her just dealing with
who she is internally and not
necessarily about I mean you get a
little taste of the people that hire her
at the beginning and that doesn't work
out so great I mean I feel like most
different cases are her spying on
cheating spouses I mean that's basically
her bread butters is spying spouse and
you want to disappoint yeah more of her
powers but month and that is a
deliberately frustrating thing in the
comics I think yeah they choose not to
tell you what her powers are for a while
they choose to only show them bits and
pieces cuz that's not the point it's a
story of a person yeah which is kind of
interesting it's hard to read but it's
interesting yeah and the whole point
here which i think is oh I'm sorry go
ahead no no I think they say the whole
point too is that when you have
superpowers how much must must it suck
when you basically get overwhelmed by a
villain who can get into your head and
make you do things and so you don't even
get to use the superpowers for what you
wanted
you you have to do it for some villain
douchebag who's like taking over your
brain and sucks and that's to me that's
like the worst thing ever is to have
superpowers that suddenly you are not in
control of somebody else is like a
puppet master and that's horrible so I
don't know I felt for during the show
I'm just glad she drank and there's some
serious sex scenes so people that were
commenting on my preview going hey I
really want to watch this with my 12
year old son I'm like well oh just watch
it in separate right it was like if you
want you can but I this is a great
opportunity for the sex talk this is
what could really I wish you were my mom
when I was growing up you can watch
showgirls honey you just have to watch
it and sir well my mom my mom was a
hippie so it's like I you know okay we
we learned about sex a way too young so
we just worked yeah but I mean this had
to learn it on the street there are some
realness there are real sex scenes in
this I mean not just I mean real sex
seems like there were some kamasutra
moments so I was just like this is this
is I'm learning good morning this is
good how many episodes are there on
netflix right now I get started 13 yeah
and you can do it all in one sitting I
did it it's just uh maybe don't though
maybe don't I just fixed I don't want to
help my boy on the show you have to kind
of watch it slowly yeah but I wish this
is it to me this is an anti binge-watch
show like if you watch it all at once oh
I had a chick is anyone spoiled for me
online well we had I mean you know as
professionals people like how dare you
call me that's her professional
professional yeah a professional ascribe
a bard is this is the anti but this is
one you want to watch slow this is like
one you don't want to you don't want to
want it you know what chubby there we
there we park on yonder you've never
seen me drink wine either uh yeah so
here's the thing i binge-watched fine
wine I will I will binge watch it it's
like boxed wine for me right Solomon
and then I'll go back co shows I I'll
watch all of it at once like a like a
cheap target box wine and then and
that's a plug in case they want to send
me any and then I'll go I'll skip a week
and then I'll come back another week and
slowly watch it and devour it like a
fine French wine and I'll slowly watch
it so I have to speak through it and
then i'll rewatch it cuz that's what i
do with daredevil all amend my metaphor
this is like a 30-fold scotch whiskey
that you have to work slowly to truly
appreciate ok I can I can I can
understand that so here's here's one
last thing I want to say about jessica
jones and we can move on because i have
to get everyone's opinion on this after
they watch it if you haven't watched all
of it i told you don't need to have
watched all of it necessarily but you
saw in the trailer when when kilgrave
came into that house and put the kids in
the closet and the whole comment was he
said that kids should be seen and not
heard and he's like bitter yet I don't
want to see the kids and he puts he
tells them to go in a closet that's the
first episode second episode that's the
second doesn't say what happens to those
kids it never gets revisited as I said
this all like are they harry pottering
and they're like big they're gonna get
like a Gryffindor letter like what do
they think is gonna happen he's very
shaky flicks but we never find out cuz
there's other people he tells to do
things that you see what happens to them
but you never find out what how they do
mention that that his power only lasts
for a certain that's changed yeah it
wears office in the comics it wears on
okay I'm not physically close to him all
right I'm just gonna assume the kids are
alive but I really like the idea of them
still in the closet was that an anti
spoiler I don't know anyways your
mission I feel like that's a spoiler cuz
I don't yeah about the kids well what
happens to them after be where we don't
know we can't tell you about something
right now so we don't know we don't know
what happens vacuole a shin right
accusation is totally different
revealing anything but the revealing is
that there's nothing review those kids
are still in the closet there's gonna be
another Marvel show just about those
kids stuck in the closet Clara what's
new job to go look for the kids anytime
move on to another show that I think is
also kind of an anti binge-watching show
unless you are you know really have a
lot of Mountain Dew my family used to
watch this for hours at a time so you're
wrong Eric it's time in watching show
time and the cording is for Thanksgiving
they're doing a marathon what kid am I
just want to hug him know I love Joel
can I just start I touched him once okay
oh yeah I met him I know I run up to him
and he's not a hugger I don't like it
when people touch it but I ran up to him
once and it was at a ILM presentation
when he's doing cinematic titanic it
wasn't their version cuz it went into
different parts that was rifftrax and
then cinnamon Titanic but this is
actually Mystery Science Theater they're
bringing it he got the rights to the
name he got the ridge the name they're
bringing it back it's two different
there there's a new cast though so the
original cast is going to be involved
creatively which means behind the scenes
like writing stuff and there's going to
be cameos however the main thing is that
the new host is going to be Jonah ray
from Nerdist he does a bunch of stuff
with Chris Hardwick and he's done
stand-up and stuff and then the story
that I just wrote then went live today
is that Felicia Day is gonna be the new
mad scientist and she's dogs she's gonna
be dr. foresters daughter how cool is
that oh my god thats laser blast I love
laser turret was it would she be the
granddaughter cuz wasn't Mary sealing no
she's married she's married mary jo
peels granddaughter so it's her
character cuz she was the mom oh so it's
okay i got so weird cuz mary jo peel
played a bunch of different character so
right i don't know it's confusing but
just just know that Felicia's in it and
Jenna raised in it and they have two new
voices for um crow and turbo turbo Tom
servo shut up shut up Tom servo and crow
I have two different comedians that
Jonah ray hand-picked because they're
friends of hits
so it's a brand new cast so that's the
thing you gotta know but they will have
cameos and the Kickstarter is at 2.6
million out of a two-million-dollar
that's their first goal so there are two
million dollar goals for three episodes
and then it gets cheaper after that so
3.3 million I think they get even more
episodes there's a fire hydrant there's
a graphic if you go down yeah somewhere
5.5 million and you get a full season of
12 yeah so the thing is it's and they
explained it in my first article when I
announced the show on scene at I
explained that breakdown of what that
means and why it's cheaper to do more it
costs and that initial 2 million because
of all the upstart fees right of all
those stuff you do at the very beginning
and then like pay for the puppets and
stuff like that and then after that it's
you mean puppets they're not real
they're not real but the girl robot is
do not destroy my fantasy here's the
cool thing know some of these
Kickstarter perks are that oh well
what's going on there hey hey that was
that was just close to close Oh what are
you showing this is see Matt what are
you doing in the oil ah oh my god I
can't concentrate okay thank you um I
totally lost what your oh oh my god
why'd you do that to me perks perks
perks going on ripstop the perks are you
can get a VIP set tour you can show up
on the show you can have your joke like
you can have one of their riffs one of
your mocking of movie quotes on the show
you can even get one of the puppets if
you like give him a lot of money I think
I was like ten thousand dollars you get
to take crow home with you or something
so Jeff did someone take a riff of yours
once or am I making that up oh yeah for
the rifftrax they had a contest and it
was for the live riff of reefer madness
nah they had a contest where they know
in a bunch of scenes they wanted you to
do jokes for it and they picked one of
mine dude that's awesome so I got to see
people laughing at a joke that I wrote
in a movie theater Wow from rifftrax
which is half of the Mystery Science
Theater gas
yeah this is gonna blow your mind what
year was that um you remember I had a
two yeah I actually won it didn't it
wasn't in the movie but I actually want
tickets to that show for a riff contest
they did on their blog where it was like
you had to they put up it was a funniest
idea they put up a family circus and you
had to take a riff from one of the
rifftrax and put it in nice and I don't
remember what it was but I want a ticket
to that reefer madness show oh sweet
thats that's creepy the irony is I
didn't actually get to see my name at
the the credits at the LOB because the
theater that I went to see it at they
screwed up the feed oh and so like that
it was like they showed the very end of
the movie and then there was like oh
yeah we're running late clip Oh guys
just like the Oscars yeah I know I got
played off Oh so anyway you can read
about it on cnet about what's happening
you can still contribute I think they
have 17 days left for the Kickstarter so
you can you know you know raid your
savings so you can buy a puppet or
something but it's cool because the once
they make these episodes they're going
to see if a TV if they could distribute
it on TV but it's going to be online
regardless I mean it's going to be able
to be viewed but Joel does want to see
if they can try to get back on cable so
we'll see what happens with i'm hoping
sigh fire maybe netflix i'll pick it up
I mean that would be pretty rad so i
made for netflix and then also just keep
in mind leagues because they do this
every year every Thanksgiving because
the show debuted in 1988 on thanksgiving
day they do a thanksgiving day movie
marathon of mystery science theater and
i wrote in the Felicia Day article that
went up today towards the bottom of the
article tells you where you can go to
watch all six episodes that they're
doing their new up movie episodes not
brand brand new but I think they're just
ones i haven't I don't know if they've
been released on DVD or not or if
they've been different ones that have
been selected on DVDs oh no here's the
thing if you're collecting all the
mystery science theater DVD collections
from shoutfactory there's a lot of them
yeah yeah there's a lot like I lost
track after I don't even I have most of
them and I still think I'm behind it's
like trying to own all the Simpson
boxsets like you just even worse it's
even worse with you starting with the
Rhino yeah that's where I started yeah
you just are so many so anyway they they
have that video on youtube mix planes
where you can watch them all and stuff
but you should check it out and it
should be something that you watch with
your family every Thanksgiving out like
we did kelsey did you meet you too when
you're on thanksgiving particularly just
all the time i used to do it a lot yeah
and mystery science theater has an
official youtube channel too so you can
watch other movies that they've got up
there for free and that's kind of a cool
youtube channel so that's my schtick but
yeah I had to do full disclosure I'm
friends with Felicia but here's the
thing i didn't know she was gonna be on
the show and I just talked to her like
last week she didn't mention anything so
she's really good at keeping secrets and
they have like a mad scientist they have
one more person that they haven't
announced yet on the show who's supposed
to be her henchmen so they haven't even
announced who that person is it's not
Wil Wheaton cuz I already asked him one
time and also he's made perfectly clear
in his facebook it's not him so I don't
know who it's gonna be I hope the
henchman isn't I want it to be Nathan
Fillion but you might be busy so I don't
know maybe listen in your cut list in
the comments of the article why do you
think should be I think it's gonna be
ray Fiennes I was gonna nominate Jeff
it's not me that's not jealous sweet I
would give my left well I would give
parts of my body for that to happen yeah
it's not Chad and that's not what we may
be John Hurt I don't know maybe market
um maybe mark its Lorne Greene I hope
you know I think it could I just this
just hit me and I thought this a bit
actually be a cool pic yeah Jon Hamm
yeah yeah he was good I that's a good
segue in the Star Wars because he did
though SNL skit that I am so hot this
weekend oh yeah Jon Hamm solo trying to
audition for the Han Solo roll it was an
article I wrote about star wars force
awakens auditions that SNL did a skip
for which they do for every Star Wars
movie as we all remember Kevin Spacey
playing Christopher Walken trying out
for Han Solo's probably the most
well-known SNL skit that happened a
while back
is was all the cast were different
celebrities in this and then actual
celebrities were also in this so you had
Michael Buble singing uh making rookie
to the song baby whoopee and then you
had Emma Stone just trying out for Ray
the character ray and then you had John
Hamm dressed as Han Solo and he said
just call me ham solo and it was amazing
I'm Leslie Jones showed up with the the
Klingon yeah they did you a star trek
joke at the enemy can't come on but it
was very sweet and but there was some
that were kind of a little um at home
like when jock both Daisy and genre
there's Daisy with oh yes I'm trying to
be so Fiat yeah Sophia fair i got from
Modern Family screen test Javier Bardem
I have a suggestion sir is a lightsaber
me on but maybe he's coming from here
you should fast forward it to the jon
hamm he's at the very end if you want to
the only joke didn't think was very
funny cuz I hit him a little bit with
John boyega who's plays um and Finn he
said he laughs when he reads oh you want
a black storm trooper and laughs at it
like it's a joke and I'm like I know
he's riffing on fans oh there's Jon Hamm
so if you guys want to start you have
the first line it's what's up ham solo
and I'm like how's it going guys so I
feel so conflicted about all this
because you know every crave cast comes
up every month and there's been more and
more Star Wars hype and it's like we
have to acknowledge it a bit because
half
what this at this point we have actually
hyped the Star Wars hype you know what I
mean like the conversation about how
there is too much hype like we're hyping
that I don't think we've done a full on
Star Wars like force fatigue article
which I'm tempted to write because I
mean I used to work for Lucasfilm and I
never felt this tired writing about Star
Wars and I worked there for 10 years and
this is the first time I'm like every
other article I'm writing for cnet feels
like a Star Wars article one because
they do really well on cnet because
everybody wants to talk about Star Wars
2 there's some great stuff out there and
all of us freelancers are writing about
seeing that not just me I mean I mean
Star Wars not to me but the problem now
is that I'm finding I just I I'm just
getting a little tired of all the teaser
trailers and trailers and I'm not trying
to be spoiler free but it's like guys
leave us some stuff like the loop
machine I mean it's very much okay
here's a perfect example I wrote a story
about the first word that's gonna be
spoken on Star Wars because Jimmy Kimmel
last night had a whole episode eddicated
to star wars force awakens with the
whole cast there except for mark I don't
think mark was there uh but Harrison was
she was he or was he um and so Jimmy
asked JJ Abrams what's the first word
that's spoken and he said if you don't
want to know what shut your ears but
it's this that means this this this is
the word okay great can I just jump in
if you're getting mad that you did that
if you're not i mean you specific Thank
You star wars fan was not mad that we've
spoiled the first word uttered on screen
in the film you need help so here's my
mate that's that's too much there it is
I'm trying again policy that was a
teacher right there all the fans uh no
better hardcore Star Wars fans know the
first word to every Star Wars movie
that's spoken and the first bird and the
scroll on the opening crawl right and I
included my article all the first words
that are spoken in all the Star Wars
films just in case someone thinks
there's a pattern or clue or I mean if
you rearrange the words
yes it does spell Sith it also spells
something I also spells a curse word
okay or hits yes yeah it's right that's
a nice uh one stormtrooper can't it's
the broad side of a barn but anyway so i
don't know i i'm excited to December
just so we can stop talking about it
well yeah in the interest of time I'm
gonna move us a little bit beyond the
first word let's get into the let's get
into the meat and you guys have written
some really interesting pieces that are
actually unique and different from what
everyone else is is writing in
particular let's let's start with Danny
then we'll come back to you Bonnie but
Danny you wrote an interesting take on
you know the missing Luke Skywalker in
all the the clips we've seen so far what
was that about because yeah cuz I
watched the trailer I actually watch the
football game where the traitor and yeah
and and everyone you know ever the only
thing everyone seemed to be talking
about was it there's no Luke where's
Luke and so I thought okay I'll just
make fun of this a little bit and kind
of started reading up on what the
theories were uh you know the bigger
ones like you know he's joined the dark
side or that I think he died and now
he's a forest ghost I don't know what
the term is for when he when Jedi die
and become a ghost um yeah that works
yeah so but it's just like it it it hit
me like just how impatient i think some
people are to just know we're like like
there's kind of this what bothers me
about the hype is that like some people
don't understand that part of the fun of
seeing movies is that you kind of let
the mystery build and then when it's
revealed it hits you in the face like
the cinder block and so that's what what
was kind of how I approached the
theories I came up with and my favorite
was that that Luke was in the trailer
yeah puppet but now he has a Jedi
invisibility powers see I think we just
saw check technically he's yeah
technically he's in every scene he's
invisible I think we just saw him
because i don't i don't think r2d2 let
people touch him like that not there
anyway the guy in the black glove yeah
yeah they want they want you to UM the
prevailing theory was that he's the
hooded guy with er QD yeah um but but
even that it's what like is he Demark is
he dead is he yeah who cares you it you
know it's a glorious beard full of
secrets it's Abrams phenotype you know
it's probably a written coffee yeah yeah
I turn on this movie that's another
theory oh yeah and what you know yeah
what makes ray cry so hard who dies
first I'm so low I think yeah that's
what this is what fans are for this is
what we do we debate things to death we
try to figure out what's going on and
who's gonna die and he's gonna survive
and where people got dark and I mean I
get that but I still like the internet
kind of ruined something like when I was
writing this piece I went back and kind
of looked over some a JJ Abrams other
movies and I watched his TED talk on the
mystery box which is one of eight ted
talks sir oh my god will you eat that
box have you watched his shows it's a
terrible way to write a story oh I don't
have to actually have a story here I
just have to get people excited and then
wander off and think about something
else if I terrible he runs everything
don't get me started on Star Trek you
ruined it anyway back to you yeah I
don't know what Star Trek was purgatory
right oh I like to generate what but no
though it was like you don't have to
know everything but sometimes the fact
that it's a mystery makes it makes it
better yeah not knowing what's in the
box makes it more and makes it more fun
but there has to be sitting in the box
ultimately I understand that yeah I mean
there's a deal it's called the for us
okay it's a force the forces in the box
you just absolutely like mystery science
some features some gonna box when you
when you go see are you not looking for
mrs. sharp whores now I didn't know you
had this hit much hate for JJ room oh I
really do I hate him wow I didn't know
that either yeah no I think it's very
talented because you're that's what's
frustrating about it he gets you excited
he gets you interested in he's got
nothing he can't deliver interesting I
agree a hundred percent
that's the electricity's me and looking
good this is yes is that the beard of a
crazy man I don't think what could
beforehand it out eric is Luke obi-wan
americana five nights a week and so
Bonnie what and what about your take
Leia and Carrie Fisher yeah so I wrote
an article for cnet about how I was
really excited that they let Carrie
Fisher be Carrie Fisher like they let
Princess Leia who's now general layout
which is sorry spoiler but if you're
watching this you're already got
everything really didn't she stop being
a princess about halfway through the
first movie technically I mean
technically yeah because when you blow
up the planet that you grew a princess
of an asteroid field princess of nothing
after that but I mean I think they kept
it because hon yeah kept calling her
princess to get under her skin and she
was leading troops even back then yeah I
mean she was leading troops back then
and you can see even in that background
with the blue and the green that's the
same blue and green we see her when
she's uh given general orders when she's
in her cool Empire Strikes Back outfit
and I'm not talking about the bikini I'm
talking about it at the very beginning
oh yeah that was returned yet anyway my
point was they let her age gracefully
and they didn't CGI up her face and they
didn't make her get a bunch of plastic
surgery so that's what she looked like
when she was in the original trilogy and
then Steven work your magic show her now
Jordao uh I know we'd do it now cuz i'm
talking about her it's a demanding i'm
like a general there we go so they like
you know i'm sure those touched up a
little bit just because you can't have
any photo ever be released for anything
without slightly touching up but she
still looks amazing and she's aight
aight we did some more pictures of her
that have come out for this new movie
and she looks amazing and so I'm super
stoked that they let her age gracefully
but let her be her they let her still be
someone of power she's a general she's
not there to just be you know Han Solo's
love interest she's actually still very
powerful
very interesting character and and I
also brought up some stuff about in
Hollywood there was a bunch of actresses
that have come out of the ageist closet
recently that has said that Hollywood
needs to knock off their ageist problem
and one point in particular was I
believe Anne Hathaway and Maggie
Gyllenhaal who were both in their 30s
were told they were too old to play a
love interest for men in their 50s wow
wow yeah and Meryl Streep's said stuff
about ageism and she's played some
amazing we're all to me Meryl Streep's
freaking Meryl Streep and she doesn't
you know what I mean like she has
academy awards to prove that it doesn't
matter how old you are it just matters
how great an actor you are and how great
material is that you have so i mean i
don't know i love Carrie Fisher in
general I think she's amazing she's
hilarious she's great on social media if
you haven't followed her Twitter he
should cuz she's hilarious um but I'm
just really glad that she was allowed to
be herself in this movie so that's what
that commentary is that's me being a big
old girl talking about old broads like
me can I say this yes if people's
sexiest man alive had a lifetime
achievement category Harrison Ford yeah
yeah that's right I don't know if I was
off topic I love Harrison Ford too cuz
he's so persnickety like when he was on
Jimmy Kimmel last night both he and
Carrie Fisher were just so like in their
element and even on the American Music
Awards this weekend when they did that
horrible I shouldn't say horrible here's
the thing American music if they're
gonna have John Williams on I understand
but says an acapella group dressed in
bad star wars costumes singing and by
saying I mean doing they like that kind
of thing did you did you do like all of
us know the theme song to star wars
we've all sung it and very in various
ways that make us giggle because we're
being goofballs these people do it
professionally so they were on the stage
after Harrison Ford with almost a
straight face said here's the
award-winning app acapella group doing
the Star Wars theme and everyone's like
did you do did you do did you do and
it's just come on I mean I'm sorry I
mean
the one harrison ford introduced right
yeah okay cuz they're actually they're
actually from my area sorry I remember
one you're gonna get assassinated sorry
yeah get my get my ass kicked why not oh
no no at least you'll have a great
soundtrack get a sound check the sound
effects that will be amazed I don't know
if you get beat up by an acapella group
do they make the sound effects too while
they're feeding you up don't they'll do
kung kung fu fighting push I just want
to write a sketch now where I'm
describing it to a police officer haha
what were they looking you down at
harmony the baritone was a little slow
the soprano really has a great left hook
yeah I feel like if you get beat up by a
acapella group you gotta rethink your
life a little bit hey Stephen down with
bass Jeff just sent around his rifftrax
cuz nothing but treble so it's so we're
at the end of the show here and I just
before we go I want to want to say hi
Joe in the alive yeah and the live
stream chat room just want to say hey to
i believe the name is a see leo Mendez
who was one of the folks that's been a
really active participant in our
crowdsource I find out what I meant at
the beginning cnet com / crowd so if I
again if you want to check it out you
know it's been really interesting
there's been more than what I mean
actually a handful of people who are not
native English speakers who I mean you
wouldn't tell it from conversing with
him on facebook and in the google doc
but they've been going through an ED and
editing and making suggestions and then
you know they tell me later that they're
not comfortable writing in English
although again I would never have
guessed that these weren't native
English speakers from just emailing and
chatting with them so we have you know
we have people writing then we have
people who might not even be English
speakers going through and doing some
edits and making suggestions in a Celia
with joined us in the live stream
chairman's just want to say hate it to
him and also just to remind everyone to
go check that out at cnet com / crowd
sci-fi we still got about a week left to
finish writing 50,000 words we're at
like you know it was growing as I
was as i was logging on to the show but
we were out 35 thousand words already
you know approaching a hundred page
crowdsource novel that you know deals
with the multiverse and nanobots that
let people live forever in the future
it's really all of the place so Eric
what's gonna happen when this gets
optioned if so how many people are gonna
be getting IMDB credits for producers
where everybody gets like like 200
people get thirty percent yeah I know
it's all it's all creative commons so oh
cool anyone anyone can take it and do
what they want with it actually so it is
kind of to it to avoid future legal
problems we just made it uh you know
open to everyone all you have to do is
attributed so there will probably be
somewhere there will be a page with all
the full credits I've been keeping track
of all the people who aren't anonymous
who want credit and there's there's
dozens and dozens of names mostly people
editing it which really surprised me um
you know in addition you know not just
people from from other countries but I
know there's I know there's like some
people from MIT who log on pretty
regularly and are just going through
kind of with a fine-tooth comb and
editing stuff well I was wondering Eric
I mean you're trying to tell a coherent
story right with so many people
contributing how how are you doing that
isn't like herding cats like how do you
do um so like on day three I realized
that there was going to have to be some
sort of a structure so I mean the
premise the storyline is actually an
idea that I've had kicking around in my
head for a while just in like one
sentence really quick the idea is that
there is a multiple or a an alternate
earth somewhere in another universe that
if you go there it's kind of a more
technologically advanced earth that
might resemble what we would think of as
heaven or utopia and and through some
kind of quirk of quantum physics when
people die on earth they do go to this
place so a lot of people think it's
heaven however on earth around twenty
fifty people start the technology
advances to the point where we're living
a lot longer
almost to the point of being immortal
and with fewer people going to this
other parallel planet where they're kind
of used as a labor force it's nice to
release through with their economy so
they have to send a person an emissary
to 2050 earth to convince people to
start dying again so heaven needs us to
die heaven needs us to digest basically
that's we've got the three different
options a human capital human something
else uh-uh that that's one thing that is
being edited um I haven't needs us to
die yeah or maybe die already right yeah
there we go it's a grenade and to answer
your question Kelsey like so that
concept at first I just had like two
paragraphs what I just told you was just
sitting there at the top of the dock and
then it wasn't enough so around day
three I did go through and I outlined
each chapter so there's I basically
wrote a paragraph summary of what 21
chapters and for the last three weeks
people have been going in and fleshing
out fleshing out those one paragraph
chapters and it's been really amazing
there's been only like one case of
vandalism um and there's been a lot of
really interesting conversations about
you know really you know deep topics
that I mean like I said well it crosses
language barriers and it's been really
really fascinating to watch and I
definitely and any anyone can still
participate there's still time done is
it easy to read through is it kind of
like an exquisite corpse where you don't
really things don't really match up but
it's still entertaining I mean that just
seems this whole concept of so many
authors and one story is very like do
you have to go read and get rid of stuff
and say this just doesn't work I get rid
of all so I determine that so like right
yeah these are like Hunger Games is it
like if I contribute and you don't like
it then all of a sudden I have to see my
name kind of float up as you take out my
part not quite that dramatic but I mean
yeah if you were to go through and read
I think what we have on November 30th I
mean it's it's not completely coherent
and early like I can go in and just add
in like a lonely unicorn right like
okay that'll be me I think you really
have the power to what I when I we also
realized the limits of Google Docs
pretty quick yeah like originally I was
just leaving everything in there like
all the edits you can see like where
stuff was crossed out new stuff was
replaced and then it broke Google Docs
so a couple times don't have to go in
and just excited so I accept all the
minor stuff as much as I can and then I
do it and I can go back and have all the
drafts the revision so I can go back and
add anything if if I need to that's only
been requested once but so yeah it I
kinda kind of go in and clean it up
every now and then otherwise it'll just
break but you know the whole national
novel writing month thing which I think
you're also doing Bonnie I am that's why
I'm not sleeping well alright me but
that you know the goal is not to have a
finished final draft on November 30th
it's to have like a rough draft and
that's what we'll have and then will
rework it's mostly about writing is just
teaching you as a writer to just have a
certain amount and this is what a lot of
novelists do too just so they can get
through something and get done is that
your first draft is always going to be
crap and then it's like your second
third and fourth drafts or where you
actually make something real um but yeah
it's basically just a torture test to
see how much you can write in one day
and I do the thing where I like let a
couple days laps and then all of a
sudden them up 24 hours writing things
that don't make sense so uh and then I
put foot notes on everything like David
Foster Wallace type Wallace Foster see I
don't even know what I'm saying I'm so
tired and I even put like a Jessica
Jones Oh Maj into my story it doesn't
even fit I don't know why I put that in
there there was like a Sherlock
reference it's just I put references in
of whatever i'm watching there's a
Scandinavian like murder detective guy
in there so because i'm watching river
now on netflix so it's just I I pity
anyone that tries to read whatever I
write this month but I admire what
you're doing Eric because it's such a
cool idea to get a whole bunch of people
involved and have it be like a cnet
collective of your readers and our
readers and people excited about this
stuff so I can't wait to read it yeah I
can't wait to mold it into something
that's
coherent enough for us to publish which
we will you know next year and I know
and again just big thanks to to everyone
I mean there's a few people a guy named
his screen name is Ryan ye I think he's
I think he's somewhere in Asia I'm not
sure who's just been tearing it up on
there there's another guy Scott Stevens
from st. Louis that's contributed a lot
and then people like a celio who are
just editing the heck out of it so go
check it out and it's also cool to just
like sit back and watch it like in real
time kind of evolved in the dock so yeah
netcom / crowd sci-fi so check that out
and we're way over time now so thank you
everyone for watching the crave cast and
happy thanksgiving if you're in the US
and happy figuring out what Thanksgiving
is if you're not for Steven Beecham
Kelsey Adams Bonnie Burton Jeff Sparkman
and Danny Gallagher in Texas that's the
creative cast we'll see you next time
