welcome to tomorrow daily the besties
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley sailor and i'm jeff cannata you
need some science and tech headlines we
got Jeff we do gather your drone forces
everybody because one University is
gonna teach you how to control an army
of drones with your might we've talked
about Arizona State University's brain
powerd drone work but now they have
taken it to the next level this system
uses an EEG cap that picks up which
parts of the brain activate during
certain thoughts and then translates
those into commands for robots before
they were using just one drone for
control but now the system can control
up to four drones at once which would
allow for pilots to fly up to 16 drones
all at the same time using only their
mind ASU hopes to keep working on their
research and also aims to have multiple
people controlling multiple robots
simultaneously so we'll keep an eye on
it and hopefully we'll have more to show
you soon actually there's only one
application for this technology and then
it's drone armies advanced drone swarm
that is the only one other reason before
people need to control 16 drones for
ashley i think you mean 16,000 row Oh
what are we doing this seems awesome uh
you know what else I can think of one
other use beautiful drone choreography
in the sky would use your brain of death
anyway at least somebody is getting my
letters because now there's a cowboy
robot swag bot is part of a farm robot
trial headed up by the University of
Sydney and he's officially out in the
pastures the robot has a variety of jobs
including herding cattle and the idea
here is to use robots in places where
traditional humans on horseback would be
too dangerous or remote swag bot is only
a helping herd cattle and sheep right
now but soon the team in Sydney will
install motion temperature color and
shape sensors to allow swag lot to
identify if any of its herd is sick or
injured then it can alert farmers and
ranchers of the health of their annum
was offering a high-tech solution to an
age-old profession he's no like he's the
sheep dog but he's enrollment get along
little robot so what we're gonna end up
having is robot cowboys vs drone army
for the fate of humanity and I put my
money on robot cowboy you know what they
can eat the can once you're done eating
the can of beans by the campfire they
can eat the can it's really what's up
I'm having my cameraman and then you
just said you can have a robot stunt
it's great I wonder if it can sing songs
around the campfire that would be really
nice I would like to feel this thing
seeing me some songs uh which one you I
think we got to talk about I mean
they're both really good sexual ones
what you want to I mean I think you're
really excited about swag bot I love him

on Arthur docs robots are unorthodox
cowboys cowboy cowboy cal BOTS Kalibak
