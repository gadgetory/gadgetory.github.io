Google's parent company alphabet
announced its Innovation Lab X would
attempt to bring Internet service to the
people of Puerto Rico via Project loon
it's an experimental program that uses
what looks like weather balloons to
provide connectivity to rural locations
and areas struck by disaster FCC chief
of staff Matthew berry announced on
Twitter the department had fast-tracked
a license for X to use loon balloons in
Puerto Rico eight carriers approved the
X teams use of spectrum rights with the
approval which should last up to six
months as Puerto Rico recovers from the
massive destruction from hurricanes
Irma and Maria according to
flightradar24 comm there's already at
least one loon balloon floating above
the island but there are still some
major hurdles to cover before the people
of Puerto Rico will see significant
connectivity loon was used previously in
Peru after an earthquake rocked the
country but it was able to mobilize
quickly because it had already been
testing in the area with a local telecom
carrier in this situation the loon team
will be essentially starting from
scratch so while there isn't a specific
start date the FCC license approval and
carrier spectrum agreement are two big
steps forward we'll be keeping an eye on
project loons progress in Puerto Rico
stay tuned to see net calm for more I'm
