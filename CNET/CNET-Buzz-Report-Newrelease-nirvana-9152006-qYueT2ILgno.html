buzz report and now for the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week Oh
seriously
Who am I kidding have you even been
paying attention this week this week is
the gadget of the week so let's get it
started
okay first Apple now you know I've been
bagging on Apple a little bit lately and
they've held some press events and
keynotes that have been a little bit of
a letdown
so I think the press was trying to keep
their expectations low for this week's
big press event in San Francisco in fact
the only rumors we even heard were you
know movie downloads from the iTunes
Store a new video iPod and maybe like a
wireless set-top box for streaming video
from your master TV show right and then
the big day comes and what do we get
take a look so the new iPod comes in two
models a 30 gigabyte and a new 80
gigabyte model it's really sweet today
we're gonna introduce a second
generation Nano and today we're
announcing the second generation of the
iPod shuffle this is the missing piece
well here it is internally we call it I
TV and today we are making available
over seventy-five films online well he
wasn't wearing a black turtleneck mm-hm
anyway let's take a closer look at those
Apple products first there's a new iPod
lineup there's a tiny little
square-shaped shuffle that clips on your
clothes
then there's the new video iPod which
isn't really that new and isn't really
any more video friendly other than a
brighter screen but you can get 80
gigabytes for 350 bucks so I'm not
really gonna quibble with that and
there's also a new aluminum iPod nano
line featuring a 2 gigabyte model in
silver a 4 gigabyte model that comes in
a variety of colors like pink and blue
and green and an 8 gig model that only
comes in black because apparently girls
don't need eight gigs thanks Steve
thanks a lot this is it right here
and finally the big announcement of the
day ITV Apple unveiled their plans to
release a wireless set-top box early
next year that will let you stream
movies video and music from your
computer to your television for it's
sort of like a media center PC without
the PC part the hard drive the DV
capabilities or the TV tuner but the
interface in other product release news
Tebow has released its long-awaited
series three TiVo which record
high-definition content on two separate
tuners whoo-hoo finally the new high-def
TiVo can also stream photos and music on
your home network just like guy TV and
has built-in Ethernet finally man are we
excited the new TiVo cost seven hundred
ninety nine dollars plus your cable fee
plus a monthly fee of about fifteen
dollars does not work with pay-per-view
or video on demand and doesn't include
TiVo to go wait what
it's pause that the new TiVo cost seven
hundred ninety nine dollars plus your
cable fee plus a monthly fee of about
fifteen dollars does not work with
pay-per-view our video on demand and
doesn't include TiVo to go out man are
we excited and finally a consumer alert
for you segway owners out there the
company that built the self balancing
scooter has launched a recall apparently
there's a problem with the segway
software that can cause the scooter to
suddenly change direction and throw a
rider off and in addition when the
batteries run low the Segway might
simply fall over and toss you to the
ground not safe the Segway recall
evidently affects every single Segway
ever made now Steve Wozniak says he'll
get them all back to the company right
after this weekend's polo match I'm
Molly wood and this has been the buzz
report thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
