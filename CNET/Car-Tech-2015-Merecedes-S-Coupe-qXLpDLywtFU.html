nothing quite says I could buy you cash
but why would I bother more than driving
an s-class unless it's this the new
s-class coupe back i'm happy to say from
a hiatus when it was replaced by the CL
that didn't have very good sales the
last couple years and never had as much
prestige as the letter s it's a very
different style check out the back end
in particular and the car I must say
actually looks more compact in person by
far than the sedan motive power will
come in one flavor for the u.s. a 4.7
liter by turbo in 550 configuration now
let's take a look inside check out what
is a very pronounced dual LCD cabin this
is gone from gauges now overhead magic
sky control in the sunroof lets you
darken or lighten that glass panel like
a pair of those 1970s sunglasses except
now it actually works really well we've
seen it on the SL and it's cool and this
is a vehicle that should be available
with that new apple carplay technology
which just seems to complement the
high-tech flavor of what's happening
inside this vehicle and at this price
point and well your right hand drops in
the console you've got a place for
fingertip input for the command system
now of course Audi got their first BMW
caught up everybody's in the pool now
from the premium German makers something
you can't see in this vehicle a
fascinating new version of adaptive
suspension that actually leans the car
in corners like a skateboard now as you
may recall Mercedes was big on these
active seats that kind of held you in
with bolsters in corners this kind of
adds a whole nother dramatic layer on
top of that these folks are really big
on cornering now like the CL the 560sec
back in the day this is not going to be
a huge seller but it's going to be a
huge looker and one that people remember
and talk about when it drives by it's a
low whistle kind of car that will help
add a nice cachet to the four-door
