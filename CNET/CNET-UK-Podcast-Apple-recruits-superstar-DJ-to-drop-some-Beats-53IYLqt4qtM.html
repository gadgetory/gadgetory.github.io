seen at UK podcast this episode 4 to 24
Friday the twentieth of februari 2015
Apple has recruited a superstar DJ
Samsung is hinting at the s6 and
scientists have proposed a ten-dollar
chip that would give you Terminator
vision I'm it shine diamond joining me
and I hi to London studio this week is
luke westaway i am sort of like the
terminator in many ways absolutely will
not stop that is so true collector new
pokemon and you always say you'll be
back yes yeah that's the disappointment
I'll be back don't know hurry hurry no
rush we are as always filming the
podcast so check that out on CNN com or
youtube com /c net so exciting but for
now let's start with the news
yes big news in the music world Apple
has hired as a no the well-known
probably one of the best known names in
British radio in fact yes I would say so
Kiwi born he's been at the BBC for a
decade before that he was you were
friend TV remember the on the MTV to
brown couch that's actually all i
remember him problem is that on the sofa
bands has come up also sit on the sofa
great format for an interview we should
have a sofa we should have a sofa in a
green screen so it looks like we're
flying through space people have said
that before actually about the whole
sitting down did we decide where we're
standing up last week I heard it was no
um there was a reason I sitting kills
you suggesting kills you that's what oh
yes this is he kills you that's Sophie's
a terrible former well anyway yes he
said he's left the BBC he's going off to
work for Apple he's best known as a DJ
but he's also he's very influential
music industry figure which is
presumably apples thinking in this he's
been a kind of music director for the
International Festival of ether rocks he
he's written and produced for tiny
temper Jason status and he also co-wrote
and produced a track on Sam Smith's
album which was grammy-nominated who's
over so Jane lowes over the Grammys yeah
last last week so presumably he's going
to be doing something related to beats
and iTunes so do we know anything about
what his actual job will be no not
really I mean so the statement apples
given is that they excited to have him
join the music team because he's one of
them are foremost music taste makers in
the world and a legendary music curator
right so there you go here he will
presumably have some hand in curating
music glad that's cleared up yes I'm
yeah curators probably the key word
there right now because if they're the
room to be making a music service music
services need curation because rock and
roll isn't all jumping around in a hotel
room and throwing a fringe out the
window it's curation curation curation
careful curation indexed curation
absolute and algorithms that's the
spirit of rocket so whatever readers
listeners and viewers saying well one
commenter on this story says this isn't
a real diversion to the man's career but
it makes sense it's nothing to do with
musical talent or insight he doesn't
have any Oh
and I kalyan ik r up says I'm sure this
is ivan's doing remember he is the man
whose along with dr. dre in charge of
beats that's probably his job at apple
advising cook to hide the top talent in
the music business I don't know what is
going on here but it looks big something
really special is coming in terms of a
new music service so yeah those that's
where all the clues are pointing
absolutely be what could it be what
could it be and so what it's that Apple
hasn't even said we're going to find out
so we've got no idea no ori or even if
there is anything mmm they might just be
collecting all the musicians starting
with Zane Lowe I mean a team it's a
night list has a lower number 100 out at
the bottom work your way up to the top
which is the sugar babes obviously yeah
that's what we're working up to yeah the
not the original ones generated yet get
the original atomic in that together if
you can Apple yeah I got chopped no I am
I don't think even apples budget
stretches that far that is true alright
what else is happening is that Samsung
has been hinting at some features for
the samsung galaxy s6 which as we are
all marking our calendars is coming out
on always certainly will be announced on
the first March and because what they've
done is they've done this blog post
about wireless charging of mobile phones
and other devices and they say that 2015
is going to be the year of motive
wireless charging which suggests that
the s6 has their big flagship phone will
presumably have some kind of wireless
charging an element to it so that's
that's convincing and the thing is about
wild charge and we talked about this
type very recently starbucks but there's
two competing standards than the PMA and
a4wp which uses powermat right and then
there's the key standard which is backed
by the world's power consortium and
that's used by asus HTC while way LG
motorola Nokia Samsung blackberry and
Sony is that all on the prayer is
pronounced cheese is pronounced chee did
I say it wrong i always do that well I
mean you maybe you said it wrong I
couldn't remember how it sooner so
anyway yes so that's the one that's got
most of the phones homecomings back in
them so presumably that's gonna be the
standard but for some reason the other
ones holding out but yes so there's
possibility the s6 might should be dual
standard well that would be cool if you
read between the lines yeah yeah well
wireless charging is it's really cool
but not many people are sort of taking
it up and so yeah multiple standards
would be
very neat because it's been a berry
hasn't it the multiple standard has been
a bit of a problem yeah definitely
starbucks got around that yeah we talked
about this a few weeks ago because
starbucks is putting in some of its
London coffee outlets like little
dongles you can plug into your phone
which makes them wireless charge when
you plunk em down on the on the table
wireless charging pad so that's how they
get around the standards problem yeah
sounds very elegantly got around the
problems of wireless charging by making
it not wireless well look well doing
their best crazy crazy world but I just
might get my way but we should see more
about of the s6 at Mobile World Congress
which starts at the end of next week
isn't it amazing that mwc is coming
around and it was at Mobile World
Congress rich than we discovered that
wireless charging sounds like a
double-barrelled surname oh god yeah
Charles wireless charging yeah what it
yeah we all lost something okay might
show little window into what it's like
absolutely well first I much as when the
Essex all come on we're gonna be able
awn CH so look out for photos videos
hands on first impressions all that all
the good stuff so so yeah and when I
know what the people are saying it's
gone that tells voice what people saying
okay well David Joe 723 says glad to see
some improvement in wireless charging
namely the inclusion of all the
standards in a single device this
commenter goes on to say I love taking
advantage of this with my current phone
and I can't remember the last time I
actually plugged it in to charge it's
not the most important feature on my
phone but it certainly is nice to have
no it is a good idea and it does give
you the potential to charge your phone
anywhere yeah means they have it yeah
its prequel meanwhile q an underscore
Lee says I've owned a samsung smartphone
laptop tablets and a few other things
nothing ever works as advertised and
will never buy another Samsung product
again hook reply stopped using the
laptop after two days it was so bad
similar to seven songs previous features
fingerprint sensor heart rate sensor I
tracking etc I'm sure that wireless
charging will also not work ouch ouch oh
it's not sounds like that so that that's
funny because the the the I trackage
remember when we heard about that before
the phone yeah
to everyone it well things yes miles de
la scroll whatever it but it was like
you can control this phone with your
eyes and then it came out and does
anyone use that I don't know I yeah well
the problem is like you can sort of
control it with your eyes it's kind of
work but like you really need your eyes
to look to it looking yeah important
that's the thing that's one of those
it's one of those features that you just
turn off immediately is it because I if
it doesn't work most of the time and
then it does it when you don't want it
to tell you I've got a game 1212 finally
says I am got game one two one two one
two oh I thought it's a different game
yeah janitor not one of the other at
least 1211 um says I'm all for wireless
charging and appreciate samsung users
beta testing the technology for apple
iphone users oh there it is seriously
though like the medium of comedy don't
want to happen to what ya important the
thought provoking pointless namely he's
holding a mirror up to our own
assumptions um yeah hate to be the one
saying it but yeah probably like for
wireless charging to really take off
it's probably got to being an iPhone
because that that's what's going to make
like big you know like everyone sort of
rushed to get it into their taxis and
buses and stuff yes not because the
iphones necessarily better but it is
just sort of it's the one that's got
that impact exactly yeah yeah absolutely
yeah and also it's better yeah so are
also happening this world profession is
so speaking of like new weird newfangled
features and stuff yeah an awkward segue
but I'm going to come to the right at
our throat yeah sony's google Tony's
version of google glass hey google glass
because we had to say google google
glass you yes Google anyone would think
we were drunk yeah we're working
categorically deny they don't we have
definitely not drunk no oh ignore the
fact that i'm drinking from a mug that
obscures what you can actually see
exactly nice i just drinking straight
gin straight so yeah this the sony smart
I glass developer edition SED e 1 cap
Sheamus I know I mean this is the thing
right so it's a I'll run through the
specs if we start laughing at it but I
give them though let's not wait I mean
if you're watching the video you can see
these on screen if you listen to the
audio version
track it down see what these things look
like because they're enormous yeah I
know they are enormous I mean my
goodness lights I would feel bad making
fun of how ugly they are because well so
this is the thing right so I'm not grief
absolutely they projected kind of heads
up display in front of you they can show
a notification all that kind of thing
they pair with your phone via bluetooth
they can only show the color green but
there yet it's there they're costing 520
pounds there for pre-order in the UK
right now so if you want one of these
god awful horrible things it's your
funeral you know you can get it so it's
120 pounds eight hundred forty dollars
in the US that's about half the price
that the original google glass was and
it is a developer edition so it's not
aimed at consumers specifically but they
look absolutely terrible they were huge
you know what's amazing like we saw
these you and I together actually in
Berlin at the ephah trade show yes in
intends on last year and you know we
were talking at the moon not sure about
this and and you know there were so many
people there like obviously surprise i
type you know it's not going to look
like this I don't know if it does look
like this it's yeah I mean even that big
dong glee dangly puck thing well this is
the other thing not only are they huge
they aren't wireless they attach to a
huge like it's like a hockey puck size
thing and you've got the battery and
that's got that you talked into that to
make phone calls it's it's very
frustrating because Google glass um you
know it wasn't the most sort of elegant
neatest looking thing ever but like it's
what like three years old now probably
since it since it first became a thing
people were actually wearing white
elegant on their faces yeah it's not too
bad and it's just like years later
here's what Sony hasn't Sony is is that
is historically famous for
miniaturization and design and stuff you
know like look at the look like the
Walkman and disc man and stuff like that
but they're really good at making well
they have been in the past really good
at making existing technology smaller
and really nice yeah so I know what's
going on here and also like what like
that they've they've sort of released
this into the world at exactly just
after google says we're stopped it says
this is a terrible idea so it is i
rolling back euro oh boy I hope Sony
didn't divert too much effort from other
projects
so what a read isn't listening saying
about they say fans well they're
actually a lot more charitable than we
are okay oh no wait Derek or says I
predict a huge flop poor Sony ouch so
wobble says maybe the first product in
history to make apple and PC users join
hands and yell in unison that they'd all
found the worst thing created this
decade to be fair she should be
interject that this is aimed I think
largely at businesses so it's a sort yes
yes sure if you need to be hands-free
when you're in the factory or the plant
or something that you can you know you
can go up to a piece of machinery and it
will show you what how to fix it stuff
gotta bring up gotta be hands-free in
the factory no see um kolb tron says hmm
fifteen hundred dollars to look like a
creep or eight hundred and forty dollars
to look like an idiot tough choice of
joy yeah okay well it'll be fine maybe
we find things crossed fingers crossed
absolutely speaking of looking like an
idiot washing machine gate this is where
my favorite stories drama this is
fantastic my gosh LG has released CCTV
footage at the moment one of its
executives is accused of attacking a
samsung washing machine Wow well this is
at the trade show that we just mentioned
actually for this was in Berlin last
year it's a trade show where all
companies get together in a show off the
new products and they've only just got
around to watching all the CCTV footage
well what happened so what happened is
that LG sorry a samsung accused an LG
executive one jos song ji and i'm not
sure if i pronounce that correctly but
he's the head of LG's home appliance
section he's the LG executive okay and
he was with some other LG executives
they were checking out the competition
as you do sure and he he looked at a
washing machine and he started like you
know fiddling with it and stuff hits on
the screen now if you if you're watching
the video and he he leant on it and he
like put his weight on the door and
stuff and samsung reclaim claim to
that's corporate sabotage and they've
really handed him so LG has released
this video and to show that it wasn't as
bad alright i think it's just absolutely
hilarious this i mean there you can see
brit puts it does actually put his back
into it you can see when you watch the
video he does sure but I mean LG claims
this is a kind of standard engineering
test that he would have just done yah
who among us can say that we've never
been at a trade show and just sort of
you know seen how strong I've broken
something at trade show after you yeah
you know you know when hybrids tablet
pcs with the touch screens
came along the ones they come but
they're quite complicated because
they've got these laptops where the
screen comes off in a combo tablet
basically yeah they click together that
yes keyboard screen here okay so they
don't hit the hinge kachunk yes that's
right so the hinge bit is quite a
complicated bit and over the course of
three days I can't which company it was
had this tablet sat out I was only like
a prototype wasn't completely finished
saying someone else loosened it someone
else loses so it's been opened and
fiddled with well I feel and I broke it
completely kicked off yes at the end
I've had enough of this through of yet
snapped it over your knee through the
pieces away this is a fantastic story
though i'd like to read normal using
that fashion actually from now on just
throwing for yeah this is fantastic
story so yeah LG and Samsung I guess you
could say LG is trying to spin the story
yes um they're airing their dirty
laundry yeah it's almost like no but it
should stop other execs from trying the
same thing in other words rich it will
act as a detergent if we could list the
rest of the podcast now we're gonna go
on like this yeah run out i think we've
run out though stop listening listening
means something so reeling cycle anyway
the ones we thought of in advance or
better yeah not sure out off the cuff
delivery was really that guy i think
okay we sold it so what so what's what
sir have we heard from any readers on
this one visual seed says all LG would
have had to do was design a defective
washing machine door and samsung would
have copied the door to their washing
machines in a matter of days oh I mishap
sungei a hard time because all right
probably even releasing a new model
before the end of the trade show that's
not a leak it's designed to wash your
floors too you just need to buy the
optional s mop for it to work properly s
mob I could just see something doing
that a small actually am let move on as
well I know that we've had a great bit
of consumer advice but we don't have
time unfortunately for someone who's
complaining about the ice in his freezer
okay well yeah but you know you can see
that on facebook and you really um so
yeah so we're speaking of mistakes being
made by that guy that LG game I here's
some more mistakes that you might want
to cover up yeah we'll get rid of so
this is a guy who student in Canada who
has come up with a tattoo removal cream
wow so if you regret a tattoo then
there's a guy called Alex Falconer and
he's in Canada's Dalhousie University
and he's come up with a technology
called bisphosphonates lie
tattoo removal which is as Quincy head
of my mother's name and it's at you wear
my research was going as well so I mean
I'm happy for the guy that he's got
there first but yeah I mean that's
pretty much what i was thinking of fair
enough well you've got a better
marketing budget so i think you should
be okay so what it does it targets white
blood cells called macrophages which
kind of which hand quite gothic and they
sound like the bad guy aliens in
something yeah yeah they creamed
essentially encourages these white blood
cells to eat up the old macrophages and
carry away the pigment in your skin
causing the tattooed babe it's much less
invasive painful and time-consuming how
it's much cheaper than laser removal so
there you go could you could you run up
we could you wait for someone who has a
tattoo to fall asleep that's lose that
remove their daddy mostly George Smiley
place or something yeah that would be
amazing um yeah so this but this guy has
four tattoos was only doesn't regret any
of them how has he been testing it rich
it's been testing on pigs ears I believe
right I believe he's made a right pig's
ear of it huh you might say the word
start of the pigs on a stag do and they
were like he has anything you can do
about this do not want this to follow me
around get a job interview next week
well they go I mean so you could find
you something about the pokemon that
you've got tattooed about your body yeah
well I don't regret that so all that all
151 up my spine what why would you
regret that I would I regret there
exactly a view but you you actually have
real I do have to do so I don't regret
any of them even the dolphin or the
Chinese symbol that says samsung says
don't visit often oh let's check out my
dog picked a tee yeah so moving on the
people who are planning to go to Mars
yeah I've been whittled down to 100 so
that to 22 hundred thousand people
applied for a chance to go with a
nonprofit private space travel company
to go to Mars and the numbers I've been
whittled down to just over a hundred
okay so yeah the Sun does 50 men and
fifty women and five are from the UK oh
ok i read it aren't sure about this
though no a storm space says i'd much
prefer they send robots ahead first to
build a working and stable habitat then
send professionals i have no desire to
watch people die on national TV well
that's tasting point there is a reality
show element to this so yeah is the
reality show element going to
place on earth Oh presumably is not
going to be them actually in space we'd
have to wait ages for the data t doesn't
you actually yeah yeah that would take
the Attic for every and um well anyway a
victoria underscore 123 says frankly i
don't understand how someone could not
only have the desire but tell their
family many of the original applicants
had spouses and children that they
wanted to leave them forever and go to
Mars that's a passive-aggressive thing
that my mum went say about what I don't
see the appeal of going to Mars frankly
white what's wrong with staying here
yeah um I mean come on it's going to
Mars we got saying oh being one of the
first people on Mars that's pretty cool
yeah but like what a conversation the
awkwardness of that chat would haunt you
all the way to Mars that's true you'd
look back at Earth you'd be the first
person to look back at Earth from Mars
and all you could think was like right
down there is someone you know I told
like I'd rather be on Mars yeah let me
get on my trip right yeah you're in it
for three hours with a bunch of three
house or three years or every along it
is with a bunch of strangers and then
you get there and it's just red and
dusty okay why dose of all it's just red
and dusty what do I do in reply to that
comment which doc 59 said it's much like
the explorers of several hundred years
ago who set sail from new world without
really knowing if they would ever return
again or the settlers who left the old
world for the new world knowing they
would never see their friends and family
again where would our world be today if
all these people had stayed home I think
we could have avoided a fair amount of
trouble to be honest if the old worldly
world settlers had its data yeah but we
could all you know yet all just hung out
yeah um but that's a good point about
you know like this spirit of exploration
yeah yeah um we got time for one more
comment on that subject I know okay go
on the nose all right bank i underscore
sseriously it's problematic that this
project is making light of a manned
mission to Mars is supposed to be a
mission not a circus it just takes one
mechanical problem to kill the whole
crew and if you don't have your best
people there to fix it in time everyone
dies well that's that is true that is
true lots of concern in the comments
about basically this being like a
reality TV show gimmick thing rather
than a proper serious mission to Mars
yes I don't think that's fair because
they've recruited scientists and other
technical types right and um yeah am i
right in thinking that they've also
recruited one guy who says he's Martian
well yes 38 year old man from Poland who
goes by the name em 1 dash KO and says
he's a Martian sent to earth who would
be happy to help us explore his home
planet yes but that doesn't mean they're
not taking it seriously right anyway
well late well I don't want to be in the
spaceship necessarily with like the
merging of mashing a long time to be in
spaceship he said he sounds a bit like a
novelty tie-wearing guy yes and well I
mean to go in the office if anything if
anything he is evidence that we
shouldn't be doing this because he left
his home planet never to return and no
he's like I want to go back alright so
should we really be you know the world
network is over ladies well anyways so
well good luck to the fire from the UK
that sir yes and Hannah Ryan Maggie and
Claire good luck from good luck good
luck from the scene at UK podcasters it
is a pretty cool okay final last story
this is great one this one this is about
a scientist proposed a cortical modem
which they reckon is going to be a chip
the size of a couple of coins okay that
you will stick in your head right and
that will implant directly into your new
your visual cortex and allow you to to
see like a heads-up display like
Terminator a Robocop as you're walking
around point coins on that small what is
it like a 50p or something yeah I'm
getting it through into your ear is
probably gonna be me yeah yes the size
of two court costs ten dollars and okay
yeah it sounds fantastic I mean it's
pretty clever it's using something
called optogenetics which involves
altering DNA right and then getting
neurons and yeah turning them on and off
with light because they're like reactive
so you can fire neurons by shining
lights on them okay it's pretty
impressive and they're possibly even
control control new and so could it as
well as having like a cool heads up
display it could also you know
potentially cure cure sight loss
neurological this all mean that's good
as well um 0b3 been 0 B 0 says and then
they'll give the undocumented API to the
NSA well Astrid although the NSA should
already know about it but there you go
alright cool well that's enough this
week's news let's gone to feedback
okay let's hear what you guys have been
saying Richard ambler says if the
temperature is 10 degrees and we add on
the windchill factor it now feels like
five degrees surely the temperature is
five degrees and not ten isn't it
question is but like temperature is is
subjective okay so it can take it kind
of makes sense right because you're
saying like if it's if it's if a
thermometer says 10 degrees and you know
it feels like 10 degrees it's still 10
degrees like it might feel like it might
feel like five degrees to us like you're
very you're a very Hardy man rich you
probably don't feel any temperature
change I don't feel anything mmhmm yeah
it was a cool room temperature
absolutely yeah you know I'm matter way
well yeah exactly the route you know the
room from room temperature that's what
every moment that's how they measure it
yeah that is it i think you that's the
constant andy tomato says i have a
google cardboard but it which is
Google's like make it at home the oculus
rift thing that's true yeah you sit your
phone in it you could have virtual
reality headset but it's hiding my eyes
when I use it what can I do apart from
stop using it don't hide your eyes under
your eyes your best feature yeah well I
mean I don't think it's possible to use
google cardboard without hiding your
eyes I wonder if maybe Andy means
hurting my eyes in which case don't use
it if it's hurting your eyes I don't
need to take it off you if anything's
hurting stop doing it as as I tell my my
wife on a regular basis and Oh rich I
know regular screen rates to keep this
and yet that's whatever screen you're
using whether it's a computer at work or
a phone or computer via at home then
regular it's always good five ten minute
breaks every 50 to 60 minutes are good
for you and remember sitting down is
killing you so get up I have a little
wand around yeah and don't just look at
your phone yeah yeah misses the point
Greg Dobson says daddy your chips I
think we buy something else that one
don't worry yes dad it ships Oh David
Franklin says lollipop or iOS 8 haven't
had a good phone shout down in a while
I'll David this I think you know I think
for the reason for this is that like
it's done where we've lost the will to
argue about this I'm know all the same
I'm done David I mean they're not all
the same obviously because there's
windows phone in the mix which it is the
best well it's not the same let's just
put it that way
which is the best so yeah um alright not
mike batt says why don't americans say
Matt well it because we took the s with
us when we left it was part of the you
know the settlement where they they got
to keep country we got to keep the SL
mats okay actually it is deal yeah all
right in fact it's because so there's
different arguments about this and both
are right so the idea that mathematics
end in s means some people shun it to
Matt but the idea that mathematics is a
mass noun that just happens to end in s
and it's not actually so much for plural
is why some people say math and both are
kind of write a mass nouns thing has
quantity but uncountable like anger
music sushi or cinnamon that kind of
thing but interestingly enough this is
one of those things well actually lived
into this you think that a British way
is going to be older than the Americans
camp with some newfangled way of doing
and they're wrong but actually the use
of math goes back to eighteen nineteen
the United States and the use of maths
goes it goes back only to 1911 Wow so
the Yanks got their first name as it
were but yeah it still maths guys oh
yeah obviously it's still maths
obviously I mean probably what happened
was we spotted that that was happening
in 1911 or whenever and said life that's
just correct yes that's early yeah yeah
correct corrected problem problem solve
problem so um all right Josh King says
