and this is the drift ghost s an action
cam that puts the best bits of other
cameras into one package for starters
it's waterproof down to 9 feet without
housing it has a built-in 2 inch LCD for
a changing setting setting up shots or
playback it has a rotating lens so you
can mount it in different positions
without worrying about what end is up
speaking of mounting it comes with this
quick connect clip mounting system but
it has a standard tripod mount as well
so you can use it with many many other
mounts underneath the back hatch here is
a large removable battery which gives it
up to three and a half hours of
recording time at 1080p at 30 frames per
second but you can also record in Full
HD at 60 frames per second or 720p at
120 frames per second or go all the way
up to 240 frames per second in wvga
resolution video quality is quite good
too especially if you can take advantage
of its high bitrate option you'll still
see some motion artifacts when viewing
closely at large sizes but for sharing
online it's excellent and last but not
least it has built-in Wi-Fi that can be
used for controlling the camera or
viewing what you've captured on an iOS
or Android device but you can also use
it to sync up to four additional ghosts
s cameras to a master camera letting
control all of them at the same time now
it's not cheap at four hundred dollars
but it's one of the most full-featured
cameras you'll find I'm Josh Goldman and
that's a quick look at the drift ghost s
action cam
