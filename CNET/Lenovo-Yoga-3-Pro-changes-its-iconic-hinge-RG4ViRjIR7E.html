at Lenovo's new yoga 3 Pro of course
it's the sequel to the yoga 2 pro and
the big change here is that this system
is actually a bit thinner a bit lighter
because they've changed up the hinge
that that hinge that everyone else now
uses to make their fold back hybrids
instead of two big hinge points it's now
this all the way through hinge
constructed of kind of a watchband
materials like a thin strip of watch
band material so it does the same thing
other yoga's do it starts like this
clamshell laptop fold all the way up
like this then you can keep going some
people like to put it down in kind of a
kiosk or display mode some people even
flip it around and turn it into sort of
a table tent I don't see that too often
but then you fold it all the way down
and you've got a tablet now of course
the keyboard and touchpad are still here
but they're deactivated just like on
every other you know yoga we've ever
looked at but the system as a whole
certainly seems thinner certainly seems
lighter than previous versions of the
yoga and I really like this new hinge a
lot another notable thing about this guy
is that it is the first laptop that I'm
looking at in person that has intel's
new core and processor that's the
low-power processor from intel that lets
us get away with not having any fan
vents on this at all which also helps it
to run a cooler and quieter and
hopefully more efficiently I'm going to
show you very quickly a comparison to
the previous generation hinge right here
and you can see this is the traditional
yoga hinge two points of articulation
there and if you put them next to each
other on this fence a little bit thinner
and of course the hinge is just much
funky and much more unique-looking this
should be out in time for holiday 2014
at 1349 for a fairly premium
configuration I'm Dan Ackerman and that
is the Lenovo yoga 3 Pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
