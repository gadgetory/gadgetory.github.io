launched a whole bunch of watches
running Android wear what does this mean
and what do these watches do well this
is the Samsung gear live which is an
Android wear SmartWatch which runs on
Android phones across the board running
4.3 or higher for your Android operating
system and you may want to check
compatibility because you've got to have
Bluetooth 4.0 now how is this different
from the other Android wear watches the
gear live feels a lot like the other
gears in design but it has a few extra
tweaks going on here and a few extra
features this is a heartrate monitor
like the other recent years that's
something that no other Android wear
watch has right now you've got a three
320 by 320 supreme OLED display so it's
a higher quality screen than on the LG G
watch cost $1.99 for this weirdly less
expensive than LG's watch better screen
and a heart rate monitor plus the rest
of it is pretty much the same four gigs
of storage onboard 512 megabytes of RAM
for what it's worth and it has the same
ability to run apps and feels about as
lightweight the design here is kind of
like a hybrid of a gear fit and a gear
there's a metal band around here middle
middle face that's steel curves no
button on the front part and no camera
there's a button on the side and that
acts as kind of a turn on turn off
button and the pegs here the way it
attaches are a bit more like a Fitbit
force not a standard watch band so if
you don't like the idea that's popping
up be forewarned you can also swap out
this watch band with others feels
comfortable on my wrist and Android wear
what it does basically you're gonna be
talking to it and tapping and swiping to
get notifications at the moment it runs
a lot like Google now on your wrist so
if you're walking around and you're at a
place you've been before it might pop up
a reminder that you've been there or in
the morning weather will pop up or it'll
send Twitter notifications you start to
get overwhelmed with notifications and
you can turn them on and off on an
Android wear app that runs on your phone
you can load it here and you can manage
those notifications and you're gonna
want to plus there are other apps
those are going to install on the phone
and then they're gonna load onto this
automatically those aren't available yet
really so what we're looking at that's
here kind of basic Google services and a
lot of its voice based to get most
things done you're gonna want to have to
double tap and then talk to it and it's
a different idea because it's not really
like bringing up apps it's more like
it's trying to learn and pick up your
habits there are also elements of
fitness you got the pedometer built into
here and you also have things like a
stopwatch and the heart rate monitor
what you get in the box is this and then
you also get a little plug in charge
cradle microUSB snaps on and a little
charge plug and that's the whole story
do you get one of these now well keep in
mind the Moto 360 is going to be coming
out this summer that's a whole different
design and they're gonna be other
Android wear watches which one do you
get right out of the bag I wouldn't go
with one of these right away wait and
see what comes and wait and see what
Android wear becomes we don't even know
yet because these are just the very
first few days of the software
intriguing but evolutionary the Samsung
gear live is available now and it's
going to be arriving by around July 8th
so stay tuned for more I'm Scott Stein
at CNET with the Samsung gear live</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
