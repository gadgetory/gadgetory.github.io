the best years for smartphones ever and
the good news is that 2019 is on track
to become even better the technology
inside your phone is going to get
smarter and it's gonna get faster
however it might also get more expensive
it could be time to buckle up 2018 was
just chock-full of excellent phones
these were the speed demons with robust
batteries enormous screens and top-notch
cameras sometimes even three cameras but
these phones didn't just check the boxes
they're genuinely the powerful gorgeous
machines that you want to navigate your
online life for example the Galaxy S 9
and s 9 plus are streamlined curved
screen beauties with a dual aperture
lens that automatically adjusts to
low-light conditions
the note 9 took it from there piling on
the storage to 128 or 512 gigabytes you
got AI to auto optimize photo settings
and the note 9 S Pen gained enough
Bluetooth smarts to become your phone's
remote
you know who else it it out of the park
the iPhone 10s 10s max and 10 are these
phones speed everything up and embrace
face ID the 750 10 are doesn't have
every whistle and bell but it's the best
iPhone value that we've seen in years
meanwhile Google's pixel three and three
XL wowed us again with hands-down the
absolute best camera on any phone
shot-for-shot these photos beat the
iPhone and Galaxy S nine using only one
camera on the back instead of two timely
updates and free online photo storage
makes the pixel 3 our top premium
Android phone of the year one plus was
another winner with the 60 delivering
your Most Wanted features for about half
the price of the iPhone 10 apps and
since you can now get it at t-mobile us
buyers will start hearing a lot more
about this brand now for a few other
standouts the Moto G 6 absolutely killed
it as a budget phone and the razor phone
2 for gamers wins the most improved
award for fixing past mistakes while
keeping that incredible 120 Hertz screen
plus phones from Huawei Oppo and vivo
pushed the boundaries with dazzling
color stunning designs and pop-up
cameras but the razzle dazzle is in
chief prices soared with premium models
spanning 1000 almost $1500 and they're
only getting higher next years 5g phones
and foldable phones will do more but
they'll cost more to 5g speeds we'll let
you download an entire Netflix season in
minutes but early adopters could make
hundreds more for 5g phones and 5g
service offering a big-screen experience
as for foldable phones like Samsung's
upcoming device these will double your
screen size while still being small
enough to carry around but brands will
charge you more since foldables are
basically like a phone and a tablet and
one and companies want to spread out
higher manufacturing costs whatever 2019
eventually brings one thing is clear and
that's that 2018 has set us up for a
very exciting but also very expensive
year to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
