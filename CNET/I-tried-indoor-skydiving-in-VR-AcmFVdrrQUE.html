but I've never been brave enough to
carry myself out of a plane from 15,000
feet fortunately I don't have to do that
because here at I fly there is a via
indoor skydiving experience that's gonna
get me pretty darn close to the real
deal so the best part is you're gonna
come with me let's go and try it
Veronica I've never done via indoor
skydiving before the most important
question am I gonna throw up doing this
definitely not so we did a lot of
testing and you know VR is still
relatively new but we've got some cool
gadgets on here that'll help like get
everything centered for you so you won't
feel we won't feel like woozy and lost
when you're in there because I'm not
gonna be able to see anything I'm gonna
have someone in there with me too right
yes yeah the whole time so the
instructor will literally help kind of
stand you up
mm-hmm shuffle you over to the door and
then they're going to help leave you in
onto our cushion of air and they'll be
there the whole time kind of flying you
like a very controlled kite okay it
sounds like I need to suit up and then
do the training and then I'm ready to go
that's good before trying the VR I had a
few practice rounds without it in the
tunnel just to get me used to fly
this is a modified skydiving helmet with
a gear VR and Samsung Galaxy s8 you get
a choice of jumping over Dubai Hawaii
the Swiss Alps or California once I have
the helmet on I can see the outside
world with the rear facing camera just
so I don't trip over when I'm walking
around once the view switches into VR
the instructor times when you enter the
tunnel so it syncs with the moment you
jump out of the plane
I'm gonna have really really bad veal
face that's gonna be a side effect for
the next couple hours I'm sure
oh really fun
I felt very relaxed while flying because
the instructors holding on to me
and because the helmet doesn't let as
much of the air in it is easier to
breathe you just feel more relaxed you
can feel like you're actually skydiving
I mean I knew I wasn't because I could
turn around and you know I could see the
field of vision wasn't entirely covering
it but it was so much fun and the best
way to experience skydiving without
actually having to do it so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
