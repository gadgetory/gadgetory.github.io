that will play later on today but let's
get to the latest news I know every time
we talk it's like iphone 7 like iphone 7
again heating up iphone 6 a really we
got iphone 6 on success cs6 SE iphone 6
a sec um the latest news coming out and
this is from efflux and evan blast again
is that pre-orders for the actual iphone
and he has confirmed this for the next
iphone will start on sep tember the
ninth now if you look at how the iphone
has released in the past and this hasn't
been always the case but in this
situation if the pre-orders are the
ninth and we talked about it earlier
this week or the last episode the actual
phone is reportedly expected to come out
on sep tember the 16th for retail
release September the fifth is Labor Day
that's a monday yeah apple better an
apple won't my hope not they better not
say hey we're gonna do an ounce minh on
that monday we know i do be happy but
will they will they release the phone
the next day on the Tuesday Weld always
release stuff on tuesday if you you know
follow the trends and how they've been
doing in the past my hunch is that the
keynote will be on sep tember the sixth
which is tuesday thank God so save your
money if you want a phone that looks
exactly like your current one
I'm just messing with you I am messing
with you all but that's the latest that
we have there from Ewa leaks another
little shot we've been talking about the
dongle right go no antenna lines a
lightning port those are kind of to the
core things a better camera sensor but
Vietnamese website tint a our team Tay
they've been they've been around for
years and they always kind of get some
interesting least once while they're
showcasing off what appears to be the
actual lightning to headphone jack
adapter and really it looks exactly like
you would expect it to look like two
inches lightning port on one end my
voice is FX that looks like something
we're gonna lose I'm of course you can
i'm gonna lose this thing and you gonna
pay 20 bucks to replace and you'd be
like where's my dongle where my dongle
at teen take oh my gosh it's so it's
tiny and it also looks like it can break
easily it's gonna fray apart like every
other Apple cable that you have it's
gonna fray apart you have to go buy
another one after like a year to
value-add Beecham value-add um another
interesting thing though just about the
transition of going from headphones that
are physically plugged into bluetooth
headphones this is a report by the NPD
group just recently has reported that
bluetooth headphones for the first time
revenue from bluetooth headphones
overall has overtaken non bluetooth
headphones ahead of the latest iphone
lunch and that's an interesting thing
because right you sometimes want to get
ahead of these trends according to
report fifty-four percent of headphone
dollar sales and seventeen percent of
the unit sales in the united states went
to bluetooth headphones so this is the
first time they've ever been able to
overtake that which i've been what it i
use bluetooth I mean are you using
bluetooth that your music guy beach i'm
not i'm not using bluetooth right but i
would i would if i had you know if i had
a cool pair that was awesome what about
when you worked on human they were great
you go to the gym do you use bluetooth
headphone never know you don't I don't I
hope the regular headphones I always
have to put my phone on its side see
that's when I I definitely old bluetooth
headphones in the gym because you know I
gotta make room for the guns
for all you that we're watching the
video you just you might you might have
been poked down the eye by my guys I
need some bluetooth headphones though
maybe maybe I can help you out there you
know I've got some friends I mean
youryour about your valuable contributor
uh pretty much a non an indispensable
element of the show maybe I should do
work on that for you i was i was
actually like thinking about them today
I'm like I cuz I'm tethered to my desk
in my computer when you're editing I'm
like if I could just get up and walk
around and even just sit around in my
chair yeah it'd be nice so the trend is
there we are moving in that direction I
know yes we've always been able to have
bluetooth headphones this is nothing new
but the fact that Apple is removing a
physical Jack and basically saying
without our dongle you need to use
bluetooth headphones it is aligning with
what's happening to consumers in the
industry right now an MPD is a
legitimate resource that pulls this type
of sales information and look at this
tartan this chart at the bottom of this
blog post top-selling bluetooth
headphone brands ranked by dollars beats
is number one that's what I use for my
work out there you go what is it beats
LG be those bose jaybird and then skull
candy skull candy skull candy skull
candy makes like the fun looking ones i
mean they may not be the best idea but
they do have like a little flair to them
so um that's what's happening in the
iphone world but we wanted to before we
get to some of the new stuff at least
address some of the earnings this past
week apple reported their third quarter
fiscal earnings which is equivalent to
the second quarter in the calendar year
and quite honestly the numbers were not
very pretty we'll just go over the recap
really quickly overall apples revenue
dropped fifteen percent okay so from a
pure revenue standpoint and this is
obviously because of the decline of
sales of iphones but there's other areas
that were affected Apple posted a
forty-two point four billion dollar net
quarterly profits re revenue and then if
you compare that to last year it was
forty nine point six billion okay now
let's talk about the actual products
iPhones dropped if you compare this to
last year's quarter forty point four
million versus 40
point five million a year earlier Mac
sales down 4.25 million units down from
4.8 last year ipad sales were also down
again I think this might be now either
like that makes six or 7th quarter where
ipad sales have been down falling nine
point nine five million from 10.9 so
every major product category for Apple
was down that's crazy I mean it makes
sense the iPad things make sense because
I think what's everyone bought an ipad
they're like I don't really need this
thing other than for entertainment for
like just fun things but the other
products losing their market share tues
that's pretty that's staggering so the
other thing is I didn't include this
report in here beach and we talked about
it on the video show but when you look
at where Apple is losing where who is
gaining and the clear beneficiary of
this has been the Samsung Galaxy s7
phone line or just their phones in
general yeah that's like their big rival
so if you even look at stats for them we
don't have them here at least for our
video audience but samsung shipped 77
million phones this past quarter apple
shipped forty point four million and
then if you talk about just market share
of who was buying what samsung nearly
doubled app or almost doubled Apple
again I think they were at like 22 point
four percent market share Apple was
somewhere around like eleven percent
market share and so at least in this
quarter Samsung is just beating them
down now during this Ordnung earnings
report Tim Cook did mention that he's
optimistic about the next iPhone and the
next upgrade purely because Apple has
such a large install base and if you
want to talk about that install base
Apple did announced earlier this week
after their earnings report that they
had sold their one billionth iphone
which is incredible 1 billion i swaddled
which is why I had this music that we
are oh wait that's the wrong music sorry
the music that you were hearing me play
before the show I had this for the one
billionth one billionth iphone cell
that's pretty that's astronomical wow
it's a mate and think about this this
has happened in nine years okay
nine-year 99 years Wow I mean just think
how many they'll sell when the actual
real new iPhone comes out next year I'm
like basically telling everyone you
probably shouldn't get this upcoming
iPhone if you have a six or a 6s and
even a 5s you might you might as well
wait it out but that is we do want to
congratulate Apple that is an impressive
feat I just did a little background
check of how long it took McDonald's to
sell their further one millionth
hamburger yeah and so they're officially
first restaurant opened in 1940 ok 1963
is when they sold their one billionth
hamburgers let's do the math on that 20
23 years three years 23 years and Apple
did it in nine and and the burgers are
way less exposures sixties a burger was
like probably 75 cents fifty cents if
that an iphone in night when did it come
out in two thousand where we have been
where we had no we're about sixteen had
mathesar so were too yeah 2007-2010 it
was in the iphone the first iphone was
what like seven hundred dollars yeah
when it first launched and then but
remember people were so pissed about it
because then they like lowered the price
because it's a little high then they
gave every everyone who bought it on
launch a dollar a gift card I don't be
like that oh yeah we're sorry cuz they
dropped it I believe they dropped at two
hundred bucks and like after people like
and then people that bought it like me
uh they gave him like a 100 dollar gift
gonna be like alright thanks sorry we're
our bad but for the record my original
iphone which I kept still works it's
still freakin works really i sold mine I
had to keep the first one though I
thought I should have kept my first
don't you regret so I not really regret
it totally I mean that's it that's a
hitch that's it should be in a museum i
got my first one the first devices that
i have i have the original power mac g4
cube i don't know if you remember that
I've seen pictures I've I've never seen
amazing uh and then I have an original
ipod that still works to this day well
and then original iphone i also have the
macintosh to se all I used to have like
the old-school man together you grew up
in line
zero yeah Roger on it and that the
shuffle putt game the horror is like a
haunted house shuffle puck yeah was it
was it dark castle or beyond dark Cassie
ever marathon went under the stones okay
everyone's like what do you guys talking
about shut up year old here's a picture
of tim cook with the one billionth
iphone that he sold right in holding
pretty impressive so there you go
there's the earnings um and Tim Cook did
say that he is optimistic with a new
phone coming out and so we'll see how
that plays that I mean we I feel like we
really know everything about the phone
right yeah I mean the last two phones
all the rumors that came out were
totally true so yes it's yeah we know
everything remember for the record I
want to let people know remember when
Tim Cook said we're doubling down on
secrecy when he first took over which
means we're gonna hire some like liquid
Twitter guys to tweet out doubling down
on secrecy we know everything about this
phone like more than ever more than ever

day they took like 50 bucks all i know i
know i saw it but I just I wasn't and I
wasn't in the mood that day okay well
this was again this was a segment
sponsored by I devices in on amazon yes
all right let's get two more of our show
this is probably the most fascinating
story that i have seen this week and we
wanted to bring it to it in the middle
the show just to kind of cover all the
iphones up at the top but you would know
that we have been talking about the
apple TV service here for a long time
the rumored TV streaming service and if
you rewind to a few episodes i had said
we had said that we felt the reason why
we haven't seen a TV streaming services
because apple must be so hard lined on
their demands that has been turning off
the studio's because sling TV has their
own TV service sony playstation view has
their own TV service why in the world
has Apple not been able to do this so an
article by the wall street journal just
drop today talking about how Apple's
hard-charging tactics have actually hurt
their TV expansion in their plans for a
streaming service now just kind of go
through historically what has happened
and most recently as in 2015 there Apple
is really try to make this work on their
own terms but a recent meeting in 2015
between Apple and Disney Apple wanted to
demand basically that they freeze the
monthly rate per viewer that is paid
right so that they could get Disney's
channels now TV channels usually get an
annual rate increase and rely on them to
fuel growth but Apple wanted to freeze
them and this is what their message was
to Disney and Disney
like um no we're not going to do that
that's not how our industry works and
Apple has continued to take this
position of we are Apple so then the
wall street journal we know we've heard
bits and pieces of this through the past
few years they went on and kind of
really tried to break down Apple's I
guess you could call it hubris over the
past years starting back as far as 2009
of how Apple has really negotiated this
i'm not going to dig in super but i want
to give you just this idea or the sense
of where Apple is screwing this up and
it really comes down to really again
they're cockiness and thinking that
we're Apple so in 2009 when they first
were kind of approaching this idea and
thought apple was offering higher fees
than the paid for TV providers right
these cable service providers but they
only wanted certain channels they only
wanted like 20 to 25 channels and
they're the people that are putting
their content are like well for example
let's say a company like Disney they
don't own just ABC and the Disney
Channel they have disney XD they have
disney animated be kids for different
just in Seattle then there's ABC family
like they want all of those on the
service apples like no no we only want
25 channels everyone's like sorry we
don't want to play and this is very
early remember this is 2009 yeah okay
then let's fast forward to 2011 and we
had heard rumors about Apple working
with time warner and a deal falling
through and them saying okay we're going
to wait on this what had happened there
is apple and Time Warner we're working
on a TV a joint TV service that would be
on time warner boxes okay the big hiccup
was that Apple wanted people to sign up
using their Apple IDs they wanted Time
Warner to handle all the billing and
subscriptions so which is like basically
like hey into your structure yeah do the
infrastructure BR do the clerical stuff
but we're gonna have the customers use
their Apple IDs to sign in also we
aren't going to necessarily give you all
the data about those customers because
that is private to which is so important
right every industry analytics or
everything to learn how they do this in
addition to this Apple pitch a similar
deal to comcast these cable operators
were like will
how is this how's the channel selection
going to work how is this and in the
article let me see if I can find it in
quote that in the article according to
here and people who are privy to these
meetings and Apple official reply that
the software would be better than
anything you've ever had so they even
asked them something like could you
maybe sketch this out on a napkin so
that we could at least see what this
might look like and they didn't they had
no answers for that really so you're
like okay you can't even tell us how how
innovative this menu will work it's like
no okay fine that's cool that's cool now
we're catching up to speed now so this
is what 2009-2011 2013 now okay Eddy Cue
comes to a meeting with Time Warner CEO
and this is according to people inside
this meeting time warner owns HBO TNT
CNN TBS things like that and according
the article Apple's mr. Q arrived 10
minutes late and was wearing jeans
tennis shoes with no socks and a
Hawaiian shirt says a person familiar
with the meeting the other executives
were wearing suits so that it that in
itself kind of is like Oh Eddy Cue kind
of like trying to Swagger in thinking
he's like the man like we're gonna do
things my way but that's not how it went
they say in the article Apple wanted
fool on demand seasons of hit shows and
rights to their cloud-based DVR that
would automatically store the top
programs and allow ad-skipping on newly
aired shows so like this is kind of so
many red flags this is how they were to
start and this is Apple coming and
basically saying hey this is how we want
to do TV you guys don't know what you're
doing and the TV guys are like do you
have any idea how we do this like are
you really that cocky and so I think
that when you hear these situations of
how Apple just doesn't get in the TV
industry to try and build their own TV
service it makes sense it backs up what
you and I have been talking about like
it has two three but exactly when
talking about we're just like apples
going into these meetings saying we're
Apple you know trust us we're going to
make everything great
it's just not working and if and if they
started this negotiations in 2009 if
they would have nailed down any sort of
negotiation at that time they would be
way ahead of everybody right now because
everyone else kind of came on slow to
streaming all their content online to
you know like Comcast a lot of these
companies just slowly have been ramping
up their online content and if Apple
would have nailed that in 2009 we'd be
much different place now yeah and it
speaks to look I think they they Apple
learned from itunes they this is at a
point in time remember when the music
recording industry was desperate for
something you know they weren't making
money on CD sales right people were
ripping non-stop there wasn't an easy
did not pressure I come out although
everyone's right Apple was the savior
for them but the TV industry totally
different they don't need a Savior
they're doing just fine and Apple thinks
that you know we use this throw this
word around the disruptor but look at
what TV networks are doing now all
they're doing is like you know what
forget you Apple people are paying for
our cable service we're just going to
build apps that give them the ability to
access that same information our same
content we're making the money thanks
Apple but no thanks yeah I mean every
every major television studio has their
own app now that you can login through
if you have a cable subscription you
just log into that and then you're
watching whatever you know watching
the PGA Championship on my phone on TNT
it's all good it's all good and so where
does this leave Apple now we even talked
I think even as recent as like last week
we said I said I've got a feeling that
because they aren't able to make a deal
now that so many channels and networks
are just putting they're making an app
to be able to watch their content apples
kind of content with that right now and
because of the way that they're using
Syria on the apple TV you're starting to
be able just cut they said it you know
in tivos you'll just be able to call up
say play vh1 you know and show me vh1 in
that the channel open and launch and
then you'll be able to i mean that's
coppergate through that content which is
cool of that but they do not have a TV
streaming service anywhere in sight and
i just think that it's very very telling
of apples thinking than just their
philosophy of like they still think that
their number one and if you look around
like blue jeans and hawaiian shirt
that's no sauce it's a very Silicon
Valley move for no socks for the record
no socks um and I think I can't find the
quote right here but in the in the
article they quoted oh here we go so mr.
Q has basically referred to the to TV
industry as overly complicated talks and
as quote is time is on my side yeah
that's like okay whatever buddy but
here's the difference also any Q is not
Steve Jobs no no not at all and for
anyone to think for Apple internally to
think that they are the same Apple with
that without Steve Jobs has been
probably one of the biggest mistakes
brand continue to me they have brand
cachet but that's that's about it yeah
and it's I mean that brand cachet is is
changing its dwindling it's it's a it's
a different beast now so we'll see how
that all plays out but again huge fail
if Apple is unable to launch a TV
streaming service by now and I can't
remember the numbers because we had
brought it up but I know that the
PlayStation view is up to this point is
the most successful TV streaming service
I think they had over I don't want to go
too far but I swear was around 250 300
thousand paying subscribers already yeah
you know service is hearing about that a
lot lately it up you while you talking
about people are like clamoring for some
update of that product yeah so um we
will see what happens okay I jumped
ahead guys and gals 100,000 subscribers
see I don't want to get likes people
like why 300,000 so they have said to
surpass 100,000 subscribers right now
for the PlayStation view service which
which is really fun okay in other news
other news that I'm personally excited
about a Apple watch 20 Apple watch to
report get ready all is said to include
a thinner one glass solution display why
does this matter right now this one
glass solution technol
eliminates the fact that it is layers of
glass from the traditional display right
now it features two pieces of glass and
so they're replacing one layer with a
thinner material and allowing it to be a
lower profile they didn't say if the
form factor of the actual apple watch
would change from a standpoint of look
they are there's no way in hell that
they're going to change these uh the
wristband sizing as they do I will kill
I will literally go over and strangle
down at the next Apple Store and valine
I'm just gonna walk up and squeezed his
neck I will not less glass make a little
lighter too yeah yeah it'll make a
slightly lighter um but that is the
report according to digit times and you
know we're expecting to still see the
Apple watch by the end of this year I'm
kind of curious that we might see it at
this sep tember keynote honestly I don't
know if they really have to do a
brand-new keynote like the last the last
king yet they did they talked a lot
about the Apple watch they did a
dedicated one just for the Apple watch
basically uh and watch oz trace is fiyah
like I love it it's going to change how
you feel about the Apple watch
guaranteed uh just to also follow up
with some more news as we kind of round
things out here with the Apple car this
is the latest and greatest we told you
that Bob Bob Mansfield who was the
senior VP of hardware engineering was
recently hired to take over the project
and now it looks like Apple is moving in
a different direction this is a report
according to Bloomberg where Apple has
hired blackberry talent they've actually
hired the former CEO of qnx and if you
don't remember qnx that is BlackBerry's
mobile operating system his name is Dan
dodge okay so Apple has brought him on
to the team as well to report to Bob
Mansfield and the actual project has now
shifted where the priority isn't
necessarily the car the initiative is
now to prioritize development of an
autonomous driving system so uh so a
driverless list system is taking
priority over actually designing the
physical car and the look at Yale and
the hope is that this will not only help
accelerate just may be there their focus
but
in addition to that they could if this
whole car idea doesn't really pan out
for them they could technically license
this system or partner with other car
manufacturers that say hey we have a
design that we want to partner with you
to create this car based on your
platform so it's kind of it's a little
strategic as well yeah it's kind of like
the robot operating system race right
now you know I mean you know about that
like no no tell me is a lot of companies
developing robots and they're all in a
race to develop the operating system
that everyone will use for said robot
you know like they all want to be the
iOS of robots so it's kind of
interesting but but hiring them a
blackberry executive does that have to
do with security because I know
blackberries you know very famous for
being like the most secure phone do you
think it has to do cuz like um I know
there's a lot of issues with hacking car
software right now so maybe that has
some its it i mean i think it's an
interesting point I think it's a no one
has really said what dan dodges pure
roll is right now um but I think it is a
really smart idea to just give them the
options to decide if they want to maybe
acquire someone to become their actual
car chassis or not right or if they want
to partner with someone instead of
actually building the car itself it's a
it's definitely a different approach
because everyone else is like we are
just building everything from the ground
up and Apple is behind let's not let's
not forget that it's leaning more
towards we've talked about it before but
it's leaning more towards where it's
going to be a service as opposed to a
car yeah yeah I mean they can sell this
self-driving software or whatever
Hardware they're gonna build and put it
in other cars put in any car maybe just
a couple other details up from this
article we know that demand for the
iphone is significantly just really
dropped off as of late oh we will let
the numbers bear out what happens with
the latest release and then obviously
the tenth anniversary you know what we
call it Beachum the iphone future so
with this demand going down they need a
new revenue stream as well so even if
this is a potential revenue stream that
comes out in 2021 which is what the
rumored push out date is it's important
and that's also why
to me that TV streaming service is so
important Apple another revenue stream
yeah that lot they haven't been able to
figure out hmm it's come on come on
Apple I don't know I like this render of
a steering wheel Apple look do us or
cheese you could accomplish that same
thing by taking the sticker from your
freaking iphone and put it on the center
of your steering wheel looks cheesy um
another a lot of buttons there too for
like your phone you know play buttons
and stuff there should be all that
others I'm gonna well we just have a
couple more car I guess car-related
driving wheeling related stories um
Apple is partnering hold on one second
I'm sorry this is this is not we're here
we go Apple is partnered with park Oh
pedia to bring in depth parking data to
Apple maps so this is a partnership
between the two companies iOS users will
be able to visit use Apple maps and
discover more than 40 million parking
spots in 75 countries across North
America Europe Asia and Latin America
that's pretty cool so you know there
they have data like where these lots are
um really what payment types they accept
number of space there's obviously
specific parking lots it's not like
they're gonna have the data on every
single parking lot right yeah its
parking lots that have partnered and
have made this data available because
they're trying to make money yeah and
they're working with Apple to provide
that data so it's very I think it's a
cool feature to have especially in
places like San Francisco where parking
is so expensive I was just gonna say
looking at this graphic here there's no
there's no mention of how much the
parking space is that's something i want
to know because our in san francisco you
can find this parking space for like
thirty dollars a day it's ridiculous
even more oh yeah even yeah even for and
when there's like giants games yeah oh
they jack that up it's like 40 bucks for
the night you better get in in the
morning when it's like 20 yeah like that
that's a deal there um and then finally
this is a the story is kind of like
depressing to me but you know we know
apples trying to get in the content game
but Apple has decided
to their kind of the surprise buyer of
the unscripted TV series based on
carpool karaoke so you know that segment
of James Corden yeah it's like one of
them the late late show it's I mean it's
very popular standing easy to package
and become a viral video you're taking
celebrities musicians singing awesome
songs with James Corden well this series
is going to be exclusive according to
the report to Apple music this will not
encourage me to watch to buy Apple means
I'm dead serious it's a TV show it's
like you know five minute video like a
mini segment yeah video set video
segments that will involve celebrities
musicians but will also not involve
James Corden who kind of makes the
segment cool okay so they got dr. dre
working on a TV show they got biopic TV
on planet of the apps landed the apps
and then who what was the other one
wasn't there will IM thing how will I am
his planet of the app so that was like a
reality a reality contest show and then
they got carpool karaoke but not the
star of carpool carry no okay not at all
so Apple is licensed 16 episodes of the
show they'll be executive produced by
cordon and the Late Late Show so they're
they're requiring this through CBS but
he will not be involved in it as well so
it's just like look this is like when
you see something like on the TV or a
movie and then you just make your own
version to put up on YouTube and it's
just not as good yeah Apple's doing that
but they're paying lots of money for it
lots of money I'm sure like is there
could it don't you think quite honestly
we have seen carpool karaoke since the
advent of time like these have existed
before carpool karaoke was a segment on
TV show it's popular cuz everyone
doesn't on there a lot time yeah I mean
and so all I'm saying is we've seen
videos of this before James Corden made
it popular with celebrities and is it
really his idea when he really is like
we talked about it actually recently on
howard stern show and said it was just a
very organic things like why don't we
get someone in a car i think the first
one was Mariah Carey he's like let's get
her to just drive around and have her
singer hits you know yeah and then it
like did like I'm
million views on YouTube it was really
YouTube that set this show set the seg
made the segment popular it's not CBS or
production or anything having to do with
that it's like an organic thing to
happen on YouTube and then they're like
oh well this kind of works now we got to
start doing it all the time and now
apples like picking up on that from it
just sounds like so weird to me I'm
sorry it's it's just the whole a key
thing where something that kind of comes
from innocent good intentions yeah then
it just completely sucked up by
corporate yeah and then it's not and
then it's not even what it used to be
like if it was cordon and if it's the
same thing then that you would be more I
would be more I wouldn't I still want to
pay for an apple music subscription
button Ocalan it would definitely be a
bonus if you are a subscriber now that
it's like wait it's carpool karaoke
without cordon and come on are these are
not gonna be a less artists these are
gonna be like Wilson Phillips minus
Willis will sit yeah it's gonna be like
that yeah like up-and-comers that you
never heard of four who like the record
labels trying to get them exposure oh
you going out anyway yeah just take off
it's just that takes the charm out of it
and it whoever they pick as a host it's
just not gonna be as good but I do it
not just we should do our own seen that
version you can carpool karaoke but now
everything is a copy on again by it it
will just buy yeah this concept you know
we'll do our own for the Apple why this
existed before even coordinated to
carpool karaoke yeah so um pulsing
apples getting in the content game but i
will say their most original idea is the
planet of the apps show although it
sounds funny um it does have an
interesting twist on the whole
competition idea yeah it does and we
have exclusive footage from that if you
watch like two episodes ago I showed
someone show yes yes we do we do okay um
should we go check out our voicemails
today yeah let's check out her voice
awesome okay hang out give me one second
I won't let you get a while i'll let you
get the other warm right now okay here
is Michael let me stop this music that's
been playing the whole show and I don't
even know
was playing Michael from New Jersey here
we go hey guys it's michael from New
Jersey I love the show I just wanted to
add something just the crew just like ed
to the rumors that are going around
about the removal of the touch ID home
button and they might replace with a
haptic feedback is it your for example
you put a finger on it that is not
registered with touch ID you'll feel a
haptic feedback through the so
it's very very possible that there's
right like magic takara wherever the
rumors are that they will remove the
home button for the present I just want
to let you guys know thanks for the show
hi that's what I like that I like that
knowledge yeah it was just a little bit
of tidbit yeah so it's gonna like poke
you if you're not if you're not
registering the phone each other this
something will poke you in the finger
it'll be like more of a buzz that is
kind of more a rejection but like don't
touch me it'd be like back back back
that's weird i'm like that some haptic
response like that okay we got Matthew
from Michigan checking in Michigan hello
my name is matthew i am from michigan
and I'd like to say real quick I love
your show and I'd like to ask two
questions my first one is I'm a little
sad that Apple is no longer doing
they're not as colorful as they used to
be there they used to be the color
company now they're just the company
that makes black white rose gold and
gold products even their logo used to be
colored and all the ipods and do you
think they'll ever do that with the
iphone like have a blue purple pink
yellow green iphone and do you think
they're done with a wife like the ilife
0607 etc like I movie you know them
thank you hey I agree we need more
colors yeah I mean I know there's cases
out there but the iphone 5c which I
destroyed with another most their most
recent um colorful collection of
products you know apples just I don't
think I think there's something in the
DNA that has clearly changed and I don't
even necessarily say Oh Steve Jobs was
like behind all the color he might have
been by clearly Tim Cook is like we're a
classy company you know it's like these
are these these looks or designs or
maybe it's just a jony ive's influence
it's not about
fun it's about being classy mean a
premium product like they forgot they
were a premium product while still
having colors and i got like almost the
colors almost saved him you know like we
all had gray computers white computers
blab and then Steve Jobs started he came
out he's like I got this bright pink
laptop right here check this out it's
like whoa that's awesome it's bright
pink you know yeah I totally understand
this guy we even just to give you a
little background as well we talk about
colors be long before I was here I used
to work at a company called speck
products we used to make cases and we
ended up making the shells for laptops
macbooks the first ever and the whole
thing was to bring back colors because
macbooks were all just silver oh yeah
right there were no colors at all and
that became the top-selling product for
that company and probably all now that
laptops are selling less these days not
as much but for years that product drove
that company and some I think the most
challenging part of it is you know this
some colors sell more than others yeah
yeah black clear and red we're always
the top ones and then after that you had
to really kind of figure out how many
units of these other colors were gonna
make and that's up for them to decide I
mean they're such a large-scale company
they can figure that out but I do miss
the colors I think you're right on the
money like that's someone who loved
colors and you know the guy that caught
was his name sorry was it your math math
yeah sure Matthew what's up um in
response to I life the I life will not
go away although it doesn't get updated
nearly as much they're not gonna try and
force people to use Final Cut Pro
although Final Cut Pro is like iMovie
plus pro a cup final gift horrible I
movie pro it's like oh my goodness but a
that they can't get rid of that I mean
you still have iphoto which is plugged
into their phone or actually that I
believe it's isn't their new app gonna
just be called me homo don't think so
yeah yeah when we heard something some
announcement recently something like
that see my brain I'm sorry someone
someone calls incorrect st. Brian you
don't know you don't know nothing you
should be doing this show don't do the
show up but yeah it did either way I
life will live on in some way shape or
form the time that I was the most
disappointed out I life is when they
took away I DVD
and I don't know most you see no one's
even stevens like Audrey what DC peps
not say I know you can burn dvds not
only you can make your own DVD and use
yes like I would you remember that and
colors and music transition so I was in
college I did that when I was trying to
get a you know whatever demo reels out a
no one was doing on DVDs people are
still handing out this technology called
VHS might as well been given us stone
tablets back then and so I burned my own
DVDs but I made my own menus on him and
they're cool it doesn't you know what
will you get a job because you did that
no but it just shows that like huh I got
that extra polish on there yeah one day
you'll look back at your and you'll be
all proud of your DVD menu one day I in
fact still have one of those dvds that I
should just bring to you as a joke just
you could love it i would love it see
some of my old work how horrible it was
and how horrible it hasn't even improved
at all in 10 years it's just just as bad
it's probably like four kids watching
the show like what's a DVD it's true but
yeah i don't think they should they'll
completely get rid of it also live in
some way shape or form i think the last
time it was updated was though like I
live 2013 when they used to do it update
it every year oh really yeah so we'll
see okay we got another call Jeffrey oh
no i'm sorry i'm going to do blair in
west hollywood first letter hey this is
blair in west hollywood so with the
supposed release of the iphone on
September 12th and that's short of a
year from when the last iphone was
released what will that do to people
like me who did the Apple financing
where you have to wait a whole year
before you can upgrade let me know what
you think hey sorry so I was reading a
comment on periscope cuz I got
distracted so can you tell me what he
said oh he who is the subscription you I
phone yes yeah yeah okay so from past
experience i had an iphone i think it
was when i moved from a 4s to a 5 back
in the day or what it was one of those
transitions and i still had a month in
between when my phone was ready to
upgrade and
they did not let me shorten that
distance they just said it's a pure
contract it's 365 days maybe you can
work your magic but I I it's what it's
about a week and a half this time maybe
close to two weeks the actual um what
release would be the sixteenth if your
contract ends on the twenty-fifth what
did he say did he say the 25th I forgot
or a week or so maybe maybe they'll make
an exception but my hunch is that they
won't they didn't for me back in the day
and this is more through the carrier
that carrier contract or you know when
you buy it outright vs apple say no will
do you a favor let's just do this I if
they do it for you let us know I'd be
curious to hear when that happens I have
a feeling there's like some automated
system like standing in the way of doing
that you know I mean like like someone
and at Apple just be like I can't do at
the computer won't let me do it you have
to wait to a contract ends I just have a
feeling that's how we'll go yeah i mean
the scope errs said like Paris coppers
have just said basically the same thing
happen to them so too bad that's a sorry
sorry this is our last call Jeffrey I
was wondering if you had a windows
laptop or a netbook question of the day
Steven windows or mac book I have a
Windows my personal computers windows 10
and my work laptop is a macbook so am I
in my witness yeah my my my work is a
macbook my home computer computers I'm
not just gonna sound like a spoiled dude
but this is I actually have an old
macbook air like old I don't have the
new one but I use an iMac and an ipad
pro 12.9 inches yes specifically to it
do most of my stuff but i'll tell you
right now i mean if you want one that
does everything that's the best of those
both worlds you got to get a surface pro
oh yeah it's so good I'm just saying
it's really good but why haven't i got a
service pro because all my stuff's on
the ecosystem and I do like my I like my
iPad a lot but none of the keyboard
solutions they have is worth my time yet
bridge is coming out with one and I
remember who else is that I'm curious to
see but until someone can give me a good
keyboard solution for my ipad pro um you
know I go keyboard list but again
nothing compared with the service pro
does it makes me sad how how their
hybrid OS is so much better yeah like
solely my windows laptop it's all about
the touchscreen I mean I have to be able
to scroll hit play hit big buttons like
