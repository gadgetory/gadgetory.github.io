and acylium plus have great features but
did you know that it also has two
speakers for surround sound two speakers
huh well I got two speakers right here
on my razor phone as well and Dolby
Atmos sir okay well that's not in Si and
Plus have Dolby Atmos surround sound -
okay so maybe we should figure out which
one of these is better I think it's the
razor phone and I think that it really
depends there are other things anything
that the razor phone does a lot better
but at the end of the day I still kind
of gotta lean toward the galaxy last
night
luckily for you we did four tests we got
two games it's got to be movies it's
gotta be music we got to do calls we did
them all so our first test was music we
played a bunch of different songs on
both phones really wanted to hear a lot
of different sounds and to hear how they
sounded now now we have the settings
exactly the same on both phones and
Shawn what was your first impression it
really took me a sec to really figure
out what I was hearing out of H cuz we
had the volume issue right away
immediately we're like wow the Samsung
phone is louder which I did not expect
because you think big speakers on this
thing small speakers on that little
speaker on the bottom which they can't
expect any louder but I didn't like how
the s9 sounded at that volume I was like
it's too loud it's it's kind of giving
me a bit of distortion the hand so we
had to pull that down I absolutely agree
I got the same thing it was like wow if
you want to kill a room with sound it's
going to be the galaxy s 9 but what is a
good sheet no we really have to take it
down a couple for the flat feeling of
this until we took it down and then I
was like there's more layers in these
songs it sounds like there's more depth
more richness app in the s9 which I did
not expect either
so for video one to make sure we could
get some atmospheric surround sound but
also just human voices like you'd have
talking to you in YouTube video so we
did both Netflix and YouTube for our
video tracks yeah and I thought I was
really interesting is that there was a
difference between that Netflix show
that we saw that really was immersive
where you need the sound to draw you
into the scene and then the voices that
came from some of the YouTube videos and
then just some of the music that was
playing as part of the videos yeah it
was really richer and a lot in a large
part four voices on the samsung galaxy s
nine but I really preferred the razor
phones spatialization you have all these
elements all these Foley elements that
made you feel like you were really part
of a scene yet if your raindrops heat up
to footsteps the neon sign lighting on a
rat over in the partner you could tell
that the rat was in a specific location
I agree I did notice that too I think if
you weren't if you didn't have the phone
side-by-side it wouldn't make a
difference but hearing it on the razor
phone you definitely got a sense of what
the galaxy s going last there but I will
say that when you're watching something
more instructional or when you're
watching an interview with somebody that
the voices came out much letter and
clearer and that scene we were watching
somebody screams that sounded a lot more
convincing like painful RAAA on the s9
even in the Netflix surround sound scene
I didn't get the surround sound there
yeah but I did get that that got a role
Valkyrie kind of scream out of that yeah
for simple games like Super Mario run I
think it didn't really make much of a
difference which fun you were using and
maybe even if you're using stereo
speakers at all or not collecting coins
ding-ding-ding sounded roughly the same
maybe a little bit different but not the
better
sounded like coins it's not like coins
yeah but then I think when we moved
along to the more advanced game like
yeah we're placing Riptide GP renegade
we've got our little wave race thing
going
I thought the splashing water sounded a
lot more three-dimensional on the galaxy
s now I was right there with you and I
thought that it was a little bit more
suppressed a little bit muted on the
razor phone so we're kind of an
agreement there but we're we are still
pretty close it's still fairly close
like I wouldn't pick one over the other
because for both of these games the
sound doesn't really matter you might
play them with the audio off anyhow
game-like pubget though where you've got
people hunting each other on an eye a
little bit more gunshots all around you
you're trying to survive a lot of people
use headphones for that game anyhow and
on the razor phone it sounded much more
three-dimensional much more sounds
around me so I could tell where things
were coming from I couldn't do that with
ds9 so at the end of the day I mean if
you're somebody who's serious about
playing games and the razor phone is
definitely going to take that one home
for you but I think that on the galaxy
s4 and if you're still comparing it
between a phone that has stereo speakers
or not it's still going to be a better
choice but but one last thing you can
block the speaker on the yeah so you
gotta watch out for that if you're
playing games in landscape mode you
might block the speech that's a really
good point yeah where is the razor phone
is definitely a gamer's phone one more
thing you might use speakers for how
about speaker phone calls so to test
this on both phones we use the exact
same SIM cards same network and even the
same caller mm-hmm and we found out
right away was that the razor phone
wasn't loud enough immediately we were
like we got to boost up this volume
thankfully there was a little volume
boost button but then we noticed it was
a little bit muffled yeah I actually
said that it sounded like somebody was
holding a pillow over the face of the
person we were speaking to the weapon
which is a little bit alarming but this
person sounded pretty distant and and
very muffled but not garbled so we
thought razor phone maybe it's not gonna
be as good as the s9 so we went over to
the SMI and it was a hundred times worse
it had all of the volume total
distortion and I think you actually
called it a garbage it sounded like
garbage sounds like hot garbage on the
line there were all these things in the
background that we could hear over the
line they're being amplified by the
phone little pops works and things like
that yeah modern audio artifacts and
then when we actually boosted the volume
it just amplified all of the problems so
I would say for me razor phone wins and
try never to use the speakerphone on the
Galaxy S nine unless you absolutely must
so we've tested them out but at the end
of the day we have to make a decision
Sean I gotta say for the games in the
movies the razor phone is my pick even
if it doesn't have the audio quality for
music it's got almost everything I
wanted two speakers just maybe not
everything I wanted to find I think that
if you're not a big gamer and you listen
to a lot of music the Galaxy S nine
definitely is the better choice because
it gives you that richer sound and it
gives you that depth I think at the end
of the day you know the Galaxy S nine is
the phone that most people are gonna
hear of and it shows that Samsung has
got a little bit more work to do because
the razor phone definitely wins in some
categories yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
