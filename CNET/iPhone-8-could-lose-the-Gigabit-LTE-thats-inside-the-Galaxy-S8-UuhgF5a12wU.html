the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple let's get
to the show and it's more news about the
upcoming iPhone 8 seen its own Roger
Cheng reports apple's next flagship
phone may be incapable of tapping into
higher speeds offered by wireless
carriers why is that you say well you
can point blame at its relationship with
Intel and Qualcomm gigabit LTE will be a
signature feature on many of the
top-tier phones this year but the new
iPhone may not be one of them
that's because Apple designs its own
processors but uses modems from both
Intel and Qualcomm Intel's latest
commercial ready modem won't hit gigabit
LTE speeds which could force Apple to
slow down the Qualcomm version to make
sure all I phones are on the same
footing now the Galaxy s8 can do it and
so will ten other Android phones but
let's rewind and remember the modem
issues from the iPhone 7 and 7 plus C
back then tests showed the Qualcomm
based ones were better performing but on
top of that Qualcomm accused Apple of
limiting them so they would be on par
with the Intel modems now I have an
Intel modem iPhone 7 and I can assure
you it's never performed as well as my
iPhone 6s in these same exact areas I
know it's it from day one gigabit LTE
networks aren't readily available just
yet
t-mobile will be the first with gigabit
LTE this year but how much faster are
they really how about 18 times faster
compared to average speeds based on
tests by open signals so yeah iPhone you
kinda need to get on that now in the
tech world the top specs give you
bragging rights and it would be a key
disadvantage if this is supposed to be
the 10th anniversary flagship iPhone but
again the phones aren't even out so it's
another wait and see situation
alright Powermat CEO Elon dubs insky
says wireless charging will be a
standard feature in the next iPhone was
this a C II no no slip-up or was he just
talking about the rumors he heard now
he's more likely talking about Apple
joining the wireless power consortium
recently because he later followed it up
by saying the company will support
whatever wireless charging protocol
Apple supports now if you knew you
wouldn't be talking like that unless Tim
Cook gave you a scolding now also more
reports claim that the next iPhone is
coming late
this time it's Nikkei that says the
iPhone 8 may not be in customers hands
until late October or November the
report says the OLED panel wireless
charging components and new circuit
boards are some of the reasons behind
the production problems
I say take your time Apple if you really
want to make a statement then you need
to get this one right because there's
that thing called the galaxy s 8 right
now and if you want to look at some more
Duty concepts of what the next iPhone
could look like at least the perfect one
we're hoping for without the touch ID on
the back
Benjamin Gaskin gives us the iPhone most
of you are hoping happens so yeah Apple
make it happen and can you believe it
back-to-back weeks with an I work story
Apple is updated the apps for both Mac
OS and iOS with stability improvements
the update also adds a number keyboard
for the iPad reducing the need to switch
keyboards I even challenged you all on
our Apple bytes extra crunchy audio
podcast to let me know how many of you
actually use I works specifically pages
yeah I got two responses one of them
came from writer Sam Sokol so either not
many of you are really using it as your
go-to or no one listens to the Apple
byte extra crunchy and that's a sad
Apple alright in case you really care
writers reports Apple has delayed their
carpool karaoke spin-off show for the
Apple music service until later this
year without any specific reason Apple
was reportedly set to throw a primer
party last month but the event was also
delayed last minute without an
explanation you know I just think apples
trying to be all mysterious again so we
can care more about this or maybe not
all right that's going to do it for this
week you can email us at the Apple bite
at cnet.com or tweet me at Brian Tong
thanks much for watching we'll catch
y'all next time for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
