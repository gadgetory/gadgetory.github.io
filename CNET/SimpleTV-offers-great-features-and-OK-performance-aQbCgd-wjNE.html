doesn't everyone but in this post VCR
age the experience is switching to over
the air has been fraught with
compromises hi i'm ty pendlebury and
this is a simple TV two devices like the
simple TV aim to do two things a bring
you a DVR with a modern and usable
interface and be enable you to watch
live and recorded TV anywhere on the go
the original simple TV debut on
kickstarter in 2012 and this new version
is a little smaller and it now boasts a
number of improvements including a
larger number of control apps and a dual
tuner this DVR is a cloud device meaning
it can't be connected to a TV directly
and it also lacks a wireless connection
at the back you'll find a coaxial
connector for your antenna as well as a
USB port for a hard drive you'll need to
buy one of those separately as well and
an ethnic port in addition to this
equipment also factor in an annual fee
of sixty dollars or 149 for a lifetime
so it's not the set and forget payment
that the competing channel master DVR
plus offers unless you still own a
blackberry you'll find that your device
is supported with iOS Android Roku
chromecast windows 8 and failing those a
web browser interface according to
simple TV the Android app is the most
stable and especially when compared to
the flaky Windows 8 version it comes
with a full channel guide as well as
handy suggestions based on content like
kids or movies it's easy to use and
fairly fast as well recording quality
though is just ok with some compression
artifacts and aliasing problems on
straight lines and as a result I
wouldn't suggest this if you just plan
to watch it on a TV but watching on a
tablet pc or remote device is quite fine
as far as devices that streaming record
live TV is still one of the cheapest if
not the best device for about one
hundred and ninety nine dollars is spent
