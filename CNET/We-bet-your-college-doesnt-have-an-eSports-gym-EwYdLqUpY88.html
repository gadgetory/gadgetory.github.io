Irvine announced it would offer
scholarships for eSports players this
year it's collaborating with a student
Club on campus to open an eSports
training facility and student lounge a
lot of students play games and support
like eSports it's really cool to be
around an environment of similar
individuals I was expecting a few years
ago I'll just come play with normal
college players but now I'm playing with
great players I'm happy yeah
the facility itself is actually a little
smaller than I expected but it's tricked
out so right here you can see behind me
are these 60 computers super high-end
about hard gaming computers like here is
definitely better than what I have at
home
top-of-the-line equipment the steps are
really nice the room looks really nice
and if students want to pick up a couple
of pointers from the best of the best
they can check out the competition
corner where scholarship athletes will
practice you'll be able to watch them
practice just kind of like how you can
go to the gym and watch your basketball
team practice at any other university in
addition to providing a space where
eSports scholarship athletes can
practice and train UC Irvine also hopes
its student gamers will have an
opportunity to socialise in a way they
haven't before
goal point is that we want to ping
gamers out of their dorms out of home
and come to this arena and play
in-person meet new friends and get that
real-life socialization that people kind
of stigmatize against gamers I get to
help abolish that stereo side to the
Facebook lore which I've always hated
even though this facility was built at
no cost to the University it still has
to make money which is where students
come in any student can come in here
anytime they want obviously during
school hours and pay four dollars an
hour to play on these computers with
their friends with new classmates the
profits from the arena don't just
benefit the facility either we actually
are putting money into the campus so
we're already basically committed a
grant to research and we've also donated
about two thousand dollars to the UCI
hospital to help children with cancer
through a charity called game-changer we
don't want to build a build space that
really meets the needs of the campus and
I think this is gonna be a really good
demo for us to show the campus and show
the world that this is something like
gamers and students across
UCI and across the nation one seat I
want to further my education the most
this is a good way for me to do it while
doing something I love so I guess you
could consider the UC Irvine eSports
arena as a mental gym student athletes
can drop by to get in a quick workout
and other students can stop by socialize
with their friends and also have a
little fun it's the first of its kind
but I have a feeling we'll be seeing a
lot more of these facilities popping up
on campuses across the country in the
future
