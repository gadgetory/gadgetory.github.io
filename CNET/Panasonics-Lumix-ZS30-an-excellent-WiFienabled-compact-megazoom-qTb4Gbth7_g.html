this is a look at the panasonic lumix
DSC cs30 which basically takes the
features and performance of the
excellent CS 20 from 2012 and adds to it
some handy Wi-Fi features so for
starters you still have a nice 20x zoom
lens a 3-inch high-res touchscreen and
inside a 18 megapixel high sensitivity
mah sensor now the sensor combined with
a powerful processor in a high speed
auto focusing system gets you fast
shooting performance and very good photo
and video quality though neither are
significantly better than its
predecessor it's intelligent auto mode
is smart enough to get you the snapshot
you want but you also get fun shooting
modes for filters and effects easy
panoramas and high-speed slow-mo video
and for those who want more control
there are semi manual and manual modes
to controls and use our overall good and
despite its compact size it's
comfortable to use in part because of
the right hand grip the only real issue
here is that the power and Wi-Fi buttons
are a bit too easy to hit accidentally
now like a lot of its competition the
cs30 has built-in GPS and Wi-Fi but
Panasonic's added NFC as well making
pairing and sharing with NFC enabled
Android devices really easy you simply
launch the app and tap the camera to
your phone and a Wi-Fi connection is
established between them the app can be
used for remote control of the camera as
well as viewing and transferring it's
contests to your device you can also tap
to send which is pretty great for those
with Apple devices you get most of the
same features you basically just lose
the NFC stuff there are some minor
nitpicks but in general this is an
impressive compact mega zoom I'm Josh
Goldman and that's the Panasonic Lumix
yes sir</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
