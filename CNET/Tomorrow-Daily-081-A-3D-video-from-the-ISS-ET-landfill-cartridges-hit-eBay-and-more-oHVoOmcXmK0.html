really cool video involving a floating
orb of water and a GoPro those mythical
et cartridges that they dug up in New
Mexico are now available on eBay if you
want one and the eff hopes to revive
abandoned online games wise from yo
grave sera daily
stratum citizen blue internet well Dom
due tomorrow daily the best geek talk
show in the known universe I'm your host
Ashley skele Cal's driving the bus on
the right hand side which means we're in
the UK I'm just kidding we're not but
joining me as always kill anonymous hey
how's it going you sounded like Elmer
Fudd a little bit why is for good wait
for me good I know it's from hunting
webos yeah I know it's not such a that's
a classic it's a classic you're at your
gamer runs deep it does everybody see ok
gamer and me it runs deep and there's
two gaming stories today but they're
like I think everyone can appreciate it
even if of interest I think to most
people yeah one is about like there was
like a like a myth than a theory behind
it well let's not go hey let's not bury
let's not spoil it this does bury the
lead really so let's hit the headlines
so you've ever wondered have you ever
been in microgravity I know the only
time I feel like I've been in not quite
microgravity but you know it's a little
g-force you know those like carnival
rides that spin you in a circle and you
stand against the wall yeah and then it
flings you upwards because there's it's
a centrifugal force thing okay that's
about what you're talking about i know
so anyway the International Space
Station just released this really
awesome video I they put GoPro inside of
an afro ting orb of water which is
really neat so here they are this is a
this is the video that they released
which is pretty cool so here they are
squeezing out some water of course
that's how the astronauts drink water
because he obviously can't just have
like a glass of water it was just float
right out so they created this sphere of
water about the size of a softball and
then they took a GoPro camera and put it
in there which is crazy they're like oh
no no trying to get it yeah there they
kept trying to get it to like sit in
there and then they recorded on the go
prophecy and that's what that's what it
looks like if you're listening you have
to see this clip it gets to watch the
show for this clip because it's pretty
amazing but but here is the even better
part of this video is that they also
released it in 3d and so I brought some
3d glasses I brought some 3d glasses you
get the DC super old with cyan and comic
books and
I'll take the Ninja Turtles glasses okay
so we're gonna put on our glasses and
we're gonna watch the 3d version as if
we're at the Opera Wow look at that oh
wow isn't it cool that you're not really
great so if you have cyan and red 3d
glasses you can actually check this out
over on youtube and you can see this orb
floating right in front of you which is
pretty late your house yeah for free at
your house which I love so much I think
they just need to keep doing more of
this 3d stuff in space I really back
interested in to this me this is this is
what I like so much about this is that
it you know it shows people how things
work in space in microgravity without
you know but still being entertaining
and and all the things so that's a I
just I thought that was so cool and I
love how NASA and the ISS astronauts are
educating but also entertaining us with
all their crazy little videos and a
music video that Chris Hadfield did like
it's back up now it's back up now you
included boy Thank You Bowie you're
welcome Kate so yeah it's uh it's really
cool so that's that was I saw that today
and I thought that was pretty awesome
that's pretty great is it wait what
YouTube channel is it on I believe it's
over on NASA's YouTube okay but you can
look up if you look up ISS gopro water
sphere like it'll it's all over the
internet right sponsored by GoPro huh is
it sponsored by GoPro oh that I don't
know okay I don't know that's a good
question I saw it on a different Channel
so maybe so let me tell you let me tell
you a legend have you heard me a story
have you heard of the legend of the ET
catastrophe I know was the it's widely
considered be the worst game of go so a
long time going back in nineteen
eighty-three they made an ET video game
based on the successful movie okay and
it bombs spectacularly three million
copies were made and so there was a
legend that Atari took all of these
games and buried them in a landfill in
New Mexico well just goodbye yep so long
so they were like they betrayed
Heisenberg and they were on an episode
of ranking badges yeah they read about
the desk at the fishes so so obviously
somebody wanted to know if this actually
happened so they started a documentary I
think was called was it called dig I
know I know yeah Xbox did this the dig
the dig yes so they said they said to go
and see if they were there and sure
enough they found all the cartridges
along with some additional games missile
commander warlords star raiders and
centipede yeah they found a ton of games
that is pretty go so now after all of
this you know obviously the document is
gonna come out on a spot i remember
hearing about this earlier this year
that there were in fact ET cartridges
yeah those fresh cartridge some some
that were just cartridges and some that
were in their box and hipsters enjoy
them look at that um but anyway so now
now you can actually buy one of those
cartridges that they dug up on ebay a
landfill yeah the landfills soul et
Atari 2600 yes yeah yeah that is pretty
amazing I really want much am I gonna
pay for this so if i want to go buy one
all right you were you really want to
know in box five hundred dollars I
wouldn't know you can't even play them
it's good dirt no you could probably go
online find an emulator and play it I
don't know it I guess it's a piece of
history yeah it's one of the biggest
gaming legends of all time so they've
got a few of them they've got 20 copies
of them in the in the box and then they
ate so they're gonna sell 60 to 70 that
are outside the box but if you're a
memorabilia like a gaming memorabilia
collector this you got to have this yeah
this is kind of laid out your five
hundred dollar bill this is kind of like
those limited edition Back to the Future
Nike Air Mags that they sold a couple
years ago and the proceeds went to
charity and I guess this like as far as
I'm aware of the city of Alamogordo
which is where the landfill is which is
a great name for the mobile Alamogordo
um they are I am not sure where the
proceeds of us are going to but I do
know that it's going to the city so
hopefully they will disperse that too
maybe kids or you know program special
programs whenever there was they give it
to like child's play which is the the
gaming charity yeah that would be super
amazing um but yeah so I like I really
like that this is kind of a super lovey
I mean if you want one of these this is
like you said it's a piece of gaming
history but it's a huge cuz it was a
myth for the longest time yeah well
there were you were just whispers of
like this crazy event that happen cuz
we're going to think about what a crazy
thing that a company would just be like
whoa screwed up let's bury all of our
gay
let's throw them out it know what I am
filled yeah just just hide it forever
instead of like just you know giving
them to people for freedom unreal to me
okay so that brings me okay this is the
question of the day that I think so we
want you guys to use the hashtag TT
trash and I think you guys got to tell
us what game should be buried in a
landfill forgotten fresco give one game
we want just stricken from drinking
surface of the earth stricken from the
record put underground what game then
just to be discovered in like 20 years
yeah 30 30 years ya know maybe even just
to never potentially be discovered again
they may never get to see a road like it
just disperses it a good so what about
yours what are you I think I gotta go
with you annoyed oh yeah you know it its
heritage people with a yo-yo it's so
based off of dominoes p I have lots of
Domino's Pizza feeling what a caveman
game like five years ago it's just no no
no dough yo noise that's what I would
back out the back when that you can
throw I was gonna say cool spot but I
think cool spot was pretty good yeah
that was it a 7-up spot one yeah it's
all back when they had all the game time
I don't can't believe they didn't make a
chester Cheetah game anyway we're
getting off shocking uh mine would be
the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for
SNES because it was painfully difficult
and when your Excuse one was really hard
you're so hard there were alleges that
you just couldn't jump to and you had to
and there's the water level anytime as a
water lock this was the word notice went
through and there's the electric plants
that you have a verte oh and you have to
stop and it like and I enjoyed the NES
game so much that I remember being
really excited about the SNES game and
then I was very frustrated ya know they
were all they're all pretty tough but
that one really in particular was yeah
Michelangelo's little like thing only
like reach like this far so you get real
close to the end of terrace with
nunchucks yeah that's the worst alright
so what do you guys think what is it
what are the things that you would bury
underground let's get rid of what game
would you bury in a landfill every copy
we just get rid of every copy of the
game just scary someone's gonna troll
someone's gonna be like someone's gonna
be dirty well total five yeah I know you
terrible people um ok so our third our
third story today is also about games I
found this very very interesting so the
eff is the electronic frontier
foundation they tend to fight for things
like
did stop sopa stops espa like all of
these sort of they fight for net
neutrality like they fight for the user
if if i were to speak in Tron isms they
fight for the user so one of the worst
things about playing a game on the
internet is you never know when support
for that game is going to get yanked
like you have no idea because you play a
game on let's say a previous gen console
like mario kart for wii it's really fun
to play that online game but at some
point Nintendo is gonna pull the plug on
that support and this is Star Wars
Galaxies this was the very last moments
of some of these games yeah like halo 2
people work for matrix yeah hello to I
mean there's all kinds of online games
that that are were unable to play them
now with other people because unless
you're in the same house because of
support going away for these games
there's a very tiny yeah play it on your
part damn center of your phone so the
neat thing about this about the eff is
that they have petitioned to make an
exception on the DCM a ban of what's
called the circumvention of access
control technologies so what they're
saying is they want to make games that
have online components exempt from this
part of the DC ma that would make it I
guess legal or acceptable for people to
run third-party servers for games like
Halo 2 and mario kart for wii and you
wouldn't have to authenticate or
otherwise check in with Nintendo servers
or whoever's buns new servers whatever
to be able to play those games online
like a third party could in like in
effect start their own server and have
multiplayer matches so this is this is
protecting idea that if I was like I
want to play halo 2 but i can't play
online let me just modify you know let
me know game code so i can host my own
server my friends can join or right and
that would this exception that they're
real cool it's really awesome but
they're asking for would make it legal
to do that and it wouldn't believe you
yeah which is pretty cool well I'm yeah
I'm like I don't have the controversial
opinion so I'm just gonna you have go do
it I think it's okay for some of these
to like just just dived on I do just to
kind of have like their 30 that's time
their their moment and
and like I know there's a community but
there's a community for everything I
don't disagree with that and we can we
can move on and move forward I mean like
right there shouldn't be an 80 year old
man playing Star Wars Galaxies like
crack 80 years like right it prompts
progress like I arsonist so much to let
go of but it's like you know that as a
moment like I go back that's part of
this stuff yeah if I can you imagine
still playing runescape and it's like
state right now but like in 40 years
know like they won't world of warcraft
to keep going i'd like a blizzard said
earlier this week they're like we want
Wow to be until 2024 we want that game
to still be going so that 10 more years
they want to go it's our 10-year
anniversary this year it's crazy what
they doing it a massive graphical update
now we're getting often yes I now we're
in off a tangible talk about that after
the show but we're going to take a quick
break we'll be right back we would back
at her Hackett and your user feedback
and a fantastic phone time for the day
so don't click away stir bar daily
okay we are back and speaking of the
word back it's time as we do every week
to talk about a Kickstarter crowd fund
and IndieGoGo wherever we find it of
something really cool that we thought
was you know worthy of our time and
yours so it is time for back at our
hackett so I feel like uh I feel like we
might have to change it though because
there's always something cool on exact
like nothing yeah maybe one maybe a half
one so I feel like maybe it's just like
hey back this um okay so kale you are
always complaining about with virtual
reality can't see your hands yeah you
can't see your hands and that really
takes you out of it yeah cuz you're like
I'm in this world oh wait I'm not
instantly so the folks over at nimble VR
feel the exact same way as you and so
they have developed the nimble sense
which is a way to bring your hands into
virtual reality gaming okay yeah okay
let's go so here's hear it here he is
this is an accessory that's optimized
for the oculus rift but where there's
his hand right there and he's like 'no
candle um he they also claim though that
it's flexible with other virtual reality
headsets so you might be able to develop
for something else but for the most part
it's developed for the oculus rift
seeing as that's how the main big served
virtual reality how was it how was it
reading his hands okay he's not wearing
gloves or anything no it's a camera see
it on top of the oculus rift it mounts
on the top and so these guys at nimble
this is pretty impressive these guys
have been working on this type of
tracking for years since before the
first connect these guys have been
working on this type of technology for a
long time and what they're doing is its
depth sensing with a 110 degree view
which is wider than the oculus rift dk2
and their skeletal hand tracking
software is extremely flexible I know
you're so excited well because it's I'm
sorry to interrupt but like it's reading
their hands really really well yeah and
so they basically talked about how
connect is like one of the few like that
level of technology is the type of tech
that you're going to need to
able to read the dexterity of your hands
and so that's the type of stuff that's
in this headset camera okay so it's a
camera it's very small it's not very big
at all this is a demo that we're seeing
but there's also there's a Kickstarter
video where they show a little bit more
of like exactly like how they've
developed it here you go here's the
dexterity that's how good the dexterity
is oh my god alright crazy and I've seen
leap motion but like this is like no way
deal this is yeah this is beyond so this
is like having a connect on the top of
but a very small connect on the top of
your oculus rift and then and then on
top of that specialized software that
takes advantage of that specific
tracking technology okay so they're
asking for backing to make this they
want to make public yeah they want to
make this public I would ship in june of
next year if you back it and here's
here's the best part well there's
employees at this company who have
worked for ILM Pixar the graduates from
MIT like these are legit engineers and
coders and I mean these are brilliant
people working on right yeah they have
to be uh if you want one you will pay
ninety nine dollars what yeah
ninety-nine bucks you get the camera and
one DK to mount for the oculus rift
that's it but if you want mounts for
other things like they have different
types of 3d printed mounts that you can
buy it costs like 129 like 110 they have
like different kind of just not very
much more than ninety nine dollars but
they have that they also have a
developer kit for a game studio that
comes with like a couple different
cameras and stuff and I think that's 300
mm so still so really reasonable really
really reasonable and you get the camera
the mount and open-source demos that the
demos that they are showing right yeah
so that you can see how the technology
works I'm like code like basically
you've modified on yourself which is
really how much do they need um they're
already a hundred there RT it's like it
ya like 37 days left like it just went
up a few days ago and it's already 100
sent back but you should definitely get
in on this if you really like virtual
reality you wouldn't you if you're a
coder on this something that's really
inexpensive to kind of jump in with so I
I say why not I say back as before it
was just virtual see a Latino it's
virtual reality
yeah I exact okay cool yeah I'm totally
all for that for sure again I thought
you'd be excited I'm super excited about
it because it didn't think it was gonna
look that good but if that's gonna be
like out of it yeah now what is its full
like capture it's crazy it's really good
really good damn you should really like
the way they were nimble since they the
way they were showing it looks like it
would be more point and click adventure
type you know doing surgeons I could
just play like 11th hour with my like do
the blood and honey puzzle I'll make
sure I love that so much looks but yeah
so that's our backer Hackett obviously
pretty good um you guys I know will be
interested in that so if you want to get
in on that I believe it's like I said
jun 2015 they'll be shipping i watch i
am curious to see how they're gonna deal
with the retail version of oculus though
like is it gonna be that they'll wait to
ship until they have a retail version or
is it it or if maybe I don't know I
don't know how they're gonna deal with
that because they are in kind of a weird
area right now time frame where they're
kind of coming up against a retail
oculus so I don't know we'll see i'm
still team oculus I know re competitors
it's like building on it so much more
hey well it's gonna be the thing that
has all the accessories and everyone's
gonna want to make stuff for it so I'm
for a new king maybe yeah um alright
well that being said it is time for your
user feedback once it comes down in bed
just in case somebody says something I
don't like you don't like and you dumped
motivation no no no I don't like glory
all right so um yesterday I actually did
not mention the hashtag of the day I
forgot but it was in the show it was a
TD 3001 we wanted people's feedback on
3001 oh the Space Odyssey oh yeah yeah
series it really Scott was doing
somebody did pick up on that though I
want to say that this is probably our
most engaged viewer who's actually
paying attention during the show
linnemann high fives he says hashtag
through TD 3001 you should read
2001-2010 2061 and 3001 but i'm worried
i love the books yeah i mean i think
it's i think it's only natural to be
worried yeah
cautiously optimistic is how I feel
right I'm not I'm not not gonna jump on
the hype train without thinking about it
but I'm optimistic a little feeling
cautious but optimistic at least they
have the backing of everybody that was
kind of like it like involved a little
bit so at least they're the F folders
wave annex and brick and Clark's it's
amazing so it's not like they're gonna
cram everything down they provide time
to tell the story they can tell a little
slow I like that I mean I that's that
could be really good many serious is
kind of a sexy word known didn't know it
is people really love the miniseries
right now and then we actually got one
not about 3,000 won this is from Jordan
who said sorry Ashley sceva you did not
get the role of Steve Jobs congrats kill
anonymous you win and photoshopped our
faces in deceive John beard and honestly
I think I'm gonna I think I'm gonna grow
beard that five o'clock shadow is
looking pretty great um those glasses
look spectacular on you kill we actually
uh we actually look pretty good I look
like a monkey like the ear is though but
that Steve Jobs is here that's not my oh
my hair sits lower on my face guys oh
