Darth Maul he's right where sky have you
fantasized about owning a lightsaber
wanna battle holographic stormtroopers
Sith Lords and battle droids and play
hollow chests Star Wars Jedi battles may
be the crazy novelty AR headset for you
Lenovo's clever toy made in partnership
with Disney combines a headset Bluetooth
connected lightsaber and a glowing flora
sensor it requires your phone though
a handful of iPhones and Android phones
are supported but check for
compatibility it's annoying to set up
you're gonna need to load an app sync
the gear attach a dongle and slide your
phone into the headset which has its own
battery that also needs charger but once
it's all set up you're suddenly seeing
3d holograms in your room almost like a
budget version of microsoft hololens yes
they overlap with furniture and things
but still Darth Maul will fight you and
it's pretty wild when you start up your
lightsaber and see a holographic blade
extend into the air oh wow ok three game
modes over several worlds have you
either lightsaber battling playing tower
defense games with miniature troops on
your floor or playing rounds of hollow
chest puzzles like that one that's on
the Millennium Falcon
we had people who've never tried it
before and someone who's never even seen
Star Wars play a few rounds oh he's
doing the double blade keep smacking
them across the face with my lightsaber
that's so satisfying verdict fun but the
setup and the price which is 200 dollars
could be drawbacks
it's a crazy-cool geek toy but it's also
a sign that a our headsets could be the
next big toy next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
