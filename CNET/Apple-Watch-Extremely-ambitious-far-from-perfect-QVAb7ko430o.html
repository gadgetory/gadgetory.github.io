what does it feel like is the second you
need well apples watch is part of a
growing landscape called smart watches
that are in this umbrella of wearable
tech these things are accessories to
your phone and Apple's only works with
iPhone 5 or later so it's going to get
messages and other things from your
phone but it also works kind of like a
standalone iPod Apple pushes three
different types of core functions on the
Apple watch
Communications Fitness and notifications
now notifications and glances which is
the other term for these little widget
like apps are like widgets those
functions on your iPhone that you get
for your pulldown menu right next to
your notifications they're like smarter
mini apps you can check information like
sports scores or weather updates or
tweets now underneath all that there are
also full apps and that looks like a
grid of iPhone apps except they're
circles and you launch them a lot of
them are living on your iPhone as well
and they're kind of cross loading so
they take a little time to load but you
can get some boiled down simple
functions like looking at tweets and
even responding to tweets and a lot of
different fitness apps including apples
core apps their fitness apps are
probably the most advanced on any
SmartWatch they work a lot like what you
get on a Fitbit or some sort of a Nike
FuelBand they look at you're walking
you're running it has a heart rate
monitor built in and it will work with
GPS on your phone and it does a lot of
communication functions this thing will
act as a speakerphone when paired with
your iPhone it will also enable you to
send texts to dictate audio messages or
to send crazy animated emoji that if you
find another Apple watch owner you can
send a little doodle to them like this
or you can send love taps or hold your
fingers here and send your heart rate
and did I mention this thing is
basically like an iPod you can store two
gigs of music on this that sink over
from your phone and you can listen to
them if you have Bluetooth headphones
kind of like an iPod except there is no
headphone jack here and it has Apple pay
so you can pay for things that terminals
even when you're away from your iPhone
the Apple watch comes in a range of
prices from $350 up to 17 thousand but
they all do the same
inside they all have eight gigs of
internal storage of which you can access
around six and you're really paying for
the design of the band and the materials
this is a steel one forty two
millimeters with a white Floresta mer
band this is six hundred dollars and the
one I tried with a stainless steel link
band a thousand dollars that's crazy
expensive and they go all the way up to
ten thousand seventeen thousand for the
gold watch you're not gonna get the
Apple watch is also hindered by its
battery life the battery life lasts no
longer than a day that's lower than most
other smartwatches out there and I like
wearing a watch at night so I really
like to be able to use it at night for
silent alarms or to check what the time
is or to do sleep tracking you can't do
that
so who's the Apple watch for after
wearing one for a while that's still a
good question I'm not exactly sure and
that's the problem with it it's an
iPhone accessory because you need an
iPhone it's battery life is not great
and it's very expensive but if you're
interested in exploring this and you
want to spend $350 on an entry-level
model it's possibly a toy that could
appeal to some people
