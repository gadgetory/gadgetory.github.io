form factor reference design called
north cape and it's in a full ultrabook
experience a 17 millimeter ultrabook it
has a battery both underneath the
keyboard as well as behind the display
and the CPU here actually sits behind
the display this is going to deliver an
amazing 13 hours of battery life so
think about the average notebook
sometimes taking about four hours of
battery life we're talking about
delivering 13 hours of battery life as a
full system but what's unique about this
is we've created a one-finger detach
mechanism that you can simply remove the
keyboard and we've got an amazing tablet
experience here 850 gram core i5 i7
capable machine at 10 millimeters it's
going to deliver up to 10 hours of
battery life so it has a one-handed
attach mechanism and what's interesting
is we've created something called smart
frame so this is essentially 11.6 inch
form factor but we're able to do is hit
a little button here and this screen
increases to a full 13-3 screen so you
get a full 13-3 screen experience in 11
6 by using some things around our
graphics drivers and if I if I test this
here will kind of play a high-end racing
game if I'm any good at it I guess I'm
not but this is something where you now
can get with accelerometers and all of
the sensors that were typically only
available in notebooks something that
already on third generation core from
Acer and Lenovo we showed is five times
the performance of a Tegra 3 and now I
was going to get even better as we
launch this later this year
