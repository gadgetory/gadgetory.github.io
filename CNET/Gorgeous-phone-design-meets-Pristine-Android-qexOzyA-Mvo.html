and i've got a treat for you today
android fans here in my hands is the HTC
One Google Play edition essentially it
flaunts all the premium style of the
standard HTC One but instead of HTC
Sense UI layered over Android this phone
runs clean and adulterated android for
got to to jellybean that's currently the
most recent version of Google's mobile
software even better google says at the
HTC One Google Play edition gpe for
short qualifies as a true nexus class
handset that means it will be first in
line to receive fresh Android updates as
they roll out just like other Nexus
phones this all sounds pretty sweet but
the HTC One GPE will cost a lot of dough
up front 599 dollars to be exact google
plans to sell the device directly
through its google play store and the
phone should hit shelves by july 9th so
what does all this cash net you first
you get oodles of premium design and
build quality courtesy of the HTC one's
now-iconic all aluminum chassis what's
really different here though is the
software this phone runs with the
freshest version of Android jelly bean
yet the 1g PE has a clean simple
interface that's nimble and responsive
there's no carrier bloatware dodgy
third-party apps anywhere to be found
either to be clear though you do miss
out on all the slick innovations in HTC
sense such as the Zoe share and video
highlight camera features the TV remote
app that uses the ones IR blaster and
useful weather and messaging
notifications blinkfeed has gone to but
I doubt its absence will cause a riot
the jelly bean camera app isn't that
bare bones it features an HDR mode a
number of scene modes manual white
balance and exposure controls all in an
arc shape you I you also have the
photosphere feature which such as images
into 360Â° panoramas plus an ordinary
horizontal panorama mode google says
that the unlocked HTC One GPE which runs
on gsm cellular networks will accept SIM
cards from t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T it is also
designed to grab 4G LTE signals
if available I'm Brian Bennett for
cnet.com and this has been a first look
at the HTC One Google Play edition is it
the ultimate combination of smartphone
hardware and software be sure to check
back soon for a full review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
