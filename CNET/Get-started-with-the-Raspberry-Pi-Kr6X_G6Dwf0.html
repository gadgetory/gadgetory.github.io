home
how about build a robot or maybe just
create a media center for all of your
content all of these projects start with
this $35 micro computer known as a
Raspberry Pi originally designed to
teach students about computer science
this single board computer has become
one of the hottest items for tech
hobbyists and is now powering a number
of DIY projects the first thing you'll
notice is the size the Raspberry Pi is
slightly larger than a credit card it
ships as is and doesn't include a case a
power supply or even a hard drive the
device is equipped with a single core
700 megahertz processor and has 512
megabytes of RAM it also includes an
HDMI port an analog composite output for
older TVs at 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack 2 USB ports an SD card slot and an
Ethernet port now a cheaper model is
available for $25 that removes one of
the USB ports the Ethernet port and cuts
the RAM in half for $10 extra I highly
recommend going with the $35 model B
that's what we have here to minimize the
risk of damaging the device with
electrostatic discharge its best to
touch a grounded piece of metal before
handling the Raspberry Pi you should
also avoid handling it while it's
powered on different projects require
different components but the basic
requirements include a 4-day byte class
4 SD card or better for storage and a
power supply capable of producing seven
hundred milliamps at 5 volts in most
cases a smartphone or tablet charger
should get the job done but make sure to
check the output on the charger first
other items you'll need include a USB
keyboard and a mouse and Ethernet cable
or a USB wireless adapter a monitor an
HDMI cable and if your computer doesn't
have one you also need an SD card reader
I also recommend using a USB hub in case
you want to connect more components like
a flash drive or an external hard drive
but a word of caution the more items you
have connected the device will need more
power for more information about the
Raspberry Pi and to learn how to install
operating system on the device be sure
