only one thing I want to talk about this
week it is super exciting Microsoft just
announced Xbox all-access this is a
subscription service that they're gonna
start testing out and it's interesting
because it's not just services and free
games in a library this thing includes a
console we here at Stream economy
figured we would try to help you decide
whether it was worth it or not and also
what it means for the future of the
games industry obviously you're gonna
want to know some details about this so
let's discuss first question of course
how much will this cost you well if you
would like an Xbox one S you're gonna
pay $22 a month under Xbox all-access if
you think you're ready for the upgrade
and you want to go for the Xbox one X
that'll set you back $35 a month if you
think this is a really good way to
subscribe get an Xbox play the new Tomb
Raider for a month and then send it back
and cancel your subscription think again
it's a two-year agreement there are some
good benefits here though the agreement
also includes xbox live which includes
online multiplayer gaming access movies
TV shows and discounts on certain Xbox
games and game paths which is a huge
library of hundreds of Xbox one and
backwards compatible Xbox 360 games you
can download and play now that we know
what you'll be paying if you decide to
subscribe we should talk about how much
you might save so if you get an Xbox 1s
or an Xbox one X including all of those
services it will cost you six hundred
fifty eight dollars for the Xbox one s
over two years and eight hundred and
thirty-eight dollars for two years with
an Xbox one X if you do it under all
access it's five hundred twenty eight
dollars and seven hundred and seventy
dollars so a pretty decent savings one
hundred and thirty bucks on Xbox one s
over two years and sixty eight dollars
are a little bit more on the Xbox one X
which I know doesn't seem like a whole
lot but honestly that's at least one
game and maybe even a whole bunch of
Indies if that's what you're into and
lastly if you're wondering if you own
the console when the subscription is up
you sure do there's no sending it back
or paying off a final balance on a
rental that sounds amazing right well
not quite so there are some downsides as
with mostly everything in the world if
you are not interested in using Xbox
Live or game pass well you're kind of
Sol because you're gonna have to pay for
it if you sign up for this agreement and
that also applies to your Xbox let's say
you sign up for the agreement and you're
paying your subscription and you decide
well I'm just gonna let this xbox sit
and collect dust on my shelf because
there are no games I'm interested in
right now well that's a waste of your
money too so if you're only interested
in one game that might be a console
exclusive all-access might not be the
Xbox for you so on top of that there's
one more hitch that isn't actually my
biggest complaint and that is it's only
available in the United States so if you
are anywhere else in the world that
sucks
I know but even if you are in the US
you're probably cheering right now hold
off on that put a pin in that cheering
for just a couple seconds you actually
have to physically travel to it that is
not a Microsoft store that is also not a
Microsoft store that nope Sony that's a
Microsoft store you have to go to a
physical Microsoft store location to get
this agreement to be able to sign up and
get your console unfortunately that's
easier said than done
thirty-five states have at least one
Microsoft Store sure but 15 states have
that's right zero sorry everyone who
lives over in this area you have really
nice views outside though if that's any
consolation no it really isn't is it on
top of that if you're anybody in any of
these states with limited amounts of
money which is why you are probably
interested in this deal in the first
place having to spend it to travel to a
Microsoft store to get a cheaper console
might end up not being cheaper at all so
look I don't like that okay
Xbox all-access I think Microsoft has a
great idea here but it needs to be
rolled out on the internet or
internationally in some way and I'm sure
there's a lot of work that goes into
that I'm not saying it's super easy but
I hope Microsoft does put in the work I
want
top of that I think Microsoft is going
to kind of prompt other gaming consoles
to offer the same types of things I
would not be surprised if Sony offered
something very similar for the
PlayStation 4 or maybe a future
PlayStation now as for the switch it is
only $2.99 as opposed to the other
consoles higher price points but the
Xbox one s is also the same price so I
can't imagine Nintendo even just
considering the idea even if they don't
do it those are my thoughts on
Microsoft's Xbox All Access subscription
now it's your turn I want you to go down
to the comments I want you to tell me
what you think about this new idea that
Microsoft's testing out are you angry
because you don't live in the u.s. are
you mad because you live in Montana and
you can't get to a Microsoft Store or
are you super excited about it you can't
wait to try it out I can't wait to talk
to you now that we're on the subject of
consoles hey Sarah

Bryan's don't sale everyone you like
