behind me you're looking at a lot of
people here with these lovely glasses
these are passive glasses we're here in
the LG booth are you guys want me what
they're looking at maybe we should just
take a look back and oh look at all that
multiple screen raised all in 3d but
this is this is just the entrance to the
LG booth then also we're obviously
flashing our hot little mike stick flags
from our friends head in video nametags
calm we were the only place in the house
with something that's sweet so you guys
definitely wanna check it out but let's
go inside of LG's booth and see some of
the cool technology one of the hottest
things that everyone's been talking
about is there Oh LED TV that will be
coming out this year so you can see the
massive crowd this is CES when CES is
live in full effect so let's just can't
take a step back here it's going to get
a little you know little crowded nitty
and gritty so let's go check it out all
right all right this is the world's
largest o le DTV 55 inches way we're
gonna try and get in a spot where you
guys can see it better let's come over
here Charlie here we go right over here
so there we go four millimeters thin Oh
LED TV true blacks 3d passive TZ this is
the hottest television set out here at
CES right now everyone is going gaga
over and all the circuitry in the
connections are down on the bottom but
you can see the crowd here around it
everybody is pretty much drooling over
this thing everyone from the outside
goes on the inside so we'll wrap around
and kind of get another better look at
it but while we're in LG's booth we're
gonna also check out over here this is
their LG Smart TV now what makes this
unique this is the LM 9600 series LG's
known for their magic remote this is the
kind of like is the remote that was very
similar to a Wii mode they had had the
wii controller activity but they really
amped it up a bit so we can we're gonna
try and scoot in here and get a second
here we go that gentleman over there
he's using the wiimote there sorry
excuse me the magic remote and this is a
new interface we saw it you know it was
a little more primitive last time but
they made a lot of improvements to it
now at the tip of the remote you'll be
able to do voice search there's a
full-on browser with the alum 9600
series this is a TV that supports both
HTML and flash content through the web
browser you'll be able to view your hulu
content it won't be blocked but it's on
there you go this is the menu navigation
of the LG Smart TV and again when you're
using this magic remote it's it's a
pointer it makes it that easy they a lot
of companies are doing this connect body
gestures and voice recognition to
control the TV the this remote
application is a lot more responsive
works a lot better so let's kind of head
over here and show you some of the other
cool things that LG is doing this over
here this is their 3d game experience
now what makes this unique is LG is
selling their own camera that you can
find right below the TV it looks a lot
like Kinect camera but that's not a
Kinect camera that's their own branded
camera we talk about everyone getting
locked into the ecosystem LG will also
be having you give you the ability to
purchase apps directly through their
store this is a favorite fruit ninja
slice and dice in going out over there
alright so we're gonna take one more
last look just to wrap this up over here
I know see this is this is the zoo that
is CES 2012 let's just get one more
really good look at the O LED TV this is
the 55 inch LED TV from LG 4 millimeters
thin beautiful color true blacks organic
LED hot stuff so there you have it guys
we're gonna wrap things up when we come
back we'll show you some highlights from
C bombers keynote but there you have it
another look on the floor the crazy
floor that is in LG's booth I'm Brian
