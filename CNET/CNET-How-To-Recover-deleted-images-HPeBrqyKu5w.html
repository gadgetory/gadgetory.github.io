everything on your memory card or
there's been some sort of corruption
issue then you're going to need to know
how to recover images from your camera's
memory card I'm Alexis Avedis from
seenot and I'm going to show you how
whether you run a PC or a Mac so the
first thing you'll need to do is get a
piece of software that it's designed for
recovering photos or any other type of
file for this how-to I'm going to be
using recover on Windows and photorec on
Mac let's get started with Windows and
the PC first start recover on your PC it
will give you a step-by-step walkthrough
on how to get your files back we'll need
to choose pictures from the file type
we're looking for and then choose the
location of where your memory card is
mounted find this select the DCIM folder
if needed press ok and walk through the
next step
this will then start the actual recovery
process
now when recover has found some files on
your memory card it will pop them up in
a window like so you can then select
them and walk through the next screen to
recover them if you want but there are
some more advanced options if you want
to find things like RAW files if you
want to do this and they're not selected
by default in this search box all you'll
need to do is just add the file
extension to the end for example if
you're looking for Canon files it's
generally crw or cr2 but check your
camera manual for other brands and of
course the file extensions as applicable
so once you've run that search once more
hopefully we'll find a bunch of
different files to recover then once
you've selected those particular files
you want to restore it's pretty easy all
you have to do is just press recover
then make sure to backup those files to
a separate location not on the memory
card itself again and then you will
actually have all those files back to
normal fingers crossed now let's move
over to Mac and photorec photorec runs
in terminal but don't let this put you
off because it's still pretty simple to
use first you'll need to choose the
location of your memory card once you've
done this the next screen will prompt
you to find what partition you want to
search and choose fat16
4:32 press ENTER again to proceed and
then you want to select other once
you've got to this stage you'll either
need to choose free to look for the
basically all the files on the card or
whole now you'll only choose whole if
you suspect the card is being corrupted
so in this will example I know that I've
just deleted the files by accident so
I'm going to choose free once that
happens then you get to choose the
location of where you want to backup
those files to I've created a separate
folder in my pictures folder called
recovered photos choose this and then
press C to continue photorec is going to
show every single file type that's on
your memory card that it can find this
includes text photos videos mp3s every
single thing if you want to limit that
to just images and JPEGs and RAW files
for example you can do that in the file
settings once that's all run again you
will be able to find all those recovered
images in a folder within finder so
that's been a quick way on how to
recover photos from your memory card
fingers cross this works for you make
