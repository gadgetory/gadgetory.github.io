it's episode 330 of the 359 podcast I'm
BVG and your host today are Alfred Inge
and Ben Fox Rubin hello what up this is
our last full live week of the podcast
for the year but we'll try to get some
nice evergreen shows up for you in the
interim until we come back for the CES
time frame but we have a very nice story
for you today or a very nice podcast
we're gonna be talking all about Apple
our very own sharra tip consider story
just looking at what to expect from
Apple in the new year in 2018 so we'll
run through a bunch of those and
anything else you want to say nope I'm
just here to talk about Apple yeah
nothing else anyway let's get to the
podcast send in your questions and
comments BVG we'll get to as many as you
can at the end of the show and let's
let's start the podcast off all right
thanks for joining us everyone we're
gonna get four minutes worth of recorded
headlines that are actually worth your
time and then you might want to leave so
no just kidding after that hang out in
the chat we'll take questions and
comments we'll be starting in three two
welcome another 3:59 I'm Ben Fox ribbon
I'm alfred hang our Apple beat reporter
shark tip can publish a story today that
looked at what we might expect from the
tech heavyweight in the new year let's
start off with the iPhone she mentions
that there are early rumors that there
are gonna be three count'em three
different versions of the iPhone 10 and
a new iPhone X se next year with Apple
expanding its phone line up even more
does this mean there are like way too
many phones now I completely welcome it
I think that you know more companies
should be going with that model I know
Samsung definitely does oh they
absolutely do yeah I mean Google hasn't
really followed that yet when they have
you know just the pixel and then the
pixel XL but I completely welcome it I
actually really like the iPhone se I do
hope they continue to make like smaller
models I do hope that they don't go like
too much with like iPhone 10 extreme 5
or whatever where it's got like a 10
active yeah something like that
yeah Samsung does that I don't think
there's ever such a thing as too many
products
especially when it comes to Apple
because they're not like Android devices
where you know all the updates are
fragmented I have a relatively old
iPhone and it still gets like the latest
updates which is like not androids motif
at all okay maybe I'm approaching this
from two philosophical a perspective but
the original iPhone something cool about
it was that if you are willing to pay
the money for it
you could be an athlete or a movie star
or just some some regular kid like me
you've all got the same iPhone I mean
something is lost when you have
something like the se or some of the
cheaper phones that are like three
hundred and fifty dollars and then other
people that can afford it and want to
pay for it can pay over a thousand
dollars well over a thousand dollars for
the iPhones I'm sorry I've never felt a
unity with other people you don't you
don't like pull out the iPhone and say
like hey we're both my own that's how
that's how I met my wife also 2018 could
be a big year for Siri Apple's home pod
smart speaker is slated to come out next
year after it was delayed of course with
Siri hopefully becoming a more capable
voice assistant in the device
the problem is with Siri is that it's
still not that good so we'll see if that
out yeah you've been following this
extensive way too because you cover
Amazon with their echo so I I think you
know a thing or two about you know
artificial intelligence and voice voice
assistance I mean I don't really know
what to expect all I've been covering
from the privacy aspect and I will say
it is definitely the most like private
you can get as far as like yeah smart
absolutely yeah they don't they don't
take your information the same way
Amazon and Google though the problem
there and correct me if I'm wrong here
is that a lot of that data that Amazon
and Google do take they use to improve
their voice assistance and they're smart
speakers so if Apple isn't doing that
yeah you gain something on the privacy
end but it's possible yes you're gonna
have to see what people would people
prefer then you know when it comes to
market next year yeah
next up augmented reality Apple is
rumored to be working on a are goggles
and CEO Tim Cook keeps talking up the
huge potential of AR
would you wear Apple a argument goggles
I mean I've been known to wear a
spectacle or two so I might might where
they are goggles I don't think my phone
would be capable of handling like I'd
have to probably get a new phone to use
them mm-hmm
and I don't to me that's not worth it I
will say that AR with the iPhone 10 and
like future lines in 2018 is probably
the thing that I'm excited about the
most for Apple I think that augmented
reality is probably you know where
they're gonna be doing a lot of their
bigger developments I think there's only
so much you can do as far as like
developing hardware you can say and I
think with augmented reality that's it's
gonna be a whole like new playing field
for them yeah well I'm still skeptical
whether people are gonna want to have
this on their face at all times with the
goggles but we'll see what the potential
about that goggle just pulling your
phone out like oh yeah yeah and we're
seeing some of that already yeah iOS 11
with a little time we have left last is
a touch screen Mac coming this is
something that a lot of people have been
hoping for for years maybe 2018 will be
the happen I don't think it's gonna come
only because it will cannibalize from
their iPad pro mmm-hmm lineup but
they've been known to cannibalize from
themselves like I'm over all over 2017
when you see the iPhone 8 plus and then
the iPhone 10 so there's a possibility
you could have you know something like
macbook X with the touch screen and then
also the iPad pro yeah I don't see it
coming if they were gonna do it they
probably would have done it by now but
Tim Cook if you're listening why don't
you just update the MacBook Air that's
what I really want you to join us on the
podcast Timmy yeah if you want to read
more about these stories check us out on
CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred a
thanks for listening trying to think of
like a clever new name for the iPhone 11
- beta / iPhone X - it's so good do that
now that's Final Fantasy 10 - it's no
it's x-men United is that is it X -
their X - x-men United okay what weather
X 2 s are there Megaman X - you guys
came up with three already I'm very
impressed but I don't think they're
gonna do that because they call it the
iPhone
10 they don't call it the iPhone X they
should I don't know whatever I I
repeatedly called it the iPhone acts
until I was shamed on
I don't know Twitter and by other tech
elite I'm not able to be iPhone 10
whatever
either way got through a lot in four
minutes or actually I don't know longer
than four it was a little longer than
four minutes sorry I started the timer a
little late this time so yeah anyway do
you have any questions or we can talk
and I'm just starting to dig through the
questions in comments there's a lot
piling in so I'm gonna try to dig out
some good stuff to spark a conversation
in the meantime I don't know what do you
guys doing well then I don't play the AR
thing too much I feel like could I mean
that's what I'm excited about the most
that's a quick turnaround for you know
I'm like personally excited about AR the
Mo's but I I wonder if like other people
feel the same way like I like it there's
a lot of potential with AR but I I don't
I don't disagree they like to kind of
visit that I just think cuz like I'm not
excited about anything yeah like
obviously there's going to be upgrades
where it's you know faster better camera
you know better security all this stuff
but like to me that AR is probably the
biggest place that's like kind of like
unexplored I mean you know I agree I
think AR and VR are definitely like
those mega trends like among many no I
didn't say we are I don't care about VR
like at all useless but they work they
work they were unison and there's also
like the mixed reality where you could
do like something between AR and VR
where you flip between the two
either way it's like between AR and VR
drones self-driving cars Automation
there there are a variety of megatrends
and like as far as like those are more
like GS are concerned that is is
definitely yeah all the things that
you're talking about I'm definitely
excited about like self-driving cars and
stuff but it's not like apples doing
that or at least you know I don't do it
anymore
I think they've looked into it yeah kick
the tires and then decided to walk away
from it yeah you just see that awesome
pun I just made kick the tires yeah yeah
sure okay
because in case I already instead in
here it right um but I I think that
there is a lot of hype around AR
and what we're seeing so far is just
like being able to like put your
furniture around yeah that's what
everybody's been talking about Slyke
Tyrannosaurus is in the subway
sure yeah Scott showed me Scott Steiner
our reporter our review yeah our
reviewer for the iPhone 10 and other
products on Sina comm yeah he showed me
some photos of like some stuff that he
put in a are like around the office and
at first I thought like it looked very
real like it's good I just wonder if
it's like world-changing so it's not
world-changing but it's like it's so
cool sure and I think Google glass
definitely shows that there's there's
significant hurdles to putting a
wearable on your face all the time
so if Apple is legitimately working on a
are goggles it has to have so much more
potential and value as to actually
convince you but this is something that
you want to wear I don't know even for
like an hour during the day it might
have much more potential for somebody
for a specialty field
whether it's like surgery manufacturing
what-have-you as opposed to like walking
around on the street in an AR world I
don't I'm wondering if that actually is
gonna happen
imagine saggy and the chat says AR
goggles will be a niche product it will
fall the wayside just like 3d glasses
for the television thank you very much
imagine saggy always like commentary
yeah people don't want to have like like
physical accessories to get a feature on
something that they use the man said is
he talking to a microphone there's also
like there was chatter I remember when I
was at the Wall Street Journal so this
was a couple of years ago Google looking
into like was it was it a our contact
lenses I have to look it up that Google
was looking into some sort of contact
lenses it was either you know for
medical purposes or augmented reality
it's the same kind of concept I would
say that like putting a wearable on your
face or as a contact lens it's like is
it such an important feature that you
need it all the time I do not want a
computer in my eye I have terrible
nightmares about that scene
from Minority Report we're like the
machine the machine or the man has to
come and take my eye out because that's
where the computer is yeah I mean I'm
not against eye transplants any
situations I have terrible vision but I
don't need it to have any situation
where I have to carry less stuff the
better for me to be honest I like give
me my pockets back yeah definitely
the hell are you talking about where
does it go he's like flip-flopping now
he loves those aren't contact lenses
aren't goggles and they're like the AR
goggles would just be for AR that which
is another thing that I'd have to carry
so I think about it that's do you know
how like it's so hard to focus in the
world already if I'm talking to Brian
and I can see like what his heart rate
is and like it's Brian's birthday in 300
days or whatever like all this stuff
starts popping up like while I'm looking
at you like I supposed to string
together a sentence everybody's life
just looks like the Terminator it's just
target acquired yeah I would probably
never pay attention to anything again
right I think my my homing signals would
just don't lie every time I come by a
pizza shop my trajectory would have to
like change it would I know whether to
even be in my control it would be good
for dating apps like if you're at a bar
and you like knew who was potentially
available maybe that would reduce your
chances of embarrassing yourself just
make sure you silence some notifications
attractive female like steaming up
anyways welcome back to I be in the chat
it's been away from YouTube for a minute
good to have you back good to see a
question from Abby what would be the
real use of a RvR in the future and I
mean we're just kind of talking about
that yeah a little bit
mostly specifically specifically what's
the current status of daydream I mean
like daydream is that's a CR though
isn't it no no that you said a RvR okay
wait a minute is dangerous daydream is
Google pixels a VR right I mean like
it's out it's available it's it's being
utilized I think mostly from the arts
perspective what I've seen is it's
mostly used for gaming I mean like
PlayStation VR has
seen some good success recently with a
are there are some commerce applications
but beyond that I don't think they've
really found the killer feature quite
yet for using AR it's cool that's the
cool feature yeah but is it like needed
like do you have to use it for something
I mean I think it's convenient you know
you don't have to use your camera for
anything no your camera's not need try
to convince that to half the population
yeah I would I would agree with you like
is cameras like super useful first yeah
well I'm sick ok but like when you're
saying in the terms of like needed yeah
like you need to take the photo of like
that meal that you're eating no yes like
is it gonna change the world no but okay
hold on yes the photo of my meal will
change the world these are really good
eggs benedict
Alex Mitchell will 5g have an effect on
AR not exactly sure I mean it definitely
will just there's a lot of like
potential like like even with VR and you
know on Netflix just like watching stuff
like can sometimes take a while to load
the idea with like 5g making it like
you're connected to you know extremely
fast internet all the time definitely
makes a are much more accessible yeah I
mean I wish Roger Tsien were here
because he's our 5g I think the idea of
like being able to like stream in like
5g would probably be like the big like
stream like AR in like 5g where you can
watch like us like in your living room
or something like that like I think on a
4G or LTE connection I would probably
like take forever because that's a lot
of data yeah arguably the resolution
would be much better you be able yeah do
a lot more stuff I I think that's
probably like that's that's that's a
good take you know I would say moving on
to phones Watson do you think that the
iPhone 10 will hold its price for longer
more than other phones in the prior
years since Apple tends to drop about
40% in price every year to year mm
that's a good question I mean that it's
so premium that it's platinum I don't
know what the hell you even call this
phone so in general Apple devices tend
to hold their value
much more than literally any other
device out there second tier is Samsung
so the iPhone 10 because it's the first
one and if it's kept in good condition
yeah the possibility it's it there's a
good chance that it is going to retain
its value a little bit better than
previous models it's also you know just
a really nice phone and therefore if
you're gonna look to like sell it or
traded it in next year it's still like
pretty high spec so yeah but that being
said like a lot of those resale markets
are connected to historic sales yeah I
don't think they're gonna drop their
prices on it anytime soon though but
like do you think that it'll get cheaper
one that when they have a month when the
ten two or the 11 or whatever the hell
they want to call it like do you think
that it'll drop prices when that usually
they only drop it by about $100 yeah
it's gonna go from like $9.99 to $8.99
the used market it's it's hard to say I
mean like it's gonna retain its resale
value much better than other phones but
I don't think that it's so far in a way
different than other apples that it's
gonna be a cosmic improvement in resale
value yes that's my best guess on that
one more unfor we move on to other
topics Tammy Thompson will they be
refreshing the iPhone se it's a great
phone low-cost option for the
entry-level now you talked about perhaps
then continuing with multiple tiers
three models in 2018 for all the iPhone
10 yeah we think that the SE will become
part of a legacy law there had been
reports that they were gonna launch an
SE 2 in June or July or so we had
written it off of I think it was 9 to 5
Mac that had it or somebody else I don't
know somebody out there had it we have
the story on scene that's website also
but as it stands currently it's still
very much rumors yeah but I do agree
with Tammy's point was it Tammy that's
out that yes Tammy yes I do agree with
Tammy's points I am a big fan of the SE
and I've actually been holding on to my
like 5's until the SE 2 comes out so I'm
looking bar - speaking of rumors real
quick before we do move beyond beyond
phones svet asks are the rumors for an
iPhone X C with a plastic back for I
drop news true or are they also just
rumors I mean they're all just
rumors at this point and putting a a
plastic back on an iPhone 10 I think
sounds like a bad idea like first of all
you're gonna lose wireless charging I
think it needs the glass back yeah
perilous charging also I don't know how
much cheaper it would actually be if all
you're doing is adding plastic - yeah
then I don't see the CSeries making a
comeback I think that was kind of a big
flop for a bit of a dud
yeah yeah so I would I would argue do
not expect that one do we think they're
gonna go with more unique colors at the
very least cuz that was the whole thing
about the see wasn't I just maybe I come
here colors probably gonna have a red
line somewhere down the line I don't
know yeah that'll continue I think I
don't know colors there's going to be
for the X because of like the class back
it's I don't know how much people really
buy the phones depending on the colors
or not usually you're gonna put them in
I don't think it's gonna substantially
increase their keyboards people
definitely care about the color though
yeah I mean like Google has been making
a much bigger deal about colors they
have like those goofy color names like
simply blue really black purpley purple
rose gold no no no I know yeah Samsung
no they purple rose gold is a gaudiest
thing I've ever seen
Lanois has written a story about like
how they made the Google pixel and they
talked about how they purposely gave it
those goofy names to make fun of stuff
like cobalt blue and like and stuff all
right fair enough I guess I didn't get
the joke then so imagine psyches asking
what happened to the red no they just
did a red yeah there's a lot of Evan
yeah alright cuz I still have a red iPod
nanos yeah where they've done it for
their iPods they've done it for their
watches when they've never done it for a
phone until the the 7 right I wonder if
they'll skip the 10 being that it's its
own big mega anniversary and like wait
for the next line to maybe bring the red
back I think it'll come back in the
phone my phone mode in POC form real
quick we're almost out of time Watson
will Apple finally make a tablet laptop
infusion like the surface pro and allow
a Mac that could have a removable screen
that would
like hotcakes surely I mean that's why I
follow me surely that's what they call
the iPad pro 2 if we're gonna you know
look at that like the iPad pro is there
like answer to the to the surface and it
does have a lot of more capabilities
than but it's still a tablet before it's
a notebook as opposed that converts into
a tablet yeah I mean are you already
saying more like a surface book like
that little thing that like goes off the
keyboard or all that stuff right I mean
even if you look at like one of apples
like latest commercials that they had
for the iPad pro where it was like what
is a computer and they show like a bunch
of iPad pro stuff and they show it side
by side with like what computers or like
it those like the same thing so I mean
that's Apple's argument I'm not here to
defend them but yeah they're their whole
arguments like we're not gonna come out
with an answer
again to the surface because we already
have it it's called the iPad pro
whatever I think that from from a
certain position a lot of like longtime
Apple people are confused that there
have been a lot of trends in the laptop
world that Apple for one reason or
another has decided against going after
and the two and ones you see that with
Windows Phone
we're sorry with Windows laptops for a
really long time that there's been a lot
of experimentation and different form
factors and Apple just hasn't done it
like they introduced the touch bar and
there are plenty of people that argue
against it and think that it's not
actually that useful
so yeah Steve Shanklin hates it yeah he
knows what he's talking about
well chris osborn is curious about
perhaps getting something with a full
touchscreen laptop that actually still
runs OS x though something with a little
little more power under the yeah it's it
would be easy enough for them to do that
and I agree with Alfred that if you're
really really into Apple and really
really want a touchscreen laptop there
is the option at the very least of
getting an iPad pro the problem is is
like just doing very simple things like
improving the macbook air adding a
Retina display making it a little less
you know old looking and just making a
handful of small improvements like a
touchscreen there
doing that and I don't know that they
are I think Ricky and the chats got it
all figured out why would they want to
make a two-in-one when they can just
sell you both there you go and before we
let go last question we're gonna take
topic we've kind of forgotten about over
time stellar tech is Apple currently in
development for an electric car or
anything else related to automotive now
we've talked about this before yeah they
can't retire on it they kick the tires
no yeah so apparently they did a bunch
of hiring for this more than a year ago
I believe and abandoned the project I I
think this was this was entirely rumored
it did the Apple never actually came out
and said what they were planning on
doing but the rumor was that they were
developing a car like a shit up car not
just software for a car and I think that
they realized that it was going to be
too costly yeah complicated and it would
be much better to just pair their their
own software into existing cards because
of that rumors and them buying stuff
though like what aren't there rumors
last week that they had bought Shazam
yeah I was off on Friday and I bought I
saw the headline and I was about it I
did see those stories and I'm actually
not sure what I mean I'm sure that would
probably be for their home pod to like
figure out what songs are playing on all
that junk also Rovers for Siri that
would be smart to work into a smart home
a beaker like that okay my place to do
it I'm looking at a TechCrunch headline
from less than an hour ago
Apple 2 confirms Shazam acquisition
today so look for that
apparently it's several hundred million
dollars yeah and that were sounds like a
lot that would directly compete with
what Google has currently on their
Google home speakers with I don't know
what they're using for theirs it's I
don't it's definitely not Shazam but
like it's the whole hey what song is
this playing and it tells you what it is
yeah the echo does a version of that
where if you because the echo is pulling
from their own database yeah if you if
you like like sing back like lyrics if
you just say a bunch of lyrics like it
will pull it and tell you what song it
is so all of these guys are getting
better
that just yet because because all it is
is like pairing a database or a library
to you know little bits of information I
just be interested to see what the
specific value issues am would be to
Apple being the iTunes itself is a
robust library and they do carry liner
notes and their own lyric pages I just
wonder if they're looking for better
vocal recognition out of the Shazam yeah
technology yeah that's a that's a good
guess actually to try to figure out what
what it is that they would do with it
and that's a good place to put our
little thinking caps off yeah for a
minute and maybe we'll revisit that
later this week but we are out of time
then you want to bring us home okay I'll
try anyway
okay the 359 podcast is available on
iTunes tune in stitcher feedburner
google play music the amazon echo and of
course cynic on cnet.com thanks
everybody
thanks for joining us we'll be back
tomorrow and we'll see for the rest of
the week and then we'll figure something
out for the brighter picture
have a happy new year and happy Apple in
2018 cool who will in twenty eight
everyone into you shut up bye okay
goodbye everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
