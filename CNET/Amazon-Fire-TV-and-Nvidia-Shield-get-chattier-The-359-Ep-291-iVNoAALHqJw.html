York studios it is time for the 3:59
podcast episode 291 I'm BVG and in the
house today we've got Ben Fox urban
Alfred Inge and David Katz Mayer David
Katz Mayer thank you very much for being
D yeah I came all the way from my desk
about ten feet away
Natalie doodlee are you hi Khalid Oakley
Duke Lee dongle so you can already tell
it's gonna be a good show today it's
gonna be a great show we're gonna talk
mostly about TV stuff yeah just David
why you're here so we're gonna be
talking about the Amazon fire TV which
was just announced yesterday and also
the Nvidia shield there's a new
integration with home assistant that was
sorry
Google assistant that was announced this
morning yeah send in as many questions
and comments as you want about all
things TV whether they streaming boxes
what TV I should buy whatever David can
literally answer every single one of
them I have no doubt in my mind about
talking into your television room you
know what this reminds me I was looking
up I did a report years ago 2013 on the
first Samsung Smart interaction
television I don't remember this you
could wave at it you could talk into
thin air
well now now you can do that and it
actually works but are any of them ever
gonna be as smart as a TV on pee-wee's
Playhouse never yes all right let's save
it for the podcast let's get moving on
that sending your questions and comments
BBG we'll get to as many as you can at
the end of the show let's do this thing
all right I'll be recording the audio
podcast I'm back to talk to you in the
chat draw up some good questions today
we could use them three minutes and 59
seconds from 3:00 to welcome to the 359
I'm Ben Fox ribbon I'm Alfred hang and
with us today is David cat's in the
cradle cats Mayer pound for pound the
premier guru on all things TV oh yeah
garni shirt today I'm ready to sing it
okay so there's a lot of news in just
the past 24 hours about the colliding
world of video streaming devices and
voice assistance let's start with the
Amazon new fire TV it's $70 it's got a
weird shape and it now supports 4k HDR
video
shame dude yeah it's it's totally square
squares the new round and it back your
TV it's a phrase in the technology of
should we call it dongle and it you know
is just like a chromecast except it does
fork HD are just like a chromecast Ultra
which cost the same the difference is
this one has a remote and it's it's a
seems like a pretty sweet deal for a 4k
HDR streamer yeah there was a bundle
that I think just got announced either
yesterday or today where you could get
it with an echo dot for how much 80
bucks another 10 bucks step up and get
it it's not the dot what are you gonna
do you're gonna new there's another dot
in the garage you can use one in the
bathroom or you can use it in the living
room yes you talk to the fire TV yes so
this is something that Amazon actually
rolled out last month the finally after
years of having to hold up the
microphone and talk into it like your
walkie talkie style in the mid 80s you
can say hey Alexa into a room and if you
have echo dot or any other echo device
always on always listening it will
control your television you can say
watch Manchester by the sea which works
great because it's an Amazon property or
watch stranger things which doesn't work
quite as well because it's Netflix but
you get the idea it's it's pretty cool
we I give it a full run-through on CNET
and it's it's it's great so now all the
fire TV devices work like that including
the new 4k HDR one and the $40.00 stick
which it remains in the line one of the
things that we were hoping to see
yesterday was an integrated product
where it was basically an echoed dodd
plus a fire TV mash together yeah are
you a little disappointed that didn't
happen darn it
well that was in the leak it was a cube
thing it had buttons on the top you know
so again the idea was you had all this
functionality in one device now with
this bundle you know it's 80 bucks I
can't imagine this cube would be that
much you know more expensive than that
so they think you big cysts you think
the cube is somewhere I'm kind of anti
cube at this point I feel like if you
can get a dot and a little you know
dangling stick thingy that does
everything that the cube does you don't
need a cube whatever the cube is like
cheaper than both of those combined
though all hail the cube if if so that
would blow my mind but you would be
their parents they're good at cutting
prices those guys at Amazon definitely
you mentioned in your story to the
the fire TV like a new fire TV box maybe
on the way they may hate that have that
up their sleeve so maybe the cube will
be coming yeah yeah and and the other
thing is the competitive landscape so
Roku still hasn't by the way those guys
had a pretty successful IPO from what I
understand they have something that
they're probably going to release at
some point in your future like they
always do every fall and and last year
they still make my favorite 4k HDR
streamer so they are the biggest fish in
the streaming you know stream right now
and we're expecting to see Google yeah
we might get another chromecast so you
know stuff is still happening in a space
we obviously saw the LTV 4k
recently which isn't a stratospheric
price point compared to all the other
guys let's move on to Nvidia shield so
they got they became the first TV device
to get Google assistant you had a chance
to play with this what what was your
experience how good was it it was okay
it was okay we're blown away yeah it was
it was one of these things where it was
very similar sorry to the LX you know
it's saying into thin air similar sort
of functionality the the downside is
that you got to use its the Nvidia
shield is basically a streaming gaming
mega box for geeks it's about 200 bucks
you get one for 180 but it doesn't you
know work out of the box with this
functionality the idea is is the game
controller has a far-field mic in it so
if you want to you know say these things
into thin air without holding a remote
you got to leave your game controller
sitting on the table kind of a kludge at
CES they announced this thing that was
like a little like Glade air freshener
that plugs in and as a far-field mike
and and a speaker in it that is called
the nvidia spot much like what Amazon
announced and but they didn't give it
pricing availability on that so maybe
they'll make the system better but the
point is Google assistant gives you all
that great Google system stuff you have
on your phone already and the Google
home speaker but now it's built into
this game box we're gonna see more stuff
soon Sony TVs will also have Google
assistance so you know that's it's
another thing you talk to in the living
room sounds great all right if you want
to read more about these stories check
us out on CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
alfred hang the David that's Myer
you know talking I'm not editing that
out guys it's actually our new outro
[Laughter]
post-credits bonus what is it marble
great the next spider-man movie just
rolls credits and they need to see Tom
Holland pretty solid one of the
questions is like the big thing question
I wanted to get to David about this wise
where do you see all this going just
kind of like to wrap up everything that
we talked about on the pad podcast in in
a little bow where is this going I think
it's a couple years TV isn't it like
integrated into the television to the
television right right so that's one
issue right now so you got about many
things that you know will work only by
plugging him in what you want isn't
integrated into the television yeah so I
think that's what I was gonna get yeah
so you want a TV that has all this stuff
built into it already and you know we
saw that like you know years ago with
Samsung they did attempt and it failed
miserably and they stopped doing it but
for example these Sony TVs with Android
operating system are going to get Google
assistant I was really surprised when
Amazon's fire TV that came out earlier
it's made by a company called Element
didn't have far-field mics built in
because that seems like a pretty obvious
thing to do you know just just build it
all into the same you know TV so I think
that's probably coming next year what
about being able to upgrade right like
it's easier to upgrade an echo dot than
to upgrade your television so is there a
value to having those things be separate
I think so but I also feel like you know
what what was an upgraded echo dot give
you you know what I mean like it kind of
does a pretty great job already I mean
I'm sure Amazon can answer that question
by saying Oh better Sonics and no volume
control how often do you replace your TV
anyway yeah it's it's not that all yeah
that's that that's the point is that if
Amazon does at some point come out with
you know some sort of improved Alexa
controls your your you're less likely to
update your your television because it's
hundreds of dollars as opposed to one of
one of those the only thing that makes
me lean towards getting a TV with like a
Google assistant as opposed to an echo
even though I have like a ton of echoes
in my home is that it doesn't play well
with YouTube whereas you know home
assistant does yep and that's like I
watch most of my content on YouTube so
especially like live streams of great
podcasts like the 359 I didn't know you
were going there I can't I can't think
of any other ones but Apple buy of all
four that's right all right net picks I
think I think the last chore on the
selection from CNET last four or four I
think is tomorrow so check it out people
is it yeah I believe so and I think they
may be doing a marathon so check it out
sweet fellow 404 fans yeah way to break
the sad news no yeah I mean it's but
worse is how and strong and we'll be
here every day it's not our last episode
it might be this was actually a pretty
solid one pretty great to end on just
throw more damn it in there damn it
alright let's jump into some questions
Tammie Thompson's got a good one
do you think Amazon is just throwing
everything at the wall and seeing what
sticks
yes would all the announced products and
wines are such a push for voice control
yes on the first part absolutely they're
just trying to like push the envelope
test out what's actually possible in the
smart home and see what actually sells
it seems pretty likely to me that some
of these devices that they have in the
echo line are not gonna succeed or are
gonna sell very poorly but they are
hopefully trying to find the next echo
dot that's their big seller in the echo
line then they probably should have made
the price is much lower yeah they could
hello wait for prime day all right as
far as the big push for voice I mean
like maybe you can answer that
yeah easily the thing about a TV is that
it's just a pain in the butt you got a
bunch of remotes so there's a bunch of
buttons on them it's so much easier just
say you know watch stranger things or
whatever they then that's been the dream
and now they're really I think very
close to making
a reality and we were talking before
like with YouTube for example it comes
down to these guys playing nice with
each other and Google and Amazon are not
good friends and apples not good friends
all these guys are kind of trying to
competing each other but also offer each
other services and the difference is
between the devices come down to what
you want to watch I mean if you have a
bunch of prime stuff you bought a lot of
stuff on Amazon you know the fire TV
because is great it's it stuff comes up
you know immediately on Amazon and same
thing with Apple when you know you buy a
bunch stuff on iTunes and their home pod
speaker might integrate this far-field
voice stuff when it comes out later this
December so I would expect that yeah and
and so you know all these guys are again
fighting for the same sort of turf that
they did with phones and except there's
a new player Amazon that doesn't have a
phone and they're the leader so I think
it makes it pretty cool to see them see
their dynamics play out and which ones
you know what services they play nice
with and I think the winner hopefully is
one that will you know play nice with
everybody and let you watch what you
want to watch with your voice right and
not only watch yeah looking at it more
broadly I totally agree that it is a
land grab in voice computing that we're
seeing right now and is more broad than
just watching yeah what you want to
watch how you want to shop how you get
your information what you ping to like
just ask any sort of like trivia weather
or whatever and that's why you're seeing
so much activity going on right now cuz
this is the this is the next big lane
grab along with some other stuff but
this is a big one has all the voice
commands stuff though like her TV at
least been only for like Oh like watch
netflix like web services like could I
tell it to like change to the channel to
like ESPN or something
yeah so for on the Amazon TV for example
it's integrated antenna you could say
watch CBS for example you know a feed of
CBS and it works great um but the other
thing you know I really love the Late
Show I think it's really interesting
that you know you bring up the whole
stuff that's not watching TV but it's
still on your TV and that's where the
Google assistant they have a pretty cool
promo ad that they put out at the same
time as this shield update rolled out
where it's basically just a guy like
he'll watch Game of Thrones and you'll
be like oh who's that actress and since
it's cool assistant knows you're
watching Game of Thrones it'll
up with Daenerys the actress and then
I'll be like oh how tall is she gonna be
like oh five three and yeah where can I
get that dress and then you'll be like
you know it's an ad of theirs yeah and
it's just TV like that well that's what
they're they're saying it's like mom's
if you're polish if you're I want to
know how tall Denarius is absolutely and
if you're in five three by the way and
if you're in this mode of like oh TV I
just gonna use it to lead me down the
rabbit hole a distraction into other
areas you know the living room
assistance to help you with that and
sell you some you know some dresses on
the way yeah I obviously people already
use their phones and laptops that way
why not the television yeah how do we
fun time for some more questions yeah
all right we've got Kevin in the chat it
says uh when will there be a Google
assistant update for Sony TV's great
question Kevin Google says a couple of
months we'll see I'm curious to know
what they're gonna do with far-field
again because they just have these
microphones in their remote controls and
I don't know if they're gonna you know
you're gonna have to leave that on the
table and talk loudly into it from afar
or maybe they'll do what Amazon did
which is the smart thing and have a
google home speaker be able to listen
all the time and control your television
and right now anybody still can't do
that so a couple months on the Sony
thing they're the only other Android TV
operating system so they're going to be
probably the next to get Google
assistant in terms of the TV
entertaining space I wish these remote
controls with mics had like a search
function on them where like when you
lose your remote you can just yell out
like oh that and then it ping and then
you can go and just like rabbit it's a
great idea do they do that let me think
Roku has had that on their devices for a
while and it's it's a button you just
press the button on the box and the
remote will play you know a ping or ride
of the valkyries or whatever you want to
that's not voice controlled though
[Laughter]
uh you know it's it's but it's there and
I love that idea I was acting like
Logitech the arming remote cries like
why don't you have this I freaking lose
this thing all the time but you know
yeah but what if you lose the box then
life right
David Alex in the chat is looking to buy
a new TV around 55 inches what do you
recommend and why great question for
David Thank You CLP series samenow TCL
p-series 600 bucks
best 55 inch TV I have seen this year
bang for the buck
it's the Roku TV I've mentioned Roku a
few times it's a great operating system
but it's also 4k HDR Dolby vision great
picture quality local dimming yada-yada
in its 600 bucks
holy crap does it have voice control if
you plug in Amazon fire TV stick into it
so I don't really like the whole like
voice control for TV thing I mean I
don't know I also don't watch TV that
much so maybe that's me it's remotes
have become complicated and my phone as
a real so the idea is still you can put
your phone in your pocket
and you said of saying you know cute cat
videos on YouTube or whatever you're
watching Alfred you can say that into
thin air and your cute cat videos will
pop right up alright yeah
arguably it's supposed to make things
easier but I think at this point we're
still bridging and transitioning and to
things getting a little bit more
complicated sometimes as they keep
adding more integrations more controls
different things that you can do yeah
and it you know this is always like you
know can my six-year-old use it and the
answer is they might if they're gonna
watch the right thing but it'll
generally get frustrated because PBS
KIDS isn't supported or whatever you
know so you're in that weird area where
a lot of stuff doesn't work yep
so we have a follow-up question and
unfortunately don't have tied Pendlebury
here but do you have any perspective on
sound bars for James
I have perspective on sandbars yeah the
best sound bar right now is a Vizio I
can't give you the brand but it kicked
all the others but I feel like it's 150
I'm sure if you search for Ty's article
he's got it covered yeah it's on the top
of the best sound bars list just google
that on seeing it and
it's it's right there it's it's a from
what I understand it says it's his world
beater right now
Nikolas is calling ul Alfred says you
mr. grumpy pants thank you yeah I mean
like that's why he's here
all right so unrelated news Matthew dad
sure what's up - hey Dad I have a very
serious question who is older Alfred in
or Cena as a company I asked because I
was just thinking about watching Richard
Hart host seen at Central when I was in
high school I actually was thinking
about this the other day cuz I was I'm
speaking of our general manager over at
the coffee
so Cena it's what like 24 now no 23 to
22 okay so yeah I'm like a year older
yeah I thought you were born on the same
day that Cena was I thought that was you
stopped like I'm trying to lie about my
age on the show dude he was the chosen
one the golden boy a red ball boy if you
will raised around this office for years
yeah I mean I'm somewhat terrified they
even asked the chat how old they think I
am but you know 76 76 I think that's
older than you right CNN is not older
than me that is stop lying about your
age dude all right fine fair enough I'm
a I'm 18 all right another through this
beard another one from - real quick is
there an Alexa compatible curing so I
can voice order my Earl Grey tea hot
mm-maybe sure why not that is possible
they have like a thousand products that
integrate with Alexa Keurig might be one
of them now or you can just put your
Keurig on a smart switch and you know
you could definitely do that way yeah
there since we're plugging a lot of CNET
stuff that we do have a whole smart home
page that you can see the different
Alexa and Google assistant integration
so I would say check that out and you'll
be able to see a lot of the different
devices that work with those specific
voice assistants and they cover the heck
out of coffee and then smart home off oh
yeah and like su v--'s oh yeah whatever
a suit is if you need to stir some water
to cook your meat they're your boys also
Showtime is a great Channel oh is it
I love you the circle I love homeland
but that's too long just like to say
that I think Roger Chang is an amazing
editor in person I mean for someone
who's 23 he knows what he's talking
about
absolutely it's great taste all right a
couple more quick ones before we call
the day Tammy has another good question
there there are cheaper elects enabled
speakers like the you fee Jeanie I'm not
sure if I'm pronouncing that right or
the Fabrique speakers that currently do
the same thing as echo without the
multi-room features will they be worth
purchasing instead the multi-room
features are definitely very useful
talking to right Crist who's he's the
smart home guru out in Kentucky that I
talked to a lot about Alexa integrations
he mentions that there are a handful of
devices that do provide a lot of those
Alexa features but do not have the multi
room compatibilities and so you'll ask
Alexa so to do something and multiple
devices are actually going to answer
that can be really really annoying so I
think Amazon is obviously trying to
protect its ability to continue to sell
you its own line of echo devices to a
certain extent we're gonna see that
stuff also rollout to those devices as
well from my experience of the multi
room feature has really not been that
great it doesn't work with Spotify me I
mean I'm sure they're gonna be adding
that feature soon and it also doesn't
work if it's on Bluetooth speakers like
it's only if it's the echo on its own or
if it's like plugged in into like
another set of speakers and all my echos
are plugged or like connected to
Bluetooth speakers so it does not work
that well like right now yes a room is
hard
yeah it's about sinking like party mode
throughout your whole house and it took
sonís a while to perfect it and and
actually now the Google the chromecast
Audio is really good that's the thing to
the the multi-room sinking from my
experience has been like one or two
seconds off sometimes and like I really
only play the radio on it because like
what else can I do with it right now
yeah and you can hear that it's pretty
obvious yeah you know it's like walking
into the past when I go into my kitchen
I know about traffic or name
all right let's get off-topic for one
hot second Danny Green is wandering
around the Apple store Danny well what
would what should Danny buy what the
store hi Apple t-shirt stock I don't
know we need phones not the iPhone eight
if you have any iPhones from the past
two or three years wolf yeah well if you
you can you could just hang out until
the iPhone X comes out yeah just go on
their computers and loiter there for the
rest of the day I've done that at months
yeah yeah just get um Danny get a
MacBook Pro with a touch bar yep put it
in a box send it over to me Danny
critters and then go on our video like
on all of their computers yeah it's like
just boost our viewers that's there you
go that's a great fact do that long it's
a solid idea right now all right before
we go let's get David under the
microscope here alex says chromecast
fire TV or Roku Roku at least so far
easy one I will be able to answer that
in more depth in detail once the Roku
and/or chromecast announcements come
later this month I'm thinking but you
know right now it's Roku good enough I
think that's about a great place to end
it off for the week but a good week
funny yeah not not filled with Samsung
and Apple and the same redundant stuff
over and yeah you should watch our show
on Monday it's incredible what was that
the equifax show no that was the one
that didn't exist oh yeah yeah thanks
for coming on yes yeah let's bring us
home the 3:59 is available on iTunes
tuned in stitcher SoundCloud Feedburner
google play music and of course Cena
comm tired of plugging this website
all right well and short for it and show
time no no we're not on show yeah ok
thanks everybody thanks and thanks to
David for joining us
