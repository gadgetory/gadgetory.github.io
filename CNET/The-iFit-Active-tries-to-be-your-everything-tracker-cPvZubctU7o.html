hopes to be your everything tracker I'm
dan Graziano and I'm here with the I fit
active this little device can track your
daily activities your diet and even the
workouts you do on treadmills like other
activity trackers on the market it will
track your steps taken distance traveled
calories burned and sleep all of which
is displayed on a small LED screen where
it's unique is its ability to Swire
lashley sync with treadmills from
Proform free motion and Nordic Track to
accurately measure your workouts at home
or at the gym with the company's Android
and iOS app you can also keep track of
your diet you can scan a barcode with
the mobile app or quickly enter calories
and intervals of 50 on the device itself
ifit's food database doesn't seem as
large as the competition and
unfortunately you have to use the
company's app for everything rather than
some third party options that are better
I really like the versatile design you
can wear it on your wrist clipped onto
your waist or simply in your pocket
although I found accuracy takes a hit
when you don't have it on your wrist or
your waist the active has very strong
battery life I got just over two weeks
for my first charge
another cool feature is that you can
also set up alerts that will remind you
to get up and move if you have been idle
for too long unfortunately the tracker
isn't waterproof there's no heart rate
monitor and the screen can be very
difficult to read in direct sunlight the
active is available for $129 in the US
ninety nine pounds in the UK and it's
compatible with the iPhone 4s and above
and Android 4.3 devices and higher for
more information be sure to check out my
full review at cnet.com I'm Darrin
Graziano and that was a first look at
the iFit active</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
