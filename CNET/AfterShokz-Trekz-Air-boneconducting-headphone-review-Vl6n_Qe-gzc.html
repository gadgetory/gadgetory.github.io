bone conduction headphone the hundred
and fifty dollar Trek's air the trim
down sequel to the well-received treks
titanium is 20% lighter than the
titanium weighing 1.0 four ounces and is
even more comfortable to wear and seems
to be just as durable in case you don't
know what a bone conduction headphone is
it's one that delivers sound through
your cheek bones that's right the
headphone driver doesn't go in your ears
or cover them it sits directly in front
of them resting on your face the big
benefit to the technology is that thanks
to its open design you can hear what's
going on around you while listening to
music or having a phone conversation
through the headphone that openness
allows runners and bikers to hear
traffic and important safety feature I'm
not going to tell you the headphone
sounds great because it doesn't
comparatively speaking anyway but it
sounds a whole lot better than early
aftershocks models I tested a few years
ago you're still not going to get that
really rich immersive sound with good
clarity and strong bass the sensation is
more like listening to good background
music from speakers you can't see it's
both in your head and not in your head
if that makes any sense anyway check out
our full text review for a deeper dive
into that phone but my quick take is
this is a wireless sports headphone to
keep an eye on especially if you're
looking for an alternative to your
typical in here or on here around the
next style headphone I'm David karna for
cnet.com thanks for watching
