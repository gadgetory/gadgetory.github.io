Lynn la fresita and for our top gift
pick in mobile we'd like to recommend
that Apple iPhone 6 it's a solid handset
that's stylish and powerful and it's one
of the more memorable phones we've seen
this year with the iphone 6 apple has
finally yielded to big screen demands
and it expanded its usual 4-inch iphone
display to 4.7 inches however unlike its
six-plus counterpart or the samsung
galaxy note 4 which has phablet sized
screens bigger than 5 inches the iphone
6 is not as niche it's more pocketable
and comfortable to hold in the hand due
to its NFC chip inside the handset can
also access all the services of Apple's
new digital payment system Apple pay the
service works similar to Google Wallet
and paypal and users can purchase items
both online and in stores they can also
add their personal credit card onto the
platform and confirm purchases with a
phone's built-in touch ID fingerprint
reader but perhaps our favorite thing
about the iphone 6 is it's 8-megapixel
rear-facing camera although it doesn't
have the optical image stabilization
seen on the 6 plus it's auto focus has
been improved to work faster it's slow
motion recording which shoots video at
120 and 240 frames per second is also
really 8th now granted the iphone 6
comes at a pretty penny starting at 199
and that's with a carrier contract buy
it unlocked and that can shoot up to six
hundred forty nine dollars or more but
if you can spare it the device makes a
great gift for anyone looking for a
premium phone
