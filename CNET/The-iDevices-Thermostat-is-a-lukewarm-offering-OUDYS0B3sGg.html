taking a look at the new smart
thermostat from I devices now this
thermostat is homekit compatible which
means that you don't need a hub to use
it but you will need an apple device of
some sort like an iPhone or an iPad
overall setting up this product is
pretty easy if you're familiar with HVAC
systems
the problem is other smart thermostats
will figure out what kind of HVAC system
you already have in place this one
requires you not only to wire the
thermostat but also to go in and enter
information about your HVAC system
before it starts working properly
once the iDevices thermostat is up and
running the basics work you can control
the temperature of your home on your
thermostat or on the mobile app you can
also program scenes in which Siri will
issue multiple commands simultaneously
to various home kit products installed
in your home but beyond these basic
smart thermostat features the iDevices
thermostat doesn't really offer a whole
lot currently there's no geofencing
feature that allows the thermostat to
know whether you're home or away there's
no algorithm that helps your thermostat
learn your personal heating and cooling
patterns over times and really other
than $150 price point at which it's
being offered on the iDevices website
there's not a whole lot to distinguish
it from its competitors after talking
with developers behind this product I
can tell you that certain firmware and
software upgrades will be happening
sometime in the future to bring some of
these lacking features up to date at
present though I can only recommend this
for early adopters of homekit technology
