before heading to Mars I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your CNET update how many of
you share your Netflix account password
with other people well if you do you may
be aware that only two devices can
stream at the same time for one account
holder if that's a problem because
you've shared your password out to
distant relatives and old friends then
the family streaming plan might be
something you want if you upgrade and
pay $12 a month instead of $8 a month
the family plan lets you stream on four
devices at once but the Netflix CEO said
he only expects fewer than 1% of
subscribers to actually go through with
the upgrade if you don't want to live on
this planet anymore you can apply for a
one-way ticket to Mars and it only costs
38 bucks a Dutch company called Mars 1
is calling for volunteers to launch
themselves into space in 2022 and then
Coast along for 7 months
and land on Mars by 2023 and there's no
going back the mission is to help build
a settlement with living quarters farm
gardens do some science try to find life
maybe drink your recycled urine take
turns messing with NASA's Rover you know
typical Mars life things and more people
will be sent as the years go by so maybe
you can have Martian babies but deciding
who gets to go will be televised and
voted on just like reality TV before
that time comes Mars 1 is looking for
sponsors because it's a tad bit
expensive you know about six billion
dollars give or take but act fast the
opportunity to apply to die on another
planet and as August 31st buying a movie
or TV season on iTunes can be a long
download not as long as traveling to
Mars though now Apple is liddie iTunes
users pay now and download later for big
file items such as movie bundles and
music box sets but it requires iTunes 11
on the computer or iOS 6 on a mobile
device the next time you visit a
business page on Facebook from your
phone you'll notice a new design that
highlights the location of the place a
button to call as well as info if you've
checked in before and the number of
likes and shares for the establishment
so by focusing on check-ins and ratings
Facebook tries to be more like
Foursquare and Yelp and Foursquare also
refreshed its desktop website to keep up
with competitors like Yelp it's now
easier to search for in flew about a
place and reach Foursquare tips from
your desktop computer that your tech
news update and I'm proud to report it's
been one year since this show debuted
happy birthday update many thanks to our
viewers and be sure to follow along
