and right now we're taking a first look
at the Hamilton stay or go blender now
this appliance is designed for busy
people who also love their smoothies
price of $40 this device is not only
compact it's also very inexpensive you
get to travel jars here for both
blending ingredients together within
inside the blender and also little hops
here little caps on top which let you
take the smoothie you've created and
walk out the door with it and drink it
on the go you also get this grinding cup
which is made for grinding solids such
as nuts hard cheeses like parmesan and
even spices if you want you can also do
coffee in here another thing I like
about the hamilton stay or go blender is
that it's very easy to clean it doesn't
have many parts and it's also dishwasher
safe so you can just throw everything
into the dishwasher and you're good to
go at 40 dollars you might not expect it
to actually deliver some of the
capabilities that more expensive
blenders can say you know blenders that
cost a hundred dollars or more and you'd
be partially right as you can see the
cutting blades here are very small they
don't reach up into the the blending jar
here so you can't really blend a lot of
complex and textured ingredients very
quickly you might have to go in there
and mash it up with a spatula so one of
the things this blender can do that
other blenders can't is blend hot
liquids just be careful because the
pressure may cause the top to erupt
another thing I don't particularly like
about the Hamilton Beach stay or go
blender is it's all plastic design as
you can see it doesn't feel very
expensive and you won't be blown away by
its premium looks so another thing I
don't like about this blender is that
the controls are pretty basic you just
get two buttons one for pulse and one
for on and off so overall the Hamilton
Beach stay or go blender is a pretty
good option if you only have 40 dollars
in your pocket
it also will help you grab those
smoothies and run out the door with it
but if you want something a little more
powerful you're gonna have to spend
money I'm Brian Bennett frissina and
this has been a first look at the
Hamilton Beach stay or go blender</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
