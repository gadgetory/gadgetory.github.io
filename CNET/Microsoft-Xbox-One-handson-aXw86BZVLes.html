cnet.com and today I'm taking a look at
the Xbox one it's a little bigger than
the PlayStation 4 and it's not as pretty
looking but nevertheless it only comes
in one version like the ps4 and that's
the 500 gigabyte model for $500 which is
$100 more than the PlayStation 4 so what
are you getting for that extra money
well you get the new version of Kinect
which allows you to control your Xbox
with your voice and motion gestures you
can use your Kinect to control your
cable or satellite TV box and because it
has an HDMI in and out it can pass
through your TV signal and let you watch
TV and play games at the same time ok so
how does all of that work well not
really perfectly at all first connect
can't do much with using your DVR so if
you record a lot of shows on the fly
you'll need to keep your original remote
handy sometimes Kinect won't even hear
you and other times it has no idea what
you're saying alright so here is the
Xbox one in our living room demo
environment I just want to show you how
sometimes Kinect won't work when it's
trying to change your TV channels Xbox
watch HGTV and it's throwing on HDNet
now when it works it's pretty cool it's
nice but it's just not that reliable
you'll probably wind up using your cable
or satellite box remote more often than
not ok so the games Xbox one games look
great and they look a lot like
PlayStation 4 games there's an 8 core
CPU and a custom graphics chip inside as
well and it's got a gigabytes of ddr3
ram alright now here is the Xbox one
controller it's not as big of a change
compared to what Sony did with the
DualShock 4 and it's not actually as
comfortable as it was to grip the
original Xbox 360 controller now the
start and back buttons are now called
the view and menu buttons and they also
move the Guide button up to the top and
that's now called
the home button up front there's
actually IR ports
that communicate with connect and can
actually log you in using your face and
which control your hold it now the best
probable improvement of the new Xbox
controller is the d-pad the d-pad is
kind of awesome now it doesn't sit on
that disc and you know it isn't really
prone to all those accidental inputs
that the original Xbox 360 suffer from
the Xbox one menu system isn't as simple
as it might appear on the surface
there's too many confusing sections and
a lot of times you don't really know
where you've ended up within the menu
system the best way I can describe it is
kind of like menu inception because
you'll start somewhere and then you're
not sure how you got there and then when
you back out to the home screen you
don't know how to get back it'll all
take a lot of time for you to get used
to unfortunately more so than any video
game operating system I've ever come
across now the social and sharing
elements on the Xbox one are not as
fleshed out as they are on the ps4 right
now you can only record video and upload
the video using a built in app called
the upload app it's also kind of
disappointing that Xbox Live Gold is
still required to do even the most basic
features on Xbox one the same features
that are free to do on a Playstation 4
now get this you still need Xbox Live
Gold to do things like stream Netflix
use some of the game DVR features and
even use Skype so here you are paying
$100 more than a ps4 and you pretty much
have to be a gold member to enjoy a lot
of the luxuries now make sure you check
out our entire review to see which
console is right for you I'm going to be
updating it as a lot of new features go
live there's a lot more plan for both of
these systems now just like the ps4 it's
probably wise to wait to purchase an
Xbox one until there are more compelling
games and software to make it worth your
while that's going to do it for me this
has been the Xbox one prasena comm I'm
Jeff Bakalar
