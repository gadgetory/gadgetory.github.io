in New York and like Star Trek well I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update facebook has unveiled a new way
to search within the site and your
connections it's called graph search
unlike Google where you type in a
keyword you can hunt for things more
naturally by narrowing down different
fields the graph search is focused on
people photos places and interests a
simple example is searching for
restaurants in Chicago or music my
friends like take it to another level
and you can search for friends in New
York that like the show fringe another
example Mark Zuckerberg gave was
searching for Mexican restaurants in
Palo Alto that his friends have been to
that way you could reach out to friends
to get recommendations that the place is
any good if you meet someone but you
forgot their full name there's a way to
do that to search for people named Chris
who are friends of Lars and went to
Stanford University the search can also
help in professional connections one
example given was a search for NASA
employees who are also friends with
Facebook employees or maybe you want to
search for a doctor or dentist liked by
your friends facebook is taking on Yelp
and LinkedIn with this new graph search
it also is taking on Google by letting
you search for some things outside of
your circle of friends for example
search for restaurants in your area like
by graduates of the Culinary Institute
of America and you just found something
that not even Google can give you but
you have to sign up on a wait list to
try out the new feature it's still a
beta product the Detroit Auto Show is
going on now and we're seeing more cars
unveiled with advanced technology that
can assist with driving in heavy traffic
the mercedes-benz e-class update
features things like brake assist and
cross traffic assist to help a driver
avoid an accident the 2014 Infiniti q50
uses cameras to help keep the car
centered in its Lane a Hyundai concept
car called the Genesis takes things a
bit further and uses I tracking
technology with a display located near
the center of the windshield the idea is
that drivers glance at an icon they want
and confirm it with a knob at the
controls drivers can also change radio
stations by waving their hand or adjust
the volume by twisting an imaginary knob
I hate to see what happens that there's
a fly you're trying to shoo
but honestly I think it'll be a long
time before we see this kind of
technology manifest itself in a safe way
in a real car and today we're looking at
the iphone app birthday cards by clever
bug it's another app that lets you send
personalized paper greeting cards from
your phone but it uses Facebook to let
you know who has an upcoming birthday
and you can insert photos from facebook
sending the physical card cost you three
dollars but you can also post a digital
version on a timeline it's a much more
unique way to wish someone a happy
birthday than the usual wall post that's
your tech news update you can get links
to all the stories I mentioned at our
blog sina com / update from our studios
