wildest boldest Christmas displays in
the neighborhood is a holiday tradition
for many families we found one in
Southern California that blends
animatronics projection music and light
into an impressive synchronized
extravaganza my name is Mike from Kowski
and my website is lights on display calm
Mike's display is well-thought-out and
delightful to watch that's because he
has a lot of experience creating holiday
displays for his home I've been doing a
display for about 40 years now I always
wanted animated figures and our yard and
everything so I started building the
figures I'd plywood and chicken wire and
fabric and use little vending machine
game Road as I Drive that about 2003 the
display really took off because computer
control for the home use that became
available and now I'm able to control
LED lights i'm atronics video sync video
and music his display is so great he
even won an episode of ABC's the great
Christmas light fight you won't find any
store-bought pieces in this set up there
you see on the display is custom build a
tree to the candy canes selling
electronics if you're considering
putting up your very own massive holiday
lights display you probably missed your
window Mike starts each year's concept
about eight months ahead of time the
display takes about two or three months
to program off and on after work and
then when it's time to actually put the
display it takes about 15 days this year
take about 15 days straight so what are
the neighbors think about all this
nightly light and sound so far my
neighbors have always loved to display a
lot of fun a lot of their neighbors
bring their kids out every night and
they've always been supportive and and
thankful for it ask for payment or
donations mike says there's nothing in
it for him beyond spreading a little
Christmas cheer I go out there every
night try to be out there and everything
to see the kids that you know have fun
and from this play and their parents
seeing enjoying watching their kids have
fun is like all those you know weeks and
months and hours is that their
programming
that's a
Merry Christmas
that's a wrap</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
