Jessica's all hurt from CNET here with
an early look at Microsoft's Cortana
voice assistant in a minute I'll show
you how Cortana so far stacks up against
Apple Siri and Google now but first a
caveat or three
I've got Cortana on a pre-release
version of Windows Phone 8.1 not even
the developers have this yet Cortana is
in beta and gets her knowledge from the
hive mind that is the cloud which means
that she isn't at her full capacity at
this stage get it good now Cortana can
do the same basic things the Siri and
Google now like call and text set alarms
get directions and search the web for
practical answers to your questions
it'll take 41 hours and 20 minutes to
drive to New York Cortana can also tell
you the weather start a note and set
reminders for example wake me up in an
hour creating a calendar item is a snap
that you can't seem to vocally remove it
if you change your mind
set an appointment for 5:00 p.m. for
happy hour happy hour dear calendar for
today at 5:00 p.m.
cancel my appointment for 5:00 p.m.
tonight happy hour
you have one event today at 5 p.m.
happy hour this is something you can do
with Siri though shall I remove it from
your calendar yes okay I took it off
your calendar beyond the basics Cortana
has other tricks as well unlike Siri
Cortana can open apps and turn on phone
settings like turn on Wi-Fi thanks
Cortana also has built-in song
recognition to ID a tune
Google now does this a little bit better
since it hooks you straight into the
Google Playstore like Google now you can
ask Cortana to track your flights and
tell you when you leave for appointments
you turn on both of these in the
settings one unique feature of that
Cortana can do is run interference on
calls and texts when you're sleeping or
in a meeting Microsoft calls these quiet
hours where Microsoft really toots its
own horn is in the way that Cortana
understands context for instance if you
tell it next time I talk to my sister
remind me to tell her about my vacation
plans then the next time we text or call
a reminder should pop up by the way you
can set relationships in settings under
inner circle this is something you can
do in Siri as well another neat trick is
being able to make follow up demands
like when you're making a reservation
show me three star Japanese restaurants
here are ten Japanese restaurants that
are three stars
how far is number three how long will it
take me to walk when it comes to having
a cheeky personality it's pretty easy to
beat Google now that thing is a software
robot Siri is a snarky er contender but
it really depends on what you say what's
the story of halo at this point Cortana
seems to be a pretty good blend of
Google now in Siri however it's being
based search results don't seem quite as
convenient as Google now and you do have
to press a button every time you want to
speak but Cortana does have some
promising integration with the rest of
the phone that bridges what both Siri
and Google can do things will get even
more interesting as developers jump into
the mix with Cortana commands that will
work with their own apps as well well
have much more on Cortana as the voice
assistant
UPS over time in the meantime I'm
tossing a ball court for C net you can
catch my thorough comparison among
Cortana Google now and Siri etsy.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
