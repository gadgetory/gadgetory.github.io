get cameras installed in their horns
we'll tell you why and a really cool
installation from forever 21 and flying
cars oh no time for the Jetsons no it's
tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk-show in the known universe I'm
Ashley Scott James always Cal anonymous
pixels high pixels hype
there's wow there is a lot of pixels
human hype if you have not seen the
movie pixels getting destroyed by every
reviewer at every site contrary to what
I said yesterday which there were no
reviews out currently not worth it I'll
give it a chance not worth making a
video movie about old games sorry today
Wow everything I say everything
yesterday's episode will be deleted from
the records expunged that from your
permanent record we got cool stuff we do
let's have headlights oh boy people on
CNET love them some car tech right
believe we're in these things all day
and night now we have an update on
flying cars those about time so company
called Terrafugia we had to look that up
thank you for that pronunciation guide
on your website Terrafugia announced a
while back
that in 8 to 12 years we were gonna
flying cars and sure enough they're
sticking with that actual number and
they've updated us with a brand new car
like a new concept for what it's going
to look like ok it looks crazy
this is doesn't look like a car at all a
spectacular looking vehicle yeah so the
one that was previously announced two
years ago was the T FX t FX ok and so
this new one this is the new design for
the tf-x
so they've just updated what its gonna
look like yeah I like that so here's
here's a few sincere some spots about
this this car it's a hybrid electric it
carries four people so that's quite a
bit yeah it's a street-legal
apparently I mean put still let's see it
actually exists area and it's easy to
fly it says it'll take about five hours
to learn how to fly it
look at this video it's gonna have like
helicopter blades I prepare this is
insane
yeah this is now let's keep in mind
you'll notice that this isn't a real
thing
usually it's just a CG thing that's
because it's just as design and not a
fully functioning production car yet
they're going to test it out they're
gonna test an actual thing but it's
going to be a 1/10 scale and they're the
size of a large dog yeah ok I got it
so the delivery was supposed to be this
year or next with a price of $280,000
because what guess what nope it's
apparently going to be a couple more
years
and it's gonna be about four hundred
thousand dollars instead of so double
the price keep saving that it'll even
give you more time to save up your money
of course I mean right now if you have
$280,000 maybe you can save up an extra
120 just you know to buy this thing
so I mean okay so rocket cars we can now
since this is kind of a discussion show
talk about the pros and cons of this Pro
it's a it's an awesome flying car no I
was just not gonna say anything oh
nothing you don't think this is good at
all I don't trust people driving cars
let alone the fact that there's gonna be
drones in the air as well I'm a big fan
of Futurama but it's sky traffic just
much just all that all that stuff
five five hours to learn how to fly it
okay so like if they give you lessons or
something I'm sure like something like
that I don't know I guess five hours
sort of fly seems awfully low
considering that commercial airline
pilots pilots spend years like racking
up enough hours to be able to fly larger
planes but I suppose you're only caring
be like a saint like a single-engine
plane you'd carry a few people in it
like not the issue is that the reason
for flying is to make it so you can just
go straight from point A to point B
instead of having to walk instead of
having to like veer and go around
mountains and stuff like that when a to
point B an issue there is going to be
that other people are going from point A
to point B without any specific pathway
meaning you're going to have to avoid
people going all different directions
and which means you should it should
self fly so that it can coordinate but
then there's a whole different
technology of people having to get there
and that's why we have air traffic
controllers but now we're not going to
have that for that so there's there's
going to be crashes there already is
already problems that haven't been
solved here so I would like for some
solutions before it comes out in a few
years that does seem like a good
solutions before it seems like I do can
make a flying car but let's tackle some
other issues yeah I mean where we're
going we don't need roads that's true
doc Brown is right but we do need some
we do need some control there there
needs to be some sort of system in place
as opposed to just everybody flying
around willy-nilly like hey look at me
I'm flying a car and then crashing into
somebody else okay so let's talk about
hash tag of the day which is teeny fly
car and okay I thought I didn't want to
ask you guys like where you'd go or what
you do I wanted something more fun so
let's say you get one of these cars and
you have to gift it to anybody in the
world you have to give this car away
who would you give it to and why and you
feel free to get creative on this like
who would you give it to it doesn't have
to be like your mom like I mean
obviously I'm sure we'd all like to give
flying cars to like our favorite
relative or whatever but like get
creative who would you give a flying car
to like Elon Musk it's just the tinker
with I'd give it to somebody who's that
who could go out there and be doing good
in a lot of different places so like my
first one was the Elon Musk because I
feel like he can go and bring science to
other parts of the country or whatever
or you know I was gonna say the
president so he would stop using that
jet and wait using so much fuel for
pollution buddy that sounds like a
boring answer to keep it to the
president anyway what do you got I think
I would give it to well I thought a lot
about this and I I I think I would give
it to somebody who doesn't have a lot of
money but needs to travel so I was
thinking maybe like I would donate it to
a to Logan or to Logan yeah we'll
produce a look and obviously my number
one choice but and yours too but yeah
second choice I mean we didn't nepotism
you guys we don't want to just give
something away to somebody we know I
would probably donate it to like a
college to help students go like study a
like go abroad and then come back like
so that they could like fly there really
quickly like see things and study a
place and then fly back the thing with
your question is you only get to pick
one person if it's only one person then
I give it to the president of a
university who it could use that car
okay that's what I would do I'm gonna be
like you should you please use this for
a year
University like donate it to the
University I'll give it some university
to like send their students places where
they maybe he couldn't go otherwise
seems pretty good so to modify the
question then like is it like where
would you give it to yeah yeah you can
give it to a company or a place or at
school or you know whatever just okay so
what make-a-wish Foundation perfect but
you have to give it away you can't keep
it for yourself that's all and please
don't give it to us don't suck up guys
that's gross second all right let's talk
about the clothes screen this is kind of
weird and also fun this is really fun so
there is this installation that is gonna
be happening in New York or is happening
right now I think they unveiled it this
morning this is from Breakfast New York
their design company that works with
forever 21 to make this screen but
that's actually not a screen that's not
an 80 by 80 pixels screen that is a
whole bunch of threads of spooled thread
that's that's fabric making those images
which is really crazy so again this is
an 80 by 80 pixel image or screen but
they're actually spools of thread so
here they are working on it and the
whole thing uses 6,400 spools of thread
that's an and the thread is almost seven
miles long like that's the total amount
of the thread use it's 11 feet tall 9
feet wide it weighs a ton it will only
be up for a week and what happens is is
it how it works is you literally upload
your picture and you can do this right
now this is crazy you can post a picture
to Instagram and you tag it with the
hashtag f21
thread screen and then there is s-21
thread screen comm which will then put
your picture up on this crazy screen of
thread which is kind of nuts and so
you'll put like this so that's
somebody's Instagram photo that they
just put up with thread that's not it's
not any kind of electronics on the
screen part of it of course there's a
lot behind that and they had to work
really hard to figure this out it took
18 months to put this together it's
about six to seven months to build and
then another about year to fine-tune it
and make it better and keep going and
they made a great video on how it works
in the behind the scenes and stuff if
you're interested but if you go to that
f21 thread screen com
you can watch a live video stream of the
actual of the fit of the insulation and
you can watch it changing all the time
and if your if your picture gets put up
on thread stream you thread screen I
should say you can go to f21 thread
screen comm slash at and then your
username and it'll have a little quick
video of like it playing which is kind
of awesome
I still didn't really explain how that
the read switch is out so quickly so
it's like a loom they have it's about
three feet in depth so it doesn't
actually go that far back I was
surprised by that I thought it would be
this big like cube in the back that had
this whole thing going on but it almost
works like a loom so it runs different
color thread through and then basically
switches them out as it needs so it's
like if you have something that is let's
say you have a blue image that's up
first and then it needs to go to red
well all of the the spools have
different color thread going all the way
through the line so they go through it
and then they they basically roll up see
if they have like different colors that
go through it so they're able to change
the colors very quickly per spool so
it's not it's not like they're not all
interconnected as far as I'm aware the
way from what I understand like they're
not all interconnected each spool has
its own like roll of color break so
easily I mean there's something like
when you look at the actual video of it
like you can see some of them like maybe
have a little glitches or giddy like
dead pixels if you will like it's sort
of like that but super interesting stuff
and I it'll be up for a week it's only
up for a week so if you want to go check
this out I suggest you do it quickly
that's me for a Z cool idea if you're in
New York eighteen months to make it
those seems like a really long time okay
so speaking of cool ideas this is
awesome black rhinos not to be a downer
but black rhinos are super endangered
and they get poached a lot for their
horns and they they get killed and left
out in the middle of nowhere and then
their horns just get cut off it's really
sad apparently the statistic is a rhino
gets killed every six hours in Africa
which is far far too too much if at all
I mean they just shouldn't be being
killed so this uk-based nonprofit has
made the system called rapid that
they're hoping will stop at least deter
poachers but or stop them
or at least enable them to help catch
them or prosecute them so rap it is
short for real-time anti-poaching
intelligence device and it consists of
three parts
there is a GPS collar for the Rhino a
heartrate monitor that goes under their
skin which is very thick and a camera
that's placed directly in a rhino's horn
so when the Rhinos heart rate goes up so
for example if it gets shot by a poacher
the camera flips on and it can see
what's happening so and an alarm goes
off and that gives anti poaching teams
immediate response ability they can jump
into a helicopter or Jeep and get to
that Rhino as quickly as possible to
help the war a poacher from killing the
Rhino which is pretty amazing and so and
the horns a lot of people were wondering
about oh well doesn't this hurt the
Rhino to like put this camera into their
horn
no actually horns on rhinos are made
from a material that's really similar to
human fingernails so it actually it
doesn't hurt when you sew if you file
your nail down like it doesn't hurt you
it's the same thing with a rhino's horn
you can actually like drill a hole in it
and they place the little camera inside
and then they that's how it's set up so
pretty amazing and they actually want to
expand the technology it's not just for
rhinos they they're they're saying
they're developing a way to use this for
elephants because they're hunted for
their ivory for their tusks and then
tigers which are obviously endangered
and hunted for their pelts
so really fascinating stuff happening
and I like I I mean this is like a great
way for me like conservation like this
is a great way to do it have they caught
anybody well they just started so I
don't know if they've caught it I don't
think they've caught anybody yet but
they are basically this is now rolling
out so we'll see if this actually deters
it I know I think I'd read a statistic
saying like I was like either I think it
was 2007 there were only it was under a
hundred rhinos that have been poached
and then like last year or maybe the
year before it was like 1200 so just so
many and like it's really just out of
control at this point and really I mean
these these anti poaching teams like
they can they can try to do as much as
they can to get to these rhinos in time
but a lot of time like you just don't
know what's happening and so you just
find them and they've already been
killed and their horns
and it's just really sad so hopefully
these anti poaching teams will be able
to actually know like where they need to
go and win as opposed to just you know
having these sort of roaming patrols
that make it very easy for poachers kind
of get around and escape yeah without
being noticed so fingers crossed
poachers on notice and on that note
we're gonna take a quick break we'll be
right back with mod squad
maybe one of my favorites and that we've
ever done and of course your user
feedback and our phone talker for the
day so don't click away it's tomorrow
daily
welcome back to the show we've returned
it's a Wednesday which means we like to
doodle spotlighting on the Internet
community of people who like to make
stuff so this is mod squad we love Mario
Kart is that I mean that's kind of a
universal yes yes all right you consider
yourself a professional I'm not quite
but I'm good at it okay I'm good at it
not quite proudest not quite proud but
I'm a I could I can race I can race so
let's talk about how this guy loves
Mario Kart maybe put him anybody geek
sniffing calm is run by this guy who has
done a lot of really great mods and he
found out a club I guess a couple years
ago and now that he was having another
baby and so decided to like make his
nursery Mario Kart themed Mario Kart 8
themed I should say so here is this
guy's finished product which he showed
off it was on I saw it on Reddit
originally and then it's like all I
think I've been all over the internet
this week he painted all this stuff
using a grid system so like putting
something down and then you know drawing
all of the grid and then painting it in
square by square made it look like the
actual track was coming into the room
and then back into the walls so he did a
bunch of really cool stuff so here's the
mobile oh that's adorable it's just
amazing you got lack two there and then
it's he he made all of his friends and
family go to McDonald's and get the
Happy Meals with the Mario Cart toys and
then send him to him cool but he could
have a Mario Kart mobile which is really
awesome I love how some of them are
upside down like that's awesome they're
all like really really fun then they got
you know Luigi he said right when he was
starting this I think he was thinking
about doing a Luigi death stare but
didn't want to scare his kids like I
skip that is fine but here's where it
gets really cool so you see the track
coming down and around it swoops up it
goes it goes up high you got Yoshi on a
motorcycle and then on the ceiling the
road comes out of the wall and here it
is boom oh wow there's a full sized
Mario Kart right there on the ceiling
hanging upside down it is a and all of
those wheels were made with I think
epoxy heat this guy really
all out put down he said that the the
checkerboard grass he got it Michael's
like really expensive to lay on the
ceiling to make it look like it was part
of the track and he put in LED lighting
and all that it's like a full-on light
fixture of the mario he said he made the
cap out of something he did it's a
system he never tried before he bought
decals like he had decals made because
he's like I tried really hard to paint
it but it just didn't look right so I
ended up getting some decals custom cut
like all this stuff I mean this guy
really went all out so impressive
incredible ya know impress it's so cool
cost I don't even want to know
ballpark how many coins how many gold
coins so many gold coins Kaelyn so many
roughly sculpted it yeah he's straight
up maybe of this like this guy and then
the hat is separate like he made the Hat
separate so you could take it off and
it's it's set by magnet like you can
just take the hat off on this guy is
brilliant
yeah well I'm is the actual video like
how much does he I think it's like 12
minutes it's like a pretty long and too
in-depth video and then he also has an
album in on imager of like all of the
different steps that he did and he
actually has instructions for like just
about everything all the materials that
he used at geek smithing calm is this
guy's website if you want to go check
out like all the details its it is a
super-detailed post and he's got just
every bit of information you could
possibly imagine in there it's really
really impressive cool so great work
okay we got to talk about you guys we
asked you what kind of robots you on
pilot so let's hit user feedback
all right so hashtag TD bought pilot or
TD rofl pilot if you're watching on
Twitter because I accidentally mix them
up in my brain and wrote Robo instead of
bot that's my bad but you know I checked
both so it's all good is that one good
yep I mean you made up for it I did ok
so about those robots let's hear what
you want to pilot we'll wrote in and
said Matrix Revolutions mech suits and
do some target practice for science
reasons yeah like that one man about
this Oliver wrote in and said iron man
so I could take over Tony Stark ink and
buy a baseball jumbo sized screen to
play Portal and watch YouTube and
tomorrow do hahaha wait that's a lot of
stuff a lot of stuff but I like it yeah
I don't know why we didn't think of the
Iron Man suit I like the idea of playing
portal in a robot costume like me if you
play it like play as Atlas like that
would be the suit yeah they'd be pretty
be super meta they're really intense
yeah and then Gale wrote in and said
bender and then they put in a delightful
bender quote that you can't say haha
yeah it's a family show you know guys
I'm a shiny metal but yeah there you go
ok yeah somebody write in yeah and then
you could just drink alcohol that's how
you fuel the suit yeah exactly
if it's really good answers and and that
and and now of course it's time for our
very last piece of user feedback which
is always ever phone talker for the day
all right so Thomas wrote in and he said
I took this picture on my moto G 2014 of
a heart-shaped lake on tonal log I'm I
hope I'm pronouncing this right tonalá
G Mountain wicklow mountains Ireland so
this is an Ireland and that is a heart
shaped like like that yeah that's pretty
cool heart-shaped Lake oh I feel so
loved
however Thomas it's very aggravating to
show this to people in Los Angeles as we
are in a water shortage no water send us
that Lake very beautiful I'm gonna be
you're a heart-shaped Lake out of like
three drops of water in a little petri
dish that's about all it's about all the
water we have I don't know how far
civilization was away from that yeah I
wonder about that a lot of times we see
pictures from like Ireland because
everything there seems so green but it
also seems so far away from anything you
know it's like oh maybe there's like a
farm like a couple miles down there like
houses are like miles apart which
strikes me is so strange because it's
just something we're not used to or it
could just be a McDonald's it's like
right right behind it yeah I like that
idea just like turns around there's a
whole strip mall there it's amazing I'm
a really good picture super especially
on a moto G like that's not necessarily
known for its camera so that was a great
shot yeah was really good maybe it's
really good at outdoor stuff yeah if you
guys want to send in your photography
email us tomorrow at cnet.com we may ask
you to verify that you took the picture
and that you're giving us permission to
show it on the show but if you want to
find us on social media to talk to us
you can find us on tomorrow daily at
Twitter but really you want to hang out
with us you gotta come to our personal
accounts which is I'm not Ashley's gonna
know that kill anonymous it's pretty
easy if you want to send somebody to the
show send them to tomorrow daily comm
it's it's that easy I promise you and
that's it for the show today we'll be
back tomorrow with a brand new docket of
weird science facts in science fiction
crashing together blown up in your face
being all sorts of Awesome but until
then be it humans see you guys next time
