into your smart home with the $400 noon
smart lighting system starter kit noon
home offers layered light which is the
organization of ambient tasks and accent
lighting in a room in this kit that
replaces your current switches you'll
get one room director switch to
extension switches and three wall plates
the room director connects to your Wi-Fi
and noon identifies each light bulb in
the room by detecting how much power is
going to it from there the new NAP
guides you through three basic scenes as
well as customization options noon works
for nearly every type of common light
bulb including incandescent LEDs CFLs
implore essent bulbs it also includes
features like nightlight for motion
activated low-level lighting and
vacation modes for scenes mimicking your
daily patterns when you're out of town I
have two issues with the new smart
lighting system first the price tag a
$400 starter kit is a lot to pay for one
room of smart lighting if you purchase
separately the room director switch
costs $200 and each extension switch
cost $100 and that's pretty pricey for a
smart lighting system that lets you keep
your current bulbs but doesn't integrate
into the smart home as broadly as blue
trunks fixate a line of switches that
cost a lot less second it doesn't work
with lamps plugged into outlets or with
ceiling fan lights and the lamps aren't
such a big deal but there are several
rooms in my house where a ceiling fan is
also the main source of light if
professional lighting design is what
you're after noon looks great
brings layered light scenes into your
home and add smarts without replacing
every light bulb if you're looking for a
smart switch that plays nicely with lots
of smart home platforms and products
Lutron's casada switches are still your
best bet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
