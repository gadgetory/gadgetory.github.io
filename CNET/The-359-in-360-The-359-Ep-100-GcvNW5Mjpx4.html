don't we talk about that force episode 4
just to kick things off remember how
terribly awkward and terrible we were it
was also looking back it was on February
29th so we're not actually gonna have
another actual annual episode for
another four years
yes so the next Olympics basically but
yeah back then we weren't able to do it
in one take we had to have Brian our
producers twice everything together see
how far we've come so what were the big
big stories that we covered since then
over the past the biggest topics well
they're all kind of random order but I
guess we should start with early on
Apple FBI okay was a big story that sort
of popped up really right around when we
started the podcast yeah we talked about
that one a line and yeah I mean that
story had everything and it was kind of
we were all pretty disappointed how it
ended because you'd end with a whimper
yeah it was just like Oh basically the
FBI just pulled what it was doing and
they said like okay we're not gonna do
sunny warm bible this is a they
basically said i we've become a hacker
togetehr things we're good we're good
yeah no court battle needed so it's too
bad I was really hoping for that but
what are you gonna do
well next topic pokemon how do we not
talk about the last five months bout
time a pokemon and joan is our resident
pokemon live pokemon player she's
actually playing right now yeah she got
a pincer already with 880 combat 888
that's huge
I miss Annie Duran she's at level 18
she's dedicated maybe going overseas
she's gonna play pokemon go yeah
wherever she is she's got a lot of
drowsies and we're a little we're
actually well despoja by the lack of
Pokemon action here supposed to be oh
there's so many rad ads and Madison
Square Park kiddies it's for me it just
pigeons everywhere is the unusual one
who's opted not to take part at this
phenomenon maybe I'll start playing
every day after I leave you should start
playing when everyone else stops
stranger is still talking about it
though because when did it first
launched it was at least a couple weeks
ago if not a month ago or something yeah
usually with mobile games these things
tend to be a flash in the pan
yeah I didn't think it was gonna last
this long and maybe if maybe it's not
gonna be that much longer without well
look it's it's also ourselves summer
months kids are starting to go back to
school now so it's really now the real
test of whether or not this game has any
longevity right remember clash of clans
has been successful long time I play
that game for many many years I finally
deleted it it's like I'm getting away
finally I finally gave up yeah I feel
like we're gonna play during class
you're gonna just walk around and play
between classes I mean it's the perfect
time there just yeah if there's a
Bellsprout on your professors head you
gotta you got to catch it you gotta get
it moving on Donald Trump we spent a lot
of time time at Donald Trump
what's the tech angle there Oh handing
on Twitter right now also he was also
asking for iPhones we've built in
America which right ridiculous Ludacris
but you know that's Donald Trump for him
you looked into that right how my loaded
costume in America forget what it was
but it was a multiple there would be at
least double triple the price up here so
then we'd have to pay wide like six
hundred dollars are two six fifteen so
we're talking about no 1600's 16-under
what was the response from Donald Trump
supporters for that story oh they were
they were very appreciative of my
logical arguments no no they were
terrible and whatever reason my Twitter
follower follower base is a nice overlap
with Donald Trump supporters don't know
why but okay I least the vocal but the
RNC and I don't try both dominated
Twitter like it was just all over it's
true all the time you look very safe
yeah and there were there were a lot of
it beats Dylan Stephen Colbert show not
one of the night what the RNC yeah Oh in
terms of Twitter response that makes
sense I watch quite a bit of the RNC
crapped my pants it was wonderful one of
the other topics we talked about law was
AI definitely hey guys remember tan
Microsoft's yeah that's all thanks to
Twitter bag yeah I think I will ever
return I hope they're gonna Renee she'll
come back but in a different way or a
different floor I don't have a tape
brand it's kind of yeah well and then
when when we do the podcast again I'm
very excited to find out what happens
with Google home there's some AI
functionality with that jab right
basically the idea there is that you
should be able to have a two-way
conversation with your Google home which
is basically there are Amazon echo
competitive they're very excited to find
out I don't know how successful that
ends up being and I don't know maybe
I'll have both in my house I'm not sure
exactly which other
watching if we like undertaking me like
the new TV you just watch all of your
other right it was like terrible
entertainment can I like a tea party
with them like play dress-up like have
them sit around the table sadly yes one
topic we we talked all about virtual
reality okay we didn't bring up VR
talked about pretty much every other
week right excuse I think we complained
about it a lot though we take her like
it's too expensive it's not good enough
right who's like basically what we were
saying about VR the whole time was if
you go to a restaurant and say the
food's bad and there's not enough of it
right so maybe VR will get better but
you guys I tried the star wars demo the
lightsaber battle Sam was your friend oh
I thought it was great I mean I
typically get like a little nauseous
sometimes with VR but this one's no
wagon when it worked really well and the
graphics were good and I was finally
lived my dream of battling as a Jedi and
then the what was I usually I was on a
vibe I think yeah and that yeah it's
super responded they did a really good
job of it again the main complaint is
that thing is super expensive but you
have to buy a really nice high-end PC to
run it but that's the thing is like when
is it gonna go
being each to something that you use
every day even every other day long time
I think I have to be a happy one super
well gears cheap your Google cardboard
will do the Pipers like free look Google
cardboard the terrible experience and
killing that use it for about five or
ten minutes before it becomes a bear
yeah the big thing though they have to
deal with its overheating
right and battery life yeah I realize
for sure
and Liars sure alright keep following
court cutting talk book we're cutting a
lot the various training options Joan
our media expert I mean are we you know
live sport yeah the proof yeah there was
a lot of problems where all the social
media availability of interesting
stories kind of precluded people from
watching the life how many time through
spoiled by like a couple times
peeler expelled fell putting this yeah
four lakh people in again I'm a huge fan
of snapchat discover and all their like
live footage it's or what is that they
shot
so that's it right death the pay-tv is
the fact that someone's got a delivery
you want to watch it on your TV if you
want to watch your Netflix if you want
to watch your house of cards on a big
screen you need to have a good
connection to be able to watch it so
people that are usually delivering that
are providers like Comcast I guess so
hey we should kick it to questions at
some point right you start as an
experiment when you really know right we
didn't really know what this was gonna
end up being but turned out to be a
really fun exercise yes oh and by the
way it's Sims I wanted to give a shout
out to Sam our excellent New York intern
who's been doing some real kick-ass work
for us give a shout out the band new
anchor for pretty much the entire time I
was now a lot actually has changed since
we saw the show we had Joan rejoined our
team I became a dad and disappeared for
five weeks and we had Sam so lots of big
lots of big things happen during the
show yeah yeah the one thing that I like
that about yeah the one thing that I was
sad about when you came back was that I
had one thing that I instituted on the
show was that everybody I had guest
hosts that I would cycle in so Bridgette
would come on Scott Stein yep to the
cats Meyer a bunch of people and it
would give everybody a nickname when
they showed up so high as Akhtar would
be the wise and wonderful as Akhtar when
Jeff Bakalar finally showed up on the
show he was the Super Mario to my
Princess Toadstool
then when Brian came back he completely
put the kibosh on the nicknames
almost immediately I mean it made sense
like why would Nick name yeah I really
want a couple of a new nickname for you
every single day yeah they would have
gotten pretty dark right after realising
how awesome thank you very much we
didn't do Apple versus Samsung I thought
that was on her you know what you're
right forgot about Apple for Samsung the
Galaxy Note 7 definitely hot topic I
don't know I mean yeah every time we
talk about those subjects were we're
either accused of being icy net or world
whatever or Samsung or androids are we
ever accused of being for Samsung
yeah if they ever a bash Apple I feel
like Thea oh my gosh Android what is it
the other way the other way around I
have no idea I kind of lost literally I
seen it I'm track of my conspiracy but
there are a couple of trolls comments
