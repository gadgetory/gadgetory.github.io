next laptop you buy might be controlled
by a Minority Report style gesture
interface
I'm here with point grabs Assaf god and
we're looking at how this new technology
runs Windows 8 just by waving your hands
let's check it out
yes I'm just need to raise my hand and
the point grab application will detect
it as you can see I can control the
mouse very easily I can just grab and
select any one of the tiles move it I
can just swipe my hand to control and
see what else we have here in the Metro
menu I can select one of the tiles to
open the photo library for example very
easily browse the pictures and then when
I want to go back I just need to comes
up my hand and switch between the
application very easily I can also zoom
in zoom out
and again go back to the menu that is
really cool now don't your arms get
tired trying to wave your computer
instead of resting them on the keyboard
no so the idea is to use just very
short-range motions with the simple hand
gestures it will be very intuitive to
the users and it's just like talking
with a friend when you talk with your
hands you will talk with any device like
your PC or your mobile phone and what
hardware does this need in order to run
just a symbol to the camera that exists
in any device that we know today so so
this laptop that we're looking at here
this is just the standard laptop with
the built-in camera we're not we don't
have any special 3d technology nothing
nothing at all just a simple 2d camera
okay so when do we get this so it will
be available from several OEMs very soon
together with a Windows 8 launch in late
October and it is already exist in
several windows 7 laptops from vegeto
Acer and higher and it exists on the TVs
that we have out there we have more than
1 million users so that's point grab
running on Windows 8 machines the
Christmas laptops you buy might be
gesture controlled I'm reg Needleman
