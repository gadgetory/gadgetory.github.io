ribbon Apple's WWDC dropped a ton of
news on us and we're here to break it
all down the scene stealer had to be the
home pod a smart speaker and Apple's
first year product category since the
Apple watch two years ago
bad you're our resident smart speaker
expert mi hope so I'm not so what were
your initial brushes underwhelming
really it was I mean the name really
thrown off guard we were trying to guess
names yesterday and home pod was
absolutely not what the series speaker
was the best-sounding
I understand why they would want to call
it that I also think it's kind of funny
that everybody has been using home you
know essential the Handy Reuben no
relation company also came out with the
essential home yep where they're going
to introduce that there's the Google
home and now the home PI look this the
idea is this is the hub for your home
right I know that was just what all the
knows a little a little more creativity
from Apple might have been useful also
um I hate to say this because I I think
it's used a lot in tech circles but what
is the killer app for this product
especially because it's really 50 the
price is the killer at a price is gives
you like yeah I agree 49 that is twice
as much as an echo as the most expensive
that go i when you think about really
like fifty dollars for the cheapest echo
so really get what sigh feather those
you can get seven echo dots for the same
price and arguably the killer app is
supposed to be music yes you know it's
supposed to have woofers and tweeters
set overdose a seven tweeter beam array
set up that in Phil Schiller had trouble
explaining yeah basically just said you
don't understand any of this only that
it sounds amazing like well I kind of
should explain I just and solved it
right and us your money do it and that
being said Apple fanboys and people that
love Apple are going to buy this
no yeah guard look it's Apple you cannot
dismiss anything Apple comes out with
this could be a start of something big
they always come out with something that
that seems overly crazy expensive and
something like the iPhone was
I first came out so we'll see how well
does over the long term a next up I want
to talk about the iPad pro Apple
introduced a ten point five inch version
this is sort of like the Goldilocks
version right sure it's too big once you
small this is theoretically really just
about an iPad yeah we are I mean what's
so interesting about this other than the
fact that it's the medium sized version
that's basically it do really mean you
do anything else it does the same thing
as the iPad pro it's faster
disappointingly the display is actually
the same resolution as the previous one
okay not a huge amount of upgrade I
would like to give Apple because we we
haven't you know this is this is
somewhat critical at this point so let's
give them some credit for the iMac Pro
which granted is a serious amount of
money at five thousand dollars yeah I'd
boy did they pack in a ton of crazy
specs into this thing and it's
definitely a way to get their loyal
fanbase of pros designers much more
excited they haven't done a good job of
serve camera to the last few years have
been pretty rough for professionals
looking to use Apple machines because
they just haven't really they've really
pushed more for mainstream customers so
alright lastly Apple availed AR kit set
of tools for developers start building
augmented reality experiences for the
iPhone and the iPad Scott had his
impressions that actually looks
surprisingly good
Scott Stein Scott stock Scott Steiner
our resident mobile reviewers everywhere
I think yeah we'll see we'll see what
they end up doing with it it makes a lot
of sense that they would push it out at
WWDC get developers excited and their
arse even happen there are even was once
this thing turns on they'll have the
largest platform in the world for AR
because of the huge base of iPhones and
iPads are out yeah yeah we'll see we'll
see
I mean Microsoft uses that bet that
argument with Windows 10 devices too so
we'll see how much it holds water
alright for more of that check us out
seen it I'm Roger Tsien I'm Ben Fox
Ruben thanks for listening
all right so par for anymore errors on
my part I think we're okay for the rest
of the day it's all good uh mr. Steve
Austin in the chat great name by the way
what's up Steve Austin am I the only one
that thinks that the home pod is
extremely overpriced less
functionalities for a higher price point
only at Apple now I don't know not down
in that personally I agree much the
universal consensus is it's pretty
freaking over price I don't think that I
would pay for this thing personally like
if if we were to get a review sample
well sure I would try it out so look I
think the well you can see by the way
apples spinning this right they're not
trying to really push this as a smart
speaker first they really spent a lot of
time talking about the music aspect the
sound aspect you know that I think
they're trying to pick themselves
against like Sonos or these kind of you
know mid-range to high-end speakers you
know they argue that relative to those
speakers they're actually a pretty good
deal let me ask you this then why not
call it something related to Beats or
why didn't they mention beats at all I
would say my argument there is that
they're trying to eventually phase out
the beats brand so why did they spend a
billion dollars on that company no they
have a lot of money okay um no let me
look they bought it for the the
subscription service that they were they
sort of had the right and the bra trust
right the brain trust dr. Dre g-man
indeed so you know the billion dollars
for Apple that's a drop in the bucket
it's just I was thinking like when you
for for a long time when you thought of
like premium to your headphones or like
more expensive headphones you thoughts
definites yep so to me that seemed to
make sense I agree absolutely makes
sense I think with home pod which I'm
still trying to wrap my round my mind
around I mean they're trying to
obviously work off the air pause at the
iPod name the iPod name was huge back of
the past yeah sorry
great but the iPod brand was huge back
in the day I just feel like it's sort of
it's definitely lost a lot of its cachet
though what well yeah I'm a pod Yeah
right like they were trying to lick iPod
to home Paul you're like alright but how
many people actually own an iPod anymore
I wouldn't have been surprised if they
named it something like the
pull home or the Apple whatever I don't
know it's I don't I don't love the name
and I don't know who the customer base
is going to be for this other than Apple
loyalists yeah um but yeah I agree with
Steve Austin then it is it does seem
pretty expensive for something that an
echo or Google home could do for a far
lower price yeah enough it's funny you
guys should bring up beats because
imagine soggy says funny that the
company that brought beats into their
target market cares about high quality
sound ooh yeah yeah fair enough
that is big ouch and what's up imagine
soggy and for the record imagine soggy I
I agree with you
Danny Green our boy Danny Green yeah I
kind of like the concept of the home pod
the name is not good I would have to
hear it in my house before I would buy
it also it should be sold as a pair for
that price so the same pretenses yes the
price issue yeah I mean I think that's
the that's a big question mark right
just listening to the sound quality I
mean I don't think Danny good luck
trying to get the whole pot into your
home try out before you've writing it
but I guess you can return it but yeah I
mean ultimately if Apple spent that much
time talking about the sound quality you
really have to experience what that's
like if it's really like up like Bose
speakers that happen to be smart yeah if
they I think they sold it like that I
could kind of wrap my mind around a
little bit better if it's so like that
but I don't think it's I don't think
that's good there is a very easy work
around if you want Bose speakers that
are smart you just plug them to your
echo yeah you collect an echo but those
because what an echo dot though speakers
are more expensive oh right yeah but
like if that's the target market then
you're gonna spend even more money for
like really really high-end Bose
speakers and then get you know Alexa
functionality yeah yeah yeah to it what
do you think of the look of this thing
by the way we haven't talked about and I
wasn't that crazy no I I think it's fine
I don't think it's again I don't think
it justifies the price for a company
known for its design I don't I don't
think it's like a beautiful work of art
er no that's kind of how I felt
yeah - when I first saw it I was just
like really that's what you guys have
been working for years is the Ala video
I'm not trying to rap on it too much but
that's that was those were my immediate
impressions were that the name was not
great I take away that cool I take away
from it was is this why you guys did the
the trashcan Pro years ago you just test
driving a shape back bro it is look a
lot like that well more than a lot and
make more sense in this configuration as
a tiny little nugget speaker than it
ever did as a desktop computer that's my
take away yeah um and related though
let's go in and Charles says it's pricey
but none of the other speakers will work
with Apple music I'm pretty sure that's
an interesting thought that is you're
kind of married in ah yeah if you're if
you're the Apple ecosystem that's that's
pretty I mean it's clear like this this
has additional benefits for you but you
know there other music services yeah
that's the problem is that they made no
mention of Amazon music Spotify Pandora
yeah so you think you're really stuck in
if you're Apple your Apple and if you're
anything else you're everything else I
mean I think that's that would be a huge
mistake if they came out with this thing
because I think it is early remember
this thing doesn't come out to December
so they probably are working on the
partnerships mm-hmm and so I imagine
some of those partnerships will come you
will probably have Pandora and Spotify
and all these other services because it
just seems dumb if they if they just
made it Apple music like it just
otherwise that nice yeah but if you're
already in the Apple ecosystem like
Charles you're pretty good to go yes yes
you listen that's a limited market right
Apple said yesterday that has 27 million
Apple music subscribers that that's a
big number but there are 450 million
Spotify subscribers so it's you know
there are there's a much bigger market
out there that Apple would be losing out
on if it just made it an Apple music
only service like I mean I'm a prime
customer but I don't pay for prime music
and there's free music there for me for
my echo like that just seems like a much
better deal for me like there's no way I
would consider going to an apple I'm
sorry a home pod if it meant like I had
to commit to Apple music yeah I agree
Jacob Kraft says how well do you think
the premium audio argument will go given
the chromecast Audio exists right
yeah that's thought oh similarly echo
dot I mean I think that's that's gonna
be tough
sell for Apple given that there are the
universe's of high-end speakers out
there that already in people's homes
yeah one of the things that we were
talking about here too was uh for
certain folks that already own a Google
home or an echo let's say you spend $180
on an echo you spend $130 on a Google
home it's possible that you have
multiple echos because you also got the
$50 echo dot that you could throw
somewhere else like in your garage or a
bedroom whatever what exactly justifies
throwing those out or just you know
unplugging them or yeah spending three
hundred and fifty dollars on a
completely different eco so yeah I think
you don't right like at this point
there's nothing that Apple showed me
that would convince me to like get rid
of the existing hardware that it
actually that if you got you've got a
home entertainment system building up
you got like a Sonos TV bar as someone a
chav you know how well is it going to
integrate with everything else but Danny
Green points out what if the Apple TV
talks to it but are you really going to
outfit your entire home with home pods
for the sake of a sound system I don't
think so
that's not self-sustaining unless they
start developing that software into a
legitimate like 5.1 system which I don't
foresee happening in Xiamen in your
future mmm like I don't think these
things are gonna suffice as a sound
system yeah they're a decent little
speaker I'm sure they are but that's
about as far as I'm gonna give them I
think I will see what we don't really
know right because it's still still
development and so I would give it the
benefit of doubt at least I would at
least listen to it before making any
kind of judgments on the audio quality
sure fair enough but I do like what you
mentioned as far as Apple TV integration
with like a MacBook or Apple TV or some
of the other Apple products these are
the types of things that you expect from
Apple and those might be you know those
types of really smooth integrations
might be something that actually
convinces people to start buying this
stuff I mean the idea of expanding at
Charles points out you can put this in
your bedroom the idea of expanding your
pre-existing system would be kind of
nice but again you have to be in the
Apple ecosystem yet they have an Apple
TV going on listening to Apple music
subscribed and then it's like oh I'm
going to walk over to my my bedroom or
my bathroom and I want that music to
follow me there that's that's where that
comes in the place yeah but he'll do
immerses yeah
by multiple apples home pods like that
sounds ooh yeah uh if you got too much
money I guess that's that's what you do
so let's get some comments about
people's favorite parts of the
presentation
imagine soggy says AR was the best part
of the presentation but it was weird
that they talked about IKEA and didn't
connect it with their products virtually
shown in your space that's a good point
that's really good I mean I think partly
it might be because it's not quite ready
yet I don't I don't know it's like they
showed a couple of like preset demos and
that was it I think they kind of stuck
to the script there I agree I think AR
is definitely really exciting as a whole
as a topic it's very exciting I think
the fact that Apple kind of showed off
what Apple showed off was actually
pretty cool
considering actually worked pretty well
and I think from where I stand it it
kind of works with any iPhone yet any
iPhone but uh I think it's a certain
version like you 6s or higher or
something I think in general just Ana AR
is still in that that's pretty neat
phase yeah yeah there isn't much to it
there's not a whole lot of depth no I
thought a meat on those bones frankly
Google's done the best job of explaining
why AR matters with google lens right
the idea of like you know shining it on
a restaurant and getting open table of
information or yelp information that
that to me is like an instant like okay
I get that right everything else has
been kind of like just sort of playing
around right yeah like putting like a
pot of coffee on this table which was
part of the demo yes it looked like it
worked but right but also like what's
the relevance be sub beyond like looking
at go well that's cool like how's my
life better for this virtual coffee cup
well they also did like um like a video
game on that table Lego Batman thing
which actually was kind of cool it was
cool but um it's kind of like I wouldn't
end up playing that like I'm in public
much no cuz like don't you have to like
move around and that we kind of mess I
mean I think you could just rotate
around it's not like you're really don't
even have like not like running through
the Train Joe finishing or something
that would be pretty sweet and horrible
uh yeah ooh our old buddy Yahoo yeah
boom the best thing that happened in
dead
DC was the iOS 11 and iPad pro now I can
replace my laptop for an iPad wow that's
a bold statement
I mean he's not wrong though they put a
lot under the hood this time around I
put some like really basic functionality
ya see that with the idea to replace a
laptop he's not wrong
yeah I don't know if we're quite there
yet I think they definitely made some
progress towards making the iPad pro
more of like a PC but I don't know if it
completely replaces it like I'm not
comfortable with like I think someone
has suggested the whole touch cover with
the touchpad keyboard with a touchpad
like unless we have something with that
kind of tactile precise control I'm not
really comfortable switching away from
it but you're a more power user than say
a large portion of the Apple audience
were like I but I post my mom on Apple
after the longest time because she kept
getting viruses because she's a mom yeah
yeah so he put her on Apple she's a
little more safe it's a little more
simple it's a little more user friendly
and if you're just doing a lot of email
and a lot of Facebook and a lot of
crushing but if you do with that you
don't need an iPad pro you just need an
iPad truth cheaper turn iPad pro they're
they're trying to go after professionals
trying to convince people that mmm not
well they're trying to go out just
because it's in the name yeah no not
professionals like workstation level
professionals they're trying to go after
people who will do work on their iPad
and I feel like that argument it's not
quite there yet yeah I think at the even
for casual users adding very basic
functions like drag-and-drop yeah that
file sharing system which granted like I
was watching it my eyes are glazing over
being like this is stuff that's been
available in pcs for 20 years right but
at the same time it goes back to yeah
throughs point that this just makes it
just a little bit easier yeah
ditch your laptop just don't want to I
just don't think it's quite there yet
okay I disagree with you but if somebody
really wants to switch over to a tablet
this this does help them along that way
like whenever anyone asked me about that
when I say if you really want to work on
your tablet like use the surface pro mmm
like don't use this I mean yeah it's
just more that's nice that's a good
point I think there's a greater number
people that they're like yeah ooh maybe
awethu is this person and other people
who are more prone to just go for the
the ease
later session and if they're gonna just
continue the air then what choice you
really have at that point what the
MacBook Air yeah they did not
discontinue it but like it saved it
there's still what it really save it
know how much time do you think it
really got left if they're going this
route with tablets yeah that seems like
it's a conflict of interest to an extent
it's yeah I was hoping for more about
the MacBook Air and it was hilarious
that's a point a actually talked about
it like we some of the editors here
bistec like it was such a quick notice
they're like oh yeah the MacBook Air is
also getting a bump in the specs are gay
livin worse a little bit more mega hard
uh it was part of the vine put didn't
even merit like appears to present a
lapel slide with all the here's our home
back lineup by the way the MacBook Airs
can upgrade to like literally that's
what it was been treated we there was a
debate back and forth among something
editors like did the MacBook Air
actually get an upgrade like some some
actually miss it because it was so it
was just sort of like squeeze at the
last second if you blinked yep because
just as easily said and we're
discontinuing them and the weird thing
is when you go on the site we looked it
up that's why there was actually that
debate we go on the Apple site you go to
the back section every Mac says do
except the MacBook Air
it's the way to say like they got the
upgrade that shows that they got it was
actually a you buy MacBook Air now I
think the you'll get the faster
processor it doesn't say anywhere in
that section that it's do like they do
not want you to buy that thing okay so
is the argument then like the air is the
most sufficient in what it's supposed to
no no the MacBook Air basically is
Apple's way of saying we have a very
affordable one thousand dollar laptop
for you that's that's what we have
that's what I mean it's sufficient in
this role where people are like I wish
the iPad did more of this and it's like
they're Pro computers aren't pro enough
we need more power the air is just like
it's an air yeah I mean I think Apple
kind of has it out there so they can say
they've got a affordable quote unquote
affordable laptop they don't wash it by
that they they want you buy a MacBook
Pro what's the highest when the MacBook
Pro the MacBook you know it's it's $300
more right it's something like two or
three hundred dollars more to get the
lowest of lows MacBook Pro well how much
is the MacBook just the MacBook the
MacBook
remember it might be $1,500 fourteen or
fifteen hundred dollars yeah they did
drop they just dropped the price MacBook
Pro the cheapest one the non touch bar
one 1200 1300 I believe yeah I mean like
if you're already shelling out a
thousand dollars three hundred more
dollars that's what they want is a lot
of money that's due but that's what they
wanted dissented they look at the
thousand dollar one they look at the one
that's like the step up there like well
this was so much nicer so I'll just get
that one it's just yes followed apples
game alright let's get to a couple more
comments and then we gotta wrap it up
for the day Jesse gateman in the chat
says Jesse Jesse they gave us a
drag-and-drop function that he mentioned
yesterday you got it yes that's right
Jesse you win again and he also includes
that the iPad dock was cool we needed
that iPad dock right was there a pet dog
Oh the mice yes yeah yeah interface yes
yeah
not a physical dog I got a dog knows the
expanded dock at the bottom of the
screen okay yeah yeah cuz it's more like
like Mac OS yeah exactly
they're definitely becoming the ideas
like a predictive like it'll show up
like it will have apps that show up all
the dock that it thinks should we use
neck is kind of cool great they have
that predictive functionality on the
iPhone already and it's not particularly
useful for me I've ever use it yeah
alright and lastly obby was uh very uh
enthralled with the video and photo
compression he says that sounds oh yeah
that was smart totally I think people
completely missed that but it's huge
like my wife constantly runs out of
space because she's taking concert
photos of videos of our kid and that
have that extra compression definitely
makes a huge difference very very smart
yeah oh yeah nothing super
earth-shattering to an extent but it
will make lives are you very very
practical very useful for sure I think
so yeah alright I think that's about the
right place to wrap it up for the day
that was fun everybody - with our little
technical faux pas and the data it won't
happen again I promise
probably will but it's all good all
right take us home all right if you
liked anything you saw or heard here
check us out on CNET our podcast is also
available on itunes google play music
soundcloud feed BRR
tune in to did and I missing anyone I
don't know
at good enough CEO tomorrow see you
tomorrow
