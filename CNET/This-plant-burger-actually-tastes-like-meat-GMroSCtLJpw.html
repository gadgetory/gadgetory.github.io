burger but does it taste like a burger
this is the impossible burger made from
plant products rather than ground beef
compared to a beef burger it requires
one-quarter of the amount of water to
produce wheat protein potato protein
coconut oil and soy are all ingredients
but there's one component that makes
this very different from any other
veggie burger out there so this is the
magical ingredient it's called a heme
and it's the molecule that carries
oxygen around the blood and makes red
meat red this is totally derived from
Fonts that's gonna taste
a little bitter on the back of the mouth
and tight slightly metallic but I can
definitely sense is a meat profile in
there and that's why it supposed to
taste like meat when it's in the
impossible burger you can cook the
burger to your liking whether that's
blood red rare or well done Brown we've
done meatballs we've done a Greek
moussaka right now you can try the
burger at high-end restaurants in New
York and San Francisco but the makers
say in the next few years we should
expect it to be available for home
cooking got projects going on that are
working on making what you call whole
cuts of meat that would be like steak or
pork chop and fish and cheese's so is it
really tasty enough to turn a carnivore
into a herbivore does not taste like
meat when you eat it isolated on its own
when you put it in the context of the
burger it's actually pretty tasty it's
got the sauce it's got a good amount of
caramelization and a little bit of that
crust on the edge it's really good in
the burger I wouldn't have it on a patty
in its own because it's a little dry but
I would say definitely I would try it
again if I didn't want to have a meat
burger but I still want a real meat girl
