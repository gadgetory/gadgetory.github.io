portable drive foam Seagate now the
drive here is to replace the oh by K +
slim that came out last year how do you
know I have the brand new unit of the O
drive right here I take a look
they both very similar except the ultra
slim is slimmer H's coin 3/8 inch where
the other one is at 0.5 inch now in
testing the new one is also faster with
the sustain real wound speed up some 150
megabytes per second for writing and
some 170 megabyte per second for reading
but most importantly this one also come
in go nothing beats that really and
guess what it's also come in silver or
platinum you can call this so how do I
know well because I have another brand
new unit of that right here but the new
drive is great if you want to backup
your laptop on the go or just extend the
storage space and as a Cottagers $90 for
Tutera buy it's quite a deal really but
it could be better though if it had a
USB C port instead of this regular micro
USB 3.0 right here and by the way the
new drawer is also available in one
terabyte for just $70 how do you know
why because I have one where is it I'll
just take my word for it
you do that anyway right that's because
I'm down low and this is a Seagate
backup plus ultra slim portable drive it
was it was right here
hey guys I need my drive back okay
