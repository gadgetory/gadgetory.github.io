which is the latest toys to life game
that's come out so think Skylanders but
instead of actually just putting toys on
to a portal and never touching them
again you actually get to build them in
real life using real life Lego alright
so I've been playing NBA 2k16 actually
got to play against my boy Andy and I
wipe the floor with him with the doves
go warriors pick that game look do this
step in my world yeah I've been playing
for 26 and even though doesn't seem like
there's big improvements over the last
year the game is the most comprehensive
driving game that's out now this week
I've been playing a lot of Jotun it's
awesome because it's got really
difficult gameplay style of kind of like
a Dark Souls feel but then it's also
really beautiful because it's all hand
drawn can't get another game like it so
this week I'm playing a game called soma
it is a psychological survival horror
game that takes place on this base
you're not sure where you are
and it has these like cute mashups of
all these different franchises and it's
such a great game play with kids 60
frames per second is the most cars the
best feeling driving with a controller
it's great
if you are feeling the Halloween vibes
this month make sure you check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
