Bakalar from CNN com and it's time to
get loaded a CNN exclusive report says
sprint will be launching its own 4G LTE
network early next year right now sprint
uses wimax and this upgrade will put it
on par with carriers like Verizon and
AT&amp;amp;T who have the more advanced 4G
technology and if reports are true that
means all three carriers will be getting
the iphone except for t-mobile Sprint is
planning to announce details of the LTE
network and an event next week the rumor
train is chugging along next stop the
kindle android tablet that supposedly
will be announced wednesday techCrunch
reports it'll be called the kindle fire
and it'll have a 7-inch display about
the same size as blackberries playbook
when the news comes out tomorrow expect
amazon to rave about all the media that
can be played on it they have about
11,000 streaming shows for prime
subscribers after that new deal they
just signed with Fox and the Wall Street
Journal says amazon just made several
deals with magazine publishers as well
kindle isn't the only tablet with rumor
news Mashable is reporting that the
facebook ipad app will finally be
released and likely it'll be announced
the same time as the iphone 5 on October
fourth apparently this app has been done
for some time but sources say the
release was held up because Apple and
Facebook just couldn't agree on terms
but apparently Facebook won't disagree
over one thing tracking your every move
even if you're signed out of Facebook
the news broke after a self labeled
hacker from Australia made a blog post
showing that Facebook's cookies will
track the pages you visit after you log
off Facebook's response the cookies are
designed to prevent phishing attacks and
Facebook won't use the data they collect
facebook says they're looking at ways to
avoid having the data collected but it
will quote take a while sure Facebook we
understand that's no problem we totally
trust you in other facebook news the
service Spotify is requiring new users
to have a Facebook account to sign up
for the service and it's ticking off
users who don't like the idea of
every single song they're listening to
with Facebook servers discussion boards
are flooded with displeased users who
say it's a deterrent from joining hey I
don't blame them it's not like I want
people knowing I listened to air supply
on repeat I just told everyone but you
can always turn off the option to share
by heading to facebook's privacy
settings under apps and websites there's
even a how-to today on cnet.com from the
digital-to-analog social network one man
in canada proves you can still do it
old-school style by chucking bottles
into the ocean for 15 years Harold
Hackett has sent more than 4,800
messages into the Atlantic Ocean and
he's even gotten more than 3,100 replies
