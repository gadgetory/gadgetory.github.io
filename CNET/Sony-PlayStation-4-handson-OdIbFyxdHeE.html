cnet.com so make sure you come back in a
few days and we're gonna have a newly
updated video now unlike last generation
there's only one model of the ps4 for
sale and it goes for four hundred
dollars and that's a hundred dollars
cheaper than the Xbox one now the whole
console itself is smaller than you might
think it's actually considerably smaller
than the Xbox one it's got a nice glossy
and matte finish and it's a pretty slick
looking piece of hardware it's got a
very sort of specific angular simple
design there's two USB 3.0 ports up
front next to the slot-loading blu-ray
disc drive and the power and eject
buttons are up front there
touch-sensitive it's kind of nice around
back is fairly simple there's an optical
audio out an HDMI and Ethernet port and
an auxiliary port for the optional
PlayStation camera and that does not
come in the box now under the hood of
the PlayStation 4 we've got 8 gigabytes
of ddr4 ram and eight cords CPU and a
raid on next engine GPU so all those
numbers aside this is basically on par
with what you might get in a mid to
high-end gaming PC so here is the
DualShock for the new controller for
PlayStation 4 it's really awesome it's a
great evolution from where the DualShock
3 was up front you see obviously it's
dominated by this touchpad which
actually clicks it's its own button it's
kind of like a trackpad which you might
find on a laptop now start and select
have been replaced by share and options
and there's actually a speaker on the
front of the controller as well and it
sounds a lot better than what you might
remember with the Wii Remote but again
it's one little speaker on a controller
thankfully you can turn it off
the analog sticks have a refacing as
well they're no longer those like really
slippery dome sort of coverings now
they're embossed they have some some
some rubberized coating here really a
comfortable controller around back you
can see the the l1 r1 and all those
buttons and the triggers have been
redesigned and the triggers are so much
better than before now they kind of flip
out a little bit much easier to pull and
then of course around back is the LED
color light and if you're using the
PlayStation camera this is how the
PlayStation will know which player you
are and then you also you got the micro
USB charging port at the bottom one more
thing there is a headset jack you can
plug in like a voice headset to chat
online and then there's another port
that I don't know what it's gonna do yet
so we'll have to wait and see so if you
look behind me here is the PlayStation 4
interface and again we're going to
update this when the day one patch comes
out it might change the way it looks a
little bit but here's where your access
all the PlayStation 4's functionality
the PlayStation Network and the store
are really woven into this interface a
lot different from last time the cross
media bar is no longer they're calling
this the dynamic menu it blends
everything together and an easy-to-use
presentation all right so what about the
games right everyone wants to know about
the games graphically speaking ps4 games
look great there's no doubt about it but
don't expect the same wow factor that
happened last generation if you remember
we were going from sd to HD that's not
the case this time around the jump is
way bigger back then this time around
not so much the games look great but
it's not as jaw-dropping as it was from
like PlayStation 2 to PlayStation 3 for
instance there's a lot more information
in there a full review so make sure you
go and read that I talked about how the
Xbox one and ps4 stack up and what the
future holds for each system again don't
forget we're gonna update this video
very soon so be sure to keep checking
back right here at CNN I'm Jeff Bakalar
for cnet.com and this has been the Sony
PlayStation 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
