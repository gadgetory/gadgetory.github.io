earr bluetooth sports headphone that can
be had for less than $30 online and is a
very popular product on Amazon anchors
made a name for itself by selling a host
of budget mobile phone accessories that
are relatively inexpensive but managed
to avoid looking cheap the same can be
said for these earphones which might
have been made in the same Chinese
factory that makes similar looking
wireless earphones for other online-only
brands like taotronics sound but slim
have a simple elegance to them and
seemed to be steadily built with metal
housings and a fairly thick cord we're
also sweat resistant and come with a
basic carrying pouch for storage battery
life is rated at seven hours at moderate
volume levels which is fairly decent the
most important thing for me was that
they fit well they come with four
different size silicone ear tips and
three different size sports hooks to
help lock the bud in place the larger
tips and hooks allow me to get a secure
tight seal which is crucial to
maximizing sound quality the cord may be
a little short for some people but was
fine for me and the buds are magnetic so
you can wear the earphones around your
neck like a pendant when you're not
listening to them USB charging port is
in the inline remote which is where the
microphone for making calls also lives
for their low price these earphones
deliver good sound and I think most
people will be satisfied but it wouldn't
say they sound great and they're only
okay for making calls the bass is a
little loose by that I mean it's a
little bloomy and the treble has a touch
of a harsh edge to it the way I dealt
with those issues was to lower the
volume but if you like to play your
music loud this may not be the headphone
for you however for those of you looking
for a decent set of cheap wireless
headphones for both gym and everyday use
the sound bud slim are a good choice and
my current favorite anchor bluetooth
headphones I'm David carnet for cnet.com
