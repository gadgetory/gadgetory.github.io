all the pros and cons of the different
engine configurations but each is good
at or bad at and even then no two engine
geeks on earth really agree with each
other let alone me so we're not going to
go super deep into that instead I'm
going to lay out and visualize for you
how each major engine layout is done and
give you some conventional wisdom on
what its benefits are okay the inline
engine is perhaps the simplest most
basic and most common this is an inline
four one of the Ford EcoBoost motors and
this gets its name because the cylinders
are arranged in a line if you look down
from the top inline four is a very
common inline sixes are very common
these engines are known for being very
compact lightweight simple inexpensive
to build relatively and because these
engines are so compact and they're
almost square if you viewing from the
top you can mount them either way
longitudinally running the length of the
car or transversely running across the
car and many different cars use one or
the other now the V engine you know
mostly has V sixes and v8s these days
although you can go all the way down to
V twins and motorcycles v4 Saab launched
afford have all made those back in the
day but the conventional v8 looks like
this here's your ford shelby v8 for
example and there's your v right there
in the front you've got one set of four
Pistons and cylinders that are laying
over this way another set laying over
this way it's kind like you took two
in-line fours married them to one
crankshaft and just tilted them apart so
they could live in one space the key
here is that you're fitting a lot of
cylinders into a relatively compact
space especially when you get to higher
cylinder counts like six or eight or ten
this v8 if you made it into an inline
eight would be like this long it
wouldn't fit in just about any car out
there but by nesting it in a V
configuration you gain some width but
you lose a lot of length
the other key nuance around the engines
this varies by maker is the angle of
this V are those cylinders almost
touching are they laid out much further
apart the angle of that V is one of the
secret sauce items for engine designers
v8s and v6s are also known as being
inherently pretty well balanced and of
course because they pack a lot of
cylinders into a smaller space they do
get a lot of power they're known as
high-performance engines in most cases
the W is in many ways a derivation of
the V the most common example these days
is the VW Group design that includes a
w8 in some Audi r8 a w12 and some
Bentley's and a W 16 in the Bugatti
Veyron now visualize this w as a pair of
V engines that are mated together to
drive a single crankshaft and in this VW
design each of those V sets of cylinders
are nested so they overlap a bit if you
run an imaginary line sort of down the
set of them this W has the V engines
benefits of putting a lot of cylinders
in a short space but also its own
benefits of putting a lot of cylinders
in a narrower nested space
now the rotary engine in the car world
this really means the Wankel rotary
engine that has been used in Mazdas for
several decades inside an egg-shaped
combustion chamber there's a
triangle-shaped rotor that turns or
rotates with the combustion in the
spaces that it creates as it spins and
geared down the middle of that rotor is
the shaft that turns and feeds the
transmission now because Wankel rotary
don't have a bunch of pistons and other
parts that are jerking up and down
violently changing direction every
split-second they can spin at higher
rpms and do so smoothly without
self-destructing on the downside they've
long struggled with highest fuel
consumption and emissions and a struggle
for a lot of power largely due to the
trickiness of ceiling those three tips
of the rotor as it sweeps around the
inside of the engine and it's terrain of
spark plug ports and intake and exhaust
openings now let's talk about a flat
engine also there's a boxer or a
horizontally opposed engine this is one
of the most famous right here in a
Ferrari Testarossa it's a flat 12 you've
got six cylinders on each side as you
can kind of see there and on the other
side are six more and they are exactly
flatly opposed to each other 180 degrees
apart the point here is you've got a
very low engine because the thing sticks
up it can be a low motor that sits low
in the car giving you a lower center of
gravity great for performance and
cornering it's also an engine that is
good if you're trying to package the
body low for a low sleek design take a
look at let's say a Subaru BRZ they were
able to get a low center of gravity and
alone knows because they've got a flat
engine in there these are called boxers
because they have pairs of cylinders
Pistons in them that are punching
together at one time in any given
direction flight engines are also known
for being very balanced because their
pistons and connecting rods are
literally in exact opposition things
tend to just work themselves out and not
have a lot of weird vibration or moments
that have to be counteracted with other
apparatus like counterweights
these are engines that are known very
well from Subarus they have fours and
sixes that are their famous boxers and
of course the Porsche 911 is a flat 6
