new integration between Amazon Alexa and
the August smart lock so we have a
first-generation August smart lock on
the front door there over here on the
table it's a little dark not sure you
can see we've got an Amazon echo dot
device
so the idea is that now you can do some
basic controls through echo to control
all your smart lock with your voice
so give an idea to set up here so we've
got the lock on the door we've got the
dot on the table there and down here
we've got the August Kinect which is the
piece you're going to be ignore for this
to work and what that does this is a
bridge between the lock and the Wi-Fi
network and that's how it likes the
talks to the lock is through Wi-Fi so
they're only a few commands we can do
here here's one Alexa tell August to
lock the front door
I asked August to log front door to
update the status would you like me to
check the state of the log uh LexA tell
ours to check the state of the lock door
it was locked
what would you like to do next so one
thing you can't do yet with the LexA and
August is unlock the door August tells
us that's coming but they still need to
work out some of the security detail so
it heads up for that it may also
eventually become a native integration
with Alexa so you won't have to do that
extra Alexa tell August Steph you can
simply say Alexa lock the front door and
it should work those are the basics of
the new integration between August and
Alexa thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
