iPad Mini and the new IMAX and the new
Mac this and that but hardly anybody
talks about the humble max Mini or as I
like to call it the perfect home theater
PC we have one here and we are about to
unbox it all right the Mac Mini is such
an interesting little computer it has
pretty good specs and a ton of storage
and I assume that they're still making
it to be kind of a home theater computer
but meanwhile they're trying to sell you
Apple TV boxes in fact look at how they
highlight the connectivity on the box
right off the bat they're like USB HDMI
firewire Thunderbolt this thing it's
meant to be plugged in empowering things
let's get out of here ten little brick
pretty heavy actually it's kind of funny
it's the graveyard of lost connectors
like they're still doing fire we're only
on the Mac Mini killed it everywhere
else
oh look at this it's like a really big
Apple TV so funny it's like a computer
all right there we go
simple sleep media receiver let's find
out what we have in the box before we do
our specs we've got our little
instructional packet Deeley power this
is really the power brick for this thing
it's a little Wow
I have to say that doesn't seem like it
would be a huge feature but that's a
huge feature there's no massive brick
here that is contributing to a tidier
home theater cabinet and I approved
you've also got a dongle actually in HD
looks like DVI to HDMI dongle which is
pretty useful so clearly I mean as soon
as you start taking this thing out of
the box you get the idea that this is
meant to be part of your home theater
setup it's just so interesting that they
don't talk about it they talk about
Apple TV when this is so much more
flexible all right on to the specs the
Mac Mini comes in two versions there's a
2.5 gigahertz dual-core Intel Core i5
that starts at $599 or you can get a 2.3
gigahertz quad-core intel core i7 Ivy
Bridge that one 799 it's configurable to
up to 2.6 gigahertz by the way on that
quad-core model
it weighs 2.7 pounds it's about a inch
and a half tall is seven point seven
inches wide and deep so it's a little
square the $5.99 model has 500 gigs of
storage the $7.99 model actually has a
built in terabyte it has integrated
Intel graphics and four gigs of onboard
memory that's configurable up to 16 gigs
let's get to the ports
there is Thunderbolt you have a firewire
800 port for USB 3 ports an HDMI port an
SDXC card slot so you could offload your
photos onto this device Gigabit Ethernet
audio in and out and of course an IR
receiver now one thing you'll note is
that there is no optical drive on the
Mac Mini Apple is expecting you to
download or buy all of your movies and
TV from most likely iTunes also note
that it does not come with any input
devices no keyboard or mouse so you're
gonna have to bring your own wireless
keyboard or Apple's $69 gesture
accessory if you want to use the new OS
10 gestures now the lack of optical
drive for me is the biggest knock on the
Mac Mini as long as all your media is in
the cloud then I guess you're okay with
this but to be honest I was hoping to
buy this and then have a blu-ray drive
built-in so I could watch movies on a
big cinema display and that could be a
whole TV all on its own unfortunately
I'm not going to be doing that but if
you own all of your iTunes movies
download from Amazon things like that
this is a great web enabled fully
functioning computer to make part of
your home theater package check out our
C net review on that and happy shopping</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
