this castle this sand castle with our
windows capture 3d experience now here
you can see the sand castle is taking
shape in front of me I'm not only taking
something from the physical world and
making it digital I'm also taking
something that would have been temporary
and making it permanent
we all know that as the Sun Goes Down at
the end of the day you'd have to leave
your sandcastle behind but with the
magic of scanning we can take this
temporary memory and save it forever
today I used HP's Windows Phone the x3
but we envisioned this experience on any
device now there it is I just made a 3d
object using my real world for
inspiration I'm excited to announce that
with the Windows 10 creators update we
are introducing paint 3d that exact same
sandcastle that I just scanned moments
ago is now a 3d object in paint
now Taj's we've got a camera here that
allows you to see all the same camp all
the same holograms that Taj can see just
from his viewpoint that's right Megan
here on hololens we have the same
awesome community that we showcase
earlier today and in it you can see
Megan's creation but what's really
exciting is this is mixed reality we can
take this creation put it right into the
space so I'm gonna go ahead and select
it and I'm gonna place it right about
here awesome looks good Megan nice job
now this creation started as a real
sandcastle that we captured edited and
enhanced and now it's back here on stage
as a hologram
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
