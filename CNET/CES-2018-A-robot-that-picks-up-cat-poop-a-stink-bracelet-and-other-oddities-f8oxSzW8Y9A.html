kind of like a high school science fair
on steroids there are thousands of
vendors and thousands of tech products
there so I found a few of them that I
really liked and I let each vendor give
me a pitch about twenty seconds this is
the litter robot open air nobody if you
have to manually scoop cat poop out of
their cat litter box this thing will do
it for you it has a tumbler kind of like
a dryer and if you're a fan of stanley
kubrick 2001 it looks like the pod from
the spaceship this would be five hundred
dollars for a connected version in the
US or four hundred fifty dollars for the
unconnected version you scoop into cats
poops he'll stop this is called the love
box it's all about positive messaging so
imagine if you and perhaps a lover had
this box at home and your lover went on
a vacation or trip and they sent you a
message the front of the box the little
heart would spend to let you know you
had a message and then you can open the
top to see what that message is or in
this case a drawing of it now what's
cool is there comes with an app called
the love box app and you can message you
can draw pictures and it goes straight
to here this connects via Wi-Fi to get
the messages and is otherwise a really
cool piece and it costs $99 u.s. and you
can get this in the US in Europe but so
it's in me a positive message hey it's
called Spartan Spartan underwear it
protects your nuts against radiation
from phones and laptops that's right you
know what your Christmas cracker is
getting a little warm from doing too
much texting so you got to protect your
cojones the way it works is their silver
fabric wiring inside that protects your
jewels against unwanted radiation so you
can have your kids and protect your
gentlemen's quarters all the better it
costs $35 in the u.s. it was available
in the US and Europe protect your nuts
guys don't don't mess around with a
phone
now your nutsack or balls or
dingleberries dingleberries something
else this is called the envy bracelet IM
VI and this cool little bracelet has a
secret it smells really bad when you
open it up so this is designed to help
protect people against a sexual predator
and what happens is it's when you push
the loop under the inside it opens up
and then you pull it and it sprays a
nasty spray the company's studied with
lots of different nasty sprays to come
up with the most stinky smelly spray
possible to ward off unwanted advances
so this will cost 70 dollars in the US
and is available on their website
doesn't smell that bad I'm acting it
didn't go off well that was my look at
Eureka Park home of thousands of cool
vendors all these different countries
and I hope you liked it make sure you
stay away from that stink races though
it's pretty smelly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
