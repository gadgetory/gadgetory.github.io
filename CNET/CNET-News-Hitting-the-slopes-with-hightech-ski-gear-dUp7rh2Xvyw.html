amped up for some slopeside fun here's a
roundup of literally the best cool tech
for your next mountain getaway
very few people these days can truly
unplug the different products that we've
got going here our time-saving their
seamless and they offer a way to access
information when you're on the go one
way to stay plugged in oakley's six
hundred and fifty dollar air wave and
recons four hundred dollar snow to both
goggles feature a heads-up display a
small screen on the lower right that
shows information like your speed music
track titles even text messages and more
and this feature of these goggles trail
maps so you know exactly which run
you're on and it'll help you avoid
making a wrong turn and ending a remote
with oversized buttons lets you navigate
through the screens even while wearing
mittens
next up gloves they aren't just for
keeping warm this pair from bear tech
which run one hundred and twenty dollars
has a built-in bluetooth module why
bluetooth if you're on a lift and you
get a call it's much easier to answer
the phone by doing this instead of
digging for your phone fumbling with it
and risking a 60-foot drop cell phones
tend to be the number one lost item you
see them drop from tear less often and
we're there to scoop them up wireless
bluetooth headphones like the 130 dollar
chips also let you take calls easily and
listen to tunes while shashing downhill
the left earpiece doubles as a button
for music controls live tickets are
getting souped up to North Star
California and its sister resorts offer
epic mix an app that stores data
collected by your lift ticket every day
pass or season pass has an RF chip
embedded in the plastic media and every
time the customer goes through our
gantry at the entrance to the lift it
records that passage and then calculates
the number of vertical feet for parents
EPIK makes us a handy way to know what
your kids were up to during ski school
you can also access photos taken by
resort photographers by far though the
hands-down favorite gadget here is the
GoPro the video camera that offers
unique POV shots
good images $400.00 apex goggles feature
a built-in GoPro this way it's already
built right into your eyewear and you
have it with you all day so whatever
you're seeing you can capture on video
the apex also boasts Wi-Fi so you can
stream your video the 130 dollar hitcase
pro is a waterproof iPhone case with a
wide-angle camera lens attached the case
to the 50 dollar Chester mount and
you've got a good GoPro alternative
the only drawback of all this gadgetry
those technical difficulties that drive
you batty at home like dead batteries
and weak network signals are much more
annoying on the slopes still it's tech
like this that lets shredders of all
stripes relive their Mountain glory long
after the lift stop running in Lake
