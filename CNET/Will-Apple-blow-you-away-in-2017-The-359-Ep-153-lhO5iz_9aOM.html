do it's time for another episode of 359
for you episode 153 with Roger Cheng and
then Fox Rubin good morning everybody
morning my body is ready thanks Reggie
what's on the show today guys what's on
the show when we talk about apple app
well what's new right big surprise
number down we have all that Apple for
like three days time to talk like three
minutes of eight minutes really yeah
we've been talking about snapchat and
all right so wit yeah we're gonna be
talking about Apple or you know as the
years winding down we're gonna talk a
little bit about what we expect for next
year right and next up we'll we'll talk
about a story that Alfred wrote is too
busy to be doing podcast today but will
write it discussing iris scanning
technology whether that's the future of
biometrics yes own to help with
passwords and then lastly google or
alphabet is reportedly killing plans for
the self traffic cards own standalone
self-driving right so Ben's gonna that's
gonna do just that I'll try I'll try
without fumbling as always if you have
any questions leave them in the comments
section our producer Brian will pick out
the best and we will try and answer try
is the keyword yes alright let's get
this recording underway and here we go
in three two welcome to 339 when we talk
about the top tech news of the day
another the crap we want to throw in I'm
Roger chance I'm Ben Fox ribbon as we
start to wind down the year let's start
looking at some of the big companies
going I'm sorry I keep going alright
going as we start as we start to wind
down the year let's start looking at
some of the big companies are doing next
year first up his Apple this was sort of
a whole hub year for the company but
things can be changing 2017 we're
looking at radically redesigned iphone
new designs for ipad apple watch even
maybe the mac so I don't are you excited
yeah yes I I think maybe I mean like
look next up next September's a pretty
far far way away yeah they just came out
with the iphone 7 it appears as though
the iphone 7 is selling well despite the
fact that they got rid of the headphone
jack and we'll see how many of these new
technologies will actually be in the
next
phone it might just be a wish list at
this point that's that's at least 18 a
wireless charging edge to edge screen
right I think the edge to edge screen in
the noho makes waffles yes I would love
the waffle maker technology yeah that
would be really nice it's called waffle
bar I waffle apple waffle touch well
it's also much is actually got a catchy
so we also looked at the possibility
that the Apple watch is going to get a
redesign which i think is interesting
just anecdotally I've been seeing more
Apple watches out in the world yeah so I
think it's it's a thing now it's
everything that it got panned for what a
complete bust but it's also not its
people aren't lining up to buy another
watch I think it's if it were obviously
a smaller company it would be a huge
success but for Apple it doesn't really
make a significant dent to the revenue
or the bottom line quite red but I think
with with a redesign will see what ends
up happening and maybe they'll keep
selling them seems like they will so
what the radically redesigned phone
though a lot of people are expecting
that this huge pent-up demand for a new
radically new iphone is really gonna
drive apple dev it's its best year ever
super cycle this was the scare you go
next up our own effort Inc took a look
at iris scanning technology and believes
that it'll be as commonplace in phones
by 2018 as fingerprint readers are our
phones now so you ready to stare down
your phone to unlock it I think that
with with touch ID people are now used
to the concept of biometric scan and
they do with their you know thumb print
all the time their fingerprints so this
to me doesn't seem like it's scary tech
I might be wrong about that but I it
appears as though people will be
reasonably comfortable with this I did I
don't think it's scary check I think you
make a good point i think people are
familiar and comfortable biometrics i
think iris scanning sort of the next
step up and people acknowledge that you
know it's more secure than your
fingerprint I just don't know if people
are actually like hold their phone up
their eyes up to their phones like
unlock it every time not not quite as
convenient just the concept of passwords
to to make passwords more powerful or
useful you have to add special
characters you have to change them at a
time so getting rid of these obviously
also useful so last google is reportedly
scrapping plans to build self-driving
car with no steering wheel or pedals
which sounds kind of scary it may
instead partner with automakers this
comes after apple reportedly scaled back
its plans to do their Titan project on
your own self driving car concept so
yeah I mean it shows there are
significant challenges not to mention
all the regulatory hurdles that are
still there for for self-driving cars
right it is easier even for becoming
like a little too partner rather than do
it all himself it's a car it's much much
harder to do a car than to build a phone
or whatever and there really aren't a
lot of contract manufacturers out there
to build your car so I think that does
make sense that they aren't going to go
at it alone yeah it's cup of shame those
kind of hoping though to ride one of
those cars around for more about these
stories check us out on cnet roger jet
I'm Ben Fox Rubin thanks for listening
and we are back and we have a wish list
all right but what all right out of the
iphone bring it on 17 how about
unbreakable screens read agree that
River mm-hmm my fire screen the sapphire
screen oh that's that's a scratch proof
scratch proof against it's not scratch
you're right that could break better I
mean nothing out there's truly
unbreakable but there are plenty more
durable options well there's the it's
getting there was it the uh what's the
motorola turbo droid turbo droid
something i don't know the one that had
like the shatterproof screen if you want
a shatterproof sky where we had plastic
that's exactly what it was it was it was
basically layers of plastic and i think
it didn't actually break under our test
until we took a pic x to it right so
actually it was pretty damn plastic is
probably the most durable but it's more
likely to scratch and it's also just
kind of you know cheap it's cheaper it
feels kind of like flimsy and your
that's why they went with glass and i
know a lot of people complain about
corning gorilla glass which is used in
most of these flagship phones but they
do make them better every year but
slightly better yeah right but they're
still going to break under certain
conditions especially after a year
two or three so yea big city boy and the
chats calling out has anyone done the
upgrade yet the recent upgrade 10 was it
10 to no no I did I yes you did yeah I
mean I didn't notice anything new about
it enough to dress to bring my phone so
that's that's good Nancy that's a big
one hey hey don't take that for crazy no
no you can't anymore actually yeah I
wanted to try out wasn't it the new like
TV app or something that's how these the
search app yeah yeah yeah so I wanted to
give that a go but I haven't tried it
yet but I did upgrade it seems fine
nothing changed with my phone so go for
it do we think we're gonna skip over the
7s and go straight to an eight I think
so and you think is gonna be a bluetooth
oh I they'll say they should call it
iphone x I think they come on which
color when you're listening x is for 399
57 Roger that name I like that name I
know that iphone X that's simcoe's
listening to this show and I know who's
timko Francona no one this is the show
we are talking to you for talking to
Brian oh do you think 2017 will be a big
year for the watch it'll have to be a
bigger year definitely it's it kind of
make or break right hotel you know it's
other things megaBrain it's incremental
improvements and there they are selling
them reasonably well they're gonna keep
improving it slowly slowly but it's not
gonna be a big product for look if they
can look if they can figure out a couple
things the design kind of hope they have
a circular watch if they could get it to
be standalone like LTE extend the
battery life and make it thinner this is
a huge whistler wishlist there's
actually rather physically difficult to
do and not of God that yet that possible
but if it they all that out you know the
software's really approved actually like
I've talked to Scott about Apple watch
software it's it's got better over time
right but what's the cheapest one what
is it 350 yeah the sport or whatever
right and that's after you already
bought you know whatever other apple
products you got so it's still do you
know yes the cost it is for now that
look they're going after affluent
consumers who have the disposal right
now that's the market so far not quite
as mass market and I thought you don't
absolutely need a watch but who they're
going after I mean
there could be demand sure and a bigger
overarching question do you think the
era of cook can really bring back that
innovation and reinvent themselves way
jobs is kind of notorious for doing
that's I feel like the cost of debate
about cook I mean he is he's definitely
a guy who can make the trains run on
time right he's a good businessman but
he's not a visionary per se and yes
that's that's always throwing out there
for four jobs it's about sterilization
but i think it's it's mostly true well
what we've seen over the past couple
years from apple is where we're gonna
take the same product and make it
smaller and make it bigger right and I I
do like the idea of creating something
like like an iPhone pro or whatever with
the oled screen that they're grab higher
priced iPhone so apparently they're
gonna be three different ones is going
to be the iphone the iphone plus i don't
like that idea yeah i'm not a big fan
like it totally goes against what Steve
Jobs pushing for one simple device like
we've got a 12 22 like two with multiple
sizes and colors and now we're gonna go
three it started kind of confusing after
a while yeah yeah I totally hear that
how verb and it just gives an excuse to
bump up the price of aphur I thought
that the pros the concept of the pros
made sense so maybe introducing that in
some way to the iphones felt like the
pros really there like because they
couldn't get enough alleged screens
mm-hmm but there's like well we just
create like a whole nother cheer and
then charged on how to charge like maybe
tube under because we can't get enough
screens for every phone yeah let's just
make an exclusive thing and it make it
even more expensive needless to say
they've got to do something really big
with this one i would say ya think
absolutely exquisite say will disclosure
as I hold my iphone 7 which I did not
upgrade to an iphone 7 upgrade yeah so
I'm sticking with the iphone 6 i'm
probably going to buy a new battery to
keep it lasting for another year and
then we'll see what the iphone whatever
7s or eight looks like
9 maybe this was just the iphone 9 this
close to buying Google pixel on Cyber
Monday I couldn't take it if I keep the
iphone a cuz 8 is a lucky number in
Chinese culture that china is its
biggest market so that could be that
could be a thing that's interesting
because Pamela's thinking they might
change the entire naming convention to
what just hasn't really said that I
think they are going to change the
naming of iphones they did get rid of
too bad they don't do the io thing
anymore so yeah they have stopped it's
weird it's like really got away Apple
phone which is it sounds it's so tied to
like the early 2000s though like we do
need to break away from that but that's
what Apple because everyone ripped it
off too it's true but iphone is such an
iconic name that it would be pretty
surprising if they dropped it entirely
no they don't and I Jewish the switch
value of that that name yeah I don't
think Apple phones sounds good at all so
I mean they could do what they did with
the ipad for a while like they just
called the iphone right like that's it
no number nothing it's like this is the
iphone yes there's a lot of hope for a
new macbook air as well I don't think
haha sorry I think I hey let's break it
to you they they basically kept the the
macbook air in circulation because they
know people wanted they have no real
intention of upgrading ever really the
reason this year yeah they really want
you to go just spend more money on the
macbook pro macbook air is there so they
can say they have a low cost option they
don't really care whether you buy it
they want you to buy pro it's pretty
disappointing but yeah the macbook pro
with no touch bar this year is basically
operated macbook air which way more
expensive it is way more expensive and
for somebody that uses a macbook air all
i really wanted to see was them to get
the bezel down you know so it would be a
bigger screen in the same body and maybe
a couple more upgrades somewhere high
resolution x way I feel like the macbook
high resolution display absolutely yes
blaze just willfully well flip there are
a lot of things that just clearly they
needed to do but they haven't done it
and they're probably not going to do it
yeah which is too bad Pamela clarifies
that they're just going to do away the
numbering system it'll just be little
bit that's what I said yeah yeah the
iphone you
Pamela I known page and the natick 01 to
close out on our buddy Michael Brown
here's a good question if any other
company google samsung etc took a two
year break on being innovative would you
still buy a pixel or a galaxy all right
no right no god no and why not why would
that put you off just because technology
moves Apple Apple has people don't
buying iphones said oh look here's a lot
of loyalty here's why I thought is
loyalty if your Samsung if your google
whatever if you take a break there are
like 15 other companies building Android
phones that are coming out like next
month and so if you take a break for a
year or two just a year everyone else is
gonna lappy with with an iphone you
basically if you're I thought user
you're just gonna upgrade to an iphone
there's no other option for you you know
really if you're going to live in that
iOS if you live in that world you know
there's no other option for you to go to
Android I mean some people do but it's
rather difficult Apple has been known
for its the loyalty of its customers
right so regardless if they take a break
of design or whatever whatever new
product comes out Apple people will go
and buy it but if you're if the Android
side if say Samsung takes a break well
cuz they're LG Sony motorola Google
there are just so many other options out
there they're all like putting out their
best game month after month there's
always gonna be a better android phone
out there so yeah we've seen that seen
the negative side to that competition as
well the note 7 samsung note 7 yep blew
up because Samsung was trying to lap the
competition lard as much technology into
that phone as possible and it just
didn't work yeah it just you know so if
the iphone 8 comes out as a loyal
dedicated longtime iphone religion 33
upper and it's the iphone 8 X know
whatever it is comes out and it's just
iphone 7s plus may become sorta you're
in probably all right but not me not me
here i'm also using a samsung phone and
i have a pixel phone like I
your job so yeah yeah yeah and i am i'm
one of those idiots that want to have
the greatest alright we have to wrap it
up kind of early today but one last
thought that I loved in the chat if they
named the next iPhone something salty
salty like a you know against the Galaxy
Note 70 called the iphone fire
I don't oh well there's the fire photo
ready that's hurting us wow that would
be knocking two companies at the same
time I love it fire yeah that was just
off the top my head don't figure to
everybody okay they're gonna start the
change.org petition right now I'm sure
there can be better suggestions out
there when we come back tomorrow we want
to hear your suggestions on really next
iPhone should be called I like that all
right all right yeah if you liked
anything you saw her hurt here tricks on
cnet podcast is also available on itunes
tune in stitcher SoundCloud feedburner
and of course google play music see
y'all tomorrow later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
