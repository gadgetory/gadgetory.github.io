and the fate of Buster tell folks well
seeing the fate of Buster your
crash-test dummy
yeah rebuilt two three four five a
hundred times hundred times times
there's an International Church of
Buster because he's been resurrected so
many times for your knowledge uh-huh
so when we started writing the finale
episode it's the episode that took us
the longest to write all season long we
decided early on to throw out
myth-busting for the finale there was no
myth that was so large or so important
that we could devote this episode to it
so we thought let's just make this
episode about catharsis let's give the
audience stuff that they really want to
connect with and wrap themselves around
so we we blew up an RV and filmed it a
10 times the frame rate we've ever
filmed something before and then we took
Buster and put him on a rocket sled
accelerate him to the speed of sound and
ran him into a brick wall an
astoundingly buster who's made of rubber
and aluminum and metal when he hit the
brick wall you can see fire at the
outline like there's so much friction
between him and the concrete wall that
things are catching fire which is
astounding to me and then we found about
20 pounds worth of Buster Buster chunks
but we never found his ribcage we never
found his head we never found his pelvis
we never found the largest portions of
him and we think that he's pretty much
vaporized and that's that's right and
proper
Buster deserved to go off that way and
there are pieces of Buster that are
living on there so in November we had
our cast party for the cast and crew and
at that party I made up little acrylic
vitrines and each one had a broken
camera in it because we've burnt and
shot and waterlogged so many GoPros and
83s and stuff so everyone got a vitrine
with the bulkan camera and chunks of
buster like a little paperweight for
there
so those are the last remaining pieces
