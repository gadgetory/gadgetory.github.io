itself over about the last half decade
going from a failing old luxury brand to
one of the heavy hitters in the luxury
automotive space the XJ is still big old
luxury though in this 2014 xjl is even
bigger an even more old luxury but maybe
that's okay let's hop behind the wheel
and check the tech now as I said the XJ
is a big old car it's the largest
vehicle that Jaguar makes right now and
the X JLS even larger all that's going
to really be happening right here in the
mid section where you get about 4.9 more
inches of wheelbase even though it's a
really big car it's also a really big
good-looking car does have a very
athletic muscular look to it and I
especially like the way that the
roofline run pretty much all the way
back to the end of the trunk it's a
gorgeous piece of machinery in the kind
of car that people are going to stop you
and compliment you on on the other hand
nobody is going to compliment your audi
now here in the cabin there's nothing
that we haven't already seen in another
Jaguar or even in another XJ that we
reviewed there are really nice materials
all over hold dashboards gonna be
covered in leather there's also some
nice chrome trim that's good most times
a day every now and then the sun'll
bounced off of that right up into your
ID give you a little bit of glare while
you're driving but also we've got some
nice wood trim around the dashboard but
every now and then some little bit of
cost-cutting cheapness peeks through for
example these paddle shifters that
you'll use to manually select gears on
your 8-speed automatic transmission they
shouldn't be made out of cheap hollow
plastic that kind of gives you this
weird fisher-price e solo cup sound in a
car that cost about a hundred thousand
dollars as equipped these should be
metal in a fifty-thousand-dollar
infinity they would be made out of metal
now here in the center of the dashboard
we've got Jaguars touchscreen
infotainment system again this is
nothing new we've seen this in previous
Jaguar models and it's starting to show
its age but its ageing pretty well I
think we've got our three major sections
in the audio video section we've got our
audio sources we've got our various
digital sources including ipod USB
connectivity we've got bluetooth audio
streaming and then of course the DVD and
CD changer getting back to the home
screen we've got the nav
patient system which is really crisp
it's got really nice looking maps that
render quickly and are easy to read
there are a couple of little nitpicky
things about the system that i don't
really like for starters the voice
command system takes entirely too long
in putting a simple address can
sometimes take up to like two to five
minutes getting back to the main screen
again the last thing we've got is our
phone connectivity and here you're just
going to basically have hands-free
calling with contacts thinking voice
command now here in front of the driver
we've got our fully digital instrument
cluster and it kind of manifest itself
as three virtual gauges if you're in
manual mode you'll see the gears over
here if you're in dynamic mode the
background of the gauges will turn a
writ to let you know that you're driving
with a little bit more zest you've also
got the ability to pop into a menu here
and make certain changes to the vehicle
and display settings for the digital
instrument cluster but a lot of
automakers are starting to do digital
instrument clusters and they do them in
a way that I think is better to hop in
this very expensive Jaguar and just see
basically digital chrome next to real
chrome it just looks kind of bad now the
reason the xjl is about seven thousand
dollars more expensive than the XJ
happens right here it is about 4.9
inches of extra legroom is going to make
the back seat a very comfortable place
to be now this example is also equipped
with a lot of extra features that are
going to make this seat possibly the
best seat in the house we've got these
ten point nine inch dual monitors in the
back of the feats that are going to give
us access to a lot of infotainment
features with this little remote right
here for starters you can view how far
away we are from our current destination
we can adjust the audio source and
change our different source right here
now underneath me we've also got
adjustable seat that's also an option
now these two back seats are about as
adjustable as the ones you'll find on
the front row if not a little bit more
we've got the ability to kind of tilt
the backrest forward and back we've got
a recline function that lets me kind of
get really comfortable and then if I
need a little bit more legroom I can
even take control of the front seat and
push that thing forward from right here
in the back seat both backseat
passengers also have fold-out little
tables right here that you can use for
placing a laptop or eating your lunch
and then we've also got our own
right here on the back row in the engine
bay we've got Jaguars three liter
supercharged v6 now this engine is good
for 340 horsepower 332 pound-feet of
torque it's a pretty powerful engine but
this is a big heavy vehicle so it's not
exactly overwhelming it's simply
whelming in this incarnation we're
looking at 16 miles per gallon in the
city about 24 on the highway and 19
combined this is the thriftier of the
two configurations you can get this
vehicle in now our example also features
Jaguars all-wheel drive system that's
going to give it a little bit more
stability in the corners and on slippery
surfaces and in between the engine and
that all-wheel drive system is an
8-speed automatic transmission and as
automatic transmissions go that's a very
good one this one has a sport program
and paddle shifters all right Audi
driver but it mean to insult your cars
but don't worry you can still feel a
little bit superior knowing that your
outing is a much more technologically
advanced vehicle than this XJ could ever
really hope to be this isn't the best
performing most high-tech vehicle that
you're going to find in this price range
the performance from the 3-liter v6 is
good but as i said earlier not exactly
overwhelming a lot of the good in this
powertrain comes from that 8-speed
automatic transmission which upshifts
ridiculously quick the longer wheelbase
in all-wheel drive system means this is
a very planted large sedan it's very
difficult to get this thing out of sorts
around the corner but the trade-off
there is that you do trade a little bit
of the dynamism this isn't a dancer
you're not going to want to take this
thing to the track even though there is
a dynamic mode on the powertrain now our
2014 jaguar xjl remember that's the big
one is that a portfolio trim level here
that's going to come pretty close to
fully loaded at eighty four thousand
seven hundred dollars but that doesn't
mean that we don't have a bunch of
options on here between the rear seats
in the rear seat entertainment the
upgrades to the technology and whatnot
we've got an S tested price of 10 15 45
now that's a lot of money if it worth
this much money well that's up to what
you're looking for it's not the most
high-tech or best performing car in its
class but it's one of the few that does
old luxury right
