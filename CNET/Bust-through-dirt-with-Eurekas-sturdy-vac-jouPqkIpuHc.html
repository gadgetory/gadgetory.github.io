I'm taking a look at the Eureka rush
roll clean with suction seal it's a $200
vacuum that looks a little plain and
maneuvers like a brick but the back of
it though clunky looks like a proton
pack so it definitely gets points for
that it also gets points for a couple of
features it has an automatically
retracting power cord which I thought
was really cool
it did whack me in the ankles a few
times though my own fault still watch
out for pets and small children and the
brushroll clean part is kind of awesome
what that means is that if you have pet
hair tangled up in the roll you can
press this button while the vacuum is
running and a boy that will lower onto
the bristles and scrape off that tangled
hair the runs themselves well they're
gonna be teased vacuuming is a chore and
this thing makes it feel just like a
chore it's big its clunky it doesn't
have any form of self-propulsion
and it's not even slightly maneuverable
it must have missed the day when Dyson
and shark and Orick all figured out how
to make your vacuum actually pivot with
this one you're gonna be yanking it
whenever you're using it but it cleans
pretty well on carpets this $200 machine
did as well as machines that cost two
three times as much it aced our pet hair
test our cheerios test it's a good
carpet cleaner on hardwood floors Mac
the suctions still there but with large
particles like Cheerios or with pet hair
the food just can't get past the brush
roll when it's not spinning and with
this machine you're not supposed to spin
the brush roll when you're on our wood
floors or it might scratch so the eureka
brush roll clean with suction seal
definitely isn't a perfect vacuum and at
200 dollars you can get a more flexible
machine in the shark rotator Pro lift
away but if you've got the upper arm
strength this thing fares well as a
carpet cleaner at any price
so at $200 it's worth your consideration
as a budget vacuum
it looks like a proton back for more be
