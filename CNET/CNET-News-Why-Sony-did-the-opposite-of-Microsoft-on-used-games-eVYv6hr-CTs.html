announced that ps4 would be able to play
used games and that players would be
able to trade loan keep their disks why
did you decide to make that decision as
opposed to going the route that
Microsoft took given that they had made
that and that's the competition why was
that important to Sony
well it's our fourth generation of
hardware and we've had a great
relationship with the consumer and I
think they've responded with tremendous
loyalty it's obviously a model that
works well for them and why change
something that isn't broken as far as
we're concerned was that something you
gave some thought though did you go back
and forth at all and in terms of
considering whether or not you might go
that route well I think there's always a
debate in the industry about the effects
of the aftermarket I remember many years
ago people thought rental was a threat
people would rent a video game they play
it they'd finish it they never go out
and buy it and I think in recent years
people have perceived that use games
might be a threat but I think there's
also a position that says number one it
adds to the value for the consumer and
their price they're willing to pay for a
new copy of a game number two it pumps
new dollars into the ecosystem for the
consumer and actually puts them in a
position to spend more on games if you
give them some value for a game that
they're done with and we all know that
consumers don't have unlimited dollars
so anything that keeps them in the
ecosystem we think is good for gaming
did you expect that kind of reaction
there I really did I think that people
have spoken very very loudly when
they're not happy and when they are
happy so I don't know that I expected to
be vocal at the press conference but I
know the news would have been extremely
well received but it's obvious that
people have very strong emotions about
it
um the emphasis on entertainment that we
saw tonight you're so nice oh that's to
be expected but why is that important
and what will it mean for the consumers
experience with the ps4 well I mean I'd
like to think that we brought
entertainment beyond gaming into the
fray right way back in 1995 with the
original playstation at the time the
ability to listen to your CDs on the
same device that you played games was a
novel concept and obviously we really
a big hand and the adoption to DVD with
Playstation 2 and then with blu-ray and
PlayStation 3 and the ability to stream
all the different partners that we've
brought without having to pay an
additional fee with something I think
really resonated with consumers and
Netflix is a perfect example of a
service it's really ubiquitous it's on
just about every device but to be the
number one stream device is a testament
to the fact that the entertainment
consumer is on our platform and they not
only play a lot of games they listen to
a lot of music they watch a lot of
movies they go to a lot of concerts buy
a lot of music so they're a very very
valuable consumer for Sony I think
that's another key point people look at
the success of a generation based on the
number of pieces of hardware you sold
what's important is if people are still
playing them and what they're doing with
them and we feel that quality is more
important than quantity if we had to
make a choice a specific launch date for
ps4 we heard holiday season but can you
tell us more specific than that and if
not why not
well I think the honest answer is that
you don't know where your production
yields are going to be until you go into
production and you see the type of
numbers you have you don't know what the
ultimate demand is going to be and we're
trying to roll this out on a worldwide
basis so we want to do it right as
opposed to Spink sprinkle a unit here
and a unit there so we've got a lot of
evaluation to do but in my mind holiday
means in the holiday season but to be
more specific would be speculative and
quite frankly I think if you have an
opportunity to get it before the end of
the year whether you get it in October
November December is it somewhat
irrelevant because we hope it's
something you're going to enjoy for the
next 10 years and beyond so a couple of
weeks one way the other won't make too
significant a difference a lot of people
are pointing out that younger players
are gaming on smartphones tablets of
course there's the PlayStation Vita but
what are Sony's plans to keep up with
that trend with that mobile gaming trip
well the beauty of working for Sony is
there isn't business as it relates to
entertainment in the gaming choices that
you just mentioned that we're not in we
make tablets we make smart phones we
have PlayStation mobile we have games
available on the tablet so I think the
entire ecosystem is growing but the
misnomer that I think some people miss
out on is they assume that it's people
gravitating from the console to a
smartphone or tablet I think it's the
exact opposite the peope
are coming into gaming through devices
like smartphones and tablets and
ultimately they migrate their way up the
ecosystem but the audience for the
console is stronger than it's ever been
I mean we believe that there are more
consumers out there that have interest
in the console initially than will be
able to manufacture there's a huge pool
of consumers to tap into and we're
excited to bring PlayStation 4 to then
what will be possible that wasn't
possible before thanks to ps4 I think as
the technology grows the ability to make
the experience more and more immersive
to really evoke emotion to make people
scared when they're playing it excited
mad and to really get in a relationship
with the characters just like they would
with a movie or a TV show and I think
we've reached the photorealism element
that you can tell a story that has the
depth that will actually leave somebody
in tears you know at the end of an
experience and that's something that it
was very very difficult to admission it
to envision many years ago and why
people felt the gaming was a toy because
it was something that you know they
couldn't relate to now Gaming is bigger
than box office and movies combined so
clearly you know we're mainstream
entertainment and people get that it's
an art form and I think the technology
and the creativity in the in the
development community has allowed us to
rise to that level do you have a
favorite among the games that you
highlighted well you know the amazing
thing it's like working in any ice cream
parlor right you're surrounded by it so
I have a new favorite all the time and
it really depends on what time but the
game I'm probably most excited to play
right now is the Last of Us I mean that
just looks incredible but as soon as I
sink my teeth into that there's a whole
list of other games I want to jump into
and I love the indie games I mean
they're great experiences as well
I mean great game play is great game
play kind of interesting integration of
Hollywood
well having been around the industry for
a long time and having devoted my career
to it it's great to see this evolution
in the relationship with Hollywood
because it used to be when they were
making a movie somebody said hey we
should pick up some licensing dollars by
making a video game that'll come out
after the movies out and it was really
the stepchild if you will of the movie
relationship now it's the exact opposite
that the creative juices and the
creative games that are being created
are turning into big-budget movies the
games and the movies are being made side
by side a lot of the same technologies
being used and where it might have been
an embarrassment for a lead Hollywood
actor to be involved in a video game
they seek it out now I think the same is
true of the music industry people want
to be on the soundtrack of a game
because they know it can really propel
their band so again proof points for the
health of the industry that Hollywood
and the music industry flocked to gaming
and that's a big change from the way it
was you know just 10 or maybe even 20
years ago and because of that shift do
you think it's bringing more gamers into
the bringing more people to gaming
because they're seeing you know oh you
know maybe there are Ellen Page fans
maybe they you know SAR anjuna or
something like yeah I think it brings
people in in a number of different ways
I think the key is just to demystify it
I think people look at a controller and
they see all those buttons and say I'd
never be able to control it and that's
one of the things that I think we we owe
a debt of gratitude to smartphones and
tablets because it's a real easy
interface but once you get used to it
you demystify it a little bit you know
you're not so intimidated by the
controller so like I said earlier you
migrate up that system but I think you
know the key is to bring something that
catches people I people's eye and they
say you know what is that I'd like to
check that out and you know characters
like Ellen Page and William Dafoe
certainly add the relevance and the
credibility that a non gamer you know
certainly would it would be drawn to if
they weren't a gamer already you're
never too old to game never too old to
game
