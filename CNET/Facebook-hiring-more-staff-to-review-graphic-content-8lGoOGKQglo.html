violent video CEO Mark Zuckerberg
announced Facebook would be hiring 3,000
additional staff members to help review
reports of potentially violent or
objectionable video last month the
social media site accidentally allowed a
video of a man killing his daughter and
himself to remain live for almost the
day and there's been an increase in
shocking videos since Facebook rolled
out its live streaming service the
company has been pushing live broadcasts
hard in users news feeds but it hasn't
exactly been consistent when it comes to
graphic content so these additional
3,000 employees should hopefully make a
difference when it comes to spotting
that content flagging it getting it
reviewed and pulling it down if it is in
fact graphic they'll also be keeping an
eye out for other objectionable material
Zuckerberg said in a post to his
Facebook page quote these reviewers will
also help us get better at removing
things we don't allow on Facebook like
hate speech and child exploitation and
we'll keep working with local community
groups and law enforcement who are in
the best position to help someone if
they need it either because they're
about to harm themselves or because
they're in danger from someone else
unquote it remains to be seen whether or
not Facebook can get a handle on the
influx of graphic content as its video
service grows but we hope these
additional hires make a difference
Zuckerberg also said quote no one should
be in this situation in the first place
but if they are then we should build a
safe community that gets them to help
they need and to that we agree for more
