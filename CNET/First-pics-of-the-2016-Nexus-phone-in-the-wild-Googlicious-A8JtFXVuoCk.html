Google Isha's for everything inside the
world of Google and we start with the
first images of the 2016 Nexus sailfish
phone in the wild from Android police
with its all metal and glass body now
the pictures have been cropped most
likely to protect the location where
they were taken but they match up really
well with these renders Android police
created earlier in July
based on their sources then the
interwebs jumped all over this picture
of what's believed to be the new Nexus
phone in someone's hand in the wild now
we're expecting to ACC built Nexus
phones a 5.5 inch and a 5 inch phone
that have been codenamed Marlon and
sailfish then the two phones were also
just certified by the FCC with the model
numbers G dash 2 PW 4100 and G dash 2 PW
2100 their way to indicate that the 4100
should be the larger Marlin phone last
year's Nexus line was announced at the
end of September and the phone's
launched in October so expect a similar
timing this time around as well
alright Google is working on a new
project revealed on github that's an all
new operating system named fuchsia and
it's not based on Linux at all the new
OS wouldn't be an upgrade to anything
but would stand on its own alongside the
Linux based Android and Chrome OS now
fuchsia is based on the magenta kernel
that's designed to work on everything
from a desktop computer to laptops and
wearables and all the way down to basic
Internet of Things devices like a smart
light bulb Google also wants to use
material designed for the look and it
hasn't been announced but Android police
sources say it will be open source from
the beginning which is why we can see it
publicly from the start with an official
announcement by Google coming later
now we're also still fired up about the
samsung galaxy note 7 and for those of
you in the comments that think is just a
slightly upgraded s7 edge it's meant to
be an upgrade to the note 5 now
according to display mate it also has
the most innovative and high-performance
smartphone display that we have ever
tested and has become the best
performing smartphone display ever those
are their words not mine and you have to
take a look because that ace
display looks ridiculous in person also
galaxy note 7 users might be getting the
Android nougat update in the next two or
three months that's if you believe what
Samsung's DJ code told the Korean times
but as a warning international unlock
devices have a history of getting
updates a lot faster for example the
Galaxy S six in Korea got the Android
marshmallow update four months after
marshmallow was released but then some
US carriers took five months after that
to get the update so let's not get too
ahead of ourselves in just expect
something similar and the new updated
gear VR headset is now available for
pre-order on Amazon for $99 with its
improved touchpad controls wider viewing
angle and more comfortable feel it works
with both the note 7 and previous
compatible gear VR devices and what's
next for Samsung
well the Korean giant has sent out its
invites for its press conference at Etha
2016 where we expect to see the new gear
s3 SmartWatch and I don't know about you
but the hour-hand in minutes hand of a
watch face on that invite kind of gave
it away the event is set for Thursday
September the 1st there haven't been
really any clean leaks for the new
hardware other than this overexposed
look at what could be a metallic gear s3
but we have to expect they'll maintain
the rotating bezel interface that's
really cool and possibly bring Samsung
pay to the new version all right that's
gonna do it for this week's show you can
always email me at Google issues at
cnet.com or tweet me at Brian Tong
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
y'all next time for another Google
issues Google ishes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
