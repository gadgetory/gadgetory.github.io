on an iPhone and while it's free to
really get the most out of Super Mario
Red you're gonna need to pay $10 that's
high for a mobile game but Super Mario
run aims to offer a package that feels a
little more like something you'd buy in
a Nintendo 3ds than on a phone does it
well we got to play Mario run for a
little bit and it all works with one
finger jumping and running happen
automatically but it's really all about
getting higher scores and more
impressive moves to impress your friends
and unlock extras and friendly
competition
there are 24 levels plus a few extras
friends can be added from Twitter and
Facebook and a second mode lets you play
random levels to earn coins and beat
high scores to gain toad followers it's
hard to tell how much replay value
you're really going to get out of it but
Nintendo promises a few extra surprises
CNET got to speak with Nintendo of
America president Reggie fils-aime a on
what his new Mario game is all about for
some it is the nostalgia element for
others you know we know for certain
consumers this is going to be their
first experience with the Super Mario
and therefore you know we want to make
sure that it has all of that essence of
a great Super Mario experience Nintendo
hadn't planned to make mobile games
before but now Super Mario run is one of
a series of phone games including
Pokemon go that de beaut√© earlier this
year the business strategy has shifted
now to B we want to make people smile
through our IP we want to touch as many
people as possible we're going to use
our IP as the way to do it whether
that's with smart devices or amusement
parks or or dedicated game devices there
are upcoming titles including Animal
Crossing and Fire Emblem but what
they'll cost will vary for Nintendo it's
all about exposing people to the
characters and the game's Super Mario
run has a retro feel but that doesn't
mean Nintendo is ready to put its
classic NES games on a phone yet even
though the mini NES is out there and
impossible to find I'd be lying to you
if I said that you know the overall
level of demand certainly is greater
than we anticipated right that's why it
work we're suffering through these
shortages out there in the marketplace
meanwhile Nintendo switch Nintendo's
next game system arrived
next year and it seems like Super Mario
run is aiming to be another game to
encourage more players to possibly come
aboard but don't expect Super Mario run
on switch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
