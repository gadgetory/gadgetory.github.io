videos D and E series they represent the
company's least expensive sets for 2017
but many still offer impressive picture
quality and features especially for the
money let's take a peek on the outside
the D&amp;amp;E series TVs look pretty much the
same they have glossy black frames with
the minimal border around the screen set
on these little legs splayed far to the
side the legs have triangle shaped
cutouts but otherwise the TVs are pretty
standard looking so how are they
different
the D series is cheaper and many of the
sizes in the series lack extras like 4k
resolution and Smart TV the two you see
here at 50 and 65 inches both do include
those extras although the D series Smart
TV system is really basic the more
expensive eseries offers 4k resolution
in every size although only a few can
handle the highest quality HDR sources
there are also Vizio steepest TVs with
the smart cast system its menus are
slicker looking and you can use the
chromecast built-in feature to cast apps
directly from your phone to the TV you
can also control some functions with a
Google home speaker the differences
between the D and E Series TVs I tested
also extend a picture quality all of
them deliver a good enough picture for
most viewers but the larger models
perform better
these 65 inch sets each have local
dimming technology that allows them to
achieve excellent contrast and top of
the price smaller ones lack local
dimming and their pictures weren't as
impressive the bigger sizes and videos
BD series are among our favorite
entry-level TVs although in many ways we
don't like them as much as Roku TVs
which have a superior Smart TV system
but the bigger videos still deliver very
good image quality for the money
