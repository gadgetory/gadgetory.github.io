busy unlocking her iphone today with a
hammer welcome to the buzz report first
the gadget of the week it's the big dog
what the hell is that thing it's a
robotic quad repaired made by a company
called Boston Dynamics funded by DARPA
the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency the folks that did the internet
look how it handles ice and cinder
blocks and snow and cover your short
hairs look how it jumps that thing is
wrong gives me the willies let's move on
well I bet you've seen the new Camaro
that is on the way next februari one of
the major buzz cars of the last year or
so and part of that buzz surrounded its
high output v6 and 400 horsepower v8
engines but this week we hear that GM
may go one better well one less offering
a four-cylinder because of the rising
price of gas now the four they're
considering is a supercharged 260
horsepower unit the one that's found in
the hot version of the pontiac solstice
and saturn sky but come on are you
really gonna shell out north of mustang
money for a chevy halo muscle car and
get it with a faux i guess it would be
kind of nice to have that extra room in
the engine bay kind of like a second
trunk maybe keep a smart car in there
and the mcdonald's of coffee is now
trying to become the face book of food
starbucks is launching what the world
doesn't need now another social network
it's my Starbucks idea calm which they
say will quote make starbucks the most
deeply connected brand in the world what
the hell does that mean well they expect
people will share and discuss their
thoughts about starbucks and what's
happening in their local stores let me
save you guys about a million dollars in
site development fee
here's what's happening in my and every
Starbucks store a bunch of workers who
don't really like being called baristas
are pouring coffee and selling Danish
that's it my thoughts and feelings
refill the half-and-half thing and wipe
the counters better I can't get
motivated to maintain a Facebook page
about what I do for a living why would I
interact and get engaged about a hot
drink now you know a technology went out
ugly when even the stores that
breathlessly hype it to you offer an
apology in cash best by announcing this
week they'll send a fifty dollar gift
card to all customers who bought an HD
DVD deck prior to februari 23rd that's
amazing I mean they can't ignore how
singed you are around the edges on this
one and on top of that best buy will let
you send your HD DVD deck to their trade
in center where they'll assign a value
and add that to the gift card cool now
you're up to 51 dollars that's the buzz
report I'm Brian Cooley thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
