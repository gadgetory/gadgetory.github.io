tomorrow daily the best eat talk show in
the known universe I'm your new co-host
jeff cannata i will be doing these small
episodes with ashley and then the two of
us will combine forces like a Voltron on
thursdays for a longer show the first
one of those next Thursday not this
thursday so stay tuned for that but
right now let's get to the headlines mi
t's tangible media group is at it again
and this time they have living bio skin
integrated into clothing it's called
bio/logic and it's a combination of
regular clothing and special nano
actuators that can detect things like
humidity and change their shape in a
nutshell that means highly responsive
events for clothing so how do these nano
actuators work by growing natto cells
and printing the bacteria with a special
3d printer on to thin fabric creating a
panel that can change its shape based on
humidity either in the atmosphere or
through the skin mit created a lot of
custom things for this project a custom
3d printer creates the hybrid biofilm
and custom software helps design the
garment and the biofilm shapes before
it's fabricated the team says the nano
actuators can also be controlled via
electronic signals and they even showed
off the potential of a color-changing
version of the film while you might not
see these in a retail store anytime soon
it's pretty exciting to think that
someday we will grow sensors and
actuators in a lab instead of
manufacturing them okay our next story
is about Google's Project loon are you
ready for internet via balloon if you're
watching this show you probably don't
need the help of Project loon which is
Google's initiative aiming to offer
internet access to more remote places on
earth but there are a lot of places
where internet isn't regularly available
and Google wants to launch high-altitude
balloons to help accomplish their goal
we've talked about Project loon before
but late last week google announced it
was partnering with three mobile
networks in indonesia to provide service
to the country only one in three people
are online there who making it a perfect
location to continue testing the program
they worked like mobile hotspots in
locations where service towers and
structure is lacking or non-existent so
connecting via inexpensive smartphones
becomes an option for just about anybody
the project loon team has already
completed testing all over the world in
places like New Zealand New Mexico and
Chile project loon is going to be
launching over 300 more balloons in the
coming year that's a lot of sky internet
our next story is about 3d printing you
can 3d print a lot of stuff but you
couldn't 3d print hair until now and
when I said hair of course I meant
plastic hair a team at carnegie mellon
university's human-computer interaction
institute has a fun way to create
plastic strands of hair through 3d
printing if you think about how a blob
of hot glue makes a tiny strand when you
pull the glue gun away that's pretty
much how this process works adding a
specific set of parameters to a 3d
printer makes it possible and the team
mentions that there's no special
hardware required all you need is
patience a tiny 10 square millimeter
patch of hair took about 30 minutes to
create so you're not going to be
whipping up wigs in a day but what's the
process cures the finished product can
be braided brushed curled or even
trimmed and fitted into tiny
paintbrushes I still in its early stages
now but if 3d printing hair makes for
better toys I am in all right that's it
for headlines let's get to some
crowdfunding
today we're looking at all n fits a
wearable personal trainer that thinks it
can help you out at the gym all in fit
is actually comprised of three separate
sensors and a smartphone app when you
head to the gym you move the sensors
around depending on what exercise you're
performing and all in fit tracks your
form and the weight lifted as you work
out you'll see a real time readout with
a grade on your form and how much weight
you're lifting bad form the sensors will
vibrate to show you the problem areas in
your reps and live audio feedback will
explain what you're doing wrong you'll
get comments in the app and suggestions
on how you can improve and the app also
includes pre-designed programs for
different fitness goals 199 dollars get
you all in fits Kickstarter special
which includes one set of sensors bands
and the app with a may 2016 estimated
delivery they're looking to raise just
over 45,000 bucks and so far they have
just under twenty five thousand of that
with about 16 days left in the campaign
the hardest thing about working out in a
gym is maintaining your form and and
dealing with people so it looks like all
in fit handles both of those with
robotic form enhancement all right now
let's get to your awesome pictures
today's phone tog refer of the day is
Neil he sent in this picture that he
took with his iphone 5 baby tomorrow
daily my name is Neil and I'm 11 years
old this is a photo of the Chicago
skyline taking from millenium park on my
iphone 5 not 5s I give you guys
permission to use this photo on your
show you guys are definitely the best
talk show in this universe thanks Neil I
appreciate that i'm gonna go ahead and
take all the credit it's my first day
