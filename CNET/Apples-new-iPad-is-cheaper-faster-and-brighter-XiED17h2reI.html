over the years has gone from being a
status symbol to just another digital
tool competing with phablet sized phones
and hybrid pcs for our attention that's
why I'm surprised I'm as excited as I am
about this new 2017 model a nine point
seven inch tablet simply called I pad it
drops all the honorifics air pro mini
it's not the bells and whistles flagship
but it's the one you're actually most
likely to get the best value out of
that's because of the price it starts at
329 which is much less than the iPad air
2 it replaces this new model is
basically built into an iPad air one
body so it's slightly thicker and
heavier than the iPad air 2 you probably
have to put them side-by-side to notice
but in person there's a definite
difference the screen is also brighter
and I find myself spending most of my
iPad time on video viewing through
Netflix YouTube and other iOS apps
that's been a huge strength of the iPad
since the very beginning and is still a
great personal media player inside
there's an upgraded processor going from
the a8x chip to the new a9 chip and it's
definitely faster than the air 2 which
is great if you're into iPad games if
you need a tablet to be an all-day
everyday full-time computing and
communications device that may all mean
strongly consider dropping a more laptop
light chunk of cash on an iPad pro and
it's accessories but if you're looking
for an iPad that excels at traditional
iPad like things such as video games web
surfing and ebooks this is a great value
and should be the default first iPad you
consider
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
