machine is a definite premium upgrade
but it also has the goods to back it up
it has a ton of features great usability
nice design and good performance so in
terms of features you'll see a lot of
the usual suspects normal bedding modes
and things like that but this also
offers a lot of advanced options
including an app that actually lets you
remote start your washing machine that
connects over Wi-Fi so you can actually
access it on Android or iOS phones but
it worked intermittently at best it also
is compatible with LG's new twin wash
system that's a system that adds a
secondary smaller washing machine down
below so you can actually wash a bunch
of larger items up top and delicate
smaller items below now that is an
option but if you want to spend the
extra 730 bucks it's a good option and
even though it does have a ton of
different settings it's really really
easy to navigate the display looks nice
and it's generally just a very intuitive
setup the one caveat with this machine
is its performance it actually did
perform it really well it a verge Denine
t---three out of the ideal 100 that
isn't on a zero to 100 scale though so
instead of it being an A or an a-minus I
give it more of a B or b+ still good but
not awesome this model does strike a
good balance between overall stain
removal and being gentle on your clothes
but there are other models out there
that do better in terms of stain removal
and that's definitely an important facet
of performance for a lot of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
