stage live from CES 2015
I'm Brian Tong and joining me ooo is the
RZA aka Bobby digital aka Prince Rakeem
aka the scientist llaman aka aka a
everything I mean you were already you
were actually you know I was I was I'm
sure the music guys in the back were
flattered because you were like feeling
that beat just then huh yeah I start the
bus a quick Larry going you but uh you
know no yeah maybe maybe maybe so
welcome to CES this is you're actually
your first year here that's what you
told me back there yeah my first time
here and I'm having a good time here man
I mean so many gadgets so many cool
people you know a lot of people don't
know that a lot of what's hip hoppers
got a nerd bone inside of us
I mean I don't want to know if I I don't
want to know if I want to know your nerd
bone if you know what I mean well I got
one nerd bone in me and when I came to
CES it kind of got excited there's no
now it's really fun they're having a
great time in us and really I came out
with all the comedy boom bollocks and we
have this thing called the boombox
Rex which I'm excited about because I
think we discovered a new way to sell
music and to get music back into the
hands of the consumer you know I mean
you know this is a bong bong goo goo
baby the bomb booboo is that your name
now over here we have the boom ba tech
Rex Plus this was just announced as a
waterproof Bluetooth speaker but we also
have these two wu-tang 20th anniversary
editions you talk about creating music
and distribute it in a unique way one of
these ways is packing them in a product
like this right yeah so when you buy the
UM the boombox Rex it already has the
album embedded so usually when you you
know you even if used to buy a CD you
got to go home and put it in your car or
something like that this is automatic
pleasure you pull it out you hit the
button Bongbong it comes on you hit play
and party stars like bungbung
on your bun exactly you know what makes
this one cool oh I got it I gotta say
this to you
we was thinking about it was like would
it be a great use I live in LA now you
know a lot of beach parties and a lot of
pool parties so this one is made to go
underwater like three feet under line
free underwater so you know you have two
pool party and the girl want to jump in
Shh and you go man I want to get into
just jumping Shh
and y'all could just get that party
going underwater underwater video now
you know another thing that is really
intriguing is the fact that you have
been working on this album six plus
years right once upon a time in Shaolin
wu-tang clan one of one album a lot of
people that aren't fans or casual fans
may not necessarily know about this but
you kind of have a statement about music
and the direction it's going by doing
this one of one like there will be no
other way to distribute it right yeah
this that's to show you know music has
been devalued and one thing I think we
overlooked and I paint not the people
here because I think here we got a lot
of intellectuals but we overlook the
artistic value of what music is and what
art is if you look at something like the
Mona Lisa it's only one or the sculpture
of David it's only one so we're treating
this album once upon a time and Shaolin
like a piece of art it's not something
that you know if you want to see the
Mona Lisa you got to fly to France you
know I mean so this would be a one piece
of art that's a fingerprint of our Tom's
a fingerprint of six years of work a
fingerprint of other great artists
coming together I mean we had people
from I mean even cher came in Restless I
mean I could keep going on and and even
when we made the box we had a commission
a guy who's usually only commissioned by
the royal family of Saudi and he made
the packaging for us and we all knew
that this was going to be something that
it's kind of like a heirloom you know I
was in I was watching the news on the
East Coast this winter and somebody in
Boston found I guess the old time
capsule that they think that Benedict
one of the wandering one of the famous
cars buried and he and he was gonna open
it up on TV to find out what he was
thinking and what was life like during
that time
to me the once upon a time is Shallon
album is dad for our time so are you
gonna be I mean there's a I've read and
heard that people are actually bidding
for this because like you said it's a
one-of-a-kind piece of art from your
mind from the wu-tang clan I mean this
is no one no one's really done something
like this you don't want to bury this
though right I've read that you want to
kind of put on an exhibition featuring
some your other works and things like
that now allow for the two around the
world
like how some art exhibits do we are
there'll be a big announcement are gonna
make I think January 28th what I can
tell you today though is that there's an
auction company known as paddle eight
who actually want us over and there
would be the one who will deal with the
Occident and able to take it through the
art world and go through the proper
procedures so I want to say without the
paddle way and I think being people that
understand the concept I'm glad to have
them on board with us now another thing
that maybe you can kind of add on to
that story is that we've heard that
there were bids of two million even as
high as 5 million initially for the
album yeah so I mean has it reached
higher than that or is it you know where
is it out right now
Waddell well powder weight is cooking it
over since then so they will let us know
you know what the final number is it's
not just a it's really not just about
the money I'm not making money from a
lot of things I do you know I mean but
it's really about that person who wants
to possess this piece of history you
know there's really no price you can put
on it if I were to talk about the Wu
Tang Gong Wu Tang forever which sold 4
million copies at $25 apiece that's a
value of something I mean but I don't
want to talk about the value of it you
know I think that when the person gets
that he will have something that's
actually priceless yeah so stepping away
from just the cost of everything what
are you you've seen music from the from
the start with hip hop but you've also
seen how technology you know music
digitally you know sent out to people
iTunes now these music subscription
services what are your thoughts on that
is how it's changed the music game for
good or for better you know from you I
think it's a balance if you look at you
know music subscription and people able
to stream music and subscribe to same
we subscribe to film it's something
unique about that but we'll be doing
with this here we're trying to put it
back on your hand as well so I think
that they need to in it there needs to
be a balance it's okay to have your
music streaming on your buddies or you
and your car or whatever but what about
if you in the woods wanna hang out by
yourself and be your own man in your own
world that's what is coming at so if if
I think if other artists will take a
look at the boombox and say to
themselves you know this is gonna be
part of my release you know you can put
it on Spotify you can put it on iTunes
you can put it on CD and even vinyl is
making a comeback but also I want to put
it on this bluetooth speaker device so
this is gonna be I think a new way for
people to release their music so your
take is you're okay with all these
different formats but you kind of also
want to bring back that physical good to
music right listen I'm okay look I I'm a
producer so I make music with Ableton
ProTools
new window I got uh the the native
instruments maschine but at the same
time I got a real piano I got a real
good song I got a real set of drums
so some things of course I want to bang
on my drum machine you know if I'm
flying thirty thousand miles in the sky
and I'm warmin able channel market on my
laptop that's fun but when I'm living in
this burg in something or my friends
come over to have a good time we pull
our guitars out we get a bottle of wine
and we have a physical time so I think
you got to have both sides covered all
right well let's um shift gears a little
bit you're here at CES and one of the
themes here is wearables right there
putting Fitness and sensors I would like
people to see your wearable that you
have right now if we can bring the
camera up on this I mean this is
definitely a one of a kind
wu-tang blank watch now would you
there's so much out there about an Apple
watch I mean to me a watch is so
personal and it's a fashion piece what
are your thoughts on this whole Smart
Watch push that a lot of companies are
putting out no I actually dig it because
you know we think about you know you
know almost
Ebony's baby so that's when the spies
and James Bond and everybody was out and
we always wanted to have a phone in our
watch you know Matt Helm so for us to
see that some of that imagination has
become a reality up in that's very cool
you know I've been thinking about
something called cosmetic electronics
for a long time anyway
you know I mean I'm happy that other
companies and people are adventuring
down that way there's more things I
think we could do you know they make it
wearable because it is like I'm looking
at your little style right here see you
got your cool whites on what you walking
though and you I like the place that you
got right there
got to got some bracelet style here now
wouldn't that have another another thing
that you know another option to it like
if it was this cool and yet it still
took your pulse and kept you your daily
you know these statistics going
it'd be cool I mean I'm okay with that I
think for me just it's weird right I
cover technology every day I'm all about
tech but sometimes there are times where
I actually want to step away from it
personally and so if my wrist is buzzing
and blinging every day I don't know if I
want that right with your lady and you
love and your wrist is the one buzzing
know what's gonna happen to you that's
funny because after a while after the
buzzing of your wrist and then you're
gonna take it off and you're gonna take
your wrist it's buzzing but it's gonna
be not like it's on you hear your phone
ringing but it don't be ringing roast
the ghost vibration in your pocket
the ghost population you don't know what
to do for you let's do it I'm gonna say
this to you you better off being Johnny
Malkovich before you bout with this
alchemist I'll attach a Falcon claw to
the tip of the iron fist and I'll
pulverize MCS brains out the wu-tang
gets out like a ranked attains out the
cage with a 12-gauge flame is out dr.
Phil can't remedy my dosage of explosive
corrosives metamorphic oracle vocalist
liver cool till planets backwards then i
backflip backwards to a name of an
unnamed actress
this is microbe addict tactics my rappin
is like Eskimo in Alaska snow fish
trapping I'll make you sleep with the
colony of ants in your pants
I caused your body physiology to stop
and dance the abbot with the tablets and
rap tips I vote with the wu-tang clan
non men who I laugh with and use the bus
caps with there we go there we go
boom drop the wound like that yeah
anyway anyway yeah that's what's so cool
about the phones you know I got like
like 30 roms in my phone ways let's go
to another one notes on the fly you just
put them on there put them in right in
there right yeah now also you know you
do a lot of acting you know directing
and producing screenwriting you know I
watched a few episodes of gang-related
even you know before I even knew you
were a part of that show that was a cool
show how the cool was a cool show
and unfortunately it did you know people
it didn't stick its it came out for
season 1 but we also have things like
Netflix right that can sometimes bring
shows back to life or introduce them to
new audiences how do you see digital
working you know in that way how do you
how do you see that no I think that's a
great additive to our industry I mean I
actually thought that game believe it
would be more of a Netflix type of show
you know you know I was very surprised
that Fox actually took a risk with such
a show that was so gritty
multi-ethnic sin it and uh in a subject
matter was crazy so the good thing is to
see TV realizing the competition is
growing around them and they're wanting
to adapt to fit the competition but the
second thing is that you have formats
like Netflix and Roku and Honolulu and
all these guys who are who are making
content and their content is specific to
certain things but there's an audience
out there for it you know I watch the
lr8 Network now I don't know if you know
this network but you gotta check out the
ELMO network y'all on Saturdays
afternoon they show kung fu movies we
know you love your kung fu flicks Oh
Thursday they got kungfu Thursdays only
for Christmas this year they had all the
Godzilla movies it's playing all the
kaiju films or the kaiju
but then also they showed you rare films
that inspired other directors you know
whether they had to roll on they have 20
no one there John Carpenter one of
course Bobby
and yours and there's a network there
for me it's the film makers Network
because you get to watch the films that
inspired the people who are the elite in
our business so I think the the way that
the the way that technology is changing
our world whether you know some right
now they got the apps you could have TV
on your phone so your cake could be in
the backseat like this yes spongebob you
know I mean but these things have their
benefits of course then they have their
downfalls as well but I'm enjoying the
benefits of it right now and is there
one thing that from when you started
that has really surprised you the most
is there any kind of single piece of
technology that you've been like wow I
can't imagine I could have never
imagined that I could do that today
how is Ted kind of wild you that's good
but well one thing that impressed me I'm
going on a music level is uh they have
figured out a way to turn audio to MIDI
I always wanted to do that you know that
means that you could take a song you
like and change it to a MIDI file and
then manipulate it and then every
instrument inside your computer will
relate to that MIDI file that has never
been done I mean for years you know if
you want to take like it saved you got a
person like yourself and you want to
make the beat but you might make a make
a nigga be yeah he cut me off but the
cool thing is that now they could take
that data and a drum machine will play
it back for you and you could build the
track from that and so I remember one
day I heard Pharrell in uh Kanye on a
radio station hot 97 in New York and
they were saying like yeah we start all
our beats when I'm doing it with the
beatbox we do it I'm out first and then
they gotta sit there and try to hit the
pads on the drum machine now they could
just do it with their mouths and the
computer will do it for you that's a
great improvement in technology and a
great improvement for producing music
alright well there you have it RZA thank
you so much for coming out we appreciate
a man bomp bomp thank you for having me
all right thanks so much stay tuned more
