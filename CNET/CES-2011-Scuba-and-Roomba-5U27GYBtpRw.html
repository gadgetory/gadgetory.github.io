first look today at the new iRobot line
of products now iRobot are the robots
that clean your floors so there are
little robotic vacuum cleaners i love
them i use them at home all the time
this is nancy smith she's with iRobot
thank you for bringing by your little
robot machine my pleasure so you have a
new line of scuba and a new line of
rumba now let's go over what each one of
them do the rumba is a vacuum cleaner so
it's not going to pick up stay it's not
going to scrub your floors at all it's
just going to pick up we have a little
mess here and it does seem like an
organized mess but we did kind of grind
them into the carpet so we can really
put it to the test because this is not
for organized message right this is for
real life messes that's right the whole
idea behind our robots they work in
real-life situations so put it down in
your home push a button and let it go
and it figures it out the next day you
can pick it up and bring it to your
neighbor's house if you're real nice put
it down in their house and work their
great too so it's gonna work real life
situations in your home cleaning up
whatever you're putting down okay so
we've got some Cheerios here it's funny
that you're encouraging sharing that you
buy one for the whole neighborhood right
it's the only robot you bring out at a
dinner party you know so you'll you'll
be cleaning up beforehand make a little
message and show people how your robot
works it's a crowd-pleaser let me tell
you and a Christmas gift that just keeps
on giving so okay let's put it to the
test we have cheerios here it's the
easiest system ever it just goes down
and then looks for the dirt itself right
well so what it does is it tries to
figure out the size of space cleaning as
it goes we're doing a little rumba
soccer here because we have a mess the
robot doesn't see dirt in front of it
but it sees dirt underneath it so there
you go that's good it's going to go
ahead and you'll see the path that's
cleaning it's going to clean around your
shoe if you leave it there it has
sensors that can find edges and clean
around edges so right now it's finding
some dirty area clean right over those
Cheerios both the crushed up and the
whole which is really nice so it picks
up large objects as well as small and
the idea here is that the robot will
clean an area of your floor three to
five times before it's done and then it
will go back and charge itself and be
ready to go again the next day okay
that's pretty amazing because it did in
fact let's turn it off for a second it
did in fact pick up all the cheerio in
the debris there's some that we really
embedded into the carpet here with my
stiletto shoe so it's going to need
to come back and do that again that's
right the whole idea is that it will get
that area again and again and so just
like when you vacuum you don't go over
an area once you need to cover it
multiple times and our robot will get it
three to five times before shuts itself
off okay one of the big things in my
house especially is a hair because I
shed a lot of hair especially just
having had a baby you know that you shed
a lot of hair so um the hair gets
wrapped around the bottom let's talk a
little bit about that the robot has
these two counter-rotating brushes that
pick up a lot of hair and it's great
because it actually pulls the hair out
of the carpet so it does a great job
picking it up but in the past sometimes
the hair would actually wrap around too
much so you had to clean that very
frequently our new vacuum actually has
an ability to pull some of that hair off
it's called arrow vac and so it's
pulling a lot of the hair off of the
brushes and putting it back into the bin
so that it cuts down on any wear and
tear people who own room was before I've
complained about that and this is a
great fix for the new version right it
tends to be a big pain in the butt so
that now you can just catch her all the
hair in this plastic thing right and
then you just pull that out and dump
that in the trash that's right we also
now have hepatitis on it which was a new
feature for the Roomba for the 700
series and then tell me a little bit
about the the timer as well sure this
robot has the ability to be scheduled so
you can schedule it up to seven times so
you can have it go every day at noon
time while you're at work or you can
have it at different times of the day if
that works better for you and so it's
very convenient you don't even have to
think about maintaining your floors okay
and then the same sensor technology
where you can cordon off areas of your
house that is correct there is however a
new sensor in some of our 700 series the
higher ends have a new dirt detect
sensor which is very cool the current
one has a sensor that will detect fine
particulate so it actually here's the
dirt the new ones actually also have a
optical sensors they can see dirt
underneath it that's might be lighter so
hair like you're talking about if you
have a pet that sleeps in a certain area
and there's a lot of hair there you want
the robot to spend more time there so
the new higher end 700 series will do
that okay and then you use these tiny
little sensors to say don't go past this
room right correct so they're called
virtual walls and you can set them up in
the robot will actually ping them and
turn them on and won't go past them but
it also also has its own sensors built
in like natural sensors like cliffs so
it won't fall down stairs
don't have to worry about blocking those
off or anything that's so great okay
very good and when does this come out
and how much can we expect it sure those
are coming out the end of this in the
middle of q1 so if you go online to a
robot calm and you can be updated as to
when those will be available and the
price range is in for 50 and up okay all
right it's an expensive gift but let me
tell you if you hate washing floors and
sweeping as much as I do it's it's an
investment worth looking into okay now
let's talk about the new scuba this is
about half the size of the original
scuba so it's a lot smaller and again I
use this in my house and one of the big
complaints is that it don't it doesn't
get into the corners of the house so now
it's smaller for made four corners it is
made for tight spaces absolutely one of
the biggest comments we got back from
people's they wanted it to clean their
bathrooms nobody likes cleaning
bathrooms I don't like lady matters
right who likes that so the scuba in its
original form was 13 inches in diameter
too big to fit around toilets and around
pedestal sinks and things and so this
nice small compact shape allows it to
get into those tight areas and do a
great job cleaning okay so let's go
ahead and we put some coffee down and
i'm not sure if our cameras can pick up
but this is a blue gatorade here it
could also be Windex but you say that
this is not for really recent spills so
i wouldn't spill my coffee and then send
the scuba over i would wipe it up with a
paper towel and then send the school for
the stains right you see that coffee
stain was dried on and it just did a
great job lifting it and again the idea
here is that does the multiple pass
we've always found that the longer the
robot runs and it can actually leave a
little bit of water behind that actually
loosens up stains because there's water
and cleaning solution the great thing
about these is that they're always
putting down clean solution and water
and picking up the dirty water so you're
never washing with dirty water now at
use you have you suggest certain types
of cleaning solution but you can also
use vinegar right on our traditional
Scoob as you can use white vinegar which
is great for hardwood floors absolutely
alright and tell us a little bit more
about the the bits and pieces underneath
now that we've seen it clean up this
coffee that will turn it up upside down
so this robot is very easy to fill which
was another piece of feedback that we
had so it's just fill here and empty
here so there's a water containment
system in here that gets larger the
clean water gets filled up and as it's
dirty water it's filling the empty space
with the dirty water so again they never
meet on the bottom here what we have is
a plate that it uses to scrub the floor
and then suck up the dirty water this
plate is removable and washable which is
very important in our testing because if
I use this in my bathroom I don't want
it to go in my kitchen yeah for obvious
gross reasons yes exactly so the idea
here that you can take these off wash
them and reuse them or you can switch
them out as need be so that's very nice
it's very compact as you saw and the
wheels this has a much lower threshold
because it's not made to go on carpets
so you want to keep it on the hard
surfaces anything sealed it's great for
all right and you also mentioned that
the battery life is longer for these as
well on the Roomba the battery life has
been increased by fifty percent and so
the idea is that you can one of the
other uses people we've thought people
going to use it once a week when we
first came out with them but they're
using them two to three times a week
sometimes seven days a week so the
battery life and with any rechargeable
battery we try to improve it all the
time so this actually will last longer
okay and we can see this again in q1 and
for how much that's correct for 299 this
robot will be available on our website
very good well thank you very much these
are very fun little gadgets I'm glad to
have got to put them to the test
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
