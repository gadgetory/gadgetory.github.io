is Steven Beecham and you're watching
the Apple byte extra crunchy podcast
with your host mr. Brian Tom what's up
everybody what's up welcome to the show
Beach and Tom come in strong all night
long I like the outside you can leave
the all night long all day long all day
strong beats of Tom welcome to the show
everybody in this episode 99 of the
Apple byte extra crunchy our audio
podcast where we just expand and just
dig deep into the topics that are going
on this week this is really the last
word that we will have before the
keynote that happens on September the
12th that is Tuesday that will be going
down at 10 a.m. Pacific time but again
if you guys follow us on CNET live we
have like we kind of treat it like super
bowl action we do a pre-show we take
your calls we do we then have the
keynote and then we do a post show so
come and hang out with us it's gonna be
it's gonna be really hype but for this
show here well this is all about you all
we have to apologize because beach-like
our voice mails sometimes it just gets
full and we forget to empty right oh
yeah there's no notification that our
voicemail is full and I just kind of
figured it out when I noticed there's
not a mini voicemails so I wouldn't
clear them all out so we are good to go
again so call us at one eight hundred
what's the number one either guard 6-1
6-2 6-3 eight yeah how long you been
doing this 99 episodes and I've said it
every time except that time and you got
it wrong
I got it right baby I took me like you
know I stumbled in the beginning but I
got it yeah your name where you're from
get your comments your insights I think
because we're ramping up right before
the keynote I think you guys in galas
you just call us about what you thought
about the keynote again 1-866 two six
three eight I'll tweet that up tease
that on my Twitter so you guys can all
get on that but let's just jump into the
show and I think that the new cycle is
always interesting to me we've been
talking on the show at least for the
past two three months because right
you're the people that love technology
want to get all the latest scoops and
rumors we've really talked about that
whole rumored $1,000 price point a month
ago
we've talked about how there were
potential delays on the iPhone 8 because
of a manufacturing issues whether it's
removing the home screen or sorry
removing the home button trying to get
that fingerprint sensor and it not being
able to then moving interactive
different direction we've talked about
that I think like two or three months
ago
yeah well with this new cycle right all
of a sudden you have mainstream
newspapers kind of like putting out
those stories a week or two before the
keynote and I always find it interesting
because this is stuff that the insiders
and the people that care have been
talking about for literally over the
past two months but also in like last
week there was a headline the iPhone may
cost $1000 and everyone that is kind of
you know my friends that follow this
stuff casually my mom when my mom starts
freaking out then yeah that's like the
main that's the general consumer but
they're like is the is the iPhone gonna
cost a thousand bucks people are
freaking out about it right
yeah Jeff called him like oh man dude
seriously and we're like yo you're not
it's you're already paying pretty close
to that right now it's not gonna be much
so the hot button issue this week was
the iPhone delays and multiple outlets
report about this Wall Street Journal
got the ball rolling basically saying
hey there's been a glitch in the summer
production that is creating a potential
shortage and then you have people coming
to me and saying wait are they gonna be
low on iPhones like do I really need a
pre-order it's like what's gonna happen
how am I gonna get one or not and I'm
just like oh my gosh like we know that
they probably won't have as many on
launch but guess what they've quite
honestly actually already has always had
shortages based no matter what Apple
will never be able to meet the demand
when an iPhone launches right yeah I
mean it's it's funny because Bonnie our
our executive producer was asking me
about this last night or yesterday at
work and like a month ago meeting you
did a show and the headline was
everything is on track like they're
gonna meet their goals you know like
action is on track but now it seems like
that is all shifted you're saying
there's a big production glitch like
what was the production glitch but this
is a production glitch that was reported
like back in June oh how they were
having issues with the home button in
the OLED panel and then all of a sudden
the same literally the same exact story
with no new details gets published a
week before the keynote on The Wall
Street Journal and everyone's like you
know ittan bricks yeah yeah
right there hit and bridge you know what
I'm doing it's like two or three years
in a row we've had the same problem with
like the rose gold phone was never
available people went and they settled
for another color that they didn't want
I'm sorry beets I know that's why you
didn't upgrade you know but I love gold
that's like gold finger dude I love her
well yeah so you would think Apple would
get their stuff together maybe they're
too busy building their there Apple
campus I guess to worry about iPhones
being on times so and then so I bought
this after the Wall Street Journal put
that on and it kind of started getting
people all flustered because yeah when
are quite honestly when our exec
producer starts freaking out I'm like
dude we this just chill out it's not a
big deal then um TechCrunch threw out a
report maybe a day after that saying
that the high-end iPhone is expected to
ship after standard models this was also
this was also rumored back in June that
this could potentially happen then they
said they will be on track who knows we
don't guess what no one knows exactly
what's going on my hunch is that Apple
should have some at launch I don't I
think it would look silly to to be a
month delayed it won't be the end of the
world because guess what people have
already been waiting so long for this
iPhone I this is quite honestly the most
hyped iPhone we've seen I think since
maybe the iPhone maybe since the iPhone
6 where they changed the form factor
yeah six six s7 yeah but this is the
most drastic change that they've ever
done across line we all know the rumors
all of you guys are guys and gals are in
the know so who knows
exactly if this is going to be delayed
another report from Street insider said
it actually isn't the OLED screen that
might be delaying it it actually might
be the actual metal frame and working
that piece effectively in combination
with the design of the new phone this is
a corner street insider so now right
we haven't heard these stories for
literally maybe two months it's a week
before the keynote and everyone is going
apeshit yeah we've got to put a story
out and every we've got to get the
people talking and again the its I just
find it interesting the new cycle of
this is the stuff that we have all been
talking for so long so we will see what
happens I think the other big story that
I really enjoyed and it came from Ming
Chico and it kind of gave us some
perspective about what's going on with
the iPhone the iPhone is roughly
entry-level gonna cost a thousand
dollars that's the rumor at least the
entry-level OLED I phone we did ask just
last week we were making a joke about oh
my gosh you'd have to have like ramen
for breakfast from lunch for dinner like
beats you found that you found that
tweet I can't remember who sent it to us
Jonathan what does it say he says it
would cost roughly twenty two thousand
one hundred sixty cup of noodles for the
price of the next iPhone so that's
that's that's a lot of dinners and
lunches dinner for two years 2160 cup of
noodles Wow that's what it was a couple
- yeah
that's that's kind of crazy I think
though I you know I've been talking
people and you and I have talked about
this a lot Beach but I had this sit-down
with some co-workers about four or five
of us we're getting lunch and people
were complaining about the fact that the
iPhone might be a thousand dollars and I
said okay would you pay ten more dollars
per month to have the newest iPhone
right so first the first question is are
you guys planning on getting the new
iPhone yes but and then they're like but
I don't like that it's a thousand bucks
I'm like okay would you pay 10 more
dollars a month 10 to 15 more dollars
knowing that you want this phone would
you pay that and what do you think the
answer was across the board
yes yeah they were all like yeah totally
and I'll talk to my homie
Brian Bay he always likes it when I
shout him out so I will shout him up and
I'm like dude just don't drink two
drinks a month just just dial down two
alcoholic beverages a month and you're
totally good and he said to me that's
what gets me from tipsy to drunk I keep
those drinks yeah and so I think if you
want the iPhone you're gonna get it I
put up a pole I forgot to send you the
link beach but I put up a pole on my
Twitter just asking people right now
right would you would you do it where
were you at let me look it up real quick
so I basically asked the OLED iPhone 8x
edition or Perl whatever you call it is
gonna cost around a thousand dollars
would you pay that 10 to $15 more
dollars per month on your bill to have
it right now it's I just sent it out
like an hour ago or so six hundred fifty
one votes 64% said yes no hesitation 36%
said no way Jose I just voted no way
Jose yes way I think you're a yes way
babe we'll see we'll see when it comes
out it really took your hands it really
depends on what the bells and whistles
and like you know it really depends on
the overall you know the function and
form of the phone if it's really cool
I'm probably gonna go for it I might
wait a few months I'm not gonna go right
away but uh you know it really depends
on a lot you're gonna have to really
sell me Tim Cook you have to put on a
show a ladies and gentlemen as of the
recording of this show 11:16 a.m. with
11 seconds I'd like it a timestamp that
Stephen Beecham we're gonna rerecord
that specific soundbite you just had and
play it next week and we'll see if you
were really if you bad because you're
gonna go bonkers at that keynote I know
you're gonna go bonkers I could've gone
bonkers before it could happen I think
this keynote is gonna be bonkers I
really do and yes its features we
No have been on other phones but it's
all about right now we know Galaxy
Samsung's notes
LG's they've had so many of these
features but it it's gonna be execution
and quite honestly I think what also is
always funny about new iPhones and this
is gonna be kind of sad and I think
Android people get mad about this and
there's a little jealousy between both
sides for different reasons but look
when Apple puts out a phone with little
to no bezel guess and no home screen
mainstream I'm a consumer is going to
think that's the coolest thing they've
ever seen
yeah like they're going to be on the
title then you're gonna hear chatter
when you're like getting coffee or
something and get it probably hear two
people say oh my gosh Apple release the
phone that doesn't have any buttons on
it and there's gonna be like a rolls
from the Android people's give me a roll
so the techni me but this is what
happened this is the power that they
have and that can never be
underestimated it happens all the time
you know what I mean I mean there's so
many like Android phones all Sienna be
like oh that looks pretty cool and I
have no idea what it is because there's
just so many of them you know and
they're just kind of fly under the radar
but like an Apple phone it's gonna big
difference you know it's in front of
everyone's face so you know I'm not
there's a lot of the I'll just call him
the general consumer that is easily
going to freak out about this phone I'm
freaking out because I'm excited I'm not
a general consumer for the record so oh
but let me just jump into the story that
I thought was really cool talking about
why the iPhone 8 might actually be $1000
or roughly in that ballpark so kji
Securities analyst Ming Chi quo always
has a lot of different scoops and he was
talking about the OLED iPhone panel
supply well guess who's producing the
OLED panels for Apple its Samsung but in
addition to that OLED panels overall
there's not a lot of companies that can
mass-produce them at the quality level
that Apple wants for their phones and so
what is what ends up happening basically
makes you close at it the process or the
OLED panels that I've a politically
controlled by
Samsung and when you only have one
source that you're going to and one or
one carrier one distributor that is
giving you that part they're not going
to give you a break or a deal on that
pricing he reports that the OLED panel
for Apple's new iPhone 8 is s truffle e
122 $130 per panel purely for the part
that's before Apple gets their 30 40 %
margin whatever they do on their phones
but if you compare that to the 5.5 inch
iPhone 7s the LCD module or the screen
was 45 to 55 dollars oh so right here
you're talking about basically a $75
difference before Apple gets there their
profit margins up easily pushing that
screen up around let's say roughly a
hundred a hundred ten dollars to add on
to the cost of the phone then if we talk
about this new 3d scanning facial
recognition camera sensor infrared we
you know again we don't know exactly
what is how many components are part of
this but they're clearly putting in a
new 3d scanner depth sensing scanner
into the phone on the front face as well
if you just add those two components
together by themselves
that's probably easy right there at
least a $150 bump before you just talk
about the fact that this is a whole new
design x y&amp;amp;z so the fact that the phone
is roughly around $1000 you know eight
hundred eight hundred dollars is roughly
what a 1 what is it a 65 Sariah
entry-level 32 gig iPhone 7 7 plus after
taxes around like it's like 772 $800 so
if you just add these new components the
screen and the the new 3d scanning
sensor that's about a $200 boost it
makes sense why this phone is gonna be
around a thousand bucks so are you are
you thinking like the larger capacity
phones like the 256 are gonna be $1000
or I'm not the energy level iPhone OLED
screen ouch you're gonna really have to
sell me on the screen you're like Ernie
I can already hear Tim Tim Cook this is
the greatest Apple
screen we've ever never made it is
absolutely stunning look at it look at
it it's beautiful and guess what I'm
gonna be like damn that is beautiful
that is beautiful
all right um Barclays actually proposed
kind of this cool idea of maybe how you
can subsidize this phone I don't think
it makes makes things better but maybe
psychologically better and they
suggested even with the rumours of this
starting price point at $999 for you
know an iPhone 8 what Apple could do to
maybe appease the fans is bundling like
a one-year service of Apple music I'm so
for that and you would know I would be
tolling for that in the iCloud bundle
though they also mention if they give us
yeah like a terabyte or even 500 gigs of
an iCloud bundle I'm in like I'm saying
yeah you know what I'm saying and here's
the other thing though when I think
about this
do they even really need to do that like
well it would it would like immediately
bring a ton of new new users Apple music
and there I clogged so would like bring
in a whole crowd that would get into
that ecosystem and be into and be using
it and then maybe you know get hooked on
it so it makes sense I like the idea of
bundling you know services with with a
hardware product I think that's that's
super cool and t-mobile is kind of doing
a similar thing with their phone service
including Netflix and stuff like that
like that's that's very like a year
right that looks yeah that looks very
like appealing you know what I mean I
just I think that's a great idea
quite honestly I'm not gonna lie I just
would love a chance to see every episode
of planet of the apps are karaoke
that is what I've been waiting for the
opportunity to do such a thing
yes and get every like big album that's
coming out a week after it comes out
that's gonna be awesome
[Laughter]
we're just having fun
all right as we continue to roll on this
is I found this to be interesting timing
because Wired just put out a
really in-depth article that I enjoyed
about Siri and how its evolved what's
interesting about this is that Gregg
Joswiak one of the one of kind of part
of I guess you could say apples core
management team is is that actor enough
to say he's kind of part part of the
a-team when it comes to Apple but he was
made available for this article and when
I what happens is when I see that when I
instantly see Apple execs of making
themselves available for a story if
there's a motive behind it like they
they are trying to they're doing that on
purpose because they want people to
think about in a certain way so Gregg
Joswiak you see him on stage a lot when
he's talking about products he's the
Apple VP of Marketing he was made
available for this article now they
wanted to talk about how Siri has
evolved how how it's more human-like
sounding and I will give them credit I'm
running the iOS 11 developer beta on my
iPad Pro you notice how I always drop
that in here at every show I also have
to say iPad pro iPad pro so it does have
a more not that it makes a difference to
me as much but it definitely sounds more
natural compared to the much more
robotic Siri but there's a couple
nuggets in this article that I found
interesting one of them is they were
time out okay how Siri has evolved but
Gregg Joswiak Joswiak
outright slammed the original Siri but
not why you think okay so I'm gonna just
read an excerpt directly from this wired
story about Siri the title of the
article is how Apple finally made Siri
sound more human here this is this is
the court this is in the article Apple
says it's not it's Apple says it's not
it's fault this is when people complain
by how Siri has fallen behind from
Amazon and Google when Siri first
launched another company provided the
back end technology voice for voice
recognition all signs point to nuance as
that company though neither Apple nor
nuance ever confirmed a partnership now
nuance and is known for like their
dragon dictation software back in the
day
oh yeah whoever it was Apple blames them
for series early issues this is quote
from Joswiak it was like running a race
and you know somebody else was holding
us back
Joswiak said they had big plans for Siri
this idea of an assistant you could talk
to on your phone and have it do these
things for Ewing in a more easy way but
the tech just wasn't good enough you
know
garbage in garbage out whoa that's
pretty heavy man and you know what I
think that's petty I think that is total
BS to slam a company that you partnered
with to be the first with a voice
assistant on your phone you're gonna
blame them for it not evolving like you
chose them yeah you know when you're
reading that and I'm hearing that like I
just kept thinking about apples culture
like their business culture is way
different than a lot of other companies
they're hardcore like they're emailing
each other like midnight on Saturday and
stuff like that and maybe this company
wasn't like into that kind of you know
24/7 work environment you know what I
mean so it's hard to say who's who's to
blame whatever but I just feel like
maybe Apple's culture was not in tune
with this company what was the company
called you know what you want yeah so
and there were also other rumors right
there the company that there see the
stories bounced around a little bit
because the company that also was
rumored to be kind of the Godfather of
Siri was the company that it now has
completely evolved to the viv voice
assistant right which was demoed at tunc
TechCrunch a couple years ago viv was
actually acquired by Samsung and used in
bixie unfortunately it's not being used
to its full potential
but when viv was demoed at TechCrunch
people can look up the video on YouTube
it was ridiculous because you could do
things like order a pizza on the fly add
the ingredients you want change them in
a conversational tone it was like
basically it was literally like talking
to someone about ordering a pizza and it
understood the syntax the subtleties of
take this
that away and it and they showed it how
it worked in multiple different ways it
basically is able to handle multiple
queries in a single sentence okay that
was actually rumored to be one of the
godfathers of Siri but you can't your
Apple don't tell me you are so petty and
you are it is pathetic to blame their
fault and for them falling behind on amp
with Amazon and Google because they
decided to partner what nuance now in
the article Joswiak says okay you know a
few years ago they decided to kind of
start building it from the ground up use
more machine learning bring in people
from multiple languages and dialects so
that Siri could be smarter Siri now
according to them recognizes roughly
like 95 percent of the language
translation that comes in you know
there's some funny videos about Siri not
being able to pick up accents but I
don't I think it's just wrong six or
seven years later to crap on someone
when really it was your mistake and to
not to not own up to it and just say we
didn't do it good enough and we're also
behind it's crap they're kind of total
crap yeah they're like passing the buck
a little bit but also like they marketed
serious series like the most famous
personal assistant out there like you
know like Siri is like a household name
pretty much you know so it's funny that
they're pooh-poohing it now but they've
like spent all this time and effort
building it up and making it a household
name it's just interesting like I don't
that look that looks bad you know like
other companies are gonna be I'm sure
other companies gonna be excited to jump
on board and work with Apple but at the
same time they're gonna be a little
concerned that Apple might you know talk
some ass about them later yeah so I
thought that was an interesting point in
the article the the focus on the article
is how Syria has become more human but
here's another kind of fun excerpt I
think this is probably the most
entertaining one from the whole story
here's here's what it says from the
beginning Joswiak says Apple wanted Siri
to be a get done machine it drives
him crazy that people compare virtual
assistants by asking trivia questions
which always make Siri look bad he's
Joswiak said we didn't engineer this
thing to be Trivial Pursuit
that is yeah that's funny that's like
always the first thing people ask is
like stupid I'm like guess what though
that's not why people don't like series
they don't they don't look at Siri as
the best because it's not nearly as
capable as Google or Amazon like they
don't have the developer support that
Amazon does and they don't have the
brains that Google does it is better
from what it used to be I think the
first four years of Siri I refuse to use
it for voice dictation when text
messages because it was straight-up doo
doo it's a lot better now and so I do
use it yeah you're always gonna get an
error here and there but it's
significantly better today than it was
before so I will give them credit for
that absolutely that's cool so check out
that article I think I think it's a fun
one
a friend of Siri the air pods I just
want to let you all know
according to Apple Store the shipping
time for air pods is now around one to
two weeks nice no longer six no longer
four even if you look right now I think
the order date says they'll deliver
somewhere between September 22nd and
September 29 air pods getting close to
being in stock like like boom ice I need
to let the people know because everyone
freaks out about that six weeks is a
long time in a way man that's a bummer
but though it's not one it's you and
again I have to defend myself for the
record people that say oh he talks so
much crap out the air pods everyone
admits that they look goofy but I've
told you there are really really really
good product I don't think they're great
but they're really good they're really
dang good so let's just squash that
right now if I hear someone say that one
more time I'm gonna do the same thing I
just did in every episode it's all good
to hate something and then love it later
you know it's all good we can takes
what's wrong about taking a hot tape
people's minds change they do also if
you want to talk about people's minds
changing an Apple right they have
completely evolved into trying to find
original content they've continued to
hire more Hollywood execs to
try and somehow catch up or be on the
same level as Netflix and you know
Amazon does have a little jump but let's
be honest that the fact that was right
Netflix HBO that's where probably some
of the best premium content is that
you'll find according to an article in
The Hollywood Reporter Apple is now
joining the race for the rights to the
James Bond franchise which is really
interesting so here's kind of how it
breaks down
Warner Brothers right now is the is the
front contender what it is as MGM is
technically like the owner of the rights
but Sony for a while had the
distribution rights so what does that
mean mgn owns like the characters the
likenesses and the stories Sony can
distribute movies with James Bond on it
Spectre was the last one I don't know I
thought Spectre was kind of like one of
the weak well it wasn't it wasn't my I
don't know if it might have been my
least favorite of them all I don't know
did you see it I haven't seen Spectre
but the last few that they came out with
a pretty awesome okay well no Craig
rules I like I like I like Daniel Craig
but you can't top Sean Connery you
cannot shut under E I'm uh I'm sure
Mason
Roger no Roger sorry more and more Roger
yeah I'm more of a Roger more dude okay
fine Roger more you're right shut up
because everyone that's listening is
just like dude clearly in a Bond fan and
he's saying Sean Connery is the best one
so are they they're just going for the
rights to distribute they're not trying
to like own the franchise and we're not
gonna see James Bond with like an iPhone
and like ear pods and stuff in the next
movie right well what what is that if
they get this deal they could much like
Sony put the movie in theaters they
could be the company that puts the next
James Bond movies in theaters but also
what this means and what they're looking
to angle in towards because my amazon is
also in the mix is getting the rights to
stream James Bond films on their service
exclusively yeah also able to be the
first ones to stream the new movies that
come out in the future so this is all
about right
content is king getting the best stuff I
don't know if people heard it's just a
quick footnote but remember how Disney
is pulling out of Netflix to kind of
work on their own video service and I
think 2019 they did announce that they
will also be pulling when their contract
is up with Netflix all Star Wars and
Marvel stuff as well that's a huge
that's a huge deal man
that is that's a lot of big content I
think what's interesting though is also
I didn't say that a lot because I think
this week is really interesting I should
stop saying that is that it didn't
really affect Netflix because they have
so much great you original programming
oh yeah yeah I mean not that I'm like a
stock watcher it was just that it was in
the article but they said that the stock
didn't you like drop like three cents
that day so it wasn't that Netflix on
that announcement that also Marvel and
Disney stuff would be pulled out it
didn't really hurt them so I thought
that what's good for them but it also
shows everyone wants to do their own
service everyone wants to get their own
content I think bond is a great thing
the point for me is that Apple was
rumoured to being working on original
content and investing 1 billion dollars
in original content which is about 1/5
or 1/6 of what Netflix is doing I think
that the bidding here for James Bond
they said the property could be worth
somewhere between 2 billion and 5
billion so this would be separate from
the original content but Apple is
sitting on 261 billion dollars of pure
cash they really want to give this thing
a go and they really want to make their
play make themselves a place to be to
watch content they've got to drop more
they've got to drop more than 1 billion
on original content oh for sure what
does Netflix is doing like 7 billion or
sickening a years like that's working
and it's working yeah you know all the
best producers are going to Netflix like
hey I got an idea
all right do you want to hear my
favorite story of the week yes I've
loved this story all right I'm gonna
read the headline everyone people might
may or may not have heard of this this
is how no I just love this from the New
York Times the Boston Red Sox used Apple
watches to steal signs from the Yankees
here's the hit this is one of the games
actually wear this hat was happening is
in August
it is so-so
I will say this officially finally we
found something that the Apple watch can
do I'm kidding I'm kidding
don't right we finally found something
the Apple watch was useful for so this
is I'm gonna New York Times did a really
great in-depth article it's kind of the
b roll clip beach so maybe you can
follow along with me buddy it was a
breakdown of how the Red Sox
used the Apple watch specifically to
steal signs from the Yankees so you have
to kind of also uh it's it's another
article Beach oh okay I'll find out so
this is really cool and really amazing
and you do have to understand baseball
to a certain degree but I'll explain the
best way I can okay so first of all
right communication between the pitcher
and the catcher step one
the catcher gives signs to the pitcher
you normally see them waggling his
fingers one two three pointing out to
the side or why not
okay the way that this works is that
when you ever you watch bass at baseball
there is a centerfield camera and you
can actually see the catcher doing the
signals to the pitcher so what happened
is Boston in a video room let's say in
the dugout or underground is ends up
being able to decode these signs how
they do that they basically study the
signs that the catcher gives they look
to see what pitch was used when a
runners on second base okay so they kind
of figure out after they and a lot of
times teams will code their signs and
mix them up but what they end up doing
is over time they can kind of figure out
okay which is the fastball which is the
curveball which is the you know right
which is the slider and this hopes
timing for baseball and baseball is all
about timing and seeing the ball to
strike okay then the third part of this
after they decode this and figure out
what the signs mean the video room sends
the cracked code to the dugout
via the Apple watch so to a member of
the training staff this is what happened
when they said that Yankee said they saw
one of the one of the members of the Red
Sox in this in the dugout see looking at
his Apple watch so you could basically
say something like okay this is a
fastball this is a slider this is a
of all the video room has decoded this
they send it to the dugout now what
happens is that we're sin in the dugout
then disseminates that information to
the players yes and why one of the base
coaches right he he does not even one of
the players when the players yeah so
this is why this is important when a
runner is and this is why this is only
effective one of the runners on second
when a runner is on second base not only
can they see the signs so they now are
given this knowledge base of what
pitches are what the runner on second
can also see the batter so the batter is
then told by the runner who has learned
the code the batter will then maybe give
them a little nudge maybe they stick out
an arm like the fast balls come in fast
balls coming the batter knows this and
is looking fastball so it's really
intricate you need to have a second base
runner to be able to decode this once
he's learned that and then tell the
actual batter who was batting that's how
they were able to do it isn't that crazy
though well process so oh look there was
a guy on second there and he told him he
probably told him fast balls coming out
of the park go over the Green Monster
there was a guy in second for that hate
to these are highlights from the game
from one of the games was rigged I know
there was no guy in second for that one
but uh that is amazing I thought it was
like I literally thought there was a
when the batter was in the thing he had
like a camera or something I didn't know
how was going but that's pretty
interesting intricate how they figured
that out so people in the chatter like I
thought you can't wear jewelry on the
fields guess what the base runner
doesn't have to be the one with the
Apple watch
it's the dugout the person who is
communicating with the video team in the
dugout
it gets the messages gets the code tells
that to the players so the players in
all it's not like there's ten codes to
learn it's literally like there one is a
fastball there two is a curveball there
three is a slider once they figure out
where in the cadence they're giving
those signals off that's how they figure
it out so you don't need to do that I
think and then was funny as recently
right after that story broke the Red Sox
and I think the Blue Jays went into like
game that lasted 19 innings so clearly
the watch was not part of that game
they're like no we're setting you down
we're sending you down we see this kind
of stuff in football too like the
Patriots were filming the other team
during their practice and stuff so it's
a lot of technology involved in all
these sports and like cheating stuff
that makes the story even better these
are there's photo evidence here Tim Cook
actually visited Fenway Park and there's
pictures from there the Red Sox Twitter
account but Tim Cook ain't and I would
like the manager and the mascots on the
field oh I thought it was so good I was
like this picture did not age very well
like they need a caption that picture
with cook dude when I first saw this I
thought it was a meme like that someone
made a joke for the Red Sox story this
is hilarious man there's real that's all
Apple watches you'll be champions again
so good all right
just a couple stories before we get to
actually you know what let's just um I
think was just get the calls I'll skip
to the cults cool cool cool all right we
had a lot of good calls and I apologize
for our voicemail before but we emptied
it and actually people did call us a
secure so got a few we still got a
feeling she's still got a feeling okay
here we go
: number one hi Brian
hi BTM him from Buffalo beacon was
talking about not waiting just phone to
unlock too soon
well Apple to take care of you with face
gestures just imagine a smile a wink or
even a duck face to unlock your phone
duck face good watch - a selfie camera
take care guys happy approaching 100
take care bye yeah man 100 coming up
yeah I think it's because you want duck
face yeah he was a the selfie that's
that's a personal request if I'm if I'm
reading between the lines yeah that's
wishful thinking for sure but yeah that
gestures face gestures
phones do recognize those now that or
recognize that really quickly now so
it's possible yeah but I also saw this
video of a dude was unlocking Samsung
phones that had faced attacked with just
like someone's picture from Facebook yes
all that yeah yeah yeah so don't do that
yeah please Apple make sure that doesn't
work for everybody because that is a
security breach no one read come out
okay here we go next call do we know if
this year if the iPhone is going to have
the same chips across all devices I know
that with the 7 they use two different
chips and so there were some differences
between the phones that were on AT&amp;amp;T and
those phones that were like on Verizon
like Verizon had the Qualcomm chips I
think it was and the other versions had
the Intel chip so is there going to be a
difference this year do we expect Apple
to stick to using one chip or using two
different ones again thanks for the call
this is in response to the modem chip
that was used in the iPhone 7 there were
two different ones in the Qualcomm was a
better performing one but then there
were reports that Apple basically
throttled it down a little bit so that
it would match the Intel chip that
wasn't as that didn't perform as well
and there actually there's Lee there's a
lawsuit and legal battles going on
between Apple and Qualcomm not for other
reasons but also one of those aspects
like Qualcomm's like dude you guys made
our chip lower performing and look worse
because you wanted to satisfy your
overall customer base the latest reports
for this new iPhone series whether it's
the upgrade to the 7 and the 7 s7 s7 s
and the new OLED a phone is that corn
reports it looks like they will all be
using Intel based modems we'll find out
once the actual supply comes out I think
that's a bummer because we know that
Qualcomm just purely from their
experience in the business they have had
better performing until sorry better
performing modems
if it's an Intel one we want and only
until we won't have anything really to
compare to inside an iPhone but I think
that well most people really care are
you not going to buy an iPhone because
they only used Intel chips no but it
would be a bummer all reports though
points of that it will only be an Intel
modem chip enough in the new phone so
let's have to weigh in see and find out
pum pum pum
that's the Intel jingle okay cool we're
going Intel baby alright next call what
are you like it or not this is Jack Jack
what's up hey Brian hey Steven this is
Jack just wanted to get your thoughts on
if you think that Apple will switch from
using a regular USB in to a USBC and on
the iPhone a and all future Lightning
charging cables since it will provide a
fast charge thanks of the show so this
is an interesting call because it's also
related to kind of similar things that
I've experienced with the iPad pro iPad
pro so with the iPad pro right it came
with a USB cable
lightning the USB cable but not but you
had the option to buy USB C for faster
charging I'm assuming Apple could
surprise me but I'm assuming that Apple
is gonna do the same exact thing they're
going to just have it bundled with a
standard USB cable that goes into a
charger the reason why is they can make
more money by having people buy a
lightning to USB C cable and then buy a
USB C charger they can make around like
70 bucks more by doing that if they were
cool they bundle it but I'm gonna guess
that they will not bundle it that's my
nostra Tongass prediction oh man I wish
I had my lightning my Thunder strike
ready for that well we need to get it on
him yeah I got it I got it hang on hang
on let me get to your lab all right hold
on oh let me let me say it one more time
then tell me when you're ready so we can
cue this up
it's gonna play go ahead say it right
now why yes yes my North Street honest
prediction is that premature premature
sorry my man's like production on the
pot production on the fly yeah I don't I
don't think they will I they make more
money by not doing that okay I'll get
you a room at the moment passed it's
okay yes I got all the buzz out loud
sound I found all the buzz out loud
sound effects the other day so don't be
surprised if you're gonna hear a few of
those okay so we have a one last phone
call so let's hear what it's what they
have to say what up guys this is Jay
Mack from Brooklyn I love this show just
finished watching episode 98 all I gotta
say is Beach you're gonna be spending a
lot of money for your new phone because
I'm doing the same thing Siri call I ask
you guys how besa purchased a new iPhone
I'm definitely gonna get it unlocked and
I just want to know Brian 1 should I
start you know getting it right away to
guarantee at least a shipment I figure
it's going to be shipping out in
February garlis I like to hear what you
have to say I love the show guys keep it
easy and against our Beach but again
it's been a lot of money catch you guys
later peace I'm saving my bucks man I'm
confused because he said February I was
like yeah yeah that's February look if
you want in I think this new iPhone in
general I think people are gonna feel a
lot of pain like they did with the
freaking Super NES classic cuz they
can't they're not grown-ups they're not
grown-ups it's like some of these things
are hard to get online and you're not
always gonna get them and I think we
might if I had to guess I think we might
there's gonna be some people that are
disappointed about not being able to get
the new OLED iPhone on launch I think
they're gonna have some available on
launch we'll see how much inventory they
actually get out but you know the when
people are complaining about the fact
that their cart crashed first a Super
NES classic and making it eight minute
video about it
or people complaining about i'm serious
chizz like it's like that's horrible
where people complain about like not
being able get an iPhone or you know I'm
a sneakerhead we deal with this all the
time okay I'm just gonna put out there
Houston Florida bastard Berto Rico
disasters that are happening
internationally was it is it I don't
want to say it incorrectly I don't want
to say Bangladesh but I know Mexico I
don't care if you can't get it online
because the system busted like we are so
lucky to be able to have this stuff it's
like don't make a video about that just
have some perspective and just suck it
up just suck it up sometimes you're
referring to a Nintendo video which I
highly agreed with the whole video or we
know with uh without what's his name
my frickin shot John yeah yeah I mean
you know it is first of all problems but
Nintendo's got to fix their problem with
nets bro not bring this stuff to get
robbed I've I've been a sneakerhead for
years this this whole thing of like that
sites literally getting hammered with
millions of people to try and get a pair
of shoes has happened for like the past
five or six years yeah yeah like it's
just the way it is
I don't know now if you think what the
Nintendo thing is definitely a pain in
the ass
well welcome to my world oh I gave up
after the Nintendo classic I'm like no
