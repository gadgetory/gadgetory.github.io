and this is the Panasonic TCL 47 WT 50
this is Panasonic's best LCD TV for 2012
it's not its best TV however stevie is
available in a 47 and a 55 inch size
Panasonic is now starting to get into
the larger screen LCDs that competes a
little bit directly with its core plasma
business and as I alluded to earlier
this TV is not as good overall as the
plasma TVs from Panasonic that we've
tested let's talk about it styling
though that is really darn nice this LED
TV has a very thin bezel around the edge
it's black with a silver extreme edge
I'm also a big fan of The Stand it's
kind of a v-shape kind of lets the TV
suspend above the stand with this sort
of swivel here and the silver sets off
the black of the TV nicely all in all
it's one of the nicest looking TVs we've
tested this year panasonic also throws
in plenty of features on this set you do
get a second remote with this TV it's a
touchpad model a lot like the touchpad
found on a laptop computer works very
well actually you get pretty good
responsiveness as you drive around the
screen it's actually particularly
impressive for the web browser which
otherwise would be really difficult to
use i also like zooming around titles
and stuff like that on netflix and
amazon video on demand for example of
course this TV has a full smart TV suite
with those video services it also has a
couple extra audio services they just
added Rhapsody which is a subscription
music service that I really like so all
told the content selection is really
good and I love the fact that you can
rearrange the icons as much as you want
don't love the fact that this TV has
built in advertising when you first turn
it on there's a little banner ad that
pops up panasonic also sold space to
advertisers on its homepage you can
disable that banner ad but you can't
disable the advertising anywhere on its
smart TV sweet so again more advertising
than we've seen on any TV built-in
Panasonic selection of picture setting
seems pretty good you do get plenty of
adjustments in the custom picture mode
as well as the cinema mode when we
delved in however we found that cinema
did not allow you to turn off d judder
which is this smoothing effect that is
sometimes been called the soap opera
effect we really didn't like it and
really wish you could turn it off in
cinema mode you have to actually switch
to another picture mode like custom or
standard to turn it off so it's kind of
a downside even after i disabled
smoothing I found
equality in the WT 52 BdoubleO a lot of
the other high-end LED TVs it's
competing against its black levels are
relatively light and its color is not as
accurate as i'd like to see at this
level and its favor the WT 50 had
excellent off angle viewing its picture
maintain fidelity better than any LED TV
I've seen so sitting to either side on
the couch can actually give you a better
picture than on a lot of the other LED
TVs out there panasonic does provide
plenty of inputs on this slim back panel
there's four hdmi three USB and a pc
input you can also connect component or
composite video using a concluding
breakout cable it doesn't include 3d
glasses however and that's another
downside of such an expensive TV anyway
that's a quick look at Panasonic's TCL
WT 50 series i'm david katz minor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
