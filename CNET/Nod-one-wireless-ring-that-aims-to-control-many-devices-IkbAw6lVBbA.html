they can control everything
I'm Scott Steiners a first look at the
nod a ring that aims to control your
computer your phone your TV your
wearables or your smart home everything
around you it's available for pre-order
now for $149 it's going to be shipping
fall 2014 and it is a small waterproof
ring that fits over your index finger
what does it do it's got a variety of
sensors allows you to wirelessly control
and point gesture to anything you like
as you can see for playing games and to
make various gestures single or multi
finger and has a 32,000 dpi controller
mechanism built in it also has a tiny
little touchpad and clicking device so
you could use this as an executive
pointer as well it has an open API and
SDK encouraging developers to make
various uses for this it'll also work
out of the box apparently with things
like nest Phillips hue lighting system
GoPro cameras 2012 LG TVs and onwards
and more
how many will work how many will need
apps will remains to be seen if you
envision magically waving your arm to
interact with your smartphone
maybe the knot ring is the thing I'm
Scott Stein it's the first look at the
nod Bluetooth 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
