you about a J but with heavy usage that
can be cut down quite a bit sure you can
disable the heart rate sensor or stop
notifications to improve it but let's
not forget that this is a SmartWatch and
we want to take advantage of all of
these cool features that's why I've got
four tips for you that could help
improve battery life without sacrificing
any of the Apple watch's functionality
number one watch faces sure Mickey looks
cool but that dancing Mouse isn't going
to make your battery last longer watch
faces with more black than colors will
use less energy to choose a new watch
face perform a hard long press on the
screen and select one of the more basic
faces
I like the modular one next up
brightness just like on your smart phone
having the display on the watch all the
way up will drain the battery quicker
the easiest way to change the brightness
is to open the Apple watch app on your
iPhone tap brightness and text size and
slide the brightness bar down to the
halfway point or even lower this can
also be done directly on the Apple watch
in the Settings app number three reduce
your motion and transparency while this
will limit some of the animations on the
watch it will also put less of a strain
on the graphics processor which in turn
could improve battery life to do this
open the Apple watch app on your iPhone
select general followed by accessibility
where you will find reduced motion and
reduce transparency last but not least
you can turn on grayscale mode now this
will take away the vibrant colors on
your watch but it could extend your
battery which in my opinion could be a
fair trade-off this can be done by
opening the Apple watch app on your
iPhone tapping general awed by
accessibility then toggle the grayscale
switch from off to on
as a bonus you could turn on the Apple
watch's power reserve mode but I would
only do this if you're in a real pinch
because it will take all of the smart
out of your smart watch power Reserve
mode can be turned on by holding the
power button on the side of the Apple
watch you will no longer be able to run
apps or communicate with others all you
can do is see the time so in my opinion
it's really not worth it most of the
time
for more how-to like this one be sure to
check out how to Tina calm you can also
reach out to me on Twitter with any
questions or comments you may have about
the Apple watch I'm Dan Ron's never seen
it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
