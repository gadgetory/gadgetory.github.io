is that nobody's shopping for a mid
class export ever cross shops stuff from
Detroit certainly not a Buick that makes
GM all red and angry so they decide to
do something about it here's the 2012
LaCrosse let's take it for a spin
check the perceptions and check the tech
before I take you inside first a note
about the looks trust me when I tell you
this car doesn't photograph or shoot
well I've never seen a good picture or
video clip of it let our shooters fault
you're a good guy Jim it just doesn't
look good on imaging products I don't
know why now here's what doesn't look
good these faux hood vents yes I know
they're kind of vintage Roadmaster DNA
but Buick don't put them on here leave
that for the customer to get it Pep Boys
and stick over here with some
double-stick tape
now I got to give it to Buick right off
the bat this interior is not to my
liking it's not my taste kind of gaudy
in a modern Las Vegas hotel way but it's
really well done if this is your goal
they've nailed the goal that's one of
the great integrations in terms of look
and color and style of instrument panel
- LCD head unit right away your eyes
drawn to this beautiful 8 inch touch LCD
one issue is because you've got the lay
back - which really opens this room up
you do have a long reach to the screen
if I'm here in my seat and by the way
I'm pushed way up for shooting purposes
I can't reach that and I've got kind of
long arms and if I have my seat where I
really Drive forget it
navigation looks great on this guy it's
in there in the class with Toyota and
BMW and some others but here's where
things start to get annoying you can get
navigation or you can get there
IntelliLink telematics and app-based
connected head unit you can't get both
that's a bad decision to have to make
until a link is basically GM's sync
killer with advanced natural language
voice control for calls and media and
app based support for Pandora streaming
radio and stitcher audio podcasts with
hopefully more apps to follow soon I've
got my smart phone all paired up I've
got Bluetooth hands-free of course but I
don't have bluetooth streaming that's
fast becoming a must-have in a car these
days and it ain't here now unfathomably
for a car in this class the base model
doesn't have bluetooth hands-free
falling back instead on OnStar calling
which is lame if they're trying to
appeal to a younger audience than Buick
normally would now like so many cars
you've got a lockout going on here is
when the car is moving a lot of things
like address entry for navigation go
gray for safety so then you would drop
back to your voice command turn-by-turn
directions all right now say plan wold
directory or store plan route I'm sorry
to use the plan route command you need
to have stored destinations to get a
route now please push the blue OnStar
button and all I can get to via voice
are these dopey turn-by-turn directions
from the OnStar Operations Center I
don't want that I want to talk to my
in-car navigation and nicely color-keyed
to the rest of the stuff on the dash
very nice and you also get a blind spot
indicator system for that but it won't
keep you out of trouble if you're
drifting into someone's path now
intelligently they have not a light foot
gauge but a momentum gauge what I mean
by that is the Eco gauge of so many cars
have these days this one shows when
you're either accelerating too hard or
if you're braking too hard both are bad
for cars when you're trying to get the
maximum efficiency out of the energy
that's a very smart way to show it up in
the engine bay not a pretty thing 2.4
liter inline-4 with some great tech
direct injection it's a very modest
capacity for a car of this size but it's
got what they call a belt alternator
starter hybrid system a mild hybrid you
get electric motor boost by that belt
pulling on the crank pulley it's kind of
crude stuff and we saw this in the Chevy
Malibu hybrid it was kind of
embarrassing but they've really refined
it and now it's a super smart system
this whole apparatus gets this car
something like 25 or 30 percent better
efficiency and it's not terribly
complicated the numbers 182 horsepower
172 foot-pounds of torque
we've got 9.2 or so as the zero to 60
perfectly adequate and 25 36 mpg but I
want you to experience how this car
performs on the road in terms of
cohesion it's very interesting come on
now as you know I particularly like cars
they do what they set out to do whatever
that may be and I think the LaCrosse
does that first of all this little
putt-putt motor is very small but
doesn't come off as puny you can tell
it's a four that's doing its damndest
through technology to move this car well
but it does move this car well this may
also be one of the best matings of
engine transmission and electronic
control unit that I've driven in a year
or two the shift points the torque load
from the engine applied to that
transmission when it's shifting are
really nice now on the downside this is
not a responsive car in terms of having
sporting power you get the v6 for that
and the handling is a little wallowing
it's an understeering proposition to be
sure but most consumers don't know what
understeering is let alone why it should
bother them oh one of the small things
there is no visibility in this car this
is the biggest a pillar I think I've
ever seen you can lose another car there
easily let alone a kid on a bike that's
a serious problem and the same thing in
the back that rear package shelf rises
up to meet these chunky sea pillars and
you may as well just cross your fingers
and listen for the crunch all right how
do we do it across seen that style start
off base about 31 grand deliver then
you've got this Sophie's Choice and
telelink their apps platform or
navigation to me it's pretty easy since
the navigation has been crippled by the
legal team goodbye I'm going to option
this guy with a package that will
include IntelliLink and I'm gonna clip
my Android phone on the windshield to
get navigation beyond that the
confidence package is intriguing it's
about 1,400 bucks but it gives you a
really good quality head-up display and
the blind spot technology if you're into
that
