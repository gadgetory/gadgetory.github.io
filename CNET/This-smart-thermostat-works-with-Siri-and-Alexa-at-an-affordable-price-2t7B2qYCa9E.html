market were really expensive costing
over 200 bucks usually in the 250 dollar
range they did that because they
promised a lot of advanced tech over and
above your regular standard programmable
thermostat they had built-in algorithms
they had geofencing they work with
homekit Alexa if smart things so many
different smart home partners but a lot
of these manufacturers are circling back
and introducing next-gen models that
cost a lot less it's the same with this
one hundred and $49 Honeywell t5 lyric
thermostat 149 bucks that's basically a
hundred dollars less than the first gen
models and this one still has geofencing
it still works with Alexa and it still
works with Siri I don't love the user
interfaces as much it looks a little
cheaper but the design is pretty solid
kind of an upgrade over the round
version of the original lyric so if you
are looking for a smart thermostat that
cost significantly less than the first
gen models this is a reasonable option
but definitely be sure to take a look at
the Eco b3 light as well as the Emerson
sense II just for comparison</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
