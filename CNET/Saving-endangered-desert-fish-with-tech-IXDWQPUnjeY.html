Park is a place called Devil's Hole
Devil's Hole is a deep geothermal pool
that's home to a very unique species
that also happens to be endangered
Devil's Hole became part of the park
system in 1952 by Proclamation by
President Harry Truman and it was due to
both the ecosystem and also because of a
peculiar race of fish and that's our
Devil's Hole pupfish Devil's Hole
pupfish are one of several species of
pupfish when water levels dropped during
the last ice age these pupfish were
separated from the rest morphing into an
entirely new species making Devil's Hole
the only place they exist in nature The
Devil's Hole pupfish is unique because
it lives in pretty much the worst
environment that you can think of to be
a fish I think water is a constant 93
degrees Fahrenheit dissolved oxygen is
at lethally low levels despite the
difficult environment many scientists
believe Devil's Hole pupfish have been
around for at least 10,000 years in the
mid to late 1960s there was development
here in ash meadows and there was a
local landowner that had land right
against the 40 acres of Devil's Hole so
this landowner put a well right adjacent
to the monument boundary and when he
turned on the well the water level in
Devil's Hole declined with act with this
groundwater pumping the population
declining with the water level going
down The Devil's Hole pupfish was listed
as an endangered species under the
Endangered Species Preservation Act
that's why the National Park Service
along with the Fish and Wildlife Service
and the Nevada Department of Wildlife
are working together to monitor and try
to save The Devil's Hole pupfish a lot
of their efforts rely heavily on
technology so it's managed by
continuously monitoring the water level
so we have two transducers so a
redundant system we have it set to a
telemetry system so we can actually type
in and say what's the water level doing
now we also you can see here we have
this blue instrument hanging in the
water that's a water quality sound so it
measures temperature pH oxygen and
activity at 15-minute intervals although
Devil's Hole looks small from the
surface it's a massive underwater cave
with unique conditions that make this
project especially challenging what's
interesting about Devil's Hall since
it's such a large body of water it's
unknown depth divers have been in at 436
feet that it follows the lunar tidal
cycle so the water level goes up been
down twice in about a 24 hour time
periods at one point the pupfish
population at Devil's Hole dropped to
just 35 which inspired the creation of a
nearby lab where scientists and other
staff are replicating the conditions at
Devil's Hole for further study we've
created a hundred and ten thousand
gallon habitat recreation it's largely
computer driven that is connected to a
mechanical room filled with filtration
ultraviolet sterilization heating and
thermal control systems to be able to
replicate the really challenging
environment of Devil's Hole there are
currently about a hundred Devil's Hole
pupfish living in the replicas off-site
tank the pupfish in and of themselves
they're kind of cute we like them it was
we believe a man-made problem that
caused them to have trouble we have a
certain responsibility we think to be
able to rectify that as much as we can
they're able to survive in environments
that are lethal to most organisms and a
lot of the grand discoveries and science
biology especially have occurred in
extreme environments and if we let them
go extinct we'll never know why should
we care and I get that question in my
you know a lot so why should we invest
the time and the money in conserving and
preserving the species and I think you
know I have my NPS hat on now I'm a
scientist I can put that on I could put
my society hat on and I think for me as
a scientist I still think we have a lot
to learn from this ecosystem and then
you know putting on the the society hat
well that pumping that humans caused
that initial groundwater pumping that
water level naver came back up to its
pre pumping level so we're having an
influence on this species you know if
we hadn't if it's a natural evolutionary
pathway for the species that's fine
species do go extent in new species
evolve but since we've had a human
impact on this ecosystem in the fish I
think as a society we need to decide
what is important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
