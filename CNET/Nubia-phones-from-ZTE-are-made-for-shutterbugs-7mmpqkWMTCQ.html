Cena and I'm here at CES 2014 in Las
Vegas with the ZTE nubia 5s and 5s mini
now let's start with a 5s first it has a
5-inch 1080p screen and it's equipped
with a Snapdragon 800 processor the
device is aimed for photo enthusiasts so
there's a 13 megapixel camera with flash
as well as optical image stabilization
and a new low light sensor from Sony it
also can record 4k video on the front
you'll see a 5 megapixel camera it's
powered by a 2.3 ampere hour battery and
it runs Android 4.2 point2 however ZTE
told me that it can be updateable to 4.3
as for capacity it doesn't have
expandable memory but it does have 32
gigs of internal memory and 2 gigs of
RAM now let's move on to the 5s mini ZTE
scaled back a lot of its specs but it's
still a decent Hanson for example it has
a 4.7 HD 720p screen it also is powered
by a 2 ampere hour battery and it has 16
gigs of internal memory as well as
expandable memory upto 32 gigs while you
won't find a lot of the camera features
that I mentioned previously in the 5s it
still has a 13-megapixel camera just
like the 5s as well as a 5-megapixel
front-facing camera now unlike of nubia
5s which only comes in black and white
the mini comes in a wide array of colors
right right now we're looking at the
matte white one but it also comes in
green pink yellow and blue now us
availability is still up in the air for
these handsets but a prior Nubia device
did make its way to the US where it was
sold online and unlocked again I'm Lynn
and you've been checking out the new be
a 5s and
I've s mini from gte</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
