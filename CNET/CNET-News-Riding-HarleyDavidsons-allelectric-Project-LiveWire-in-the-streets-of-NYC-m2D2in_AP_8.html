livewire very different bike from the
company it's got a very different
powertrain all electric it's got an
electric motor mounted down in the
bottom of the frame which is actually
mounted transversely pointed toward the
rear tire which is very different from
other electric motorcycles that we've
seen before but sound about 74
horsepower which doesn't sound like a
lot but they say it's good enough to go
zero to 60 in less than four seconds is
it quick we're about to find out
that's unlike any other Harley I've ever
ridden before and probably unlike any
Harley you may have written before to
smooth and quiet it's very different
from a traditional bike but actually a
lot louder than your average Evie to
your average electric motorcycle is very
quiet but Harley is you went out of the
way that a lot of noise - this coming
from the drivetrain it is all natural
noise we did confirm there is all the
noise coming from the differential and
from that electric motor itself there's
nothing going on through speakers or
anything like that the riding position
is very upright very comfortable very
suited for this sort of conditions it
sit straight upright you can see where
traffic very easily and there's no
transmission here there's no shifting
there's no clutch which also makes it
very easy to ride in a busy city streets
like we've got here of course we'd
rather take it on some country roads but
hardly thinking this might be a commuter
for a lot of people and that we could
certainly see it doing pretty well in
that regard now we did talk to some
members of the Harley Owners Group they
think that you know loud pipes save
lives so therefore they're concerned
about the quietness of this bike but
otherwise actually thought it was pretty
cool now I run a triumph which has a lot
of torque but it doesn't quite have the
throttle response of an e V like this
really a twist the grip and it goes at
any rpm maximum rpm of this by the way
is 15,000 which is you know as good as a
600 CC sport bike it gets up and goes
much more quickly than a 600 CC sport
bike another big change from a
traditional bike is this colour
touch-screen here you can actually go
through and toggle between reins you can
see your throttle response you can see
the temperature of the motorcycle all
very high-tech maybe a little bit
distracted for riding but again this is
just a prototype at this point now there
are two very important missing pieces of
information about project livewire price
and availability Harley will won't give
us any indication on either of those
things which is a little bit unfortunate
but the way they're launching livewire
is pretty cool they're actually taking
these bikes around two major dealerships
around the country and a major Harley
shows as well to let the normal people
out there ride on people like you if you
want to try out this bike Harley would
love to let you sit in the saddle and
take it for a spin and that's a great
way we've got a traditional company like
Harley Davidson watching something
untraditional like project livewire</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
