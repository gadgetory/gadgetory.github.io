smoke detection is a good place to start
and there are three types of devices
that can send you a push notification
when your smoke alarm sounds we're going
to take a look at the pros and cons of
each type of device
the most obvious way to add smarts to
your smoke detection is to replace your
dumb old smoke detectors with a smart
model the pros of smart smoke detectors
in addition to those push notifications
this is going to mitigate the annoyances
that you might be used to with those
small round pucks you're not gonna get
the annoying low battery chirps you're
going to get a push notification when
you need to swap out the batter the
biggest con with these guys is that
they're costly especially if you have a
large house you can expect to spend a
couple hundred dollars if you want full
coverage of smarts in every room as far
as your options so far we've tested the
100-dollar nest protect we also tested
the 120 dollar First Alert one link
smoke alarm if you don't mess with your
tried-and-true smoke detectors but still
want notifications when something's up a
listening device could be for you plug
one of these in your wall and they are
specifically tuned to the frequency of
carbon monoxide and smoke detectors and
if it hears something it'll let you know
the pro with listeners is that if you're
looking for whole home coverage you're
going to cover a lot more space with a
single device the cons is that with
these you're not going to mitigate smoke
detector annoyances at all your options
the 100-dollar Leo smart alert nightly
it's not only a listener it doubles as a
fun color changing nightly and if you
want to go simpler there's the one
hundred dollar kyd remote link monitor
and it's still alternative to the other
two this is a Wi-Fi connected 9-volt
that you stick into your existing smoke
detector for the pros this is much
cheaper than replacing the whole thing
and you still mitigate some of those
annoyances you're not going to get low
battery chirps and with battery powered
smoke detectors you're going to avoid
false alarms well cons on the hardwired
smoke detectors with a battery backup
you're not going to be able to shut off
false alarms you're also buying a smart
device that's not going to last as long
as your nets protect roost is rated for
five years which is pretty good and you
can buy replacement packs but still
necessary tit-for-tat your options here
the $35 roost that's it that's ok though
because it works pretty well so the
right fit for you depends on your space
and how much you want to spend pick the
category that suits you best and you can
use your smart home to add a little
extra peace of mind with smarter smoke
