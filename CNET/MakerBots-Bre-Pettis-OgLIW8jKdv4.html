stage i'm donald bell at CES 2013 and i
am joined by Bre Pettis here co-founder
and CEO of MakerBot industries and
yesterday you guys announced the
MakerBot replicator 2x am i right tell
me about your new 3d printer so we
unveiled this one yesterday so this is
our fourth generation of MakerBot and to
kind of break it down the MakerBot
replicator 2 is a single extruder a 3d
printer optimized to use a material
called PLA which is a renewable by
plastic that's made from corn now
yesterday we unveiled the replicator 2x
for extreme for for experimental
airplanes yes maybe but it's kind of
like that actually because it uses the
replicator 2x uses a material called ABS
which is a little bit fuzzier material
and we made we optimized the machines so
that you can be successful with it but
it's really set up for the Doc Brown
MacGyver types like you know if you've
built a trebuchet from scratch
replicator 2 axis abs 7 go up to 11 so
now for like you can really feel the
power yeah so you can print out your own
style and let's back up I know there's
still people out there who really
haven't gotten their head around 3d
printing the why of it the who's using
your 3d printers you've been selling
these now for a good two three years how
long has makeup up and selling
MakerBot's
this is our fourth year we are and this
is our fourth time at CES the first year
we were here we were the we were like so
far back did you guys make a box here
but you were yeah you were in the
boonies yeah way back there then who's
really taking up the the MakerBot's and
kind of been your your biggest market
well to kind of well first I should tell
people at 3d printing us cuz it's still
science fiction for a lot of people and
basically if you think about 2d printing
like you have a virtual document on your
computer
and you turn into a physical documentary
with 3d printing you have a virtual 3d
model and you turn into you know a
physical 3d model and it builds it up
layer by layer and then you take it out
and you have your thing that your mouth
is there you can give her a name
and so what's so we've got these two new
3d printers that we launched and then
we've also got some other stuff we've
got we updated our software so it's more
feature-rich and then we launched a
thing on Thingiverse which is our place
where it's our library where people
share downloadable digital designs we
launched an API which allows developers
to make things so just for fun we made
an application on that API called the
MakerBot customizer
and it lets you go on there and create
things so it makes it it makes it really
simple to make things so like there's
the iPhone case and you literally you
choose what kind of iPhone you have and
you choose what kind of shapes you want
to have and how much they overlap and
how thick things are going to be and you
can make a custom geometric pattern
geometric pattern to iPhone case looks
really cool show some of these off show
me some of the things that been made by
the MakerBot so this is one of my I'm a
gearhead I you know I've had like 30
cars and only two of them were worth
more than a thousand dollars so I've
spent a lot of the time under the hood
of old cars and this is a v6 Ford engine
block and Ford sent us the model for
this and this is actually the model for
a Ford v6 engine block so just scale
down you have to print out a few more
pieces though to get the whole car
eventually that's true we need there's
actually but it's really cool you can
see where the where the oil goes and
then there's a separate system for the
coolant and it's all there so in some
ways this is an education in how an
engine works just printing that out and
this is printed actually at medium
resolution which is still really nice
and then this is actually we're making
this right now it's just starting this
is a sculpture a Sappho sculpture and
this is printing it printed at our
highest resolution 100 micron layer
height yeah and you can definitely tell
the difference in the the feel of the
resolution on this little statuesque
statue eight and that and the engine
block this has kind of like a satiny
finish smoother this one you can kind of
feel the steps as of things and this is
smooth
and then you better oh you also should
this little statue can live in this
house yes your miniature furniture here
so this is furniture made by Casey
Holdren and Casey Hall Grimm
she's a set designer in New York and her
sets are on Broadway and in the old days
she used to design sets with like
cardboard and exacto knives and glue and
you know spilled blood everywhere and
process right well now she's got a few
MakerBot's and when she goes to the sign
a set she designs them all on her
computer and then makes them on her
MakerBot takes him into the director and
they talk about stuff and and because of
this she's done this for a lot of shows
she's got all this period furniture for
like games just got Victorian furniture
and I'm not sure really kind of like
classic furniture for different plays
hopper where Bane's full of old
Victorian miniature furniture so now on
top of being a set designer she's also
got a side business where she sells us
to dollhouse enthusiasts so it's one of
the things that when you're a maker
about operator you think about okay I'm
gonna make these things in the world and
if people want them no problem I'll just
make more but mostly you're talking
about creative professionals people are
in kind of different crafty professions
or hobbies but there is also that that
sense that what's exciting about this
technology and why is that CES is that
it may be this step towards this future
of printing out your own gadgets or or
somehow a cooperative process of you
know the next iPhone come how comes out
in some parallel universe it's pseudo
open sourced and you can print out the
casing for it and then just buy the
chips from Apple or something like that
right there's there's this idea that
maybe 3d printing is going to replace
the conventional distribution of gadgets
so at our core MakerBot is an innovation
company and and what's cool is we
innovate so that you can innovate and
our core audiences is you know in
engineers industrial designers
architects and you know professionals
who use CAD but then there's this whole
other level of people who just want to
live in the future
and so they get their amp there may be a
teacher or they a parent and they just
get one of these so that they can be
ready for what happens now
and those people they don't necessarily
have to design the next Ford engine
they're free to design whatever weird
thing they can imagine and you know
traditionally if you were going to come
up with a product you have to think
about you know selling it to ten or a
hundred thousand people or the MakerBot
you just have to make it for yourself
right so there's all sorts of wonderful
things on Thingiverse every day that's
and that are coming out and it's and
we're at an inflection point no it's
never been a better time to be a
creative you know maker in the world
with a MakerBot you can make stuff just
straight out of your head what used to
take a month to send off to a model shop
to be made and take you an hour so that
whole process of innovation you can
iterate much faster so you can do a lot
more you can try things out a lot more
before you make your final check I mean
it gets to this idea of home production
right of instead of the printer analogy
instead of you know having to go down
and have your your you know making
copies on your old mimeograph machine
you can print out at home now and in the
same way here you can instead of having
to go and buy an iPhone case you can
print one out at home or print out your
miniature furniture is there is there it
doesn't stop it at plastics
or is there a way that this is
technology is eventually going to come
down to 3d printing you know
motherboards for your computer or 3d
printing food as our producer was
mentioning today is there if there
another step to this that gets towards
the whole gadget what's so great is that
we're at the beginning of the next
Industrial Revolution and we put this
power in people's hands and they're
gonna do both wonderfully innovative and
totally absurd things with it and in
many ways absurd things are really close
to innovative things because when you
make something that's just stupid
because you can you learn a little bit
something different about what's
possible then if you are really focused
on a traditional application so we're
gonna see just a massive blossoming in
the coming years as more and more people
get these in their hands and it just
becomes normal to innovate super-excited
about it breathe thank you so much for
joining us today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
