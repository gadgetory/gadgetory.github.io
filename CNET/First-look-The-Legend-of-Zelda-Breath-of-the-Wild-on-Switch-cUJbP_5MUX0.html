launches on a new system you can play
the Legend of Zelda breath of the wild
on Wii U or the Nintendo switch I got to
play the switch version Zelda on a small
and large screen means two ways to play
and breath of the wild is a lot of new
ideas for traditional Zelda fans to get
used to breath of the wild is an
open-world adventure and Nintendo isn't
kidding the game's scale feels enormous
and while players of open-world console
games might not be surprised
Zelda gamers might be slightly
overwhelmed it's a quiet world full of
forests and fields and mountains you can
climb anywhere as long as your stamina
lousy some cliffs are seriously big you
can wander alone for a while and the
game invites it there's lots of crafting
in this Zelda your weapons and items are
found and they wear down and break over
time you also end up foraging for fruit
herbs and other things that can be
combined and cooked and nearby fires
sometimes you get powerful potions other
times you get Duns breath of the wild is
a post post-apocalyptic Zelda game
taking place many years after some
cataclysm ruins are everywhere and
mechanical creatures lurk link has a
tablet sort of like your switch that can
scan for locations tagging and mapping
locations feels like having a mini GPS
breath of the wild uses all the buttons
on the switches joique on controllers
but those controllers are small plugged
into the included grip or slit into the
switch there okay aiming a bow uses
motion controls managing abilities and
weapons uses other buttons it's fun to
take Zelda on the go but the scope of
the game and its small details make it a
better fit for a TV than the switches
small screen but the ability to play the
game away from home makes breath of the
wild feel special so far it's great but
it's also one of the only games
available
and a switch at launch on March 3rd
