a pretty good gift idea for the reader
in your life it's the new nook HD tablet
we're unboxing the 7-inch but they also
just released a 9 inch HD tablet and
that one this is kind of interesting 269
for that full-size tablet that runs
Android if you wanted to buy that and
root it you'd have yourself a pretty
good Android tablet for not very much
money but we are looking at the 7-inch
model which is a direct competitor of
course to the Kindle Fire HD have we
hear things this daily coupons
unbeatable prices on holiday cards baby
stuff that's a little janky
well it's coupons okay for the Nook here
we go the Nook has a pretty good cult
following it's proved in a pretty decent
competitor but it doesn't have quite the
traction probably because it doesn't
have quite the ecosystem we got the
white one highest resolution ever on a
7-inch tablet take that iPad Mini oh I
think I open it upside down I totally
did I failed alright here's our not very
attractive black power brick little get
Quick Start Guide one thing people
really like about the Nook actually is
that you can go to a Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
store and they will help you with it
right there let me tell you that really
works out for my mom alright let's get
this guy up so it's white on the front
kind of this grey on the back it's not
the sleekest
tablet I've ever seen but it is pretty
light oh the back feels nice it's got
kind of that soft touch back here feels
not quite as substantial as you might
expect this is definitely a plastic rim
and it shows and then because of this
bezel the screen actually looks a bit
small let's see if we can fire it up
we've got a little battery here
are you doing 90% 99% hi welcome to nook
while we go through set up let's go
through the specs the nut comes in two
models eight gigabytes for 199 or 16
gigs for 229 that's actually kind of a
worthwhile upgrade it comes in two
colors which I like to call white and
dark grey but with Barnes &amp;amp; Noble called
snow and smoke it has a 1.3 gigahertz
processor which doesn't seem as snappy
as you might expect it is running
Android but it's a custom designed
version of Ice Cream Sandwich
it weighs 11.1 ounces and the width is 5
inches that's a little less than the
Kindle Fire HD and in my opinion makes
it a lot easier to hold the nukes HD
display is 720p but the resolution is
1440 by 900 and you can see the
difference
battery life is pretty good according to
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble up to ten and a half
hours of reading and nine hours of
watching video there is built-in Wi-Fi
but no cellular connection in terms of
ports you have a universal stereo
headphone jack it does have a
proprietary charger which is kind of a
bummer no micro USB here just a 30 pin
charging connector that it says it's
HDMI compatible there's also a microSD
slot for expanding your memory the Nook
is a lot lighter and frankly a lot
easier to hold them the Kindle Fire HD
this is a true 7 inch tablet and this
obviously is quite a bit bigger now I
think that the display is beautiful here
but this presentation might be a little
bit better these are about the same
price so it's really whichever one you
prefer and which one you think is going
to offer the more content for me this is
much nicer in terms of size weight and
it's very intuitive to use of course
both of these are now also in the shadow
of the iPad Mini but since these start
at $1.99 and that starts at 329 that
comes down to a wallet decision for my
money I think I'd pick the Nook read our
full review though and make up your own
mind
