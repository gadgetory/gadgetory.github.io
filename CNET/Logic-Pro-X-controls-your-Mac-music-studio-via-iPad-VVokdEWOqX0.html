a look at Apple's new Logic Pro 10 music
recording software this is such a big
complicated package there's so much to
it we can't really go over everything in
one video so instead I'm going to show
you how to use one of the cool
highlights here which is using your iPad
as a remote control surface for Logic
Pro 10 there's a special app that you
get for free on your iPad once you spend
$200 on Logic Pro 10 and once you
connect those two on the same Wi-Fi
network then it's actually pretty
seamless the most important thing you
can do is control your mixing board you
can bring up an onscreen mixing board
right here with all your faders on it
but at the same time you can get 8
faders at a time here on your iPad and
the real advantage here is you can
actually use multi-touch on the iPad to
control multiple faders at once so I can
grab two or three of them and just go up
and down and you'll see that they move
at the same time right here on the on
the iMac screen if I was just doing this
on the computer I'd have to take my
mouse and the pointer and just move
every feeder one at a time not nearly as
efficient the other cool thing is you
can take pretty much any instrument or
track that you've got here in logic and
you'll get a contextual screen here on
the iPad so if I select this this bass
track I have right here I get a I get a
fretboard here on the iPad that I can
play directly from the iPad I didn't
call up an electric piano and I get a
keyboard on-screen and I get the
controls for that particular instrument
and I can play around a little bit like
this
we just threw four bars together using a
bunch of different keyboards and a bass
and some drums just to show what you
could do very quickly here in Logic Pro
10 I've got a little loop playing I like
in solo tracks directly from the iPad I
can add stuff make it louder or quieter
so for Logic Pro 10 the iPad integration
is really deep I did have to set my iPad
to make sure the screen didn't turn
itself off after a few minutes otherwise
I kept having to turn it on and
sometimes having to remake the
connection between the computer and the
iPad but once I got that out of the way
I found myself using the iPad a lot more
for control and the actual iOS screen a
lot less I'm Dan Ackerman and that is a
quick how-to for apples Logic Pro 10</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
