feet on the street the iphone success is
coming out so we asked people on the
street what is 3d touch well what it
sounds like is you touch it and it pops
out of the screen 3d touch ah i have no
idea with 3d touches how are you press
it changes the behavior i check out this
3d touch just pretty cool you know you
adapt it to your phone and it goes on
your wrist and it opens up stuff like
briefly when you press it the app opens
different options before you open the
entire app then you could open your
phone without actually touching it I
don't know some sort of weird 3d
interaction you keep it it says oh maybe
like the buttons look like they're
phrased it just means that you can touch
your phone really good you can press
certain buttons to make different things
happen either superficially you can get
deeper it does all kinds of fun stuff
when you just touch it who knows you
know something might pop up out of there
you know it's the little feature or
something you know I don't know I'm
expecting like a hologram to come out of
your phone and you can touch it well you
can now interact with apps using a
downstate you could press harder on the
screen and it does things you would
probably somehow pop out at you how
would you best describe 3d touch um
events gestures
so different type sensitivities for
different gesture layers you'll heighten
my ig pics in my facebook posts and i
think it's i guess you see an image you
touch it and kind of animates itself
kind of like a harry potter newspaper
it's like where your finger has like the
pressure-sensitive things and looks
really cool for like gaming it's when
you like hold down the screen and things
pop up and you don't have to it saves
you like to click so your finger is less
stressed no idea no clue whatsoever
futuristic digital output on top of your
screen that's cool awesome thank you
iphone for doing this i wish i could
