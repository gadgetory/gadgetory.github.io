sure sure Ross what everyone always says
march in like a lion out like a lamb
right is that April it's in like a lamb
out like a lion no no you're wrong
you're dead wrong yes because the lion
represents the winter bad right exactly
so in like a lion out like a lamb right
right right yes we all agree on that
stupid animal season MLG right but then
it's april showers bring May flowers
yeah so April starts shitty to know but
the showers are still smooth like a
shower I'm not scared of a shower yeah
they're not roaring showers that's why
it's like oh my lamb like shower yeah
yeah sheepish shower okay understand
it's the name of the show today okay so
you got that you're all set so far it's
been a pretty nice march though so I'm
not it's not it's weird it's like 70
degrees outside yeah I don't know how to
feel about that it's all Donald Trump's
fault what uh feel pretty good about you
have eyes don't you think it when you
walk out yeah that's true uh well how
you been man what you been up to I've
been pretty good i've had the apartment
to myself for the past month so a month
is a long time yeah well it's actually
been a month and a half and i still have
another two more weeks to go so I've
been kind of hold up in that apartment
so surrounded by seamlessweb cardboard
containers and you have a diver phone
Pringles container and Lubriderm so you
have
you hurt yourself yeah yeah overdose
overdose on everything that's too much
yes sir that the back story is that uh
PNE unfortunately lost your job that's a
sad part worried on last month and she
was doing accounting for a start-up and
after that instead of you know doing
what I think I or and everyone else
would have done which is you know
certain your ass or go on vacation be
lazy for a while she decided to look
into taking a boot camp class for data
analysis see you guys have heard of like
General Assembly insurance dare take a
two month crash course in whatever um
and whatever lessons you want it's like
Barry's bootcamp for nerds exactly it's
a yeah it's basically an adult
internship and like pocket protectors
and calculators pretty much yeah an
incubator so she found one that was part
of northeastern university and but it's
actually in san jose okay and she's out
there for you know two months to learn
that stuff in which comes back hopefully
she'll be able to get a job sort of like
in an entry-level position but still
more than what you would get if you
didn't so anything and i think that's
crazy this is so sort of like this uh
it's almost like a she sleep is like a
dorm situation no no no that's what I'm
not bad to camp yeah there were Yuma to
talk good all your food is solved make
your bed is getting code Reds how many
deductions can we make with that hahaha
that's pretty good now well it's pretty
tough I mean it's eight hours a day five
days a week for two months and that's
how they fit all the concepts in there
yeah but it actually has a no problem
and stuff way she sleeps at the end
that's nice but it is really intense and
coming from a job and not being in
school for a while I sympathize with her
toes I definitely don't have the study
skills now or even before do I've done a
class like that yeah um but anyway so
she's gone and yeah I've just been
keeping myself enjoying the privacy at
home you guys live with your girlfriends
could you imagine would you would I
lives marry my son yeah he lives with
his ex girl oh yeah it's our and then
your fiance my field yeah that's right
we're all getting hitched up yeah and
you know I don't know what the future
will hold I might I might be in a
permanent cohabitation situation yeah in
the next few years who knows with me not
so this might be the last time I could
really enjoy
myself alone yeah I'd hate for her to
come back and you just break up with her
right yeah they joined this too much
I've already booked in a change the
locks don't know just new yeah where do
you go so is last time I saw do you feel
lonely um is it a bummer when I talk to
her tell her that I feel now you know it
we've been together for four years now
and we've never spent more than even a
month apart yeah I'm each other so there
are times when it gets you know a little
bit lonely the house at night and stuff
but aside from that I feel like I've
been a lot more social with my own
friends sure because you know like
having a girlfriend wife relationship is
obviously very social all the time so
normally when she's you know out with
friends and she's here yeah I like to
just spend time by myself like literally
doing nothing listening to music or
whatever yeah yes now when she's gone I
kind of value those social times a
little bit weird how i never thought i
would love doing nothing so much yeah
yes weird if I asked myself when I was a
kid what do you wouldn't do nothing cuz
they went out for a while you know
someone asked me when I was six what do
you want to be when you grew up it would
be like hockey player or movie maker
filmmaker yeah right and now 30 I'm
almost 34 34 year old Jeff wants to talk
to 60 jevon be like nah dude you just
want to chill out take more naps you
just want to sleep and what's not
actually nothing what is your nothing at
home i minus definitely listening to
music yeah my nothing is actually pretty
involved it's like playing a lot of
games leading watching stuff laughing
maybe like you know writing a little bit
writing yeah it's like writing down some
ideas some like we jotting down I just
have like I I feel like you know I go
through parts of my life where I get
very creative okay and I think like the
the sort of the wall I was in being so
tired from being a new father and I feel
like that's ended I have this like new
renaissance of creativity that I'm
embracing yeah and now I'm enjoying that
you can journaling I've been journaling
I've been sketching even though I'm not
a terrific artist yeah you know I'm just
letting my mind do things that I didn't
allow to do for the last year okay is
that weird do I sound like New Age
weirdo Jeff yes little bear I ass big
time I think so I gotta get home and
clean the house yeah lets you have the
biggest thing yeah and also the kitchen
has been used for a month so thats
collecting dust i got a wet so with it
would have even watching stuff like are
you watching movies and TV shows like
what are you into you know i get caught
because like you know for a while I kind
of you know i would i would definitely
tap you for some advice on pop culture
or even non pop culture stuff hmm like
what are you into now well I wanted to
talk to you guys about this documentary
that I watched called the 75 okay and I
first heard about it because Joe Rogan
had this guy Michael Dowd who's the
subject of the documentary on his
podcast and it basically talks about
these dirty cops that worked in the 75th
precinct in brooklyn in the 70s and 80s
these guys maybe biggest hops were
responsible for bringing in a huge
majority of the crack cocaine that came
into the city okay and of course you
know obviously new york and in the area
around there is bad with crack i'm
seriously where it all came from I'm
sorry if you hear the Giant Bomb guys if
you want to know what the hell they're
doing we're recording in a bar right now
well no they're doing this like it's
called Project beast and it's like
they're playing the Kerbal this kerbal
space program have you heard of that
video game and there's no way you heard
of that it sounds like fun yeah in there
like they call these commissions and you
know it's they get excited yeah so I'm
sorry if that interrupted your very
intimate story did i do wanna know so
where were they getting the crack
cocaine so they were getting it from
South America importing it through the
city were they like is literally going
to South America like like Scarface
style like picking it up and they were
back but they made a relation they
created this relationship with a local
drug dealer that was sourcing it from I
think the Dominican Republic on vehicles
but this guy actually to get the drug
dealer they're working with own six
bodegas in East New York around flatbush
a doubt they're just friends the story
about how they hide you know they would
go and pick up these drugs for ya and
anyone could share if you wanted to buy
crack you'd have to go to one of these
bodegas and you'd walk all the way to
back in there is a green door yeah in
all these bodegas you knock twice and
was it always grown how much you want
yet that's good branding Yeah right it's
it's fluid well I mean a bigger branding
if it was weed I feel that would make
more sense right maybe a white door
right just crime grayish really gets
great crystally white uh I feel like it
looks like the fortress of solitude I
also also also if I was in New York for
the first time ever and wanted to get my
hands on some crack I feel like I
wouldn't organically walk into a bodega
I be like yes a shady f in place I bet
there's crack available and they're
probably right and you'd ask the guy no
I mean look if I'm a guy who smokes
crack I'm probably doing whatever I want
well I need to get like I would go to
like a really bad neighborhood and start
asking people see Holly and really
poorly yeah but going to a bday again
just being like hey so bad right ringing
the bell like crack here bodegas in New
York are definitely we're all this shady
stuff goes yes I'm saying did I ever
tell you guys about that bootleg
cigarettes pot that I used to go to yes
but I don't know if it was on air okay
well I guess I'll tell you now yeah I
want to hear it um I don't smoke a lot
of cigarettes but every once in a while
by pack or whatever little but yeah a
little-little Jeff is doing uh I don't
know what you're doing here is a
cigarette I'm doing the scene in knocked
up when ken Jeong is being her like do
you smoke her and she's like no he's
like not even like a little like me it's
a cookie little better you every now and
then yeah so anyway um back when I first
moved into the city somebody told me
that you can get cigarettes that are
imported from other states like jersey
from Jersey yeah basically or Delaware
you know anywhere that's like five
dollar packs and basically going to I
want you to go into this one bodega on
canals yeah and is so weird because when
you walked in there was always a really
young asian girl working the counter
okay young as in like 10 or 11 oh that
is weird right so you'd have to go up to
her and you would say i want Pringles
tangles was the code word understand the
what if you really want to Pringles
though you might have to go to a dega
as all the wrinkles canisters contained
cigarettes yeah and so yet you would go
in and ask for Pringles and now's the
code word should walk back also in the
back room not a green damn yeah is
always back Rushel what else is going on
do you think they mahjong rings do you
think that you sprinkles because like
cigarettes once you pop you can't stop
ah that's super lame and you deserve you
know but no because this cigarette so
they fit perfectly inside of one of
those mini half containers really yes is
that how you get them yeah so then
shoujo a shock go into the background
and you would tell her how many you want
you'd say you know to Parliament boxes
or 12 that will not what are you losing
the terminology now and yeah all right
we'll ask you to pray branch cream which
was Parliament Pringles was just the
introduction to two so that she would
know that you want cigarettes be out so
then you tell her what you want to come
to go to the back and it should bring
these little Pringles canisters out and
each one would be filled with cigarette
but they were Lucy's right oh yeah full
pack but a Pringle I Minister is round
but packs of cigarettes are wide enough
to fit be but there's so much unused
space this there yes it's really want
d100 litter in the rest he's like a
Nilla wafers box okay are any of you
have a same way more cigarette a lot of
Pringles because they had a lot empty
container what about a box of cards
right that was your car right I think
that's too small it might be too small
but then they got shut down probably for
the singer I heard that the vast
majority of cigarettes being sold in New
York City are actually bootleg
cigarettes yeah but they just sell them
at the full price yeah only to get in
from Canada that would make sense you
can tell there's only so easy on the pot
on the bottom of every pack of
cigarettes is the biggest and a stamp
they even had chinese cigarettes which
were in st. like alarmingly cheap like
you don't want to pay that little money
but i also don't want to suit all right
glass national chinese cigarettes
fiberglass I don't not yeah but anyways
getting back to these bodegas they would
have six of them right in right movie
and and that's where they would source
the crack cocaine from at the amount of
corruption that happened
between the six guys was amazing so they
were pulling down four thousand dollars
a week okay in the 80s was a lot of
money right these polymer and eventually
the reason why this the guy that was
leading it Michael loadout the reason
why he got caught was because he stopped
picking up his paychecks from the nypl
what a dumb as they were what so little
because there was so little compared to
the amount of money that he was pulling
in from is it 4,000 per person or the
whole group per person okay yeah this
was I billion dollars a year for the
actual drug runners right operating that
it honey not that's just a match yeah
and he you know he had bought a Corvette
but he was all right what a dumb cop
salary doughnut but that's the thing is
there's so much corruption and it went
so high that you could do stuff like
that yeah and get away with so how did
he get caught he got caught because um
there was a buddy call them um I the rat
squad yeah exactly the Internal Affairs
yeah came in and started suspecting in a
boil up my butt yeah yeah but i really
recommend this movie and you know the
characters in this are amazing yeah
super New York your stereotypical yeah
you're not all we want to do this more
gangster yeah he's a cop but you know
it's it's relevant to based on a lot of
stuff we're doing with police
deployments now too yeah that's a great
movie though I don't know if it's on
netflix but you can definitely bottle 75
yeah the 75 all right we'll link to that
in the show notes what's the shadiest
 you've ever you ever done like
we're just getting stuff like that the
whole story I'm fascinated by that kind
of stuff yeah I mean there's stuff in my
head that's what's racing through my
head right now that I'm not gonna talk
about right but I've just seen okay um
I'll talk I'll talk about something yeah
let me hear it this is not it's super
shady but it's a little bit funny I
think we've done this on the show before
we've just a bit stuff we'd like
literally this is like this ten years
ago I really like yeah ok cool I
was in Hawaii on spring break a friend
of mine whoa I'm gonna tell you the
whole story in Hawaii listen to a whole
story and and you'll understand sort of
a friend of mine in college was from
Guam originally so they had family that
moved to Hawaii Hawaii and Guam or like
still six hours away from each other but
hey there's not a lot going on in the
Pacific so I guess that's pretty common
yeah and
so she said hey we can go stay with my
family for the week and you know if you
figure it out that you know the hotel is
obviously the most expensive part of a
trip so really was just a flight so kind
of evened out with like a trip to
whatever Jamaica or something close by
so we're there and the first few nights
we stayed in Oahu okay and on the and
back into the trip we're going to going
to Kauai which is like the more remote
yeah forested island while we're on Oahu
we thought we'd buy some weed because
that's a reasonable thing to do you know
and it's sort of a you know has a
reputation for very good whatever it was
that although it was extremely expensive
as exactly as everything is in Hawaii
but a weed in particular was very
expensive that doesn't make sense too
because you have to import vegetables
and groceries but we you can grow in the
island there no there's no reason for
that to be so expect yeah that's bizarre
that any was less Jesus grows outside to
with the humidity yeah I don't know I
don't know the logistics of it anyway
was very expensive I guess I get away
with that shirt and so we bought and
then but we hadn't like used most of it
by the time we had to go over to Kauai
and you have to fly a quad there's no
like boat or there might be a boat but
we certainly didn't take one and so
there was a moment we're like well do we
toss it or do we fly with it oh god why
was there even a question of whether or
not you fly with it you won't you smoke
the rest of it now you can't know this
done no it wouldn't been fun it would
have been a waste okay so a total
backfire so we're all in line and two
are my two friends from Guam decided
okay there they were going to keep it on
them they put it in a in a shampoo
bottle how their matted in in plastic
and put it in there and I'm waiting in
line behind them in the security line
and the bags are going through and they
go through and the security guy walks up
and he's like excuse me classier bag
 and the openers just you guys
looking through looking through um is
this yours a nail clipper yes and
they're like oh you're gonna have to
take that away and my heart nearly
exploded it a little bit it was fine we
got away how did they pick you over now
then pick me they picked it because the
nail clipper this other
in the x-ray post-911 a nail clipper so
who was she well i guess it was I mean
that is I do not generally break the law
yeah it certainly not when it comes to
like post 9-11 SI ya regulations um that
was definitely like a moment of pendulum
you just well that I was really I would
never recommend somebody fly with week
but recently I was talking to somebody
about doing that and they told me an
insane way to that they smuggle it well
one here yes I want to hear it so he
told me the girls it's a pretty go to
this young girl personnel bad advice
don't horrible we're not doing it is not
worry first of all if you don't have a
license for you should be smoking anyway
but that can wait two years they go
everywhere right right just fold out he
told me that one time he was flying from
LA to New York and he lived in la
ventana yeah and so what he did was
ground a bunch of weed right okay he put
the grounds inside tea bags right he
like took out loose leaf tea from the
bags you know had the box and everything
work you know 20 or whatever bags inside
took the t out replaced it with the
ground weed right okay then re stapled
those bags okay mmm this is like then is
too much effort that is alright it's a
lot of effort it but it gets crazier
because he put those ba the the weed
bags back into the tea bags there was
still other real tea bags in there to
coat sort of dating mark smell smart he
didn't mark them and he's got a smoke at
all nothing no really make children so
and then for a little extra step because
it would still smell it's an open box
forever he went to a friend who worked
at blockbuster this is how old the story
okay at the time right and he brought
this box to his friend and had them used
a plastic sealer to reseal the tee box
and then he wrapped the box as a present
using wrapping patient is so in the
unlikely scenario that he was at the
airport and got stopped they would have
to unwrap the package then open the box
and then smell every single tea bag
whichever state
and he got away with this so since then
he's been doing that same thing and just
bought in one of those plastic shrink
wrap marks which is genius good because
those shrink-wrap machines can probably
come in handy for other stuff too yeah
sure if you're trying to rip people off
by using things as brand new but
regarding you sound like such criminal
regardless that's a genius identity
smart it's smart but at the same time
it's like men man is it worth going but
pots authentics let's judge that kid
with a one-hitter in his pocket or you
know I mean that's not that much money
but it's sometimes difficult to get it
right guess that you gotta really be
desperate to do stuff like that though
yeah and I think that's if you have bulk
you know yeah I dress like that yeah
that's what I'm saying not that we know
the normal sort of vernacular you know
this is all foreign is all Greek to us
as we're concerned um all right but it
doesn't matter in New York now anyway
right because they decriminalized
criminalize and I'm just we two I read
the other day that uh they
decriminalized public drinking and open
alcohol containers too now they won't
actually take you in finish get a ticket
you just can't take images or maybe just
a slap on the wrist I don't know by the
same thing for public urination as well
yeah and we'd so all that stuff how much
that impacts like income for the city
how much is that really hurting them oh
it probably is significant uh I would
imagine it's nowhere near significant as
like how much uh they're losing from the
yellow cabs like oh yeah they're losing
yeah billions of dollars on I also think
that law does not apply for you if you
live outside of you know gender fried
Brooklyn and Manhattan it's everywhere
else they're still taking people to have
a that's guaranteed yeah it's uh it's
interesting I remember um my eye on a
relative telling me a story about
someone that worked for them and how
like they thought they were gonna have
to go to jail but they went up just
getting like citation mm-hmm and it was
like oh okay for an opener all know for
pot okay yeah yeah I've seen people
smoking joints on the street that's all
that was passing a blunt yeah that's
recently it's yeah but that's always
been like on it yeah you go through any
park now
yeah why don't know because one of my
friends was telling me that her buddy
when she was with him one time outside
of a bar got caught by an undercover cop
smoking a one-hitter yeah and then he
got taken to jail oh really a few years
ago so i don'ti years as it did a lot
has changed on us thanks Obama yeah she
is judge cops based on like I always
look for the gun to see what kind of cop
they are like whether it's just a meter
maid or like an actual cop yo it's not
always easy to tell right it's subtle it
is subtle because they all have a
similar uniform and I feel like they
should be more secure like there should
be a better way to secure their guns
like I don't say don't look very secure
button yeah the button that closes the
gun down only thing stopping yeah it
seems like very out there I realize it
doesn't happen very often where people
just grab at guns but like I don't know
fingerprint I always have that thought
while I Triano biometric right don't we
all have that that instinct when we look
at a cop's gun to be like I should grab
that I always have that like half second
thought one like oh my god they're crazy
do I yeah oh yeah like what would happen
in I think it's you die yeah absolutely
see if these scenarios you die have you
guys seen any New York cops with um body
cameras on you know I was Lee that's
gonna start happening haven't seen that
I haven't I think it's great yeah I'm
great thing all for that totally so
what's the worst thing you've done man
yeah really I've just heard a lot of
shady stuff and you've done like people
admitting to killing JFK and you're not
telling it just like a lot of you know
stolen stuff you just hear stories about
like I just have a lot of friends in
construction that would like tell me
stories about you know they would work
until 4am and and then when they would
leave job sites at 4am like people would
like meet the hundreds of construction
workers that get off and would like sell
them electronics and stuff like that
it's like really weird seems like a
shadow economy whatever yeah that's what
it is that's a lot of a lot i thought
you're gonna say they like like Barry
people in cement at the bottom of the
boat no I don't know if that's the girl
I don't know I don't know
I mean we've all you ever found find
anyone that the perfect crime it is
pretty good there's that's shady I just
i I'm I'm threatened by shady stuff but
I also think it's it's fascinating
what's it's exciting to think that
there's so much stuff that's happening
underneath the city right like there's
this veneer of what we see it shiny
stores oras but there's some working
stuff that all happens in China it does
man I've seen poker rings and stuff to
you if you walk down into deep Chinatown
a lot of times I'll just leave that door
open you'll see like mahjong and
gambling and stuff going on sure there's
nothing shadier than mahjong oh yeah
gambling man just heard every shady
story from like you know casinos and
queens and like yeah you know like
private member like gentlemen clubs and
so again I like shady thing is that you
care about you know you're like why
right you're like we what there's a
little stuff you can organize there's a
thing where you like get an email and
you get a password somewhere and right
show up at a place what and there's like
stuff going on what is my stuffing
another place is like better not vague
at all wow it's right yeah thanks for a
shady world all right I'm gonna let that
once it yeah we're gonna take a break
when we come back we're very lucky to
live in New York right there's people in
Wisconsin right now they're great oh oh
there that wouldn't give yeah yeah we

I will not lie world-changing Manton

blade that is also affordable cool in
addition to it being comfortable and it
got me over my fear of face blade shave
good for you ah look we're not gonna lie
Harry's is the cheap alternative to

feel like we just went to hell and back
wow I feel like we've seen the other
side it seemed like a short break for
you guys but we just caught for two
hours yes our weekend about the weekend
and what dreams may come um alright what
you're going away Justin where you
headed yeah so I wanted to talk to you
guys about this on the air we were
speaking in the break a little bit about
it but I'm going to New Orleans in all
of these Nalan know at the end of March
so pretty soon a march 24th right and
I'm going for my friend's bachelor party
okay which doesn't seem relevant right
now but if you enter the conversation
talking about it is um so I want to ask
you guys have you been to New Orleans
not word you have any recommendations
for me no insight I've been there I've
been there I sound defeated what
happened to you in New Orleans so I I
don't like that city really I what'd she
do with you Shh ladies Orleans I don't
so my impressions from that city are
based off of like being there in the
summer right where it's a hundred and
eleven s must be 193 hundred percent
humidity yeah um it's a there's a lot of
fun to be had in that city hmm I think I
had a bad impression from it because of
the heat and because this was like right
after Katrina to so like that city was
in bad fair to judge how soon after
Katrina was it like a year and a half
wow yeah that's pretty soon it was a it
was rough yeah um but yeah like I have
friends who went to Tulane that like
love it yeah um you're gonna have a
great time yeah well we have about eight
guys are going it so that's been fun to
plan out yeah but we found this one
thing that sounded pretty cool I think
we might actually do it so do you guys
know a nutria are yes the giant rat so
the jit neutral show you are doing this
have you heard about what I'm but yeah
we talked about this you're gonna do it
so it shoot them okay so yeah basically
New Orleans probably because of its
Katrina has a really bad nutria problem
which are which are overgrown rat
overgrown giant rat they look sorta
similar to those princess bride right
monsters yeah cute like I've seen in
there Harry they don't like us between a
possum in a fox yeah get about the size
of like a large dog sure sure so look
I'm up nu t RI a and they become such a
bad problem with pests and New Orleans
that on there are places where you can
go and pay a fee and they give you
little pellet guns where I think maybe
even 22 rifles and you go out on these
hunting trips right because it's
sanctioned by the city for you to kill
these things these nutria and so you go
out on these hunting packs and they take
you underneath the catacombs of the city
they take you to the sewer areas where
they congregate and you just basically
shoot these things all day there's a
pellet gun enough to kill one of
yes I think it might have been a 22 I
forget what i read it was some kind of
gun but it was a load of county big have
to shoot them in the brain yeah so he
have scopes on these guns but you know I
thought it was a good idea it sounded
like fun that the program got good
reviews online from these people that
done it yeah but then I looked online
and they kind of were cute they're
adorable they are Catholic free of Eden
they don't have long rat tails or
anything no it's they're almost like
this one's licking an ice cream cone
online yeah it's it's something that if
I shot I I sort of that would feel bad
and and yeah and I don't know anything I
would feel bad and I feel like there's
people listening that right now they're
like oh my god don't do that yeah if it
was a rodent if it was a legit New York
Rowan I think they should bring this
program to New York yeah we need more
women there was a hit there are nimble
the New York rats yeah yeah they carry
pizza down there's things in the eye
with the Pelican gratifying now you know
what so are you doing this though I
don't know I think we might check it out
but who knows about sounds of a sec I'll
come back and let you know I might be
vegetarian after that you're gonna stay
at the hotel that night in a bathtub
with crime so cool where are you staying
so we got an Airbnb cuz we have 88 dudes
going so yeah I'm gonna be a pretty way
to do it yeah yeah what else are you
because the food is great the food is
amazing there yeah supposedly uh you
know the thing that people talk about
all the times is seafood but in New
Orleans last time when I went the best
thing there that I a was these
chocolate-covered pralines oh yeah
caramel praline yeah whoo yo good i'm
looking forward to that's nice you're
gonna have a lot of fun down yeah I
think it'll be a blast yeah meanwhile if
anyone wants to recommend stuff for me
to do you should email me yeah
definitely that would be very nice and
um you know it's affordable a place is
like one of the last affordable places
in the US yeah yeah so enjoy it live it
up maybe I'll come back with the crawdad
tattoo yeah thinking about doing crew
Ted you might as well right might as
well be cheap and there well I'll get
the bride's name tattoos oh that's
filthy Russell you seem to be staring at
something that has caught your attention
okay we're fine i was just a little
distracted
we've we've talked about this thing for
a while and it's like a it's real now
and you know yeah and it you know what
I'm talking about yeah at the top thing
on this list yeah I'm very upset well
were you upset when they in it and I
guess what can I do want to talk about
the new Ghostbusters trailer yeah in the
second yeah well but I guess we have to
talk about this because we kind of just
owe it to ourselves right we do Tim
Burton has confirmed that there's gonna
yeah there's going to be a beetle juice
too oh yeah so there was originally as I
understand it there was originally going
to be a beetle juice too after the first
movie was quite the success right and it
was gonna be set in Hawaii I really
Beetlejuice goes to Hawaii or something
like that would he go to Hawaii like
what like what based off the success and
the ending of beetlejuice one where is
the logical connection it's a very
tropical island that's a very common you
know like the the second brady bunch
movie went to a tropical island oh my
god how dare you I'm just saying you saw
the second Brady Bunch Minh you're funny
you saw the first one they're funny
movies fine they're like as written by
the same guy were at Adam's family
they're funny movies anyway uh yes so
it's happening and I guess I mean
Michael Keaton is in our Keaton saanse
right now so like he's bad it's amazing
that so his highest was only like 11
years long that's pretty long I don't
know if you're an in Hollywood I feel
like that's 11 years of you're gone I
said yeah that's not two movies they
people do a movie every year he's still
so hot he's been in back-to-back best
picture yeah crazy uh and yeah he's on
fire spotlight was great I just watched
if they did like an old man batman with
him that would be the best thing I would
do can you imagine someone's talk ah
that was someone not toggled man i was
so how is tim burton not talking about
and beyond yeah I don't know you could
do the dark knight returns on it right
right but I guess that's kind of what
that meant i sold it man they have shots
from that comic in the movie we don't
talk about them now we just talk it's
done I'm sorry we don't talk about
Batman vs Superman was terrible when we
hate it we what we don't talk about that
movie on this pocket havin a bad thing
to say about the trailers that have come
out
yay spoil the entire movie yeah but you
in tombs day whether you think it's
funny and exciting funny well whatever
entertaining and exciting I'm absolutely
gonna watch it just like you guys are
yeah I got a money I'll pay money for
I'm not gonna spend 15 hours be a
mistress is not a joke no I the first
move is so bad that Superman movie was
terrible yeah I thought it was pretty
good oh yeah I'm surprised you usually
share the same sort of dark cynicism I
don't know I mean it was a David s Goyer
movie I bad could have been like I
thought the the original Superman movie
is what we're talking about right uh sac
Snyder oh yeah yeah well no gory wrote
it Snyder director no I'm pretty sure
maybe Goyer and Snyder wrote it but I
know Snyder was behind the script as
well hmm well gory wrote this one right
right or you're dead right this one yes
that was the yeah I think it's gonna be
decent I'm not look I'm not really
really really looking forward to it but
yeah yeah okay i'm also not into like
the Civil War stuff so the weird thing I
was very excited about Civil War and now
in seeing the new newest trailer that
just came out it seems that it's a much
smaller battle like civil war in the
comics was like hundreds of superheroes
duking it out and now it looks just like
a four run for and then spider-man shows
up also what spider-man gonna do at this
point like really he's gonna shoot some
webs that's gonna be enough to take down
Captain America like what he has no
place in that battle iron man could
shoot him in the face with a rocket you
done and be done the is it like I think
all this stuff is getting ruined for me
yeah not that I dont still read comics
I've never read more comics in my life
to hear I'm reading I'm I seriously am
juggling 15 comic books right now 15
series yeah I love them uh but none of
them are really like super hero ii right
they're all more grounded they're almost
all there some of them are super out
there okay but they're not super hero
based okay um and I just I don't know I
feel like the the saturation the
oversaturation of all of these things
like I've already lost count of like
where we're at like I don't know I know
iron man like iron man doesn't have his
own movies in
more so he's like in Captain America
right is a civil war now spider-man's in
there yeah it's it's all the webs of
stories are getting really hard to
follow like the I saw the announced in
venom movie on that's gonna get its own
spin-off yeah cuz they was that's not
the heart of it you the general Marvel
canon so that the spider-man will
probably be different in that movie too
it's hard to keep track Bears onesy an
end to the others I and and there's a
lot of like inconsistencies right so you
have like Robert Downey jr. as that guy
but now it's a different spider-man so
they like honor the legacy of our DJ in
your head we're having crazy soldiers
yeah really distracted weird and and
people just they lose their minds over
it they think it's the greatest thing in
the world I'm really curious how much
money that the batman superman movie
makes i'm really curious yeah is the
buzz I don't know in general I don't
seen it o people have seen it I don't
know I haven't heard anything though no
I haven't heard anything either but i
would say in general having seen the
trailers and it doesn't seem like the
buzz is super positive for it and i'm
wondering maybe that's just like the
insular internet yeah speak or maybe so
I don't know this is going to sound
awful and I don't want anyone to lose
money I don't want anyone to be out of a
job but I almost feel like we're at the
point for this to like self regulate and
balance like we need to have a bomb well
yeah I mean Fantastic Four was a bomb
sir but like at the other baby still
feel like people don't give a about
fantastic for any yes that's true uh
it's more of an uncle give a about
Superman Batman and I feel like we just
need a regulatory band that like
constructs the balance yeah right like
something needs to die yeah for like the
rest of us to continue on with some
semblance of sanity well and it would
also sort of reboot things for the Ben
Affleck Batman movie which I actually
actually am excited about cuz he's a
good director and like what he's
directing a standalone Batman movie
after this movie and he's Batman he's
Batman what does he get why does he get
to do all this talented he's a talented
guy and handsome he's good actor I don't
so just like benefits fine I don't
dislike him I don't know if I love his
buddy Matt Damon but I don't dislike
Benna okay so what's the problem
problem still stems from the fact that
like he's mr. Hollywood why does mr.
Hollywood get to be Batman also mmm i
give it to someone else what you want to
go being Batman I don't want someone
ugly cuz Bruce Wayne's beautiful and
it's a ladies man no I'm kidding III
just I'm you know I'm saying like it's
just the nature of these big franchises
you can sign own face I don't know the
dude we're in the spider-man costume in
in civil war he's some new guy right
yeah but you have to cast a young kid
some people that he is we just don't
because you also have this world because
we're all my man's always like Tobey
Maguire was not a person before
Beckerman he was not a young did not
exist well I think you guys watch uh
this new beetle juice movie though are
you gonna boycott that I mean I will
wait and see but I'm very it's a
password needle juice movie like if you
told I am NOT gonna go blind why known
as any right and Michael Keaton and I
mean I'll I Nona why Owen with no no no
no no not why not enjoy not one wait did
they spell it the same no subsequent
Furnival no no right who do ya dynamite
like Winona Ryder rainy home eh Oh like
that that I nineties yeah um but yeah
like ah man man oh man i don't know how
i feel about this yeah i don't know i'm
gonna i'm gonna way cuz i always thought
it was never gonna happen it's also been
a long time since tim burton's done like
a good movie no I bright a big bright
eyes oh I heard that was not well
received I enjoyed a great teacher yeah
okay guys big eyes I thought it was very
good so have a talked about what the
story's gonna be or anything like that
they had a script written right I don't
know Tim Burton has told the I don't
know who this is showbiz spy they are I
guess a Hollywood blog uh he told them
the film as a go and has been approved
by Warner Brothers we have talked with
the cast members we wanted for the film
and they are all on board which includes
Winona and Michael yeah what about albin
I don't know he better be there we have
the script in hand everything's in place
and all we need to do is get ready and
start filming uh what about what about
legacy alive he's dead uh all really he
died like uh two years ago I think that
Jeffrey Jones is like oh yes he's not
all you got
has to Catherine O'Hara said she would
do it what did he get a restaurant well
I don't know and I hate I don't nothing
bad right the big sexual thing will have
children yeah is bad he i think it was
like kiddie porn otter creek which is
obviously terrible okay felt weak I
loved him as Rooney and Ferris Bueller
right yeah you know but if that's what
he's involved in no thanks but but yeah
boy we'll have to wait and see how the
shakes out yeah I I guess all you can do
is be optimistic all right we got talk
about ghostbusters yeah uh here's I'm
sort of I guess a little surprised by
how much hate there was after people saw
the trailer I didn't well think well
here's why okay cuz it's not a good
trailer I agree yeah i agree that it's
not a good trailer and i said but I
don't think it's like a universally
badshah it's just like a blah trailer
which maybe is why people were so pissed
because there's so much expectation
there yeah what do you think Justin I
think that they're the the rhythm for
some of the jokes was a little bit too
spastic like that every two seconds it
seemed like each actor was making a new
joke and and the thing I liked about the
original Ghostbusters was that even
though all those actors are comedians
it's not all of them but most of them
are coming where they were yeah they
were there any Hudson yeah yeah they
weren't um they weren't telling jokes
all the time you know not all those
characters were funny right the time is
really good that's a trailer issue
though yeah yeah so I'm hoping that it's
not gonna be like that where everyone
just has to get their own little it was
also not in slapstick e and this looked
very yeah yeah for to me that's the big
turn-off is that oh this is like a
cartoony slap sticky ghost busters Brad
right yeah i mean i like all those
individual actresses yeah that's given
me somehow and in the net how big is a
very talented director funny guy right i
I'm going to give it the benefit that
say this is not a good representation
you know trailers oftentimes don't write
show you know I would love to see like a
scene yeah I think that would be much
more representative need to see a scene
I think they just like yeah poop the bed
on on the trailer it's hard to make a
trailer trailer sure hard right
in this movie have they announced any
that's right I don't want to know no
okay I mean she said something about
like someone's turning ghost energy
around in New York City whatever the
hell I mean who cares like there wasn't
really a villain except for well the ego
no well in the first one was talk yeah
this was my villain in the first one was
they publish money no so I was sorry God
chozer was guys goes to the ghazaryan
yeah yeah yeah that's a good choice the
form of the destruct dog I mean yeah
like are we gonna get stuff like that
yeah I don't know what it is about the
first Ghostbusters and even the second
one that kind of just works and I guess
yeah I don't know it feels their first
one feels very like we're all the
characters are very grounded and like
believable especially liked Ernie
Hudson's character and and the concern
that i had watching the trailer was that
like they just went like hard and
direction of like extremes because you
could believe it or not like they really
do and even though it's quick they do a
good job at explaining who those three
people are right away in the trailer
yeah we're like yeah these guys like
like like penguins like the worst
scientist ever he's such a dick yeah
he's been like playing it lazy his whole
life yeah ray you know is just a
paranoid due to a gullible but like
means well and then you have Egon was
like ever you know takes it super
passionate and you know he's a realist
and he's blunt and and I don't know like
maybe that's what we get you get I don't
know and I hate to like compare them
directly but what else can you do it
right exactly it's the same franchise
yeah same story yeah I don't know yeah
yeah hard to say hard to say I will wait
and see on this one is though um so
there's an apple event next week if
you're into in two weeks if you're into
apple what do they do for I don't know
what is it do you know I have no idea
cuz I don't care when do new phone new
funds come out in the set September
right yeah I don't know what this is for
and the new iPad know that just happened
the ipad pro came out what six months
ago yeah I don't know the invitation
says we're gonna loop you in well it
says yeah cording to maybe they're
building a foreigner iphone and an
updated
better among the new products to be
announced but a 4-inch iphone yeah so
like back to the little I guess they
mentioned you but that's a usually the
invitation is a clue right right maybe
it's like a loophole in the FBI case
right it must ask for it yeah that's
okay okay we got new so yeah that's out
in San Francisco on march 21st so go to
Cena that calm and find out what you
want to find out about that were I'm at
the point where I just I see one of
these things I'm like whatever and I
want to get excited do you yeah I I like
apple pie I do like Apple products but
we're older do you think young people
give a you think a 20 year old
cares wait about a phone about apple's
event on 21st yeah I think 20 year old
yes yes I think okay yes and correct
your other I think is their phones for
more things than we do yeah I guess so
they gotta get their snappy's in oh my
god we are you on snapchat no I can't
figure are you attached I I installed an
account but I was like do I take I felt
like the oldest man in the world that's
how it would take a video yeah but we
had a training seminar this we have chad
is made doing that more so look out for
snapchat had seen it on I've been doing
it for a little while to be a flying it
was that meeting it was bad it was a 16
year old girl like the person did you
know the people doing it also maybe
weren't the right people no no I think
they're the right people they're the
ones that knew the most about it for
sure i just feel like i may be ready to
him to grasp notes I kind of feel like I
had a better grasp on that thing I think
they overcomplicated it but that's
because a lot of people were asking for
very detailed like yours better that
might have been able to figure out how
do you profit on snapchat so it's very
hard the people making money are like
these amazing so like if you swipe all
the way to the right there you see the
curated content that comes from like 20
or so selected brains and those brands
are able to monetize their stories that
have other ads there's that oh I
pre-roll and stuff on the OL like four
pocket yeah they're just like you know
you tap to move forward in a story yeah
yeah one of the tab gotta come to an
edge but those are invite only
those yet 20 there's the very expressive
spot share exclusive and unique Rosie's
relationship yeah which so what did you
snapped so far foreseen it oh just
napping Arsenal I do just for me okay I
care about social media so no I'm okay
are you I'm not the worst I'm bad do you
usually do the story or are you snapping
to people I just do my story okay are
you like if I snap to people its to like
three people yeah and it's like the
booger that just came out of Dylan's
face yeah you know you gotta see this it
looks like Italy I think the funny part
about that meeting was that snapchats
it's like a casual thing yeah like it's
like basically explaining a joke at door
spending like 10 minutes talking to
somebody how they can like resize a
sticker you know what I mean you're like
how do I get the rainbow cue to come out
of your mouth right but then like to
talk about that for five minutes without
breaking a smile it's kind of funny and
then and I'll and I think snapchat is a
terrible patien it's really not good
sure but but it's so insanely popular
because I feel like it is it resonates
with certain kind of people like Stacy
got really into it in the last six
months and she does she's really active
on it yeah and she's like using and she
said why does this suck and I'm like it
does right like it's not a good app and
it's not it's not laid out logically um
it kind of flies in the face of every
like sort of fundamental app design
language okay um everything you can do
in it you have to figure out and we were
trying to talk about like is that of
design choice or they were like let's
let people just figure this out or is it
just like a lack of transparency and
they're just like whatever yeah all but
happened to work out where people just
fell in love with it anyway and we've
and I related to it related it to when
you pick up the controller and start
playing a game that you don't know how
to play and it's like the same sort of
feeling where you're like oh I just have
to figure out how to do this right and
maybe it's the same you can like use
that analogy for for snapchat because
that rapper has like he didn't controls
like everything in snapchat for the most
part like all the finite granular
features and options none of that is
laid out right it's right you have to
figure
exactly there's no tutorials no tutorial
yeah there's nothing like that yeah
texting and it's just like yeah here you
go use like a sphinxes puzzle yeah
basically I feel like we should have
been having this conversation years ago
maybe I'm sure young peoples have just
gotten way more complicated than the
last couple years I think it's it's a
ball and by the time you mastered it'll
be dead yeah maybe I don't know a lot of
people a lot of eyeballs on I guess the
one thing that I didn't know that I
learned going in that meeting was that
those stickers are some of the animated
stuff that you could put on top of your
face are temporary and those getting
released every week yeah they should
schedule every day yeah okay so my can
see by them if you want something
permanently I think you can buy some of
them and I think yeah some like that
yeah but that's not how they're making
money I'm sure some idiot out there's
buying a certain kind of emoji yeah ah
or even paying to replay someone
snapchat which if you do that come on
you're you're a psychopath what uh what
were you gonna say I was gonna say that
this morning i was browsing instagram
and I you guys look at memes on
Instagram sure so following memes like I
don't even give names on Instagram
Daquan or you know whatever brown
cardigan some people use to Instagram
what do you just follow friends and they
chose pictures of their family alright
and what you notice yes I'm aware of me
I an imager sure all the time yeah yeah
yeah like that absolutely okay well
anyway so I was looking at some meme
accounts on its grandest morning and one
of them had a link to uh they're like oh
go check out the link of my profile for
to download this app called spy cam okay
and I don't know it obviously doesn't
work because that'd be a huge loophole
and privacy but they're claiming that
this app and I should bring it up so I
don't remember what the actual name of
it was but it there was a field where
you put in somebody's phone number and
they're claiming that once you do that
you can pay to access their camera front
facing camera no look at whoever's doing
it and also it's a keyboard lager as
well so it'll try and read so i don't
know like it but it the website seem
legit I don't know if there maybe is
just farming credit cards or people's
personal information which it or what
but it was asking
I mean not legit as in like it works but
just that someone had spent time to
build this out so I'm wondering what the
actual uh with the actual purpose of it
is and why people are actually falling
for it because if you know anything
about the internet you said you fell for
it there's no no I didn't actually sign
up for do you have to pay that to get
but that's the reason you sign up for it
cuz you have to pay yeah and also
there's no way that could be a real
thing yes that's the more important yeah
actor I don't know that sounded great
here the world it's a change yeah all
right that's I'm gonna call it a day
sounds good is excellent having you here
bud thanks buddy oh I'm talking to
Justin your oh hey I was talking I
contact well not really I was looking at
my computer but I was talking us in
thanks buddy did you haven't gotten past
the shady talk in the first section yeah
