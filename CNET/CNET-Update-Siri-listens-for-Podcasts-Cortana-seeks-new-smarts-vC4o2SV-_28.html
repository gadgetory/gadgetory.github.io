learned a few new tricks Apple's voice

updated its podcasts app so you can ask
Siri to play all your favorite podcasts
by saying the command play podcast or
you could just play a specific one by

only smart assistant getting an upgrade
it appears that there's more in store
for Microsoft's Cortana and maybe we'll
find her eventually on Windows PCs or
tablets well at least that's the
takeaway from a job listing on
Microsoft's website the posting seeks an
engineer to help shape the evolution of
Microsoft's digital assistant and
redefine the personalization experience
on windows so that could be more
platforms than just the Windows Phone
Cortana is rolling out to new Windows
Phones this month and she'll be in an
update on existing windows phones
sometime in June there is something new
coming soon from the windows surfaced
world Microsoft is holding an event in
new york tuesday to unveil surface news
Microsoft calls it quote a small event
which is likely a tease to the
much-rumored surface mini that would be
a windows tablet with a 7 or 8 inch
screen similar to the ipad mini but
there may be more sources still seen it
that Microsoft is planning to release an
update of the surface pro with Intel's
latest Haswell chipset we'll find out
for sure on Tuesday May twentieth you
can watch the news event live on cnet at
eight a.m. pacific 11 a.m. eastern in
other Microsoft news let's switch over
to the Xbox owners of an xbox will no
longer have to pay for a live gold

that refund but you'll probably want
that subscription come next year when

galaxy it's out in the fall of 2015 for
the Xbox one console we don't know much
about the story but game maker 343
