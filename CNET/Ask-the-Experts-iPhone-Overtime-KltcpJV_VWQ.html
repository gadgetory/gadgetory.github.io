episode of ask the editors I'm your host
Jeff Bakalar and today is iPhone
overtime day last night the iPhone 6 and
6 plus reviews were posted and then we
asked you the CNET audience to submit
questions and requests so we could
better address some of the personal
needs of our readers and you did not
disappoint we received hundreds of
comments on cnet.com Facebook and
Twitter using the hashtag ask
CNET so thanks to each and every one of
you for doing that joining me on this
iPhone overtime show is senior editor
Scott Stein and he's the lucky man well
I guess I guess lucky is I guess lucky
is relative but he's the lucky man who
got to review the iPhone 6 for CNET he's
been living with the iPhone 6 and 6-plus
for a week now
so he's one of the very few people on a
very short list of iPhone experts let's
get right to it are you man oh man it's
been a long week yeah it's been a long
week you're you're just you're just you
know I I see you with your like your for
casual time really nice coming off
ladies and gentlemen take a look at this
guy he's showing some skin we're gonna
relax more TV just relaxing unbutton
these shirt sleeves no just just get
comfortable well I did like it's not
gonna be a whole place taking everything
okay let's just that's it we're done now
it's been a chaotic couple of weeks for
you yes yeah what so I said we've had a
lot of things I mean I was at Motorola
we also had Samsung Apple says a lot of
products and all sudden have been
hitting it at pretty much the same time
right so you've been a madman for a
month yeah you finally posted your your
iPhone 6 review yet you birthed it to
the world we put it out there and
there's actually more to come yeah Tim
Stevens and myself about the iPhone 6
and 6 plus reviews and we're gonna be
updating these actually over the next
you know 10 days great where things like
for with the help of everyone had seen a
detailed display tests camera testing
it's a more network connectivity test so
whatever you want to know we're
hopefully gonna get to it but yeah we've
already written I've written a lot in
there already sure and hopefully not not
exhausting people but there's a lot of
things people want to know about these
phones that's correct we got like I said
hundreds of
requests and questions we've got two of
the we got the two phones here the six
plus you're here the six this is the
Roger base now these these are leather
cases that Apple sells there'll be lots
of others there these iPhones are
thinner so actually in the case it
doesn't feel you know that much
different right in the iPhone which is
kind of a nice element
I just want to interject real quick I'm
looking at this thing for the first time
it's freaking massive it is big now I am
this I like the size of the six more I
will say but I hand this to people
sometimes you'll hold it and go that's
not as big as I thought it would be you
get as someone usually they say that's
pretty big yeah that's pretty big I
don't have a bear claws all right so
check this out real quick I have a g3
uh-huh let's put these next to each
other just side by side like stand it up
the g3 is the same same size screen as
the as the 6 plus but this phone is
significantly smaller well 6 plus is
tall man it is now you know the meaning
of a case on ID plus I have a case Apple
always puts the premium on thinness but
yes
you know height you know width and
height the g3 is is more compact that's
something that happens on a lot of
phones I was looking at the iPhone 6
it's the same thing right we have all
these phones here we have a phone
welcome to the phone table yeah the
iPhone 6 which is here we have a pile of
Android phones here we've got a Samsung
Galaxy s5 and Nexus 5 the six kind of
blends in better lens in it it's in that
landscape but it's a 4.7 inch screen if
you want to get phone nerdy the laughter
funny phone now but you know that's a
4.7 okay again one's bigger than the
other yeah so I like the form factors
are interesting you'd get rid of some of
that bezel we're being way too selfish
now we have already people who question
questions okay got game twelve twelve
wants to know sure now that touch ID is
open to developers and this is sort of
broad what are some initial third-party
apps that might begin to use touch ID we
haven't seen any yet but now that iOS 8
has just hit we're gonna start seeing a
lot of those you can expect that people
will be able to tap into it I want to
see what can be done Apple pay will also
work with touch ID so I think you're
ending up with a lot of ways to pay okay
a world login
using that now you'll also a lot of
times you'll have an option to use a pin
as well be sure with touch ID you do not
you can't lock you out if you somehow
your thumbprint doesn't work so there's
always a way around it okay with touch
ID if you've already been using it so
just saying to be aware of it's not like
it's not like you're your thumbprint is
the only way to login for these fair
enough good to know
you don't need thumbs you don't need
them you t mark d13 this is a great
question why is it that the iPhone 6 has
a better Geekbench score than the 6 plus
that's a very good question now Apple
does not talk about the speeds of these
processes no they don't hey we use
benchmark tests how fast is it
it's a rights a a now with PCs it's
easier what we saw was one of our
benchmark tests showed that the speed
and the speed of the smaller iPhone 6
was actually a tiny bit faster really
yeah it's it was like a 1.3 9 versus 1.3
8 gigahertz I think now you know what we
saw was that some of the benchmark
speeds then and these tests were a
little faster on the six but graphically
the 6 plus seemed to do a little better
on those tests okay when it evens out
they're not like massive differences
they're very similar but that would
maybe answer why that's going on but
what doesn't the plus perform better for
games and stuff well no I mean the plus
is running the same processor so you
would think that it would run similarly
but you're taking advantage of more
pixels and all right for screen
resolution what will be interesting to
see we haven't seen any optimized games
yet because those are all gonna be
hitting but as we do an update to that
we'll have to see whether that 1080p
screen takes a hit on gaming performance
or whether it's able to make up for it
because it looks a the graphics
performance might be a little better ok
in some way so we'll keep an eye on that
but it should be the same but bigger
screen like the Vita size record yeah
that's wacky the 6 plus has a bigger
screen than the bigger screen than the
Vita a bigger screen than the 3ds
what's happening to the world I don't
know big screen man yes man
it's chaos that's pretty big I learned a
lot through asking for questions from
the C net audience most of the viewers
most of you people are fine people most
of you are some of you are just you know
awful trolls that
just be removed from the internet
there's a wide spectrum yeah a lot of
people in spectrum gonna it's insanity a
lot of people had a lot to say about
battery life
sure okay so the Yaya reliving that's
the handle wants to know a couple things
and I know you covered a lot of this in
your review which I highly recommend
everyone go check out it's Unicom what
about charging the phone from zero to a
hundred can you give like a realistic
sort of timeframe
I know exactly minute and seconds is
sort of impossible my g3 it's a large
phone it has a huge resolution larger
than the plus it takes about an hour and
a half to go from like zero to a hundred
yeah I would love the plus I would say
on the plus I don't know because I you
know I focused on the sixth review but I
used the plus law but we'll get to that
and we may have gone ten in the plus
review the six I think was about two
hours well that's not it's not bad it
like a lot of these phones or I've
noticed on lightning the first half of
the charging happens pretty fast yeah
so you can you can climb up to 60% I
don't remember what amount it was but it
was definitely under an hour and it was
pretty rapid okay it's it's climbing up
to that once you had 8090 percent you
got to let it sort of sit a little bit
longer but that's true with a lot of a
lot of batteries now and the performance
over a day is like the iPhone 5s maybe a
tiny bit better depending on use case
but on our test we saw it was about the
same sure and that could be a letdown
because the 5s
I found you need to top it off
throughout the day and the six plus you
get anywhere from a couple hours more on
video playback to a lot more on talktime
okay app we didn't test talktime but
apples claim is something like 10 hours
more all right a big jump people curious
about battery sort of stuff yeah and you
still think it's it's going to serve
everyone fine though at the end of the
day it's not something you need to worry
about well I think on the six I would
have liked to have seen more battery
life oh really I think you can't you
know I don't think you can give too much
battery life right at this point what
we're using them for so I would like to
see more I would have even gone a little
thicker but you know a lot of people
like the shape and sure design we'll get
to that in a second
that this diary life is good but not not
a gigantic leap right it's a very nice
step on the plus a lot of people are
asking about the six people are scared
that it's slippery wood is it slippery
do things like a phone condom
I feel instantly like I would want to
put this in a condom yeah phone condom
definitely all that quote yeah there you
go
the I was created on that that's gonna
go that's gonna go viral so you put it
you put a case on this yeah put a case
on it put a case put a bird on it maybe
put a bird on it you put a case on that
it's still gonna be thinner than a lot
of phones so at least you got some
advantage there but yeah the shape it's
very thin it feels even thinner with the
size it's smooth now the last I'd be
terrified to drop it because now you
don't even have corner so if it hits
here could hit glass yeah ah I don't
maybe a great situation if you rubber
that up yeah yeah get a case get a case
get a case put a bird on it but what are
you that's how I feel I don't know if
it's slippery but every time someone
picks these up and holds them yeah I'm
terrified that when you're picking it up
off the floor if I dropped it I'd want
to check in make sure it was alive make
sure it's okay it's very solid though
really saw I mean Apple stuff is very
well built feels very solid but then the
six feels slippery yeah liberty little
devil it's it's more slippery if you
have it in some nice dress pants yes and
those slacks if you're wearing a good
pair of slice you can just pop right up
you put in a slippery fair it's that's
gonna shoot right out you would that's
gonna go right across the room and at
light speed that's gonna be in a cab if
you were gonna be left in a cab
definitely if you were to put in like a
nice pair of like tuxedo pants forget it
this is walking away you want a high
friction case you want something that's
gonna it's like a slippery fish rough
yeah you want something a hole to slow
it down slow down that momentum we are
wacky I think we're all like I'm
overtime hangover very loopy right now
but that should be entertaining a lot of
people asking this including MMJ one
these are the first one yeah wants to
know could my could a six plus
realistically replace an
paid mini or an iPad could it
realistically happen thank you for
asking that that's a very good question
I have been wondering that I'm probably
to write another piece on that I use the
iPad all the time particularly the mini
hey look what we have here we have an
iPad air and a mini okay so let me see
the plus let's make money let's look at
the plus because everybody's talking at
the plus being a mini replaced I don't
even wanna know we're not going down
that road the plus it's not the same
size as the air let's just leave it at
that
but when you get to the mini yeah just
just take a look and let's see what
we're talking about here okay so here's
the the six plus up against an iPad Mini
okay look at that I mean that's a big
difference to me you're looking at it
looks like the plus is a third the size
mass third the size of a via of the mini
that's I mean I'm kind of thinking like
dude just make this a freaking phone
just make that a phone hello I mean
what's the difference there's no look
there's your hand
I am wondering at some point we're gonna
show you right now that is the next one
I should take this out in public and
tell them that this is the 6 plus but
this I know it's bigger if you look
you've Elte on this it's already
practically a phone yeah plus actually
iOS a and hand off and with with the 70
as well there's gonna capability to take
calls from one device to another right
that's four so it could be then a lot of
ways this will act more like a phone I
mean it's a thought there's not that
much screen size space in between the
two so maybe you make I don't know I
don't know what's gonna happen and they
look here's a thought big screen sizes
were ridiculous I still do to some
extent although a lot of people use them
and now here you can buy it you compare
these two and you know it's funny
they're not a gigantic difference right
but the difference is enough that this
is this is bigger than most people think
it's I don't know you that was when I
first held it just now before we started
I was shocked as it's actually way
bigger than you think
yeah it even surpasses the size of
something like the note 3 by a little
bit right a little bit so it's at the
top end of the spectrum I think for
there's a reason why
this thing is shaped more like a piece
of paper if you're using it for
documents or typing can I go keyboard I
don't think this replaces that because
it's gonna be really hard to get work
done like that sure but if you're
browsing news and you're checking email
I could see that you're holding in the
car videos games right I could see this
taking the place of the iPad for gaming
look let's talk more about the plus and
it's unique sort of size and you know we
talked before how a lot of the Android
phone makers they cater to that bigger
goofier size yeah and it is goofy it's a
little goofy the other thing it's like a
return to the PDA super-aggressive PDAs
but you're saying that live cell phone
that's a plus doesn't necessarily cater
to that bigger size in ways that you
think Android phones did right because
you're saying the keyboard if you want
to pull up the keyboard on that thing
well depending for legacy apps right for
legacy apps Oh older apps will scale
okay so it's a show us an example of of
where that looks strange
so that's Twitter okay well that's tweet
bot doesn't we just have to show yeah
they're really big I mean you could
adjust the text size right well let's
say you choose to write a message now
look at the keyboard that's almost like
those novelty remote controls you see
that is a giant keyboard now the actual
keyboard that pops up in an optimized
app is smaller right this will get
adjusted most every happen will be
optimized for this but there is
interesting question first of all Apple
has the ability to have this work in
landscape mode now and there are some
split screen elements to certain apps
okay that's cool I like that it does
landscape in the home Scott school it's
more like an iPad how many apps will
take advantage of the 1080p screen over
this the more like a 720p style display
right on on the six that depends on app
developers you're gonna have to wait and
see and that's to me how useful this is
going to be now you also think is like
Samsung the note 3 obviously they're
taking advantage of not just the stylus
but certain multitasking tools very
attentive to things that are more like a
PC user experience this is very much
like the eye
phone sex and peck the iPad is like the
iPhone so apples tried to not give it
ever really push that much and how nice
to see that be a little different I find
that interesting I find it interesting
that there are other phones that have
similar sized screens that get this
special sort of oversized treatment with
the styli whatever it is and you know
what with the six bus it's sort of just
like alright this is a massive iPhone
there's if there's no real sort of eat
uh luxuries with it even the number of
apps on screen is identical yeah why not
think like oh I could put more apps on
that page no you're not right now you
can't it's more stretched out here like
the iPad that's really just the
brightness through some apps on the on
the plus I've read what Tim Stevens
review said some apps look a little
blurry
yes well because they're expanded up and
so you end up with some apps but you
know I launched the Kindle app which is
not optimized yet okay and it looks
great on both because you can adjust the
screen size and Apple actually has some
pretty good upscaling technology and all
these apps that handles things like text
okay so if you bring the text down it
won't look blurry in most it'll look
crisp unless someone created some some
specialized art and things like Netflix
actually look good even an optimised
form interesting but games sometimes the
the interfaces and buttons could look
big and blurry some keyboards pop up
weirdly icons get odd so yeah there's a
lot of stuff that you you would not want
in that mode but at least it's not like
if you had an iPhone 5 way back and you
upgrade it from the for if you remember
those apps used to be black barred at
the top and Bob right yeah at least that
doesn't have like a letter boxing thing
it's the same it's the same aspect ratio
but you end up with weirdly magnified
the functional apps some are crashing so
see this is good later we get into like
the details that you know people don't
sort of see on a surface level yes Kate
thorne wants to know and this is
something that was echoed by dozens of
people they want advice on on on
capacity which one is right for them
this time around it's there's no 32
gigabyte anomaly 16 64 or 128 gigs my
knee-jerk reaction is sort of like 16s
maybe enough for someone who just wants
a phone
and that's just a fun but I feel like
and correct me if I'm wrong 64 gigs is
that sweet spot
I think 64 is a sweet spot if you're
doing any photography I think it's all
about photographs and videos so if
you're doing it you're using it as your
camera there's no way that's 16 unless
you're just really casual about it it's
gonna cut it for you I think if you're
doing things like I mean look we're
streaming music we're streaming videos
you're doing a lot of stuff off your
device right well then 16 will be just
fine and a lot of people say it's fine
I think 32 is kind of a nice spot it's a
little shame to lose that where's 32 32
is a pretty good one I don't like for me
64 is what I like right because I'm hard
court now one two I will be tempted I'm
crazy I would be tempted to go on an
iPhone 6 in a 128 just because I use up
my storage and there's no way to expand
it sure and for videos shoot videos of
kids or shoot videos and events here we
do I use these things as an event camera
times so I would I would be tempted but
it's a lot of storage
speaking of a lot of storage we got a
lot of questions about the 240 frames
per second recording that takes up a lot
more space those videos it does I didn't
actually record what size they take of
but if you're going up from 120 to 240
frames per second you can just do the
math and imagine that it's going to get
pretty sizable I know if it doubles up
but it you know the size of 120 frames
per second violation jam-packed into the
same amount record a 15-second video and
you'd be surprised how much space it
takes so if you're if you're a stunt
skateboarder yeah you want to shoot some
slow-mo you're gonna need that yeah all
right that's fairly interesting and we
don't and the the resolution of 240
frames per second do we know that for
sure is that I believe it's 1080p yeah I
think it is - yeah that we had that
question from us it looks good Jay mez
so actually let me well we'll get back
to the review I should know that at this
point but um it looks good it looks just
like the slow-mo from before but slower
bits I mean it's so slow that you could
like spin a coin on a table and see the
coin spinning no yeah it's all you could
I mean 240 is pretty slow so it's four
times 60 frames per second yeah so I
mean it looks great
and it's nice to have
you can also shoot at 60 frames per
second or 30 frames per second for
regular video okay that's a change which
actually could matter just as much for
people who are shooting like high-speed
sports photography just like that look
that's buried in the settings I really
like so we're shooting this this is like
an emulator like 30 frames per second so
it would be eight times the amount of
frames in the same amount of period a
lot my math good on that it's a lot well
that's why you end up shooting a
ten-second clip of like my son jumping
off something yeah do a tremendously
long it's crazy it's bizarre okay a lot
of questions about the camera yeah
does the optical image stabilization
which is only available in the Plus make
much of a difference in picture quality
compared to the six standard so that's
from Joey a nine five one there are a
lot of little tweaks to these cameras I
still feel the average person if you're
trimming from the 5s camera to the six
it's it's not as dramatic so far to me
as the five was to the 5s or that the
five was from the 4s yeah it's still
eight megapixels but the big focus was
on focus there was sort of ruin the
punch line but it's auto focus they
called focus pixels but it's like a
basically a smarter focus system I found
that that mattered for capturing details
and avoiding some blur in close-up shots
so it knows where to focus better but
the optical image stabilization and
low-light should also help for that it
should it should adjust and avoid blurry
shots that that seemed that seemed like
it made a big impact it was not
something that unless you're really into
photography sure I don't think the
average person is going to necessarily
miss it but I'd want it and I'm a little
a lot of people saying that that's their
main you know deciding factor I think
it's a big thing it's a big thing in
cameras if you're treating this is a
serious camera and so it's something to
consider with this but then if you're
using this is your regular camera this
is big and why does a regular camera or
sure I don't think it fits as well in
one hand when you're taking you a quick
photo so for me the one-handed ease of
use with that if I'm you know I'm
running around and I want to capture a
quick snap saying that's that's
something that I like in this alright I
want to and this wall lead into the way
we push here with your fall so say the
FaceTime thing I mean apples talked
about this before yeah they changed the
aperture but here
should be a little better in low light
and it takes multi burst the sort of
selfie stuff that they attended to it
looks good it's still 1.2 megapixel so
it's not like it's not gonna rock your
world with with image quality on the
front yeah but it's a better FaceTime
calls tend to look better for the person
on the other end sure a little better
let's move to this is a one really
unique question that I was curious about
myself at D fish design asks can Siri on
the iPhone 6 with iOS 8 which is what's
running on on the planet can Siri turn
on the flashlight and just want to let
us know that's an important question
that's an important question I don't
know you didn't using belong king
mounted flash like what situation are
you in where I don't know who cares
let's can we go - I want a special video
just on that I didn't even think about
that so strike let's try it out let's
hear please turn on the flashlight okay
so I mean did I say you're right looks
like can you turn on the light oh look
at that it's ready it's ready to do a
home kit right but no just want to put
my OS 8 they tries to knit together
smart home right Siri was like I could
turn on actual light in your home can do
a lot of things Scott but not this yeah
that's not the one that's on that is
interesting why not just have like Siri
can do all this complicated stuff
I see why that I could see why it would
be a big deal if you somehow wanted to
mount this as a light you'd have to have
a Bluetooth thing and trigger it on your
ear or whatever and go Siri turn on the
light yeah and then you could turn on
the corner oh yeah beautiful Scott did
an in-depth review of this freaking
phone you you are sorely mistaken yeah
it's got an iPhone crazy losing my mind
that is maybe one of the last important
things I've thought about importance
it might be at the bomb but we tried it
here's a great question from a Talon
Steve 6:19 wants to know about that
protruding camera lens that is on both
iPhone 6s do you think that's gonna
leave itself vulnerable do you think
it's gonna affect the phone maybe
getting a scratched or broken lens what
do you think about that can you see any
scratches so let me tell you yeah
Apple makes a big deal there's from the
sapphire lens secondary are hard I mean
so hard it is it is hard but you know
things can obviously still can still
scratch this is the here's the thing
this is actually the same protruding
lens design that was on the fifth gen
iPod touch okay which we shockingly
don't shock is a one thing I failed you
I had it sticks out a few millimeter it
sticks out people have fifth gen iPod
Touches and I've not heard any problems
I will take your word for it
you put a case put a case on it yeah I
don't want to be like that but if you
put a case on this it instantly
obviously becomes recessed and right not
a problem and they clearly thought that
too
this is not I think this is a phone
designed for cases right that's probably
why they focused on being thing is they
said just put this in a case and you'll
be fine
using it naked like this I would worry
sure
oh if I put it on a grainy surface or
something but on a regular table no I
wouldn't particularly fire you know how
hard sapphire is your I mean I put my
phone facedown all the time
with no case well not on the front oh
the cuz the clicky like leaves it I put
it on the table
sometimes I flirt with faith but I don't
think it's weird that's a little raised
but I don't think it's particularly not
a deal breaker deal no way okay well
there you have it there's your answer
yeah very specific about the screen and
we've only got time for maybe one or two
more can you feel where the iPhone
plusses screen meets the aluminum body
or is it perfectly smooth hold on could
we see how tightly Scott's hide now I
feel uncomfortable as I caressed my
finger
over the smooth edge of the curved
polished glass yes you can feel an area
but it's very it's nearly seamless it's
a one curved continuum but if you look
close with this there is a seam
there's a little line oh and even on one
of my phones I got a little bit of
schmutz in one of the muscle or mutts I
got a little bit of lint or something
that kind of hot and one of the edges
schmutzie gunk the point being that
there's a little bit of a seam right
it's not you know nothing is seamless
but as opposed to the edge now we're
used to have that hard edge than the
glass yeah now the glass is curved
around so the metal does not begin until
after that glass is cleared a little bit
of the edge interesting on all on all
sides okay all right so it gives a nice
feel the glass feels more the screen
feels like it pops off more it feels a
little more immediate okay I don't know
if that's just the effect of the design
on it but it doesn't feel it has a nice
nice handhold but slippery little bit
slippery very good and then finally
let's talk real quick about like
one-handed use yes with the iPhone 6 and
6 plus how's that experience been for
you that comes from Matt Allen the 6 is
pretty good I would stop short of saying
miraculous just because my favorite one
hand feel on a 4.7 inch is that Moto X
sure last year
yeah Moto X was the one that showed hey
this is totally easy to hold right no
problem this is just a little bigger and
rests a little flatter so you feel the
edges push into your hand a bit great
you can press the home button because
you notice then you have serve stretch
to the top apple thought of this they
have this reach ability so you double
tap can reach reach around and
everything just plop down to the bottom
did you see that no let me see that do
this oh that's neat she does whole thing
and now you can reach at the top for
people with small hands small Han so you
double tap and now you can reach the top
that's cool and just like says like hey
you know the tops not important anymore
it's it's interesting it's weird I'm
sure people are going to use that
accidentally Mart yeah but it's smart if
you're
and reaching that the home button the
touch ID is easy it's a tiny bit of
adjustment but it's fine they also move
the power button here off to the side
okay on the top anymore you're okay with
that yeah absolutely because it's
actually annoying to reach up and press
that yeah so now you have to remember
that you're doing that because if you do
but volume and home I mean the power
button you might actually press power
instead of volume okay that's not a big
deal but I like it now if you're talk
about the plus it's a little hard in one
hand you can do it I think because it's
so tall I need to support it with my
pinky here I'm doing this strange like
strut support I don't know what I'm
doing but I yeah I feel here and this is
a little hard I would immediately want
to reach and do that it's more of a hold
and then use another finger we've shown
you you know um people probably okay
with that I know we said this at the top
of the show we've shown the plus to
people for the first time today and
everyone does it pass this the pump is
the shirt pocket test look at that sort
of that sort of does doesn't look
awkward at all no not at all just take
that out people when they first hold it
I think it's worth noting that people
are kind of shocked they're kind of
shocked now you have people who are big
phone users right who may have seen
these but we've got an iPhone your whole
life you will be shocked if you've had
one of them this is the iPhone 5s now
you you look at those and that's AB it's
a big leap yeah it's a big gigantic
that's a big leap and you may be used to
your pockets and what they can hold and
you say I wanted a bigger phone and you
go oh my god right that's what's going
on oh and there's an iPhone 4s you know
that's even have a 4s you are in for a
rude awakening so I think I think that's
that's uh me and even like you said use
an LG g3 right that this still feels a
little big for people who use that yeah
definitely so even though the same
screen pushing the varied 5.5 is pushing
the very top end of the normal phone
spectrum would you agree you think it's
gonna be maybe a shorter design next
time around same screen size I'd love to
see that or I can see Apple just
sticking to its guns
but maybe in a year's time we'll see the
plus maybe be a little more distinctive
gosh you come up with more features than
not just not just you know a hardware
feature that's been left out well you
say what does this mean for multitasking
sure multitasking you know we haven't
really seen a lot of that in iOS 8 that
some of them made a difference but
really taking the next right with that
bigger size you have to almost include
that yeah ok before we say goodbye real
quick your quick takeaway your quick
final say for the average but what do
you think is right for for people
deciding between the 6 and 6-plus I know
it's not an easy question for me
personally seeing you know what we know
now and and having to play with them for
a little bit I kind of think the 6 is
like the more practical way to go yeah I
think the 6 overall is a great package
optical image stabilization is a really
is a minor element right the battery
life is the one thing for me that I
would wish it had more of yeah and if it
had great battery life like beyond what
we were expecting I would be through the
roof on how much I like that phone but I
quit battery like at the top of my list
this year stuff I was looking for right
so I personally you know sure I've got
my own opinions but that's the point I'm
a little let down that it didn't take a
leap but bigger screen size and and what
it has in both of these we haven't even
talked about but obviously apples time
at Apple play yeah
Apple pay is that you know NFC
technology mobile wallet we've seen this
on Android phones but Apple is gonna try
to make it work better with more banks
these are both the first devices to use
it so you can do with either one of them
if that in October if that becomes
really awesome and you say hey I can
really use this to pay for stuff
anywhere easily then that would make
these even better and then you even say
hey the 6 has another advantage that I
may not worry about this but yeah I
would say go with this right the plus is
a specialty phone it is definitely
special you did a specialty phone
some people will absolutely love it but
it's kind of like you have the Retina
Display MacBook Pro most people pick the
MacBook Air so I kind of think that's
the a little bit of the analogy here all
right well very good thank you for being
here yeah I want to thank Scott Stein on
Twitter at jet Scott I'm at Jeff Bakalar
please follow me too if you like this
little show maybe you want to let your
friends know about it and we'll try and
make it happen again next time for a
product that's maybe not an Apple
product I mean that would be maybe we
can do this for like the next Samsung
phone or whatever it is to do it which
how does that work
I like it I love it all right thanks so
much for tuning in and we'll see you
guys very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
