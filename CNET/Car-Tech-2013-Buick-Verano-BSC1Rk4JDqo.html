kind of fits because Buick is trying to
make hay while the Sun shines on compact
premium cars let's drive this 2013
Verano premium t4 turbo and check the
tech so what is a Verano well it's got a
lot of GM DNA that you'll recognize it's
a cousin to the Chevy Cruze in terms of
platform and it's a sibling to the Opel
Astra we don't get that here in the US
but you can see it's part of a very big
broad platform for General Motors spot a
Verano by its tiny size kind of three
series looking rear quarter and by the
trademark Buick grille a toothy affair
that comes almost as far back on the
hood as the freakish headlights on a
Nissan Leaf also spot one of these guys
by the ventiports I think only Buick
maybe Maserati do these things they are
fake portholes that date back to 1949
even back then they didn't actually go
through the hood they are decoration but
their signature Buick there's this
complicated formula that you Buick buffs
know for how they decided if there are
three or four on each side
great Buick trivia some combination of
trim and number of cylinders all I know
is this this may be the first era for
which there are more ventiports on the
hood than there are cylinders under it
the first thing most folks notice when
they get in the Verano is wow it's kind
of fancy in here you've got three
different kinds of metal trim metal eyes
trim two or three shades of soft trim
around that to my eye since my opinion
it's fancy the way in Olive Garden is
Italian which isn't to say that neither
are but there's something kind of ear
sets about it
now the belle of the ball is this screen
right here this is the IntelliLink
interface in a 7-inch touch LCD but kind
of set back into that cowl all verrano's
have the intelliwhite
not all of them though have DVD and
navigation you have to option up into
that standard sources include bluetooth
streaming Pandora and stitcher via
Bluetooth link and on the more mundane
side am/fm CD satellite USB plus iPod
aux jack all the hits you want but
notice no HD radio here's what may be
the oddest start/stop switch I've ever
seen on a car it's so fiddly and dainty
it took me like a full minute to figure
out how to start this thing the first
time I'm looking over here for a big ol
engine button that thing's weird also
weird and more substantially so are some
interface gaffes on this car just three
that come to mind for example let's say
I'm listening to Pandora or radio or
satellite doesn't matter from that
screen I can't get to the tone controls
to do so I have to go to home then I
have to go next then I have to hit the
tone app and now I can adjust the sound
that's interface for interfaces sake I
think here's another one the climate
control knobs just have a couple of
representative temperatures on them I
don't really know where I am
to find out I have to actually move the
temperature then about a second later
this comes up at the bottom of the
display now I see what temperature I'm
on then I can move the temperature where
I want it by then the display is gone
and it has to come back to confirm what
I just did that's a mess and you'll use
temperature controls a thousand times in
a car like this and like many Ford's
this screen is set too far in surrounded
by this fence of kind of plastic garnish
it's hard to get to these buttons that
are down here and in many cases they're
just too
damn small and notice this these buttons
here on the Pandora screen and many
others are very small hard to hit you
got this plastic garnish in the way but
I can't use my control knob to get to
them you have to touch them or nothing
now our little verrano's got a high-tech
motor up front because we have the
premium trim all the other cars get a
fairly routine 2.4 liter for we have a
smaller - liter side saddle for with an
intercooled turbo and direct injection
variable valve timing just about
everything's been thrown at it that
gives you some nice numbers from a
little motor 250 horse 260 foot-pounds
of torque 0 to 64 this thirty five
hundred and fifty pound car takes a tidy
6.2 seconds while delivering 21:30 rated
MPG front wheel drive on this car only
two choices for transmission 6-speed
automatic or 6-speed manual that's a
pick now buick says all verrano's get
quiet tuning not sport tuning that's
very telling and the driving is exactly
what's promised smooth and quiet at all
times
it's a capable handling car but it
doesn't reach into the serious driving
realm at any time as for the engine the
revs float too high and for too long
between gears a lot of modern cars do
this although this car has no lift shift
which means you can keep your foot flat
on the accelerator while you work the
clutch on the gear shifter and it'll
handle rev matching a weird sort of hot
hatch feature to find on a car like this
okay this price or Verano $30,000 on the
nose delivered for the premium the top
trim that includes the turbo engine nine
hundred bucks for that glass power
sunroof that's a nice addition 795 to
add nav and DVD playback to the
IntelliLink head unit we're at like 31 7
with just about everything seen that
style now here's my take on this car
it's lots above Accord Camry infusion
but below 3-series and c-class and it's
got its own sort of an identity crisis
it's got sporty things like a turbo
motor no lift shift and the available
six-speed but it's mostly a very nice
car with lots of chrome and bling and a
very comfortable ride I'm not sure it
knows what it wants to be but for you
it's the car to consider when you want
to get a compact that feels like you're
driving more than you paid for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
