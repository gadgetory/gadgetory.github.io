of mobile news to perk you up I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update Starbucks has partnered with
square and invested 25 million dollars
into the mobile payments company that
you know for this little credit card
scanner dongle this holiday season
you'll be able to buy a cup of joe by
showing the cashier a barcode on your
phone screen with the pay with square
app instead of taking out your wallet
but wait a second you could do all that
already with the Starbucks app there's
no extra perk you get for using the
square app the Starbucks app actually
has more benefits like giving you
rewards for frequent visits so why the
partnership well right now it matters
because it'll raise awareness of the
square brand it'll get the public more
comfortable with the concept of pain
with a phone but in time as they work
together Starbucks could add more
features like never having to take out
your phone you see many small businesses
already use that technology with square
you just walk up and say your name and
that's how you pay that's that you walk
out but Starbucks isn't going that far
with the technology at least not yet a
government report says we need to test
and update the standards of how much
cell phone radio frequency we expose
ourselves to before it's unhealthy the
Federal Communications Commission set
the exposure limit standards 15 years
ago and that was before we were holding
phones to our heads for hours and
putting the phone in our jean pockets
the report is from the US government
accountability office and it doesn't say
that cell phones are not safe it's just
that we need to do better to test the
effects of today's cell phone use you
heard of complaints about the working
conditions at Apple's factories well now
Samsung is under fire an investigation
from China labor watch says that
children are being hired and working
long hours at the factory that makes
Samsung phones and DVD players Samsung
quickly responded sending out a
statement that it's flying out to the
factory to investigate the claims if you
use google docs for creating
spreadsheets there's a new feature that
lets you lock down cells to prevent
others from editing it's called
protected ranges and it's helpful if you
have multiple people working on document
and today's appt to watch is one that
takes caller ID to the cell phone era
whitepages launched a free Android app
current caller ID it shows you who is
calling even if that number is not in
your address book it also shows social
connections to that number and it will
hit you with local news and weather
based on the incoming call that might be
a lot to take in before you actually
answer the call but hey it's better than
wondering if you should pick up or not
that's your tech news update you can get
more details on today's stories at cnet

York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
