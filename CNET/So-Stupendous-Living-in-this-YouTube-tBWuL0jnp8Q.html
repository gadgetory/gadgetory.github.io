right after the acquisition it was so
great was YouTube was only a few years
all the time actually 18 months old and
had about 65 people but the scalp
they're already reaching was tremendous
touching you know now it is hundreds of
millions of people or weakening muses
kwan-yuen I'm a product manager at
YouTube work on a bunch of things most
recently YouTube rentals we gain
changing product because you know the
one else in the industry has has made
you know offering a video for for rental
as easy as we have we think we had a
solution that scales really well in all
the way from your independent filmmaker
to your major Hollywood studios it's
it's so easy to get a video out there we
have a you know fantastic awesome game
changing product constantly innovating
at YouTube and we're constantly growing
and right now we're doing a big push to
recruit engineers to come work at
YouTube to help us maintain our position
is the number one video site in the
world and as the second most search site
behind Google in the world today you're
gonna see where it takes place and the
people behind a lot of the really
important elements that make you to
argue we are in san bruno the google
food service program is pretty fun I've
really good time greasy food here we do
daily menu for about 300 people are you
hot breakfast and uh hot lunch and
occasionally we do dinner events well so
you know you will define YouTube in a
living room on a large screen TV in what
form would that take and YouTube exhale
really get us give us the opportunity to
experiment with you know different UI
paradigms in a different way of getting
users from one video to the next but
still you know providing what is
essentially a YouTube experience is
stupid with everyone so it was a great
opportunity for for the product team for
the engineers for the user experience
designers to really come together in
and and brainstorm and come up with
something really creative and different
now it is hundreds of millions of people
a week who turn to YouTube to be
entertained educated informed and to see
things that sometimes are very familiar
you know music videos that they're
excited about videos from some of their
favorite content creators but also to
experience all new types of content or
places what are the things that I love
to do most is just look at videos that
people are uploading them all across the
world and what what about their everyday
life did they choose to show there's the
world and it turns out that you know
traffic on the 101 here is very similar
to traffic you know in in Delhi in India
but if you don't get the chance to to
see it you often don't know that it's
one thing to read about something it's
another thing to look at a picture but
video is really the most immersive form
of media and to be able to bring I guess
what is now almost 24 hours of content
uploaded to YouTube every minute to
bring that to a global audiences is
pretty spectacular what sort of gets us
jazzed everyday work with my product
managers engineering team the designers
basically a bunch of different teams to
try to figure out where YouTube should
go and how we can create new features
that delight our users and solve self
problems that users might be having with
the with the website today so we succeed
when our users are happier uploading
more video watching more video sharing
more video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
