best picture for any TV in 2012 and we
have seen it have very much been looking
forward to its replacement hi I'm Ty
Pendlebury and this is the new Panasonic
VT 60 while LCD has been coming down in
price the picture quality hasn't really
improved that much but based on the
performance of the VT 60 plasma still
has some life left in it
design wise it's a fairly stock standard
television with a black bezel and a
silver trim and though it's distinctive
I'm not a very big fan of this new
v-shaped stand I'd recommend wall
mounting this television though this is
the second best television in the
company hierarchy it has the most
features which include a camera for
Skype and facial recognition forward
facing speakers and voice commands
Panasonic VT 60 the VT has an updated
interface which now includes this
welcome screen which has customizable
slots for your favorite apps but you may
prefer to start up in the full-screen
mode instead the TV comes with a
touchscreen remote which has a
microphone for content searches though
it lacks Samsung's integration with the
cable box so it's web-based or local
content searches only but it isn't
features that have built Panasonic's
reputation but performance and so the VT
60 is an excellent TV in that regard it
is a better performer than the VT 50 and
easily add does the previous video file
choice the pioneer Kuro this is a better
performer than last year's VT 50 and
easily out does the previous video file
choice the Pioneer Kuro this television
has very deep blacks fine shadow detail
and excellent colors we're only a third
of the way through 2013 but this could
end up being the best television of the
year especially if the OLED slipped back
another year like they did last year
while it's not the best value or sexiest
looking this Panasonic VT 60 is an
excellent screen and if you have the
money I would highly recommend it this
