talking about it's like oh that guy was
a mess already but I can't believe he

overdosed I don't know I don't know it's
some easy conclusion to jump to but I
mean yeah we just he was only 48 as a
young man very sad Scott while and lead
singers don't the pods passed away this
morning so we just I just want to take a
second to say I'm upset about that
because that's someone that I felt a
close personal sort of relationship with

much recently but that's it said they
wrote that awesome tunes that's a very
sad thing yeah welcome to the 404 show

mite the rest of the show Flemmi
character how how you doing man good
good we're in the thick of the holiday
see this is it i had to walk down Fifth
Avenue today it was a nightmare it's so
crowded going anywhere where there's
like a significant amount of people /
shopping stuff is that's the worst thing
you can do now especially in New York
but we're going to get through it you
and I sir at the end of the show when
we're done we're off here we got to
discuss how we're going to handle this
holiday let's trophies in that we're
rapid that we're rapidly getting
horrific of coz scenic goes into
hibernation for a little bit but we're
we'll figure something out to keep the
people entertained so I want to get our
buddy Adam from TV Guide talk about TV

and then you and I are going to try and
pre-record a few holiday episode yep
between now in the next two weeks yeah
and we're gonna do like short little
like morsels yeah like the good old days
memories will you do you remember us
doing that I mean I was on yeah i was on
a few of them I think I did it back to
the future one with your Ghostbusters
maybe ok so I don't know if I want to do
actual um you know I don't found actual
movie yeah uh but I definitely want to
do like themes sure thematic episodes or
if you will um Shakespeare Shakespearean
you know sonnet sure have you ever heard
of the podcast how did this get made I
have heard of that bag and Paul Scheer
yes and Jason was yes i love that jason
guy Jason Mantzoukas man oh it's easier
that to say and I thought yeah man Dukas
yeah very funny he's very funny is great
I don't watch the league yeah but I know
that's what those dues are from I knew
Paul Scheer before the league yeah uh
and is that his wife on the show as well
I'm not sure who I I'm not a regular
listener my name is Jude anyway I got
turned on to it because they just
covered hackers oh right on i love
hackers of course you do as everyone
between the ages of 25 and 35 does now
they kind of bragged on it I mean it's
super entertaining it's super
entertaining it's also super terrible
yeah well it's not a quote good movie
right but but there's certain kinds of
moments that it creates they were
very critical about the production
design and artistic direction what can
you do when you're showing servers you
gotta make it look sorry right and you
know I think obviously they brought it
up because if it's just recently
celebrated its 20-year anniversary yes
um it's an important movie for our
generation but even when I was 13
watching that movie for the first time I
definitely knew like Jacques liberties
were being taken yeah like you know we
all knew like this movie is over the top
fantastic it's a fantasy yeah certain
parts I knew the server stuff like where
they're flying through the files I knew
that was crap but like the cool high end
laptop that he had no I girl I could bid
that could exist it's playing videos
look at that it's pretty cool the
internet was not anything recognizable
no in 1995 I mean it was it was there
and it was it was accessible yeah but
not by me like I didn't use the internet
probably until 96 maybe really I think
so huh I've really started using the
internet I don't want to say like
religiously but it was more of like oh
maybe tonight I'll go on the internet
tonight when i get off from school
perhaps I'll surf the web I find some
good BBS's to discuss my interests on ah
and i want to say i started that like 93
you know look at you ahead of the game
I'm an Internet oh gee yeah okay guys
got ready just Austin you know guys like
guys and grat on gals listener to the
show we got a voice mail today then
we're gonna play later exciting it's
been so long it's been so long because
they are terrible well we just I mean we
appreciate the interest and people
leaving voicemails we should say but you
need to have a clear concise thesis and
point to you calling and I can't really
needs to be like discernible I think the
voicemail situation perfectly sums up
the state of the 404 what's that where
it's like so like where we do the show
weekly sure we know people listen
because we have robots there are robots
that tell us yes we have
sponsors that see what the robots cherez
they would not give us money if they say
hmm the robot says hmm there's value in
them Hills yeah so like we know that the
machine works we know the system is in
place yeah but voicemails are not
plentiful and when they are they're
usually not quality and I think that
perfectly sums up like the situation
we're not that we're on autopilot but
like 40 for for a while has become a
one-way street more so than it wasn't
yeah and we when we want to turn that
around I don't we want to turn it around
well just we want to or the other you
want to offer like on ramps yeah to that
to that I way in the in the spirit of
offering on ramps what is the phone
number once again for people that don't
know it's very simple right thanks for
asking sure it's 86 6404 seen it and if
you don't have the letters on right
phone a lot of people don't know what
those are seen it is 2638 and you
definitely didn't have to look at a
phone to determine what those numbers
were shoe 638 yeah all right so call us
oh it's give us a call let us know how
great we are because odds are if its
quality it's going to get played Katie
from Cleveland Ohio leaves a message
talking about the whole pot situation
whoa totally figured out why the pot
thing got rejected remember we're
talking about pot oh yeah right and it
got rejected yes oh the irony of you
forgetting that we talked about few
weeks ago come on it was a few weeks ago
nevertheless thank you katie for the
call 866 44 cnet that's how you call the
show obviously go to reddit.com / less
the 404 as well let's jump into the
stories at hand today is a pop of this
week as a pop culture filled we it as
big week arm so what happened but i ah
sure and i'm going into this blind as
well okay so i'm surprised because
obviously yesterday the world woke up i
guess if you were on the west coast you
probably saw it very late at night but
most of the world woke up to the new
Batman vs Superman trailer dawn of
Justice which which I which I do not
give a about right even though you
enjoy all of the carrot well Batman
certainly you enjoy Batman
as a character I enjoy him a great deal
I'm psyched that telltale games is doing
a Batman right but the idea that this
movie is coming out with two superheroes
fighting it out does not interest you in
the least and that's because of the
people involved in it Zack Snyder
specifically uh it is I it is a
combination of the people involved uh
compounded by the fact that Superman is
the worst he's pretty bad he is so lame
yeah he's only good if you take away his
powers like that's the only time he's
remotely interesting and then he's just
a dude right with glasses like assume
that I am a fan of him yeah it drives me
crazy yeah maybe someone was like oh you
like Superman right and I'm like you
shut your flow it's weird because DC has
these two monster superheroes and it
does seem like people that love Batman
don't necessarily love Superman and vice
versa like oh how dare you yeah how dare
you gerald yeah it seems hard to like
Superman he's not the super interesting
character so to speak he's the worst
nevertheless so what's up there's no
trail there's a new trailer and and I
wanted to you to experience this live
and we'll talk over some of it but I'm
sure a lot of you at home have seen it
already if you haven't seen it already
just google it it's literally everywhere
all right so we're gonna watch all it's
due to topic in three minutes three
minutes long are we gonna do that right
now we're gonna do it I feel like people
are gonna be pissed nevertheless bat low
here we go
it's like Batman's driving up to a
museum of some sorts of some sort of
event you must be new that is first
point okay marrow that's Ben Affleck
very handsome I don't have any problem
with that casting no no it's just it's
not Clark Kent Daily Planet what's your
position on the bath vigilante in Gotham
I just don't think it's fair he gets to
do all the city huh very handy appear
thinks he's above the law Daily Planet
criticizing those who think they're
above the laws Oh hypocrite for what
yourself it kind of sounds like old
Harrison Ford nursing cabinetry you're
ready puff piece senatorial
about an alien could burn the whole
place down most of the growth doesn't
share your opinion mr. Wayne maybe it's
the Gotham City and me you just have a
bad history with freaks dressed like
clowns oh he's talking now submit
bullies Oh Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent
I love it oh i could not about jesse
eisenberg being like Luthor Lex it is a
pledge out wow that is a good grip you
should not pick a fight with this person
that's a reference to the whole theme of
the movie what you to not walking by a
senator the power can be innocent
you're gonna go to war
Jeremy Irons is it yeah he's Michael
Caine super boss you know you can't win
this it's suicide
the greatest gladiator match in the
history of the world Son of Krypton vs
bat of God
you're psychotic it was a three-syllable
word for any thought too big for little
minds
time you learned what it means to be a
man what's going son I wanted it you be
dead already
if man won't kill god
and so I will do it
what have you done
oh my god the dinosaurs
flegal ha
well sign there's it's doomsday but wait
and Wonder Woman i wonder when using
this I thought yours is here All Right
see the kind of reveal that they all
team up yeah it's literally the entire
movie well sir all right so I'm sorry
that was all audio and I'm sure there's
people listening or like what the form
of these assholes doing well they've see
I'm sure the people at home have seen it
but now you've experienced it what is
your initial tank I ok I don't know the
only story I know about went when Batman
and Superman get into a pissing contest
was the the dark knight returns yeah the
Frank Miller one yeah yeah so I only
have that to go on it doesn't seem like
that's what this is about I thought it
was well it's act one is like they are
angry at each other probably act when
they meet and then then add to their
anger each other then act 3 doomsday
shows up and they have to unite for why
does dooms they show up because they
needed essentially a reason to have them
team up well essentially yeah because
what this does the reason they're doing
it like this is because it's setting off
this DC Universe they've got their
Marvel series right there Marvel
equivalent so it sets off the Justice
League the problem is it's so clear that
that's what's going on that this was
like a movie made by committee I mean
it's called dawn of Justice right so
like movies called beginning of the
Justice League and it's it's baffling to
me that they revealed as much as they
did in that truck like it's crazy how
much they show in that trailer to the
point where like if there was any
mystery at all or any surprise at all
like there isn't anymore but i don't it
I don't believe Jesse Eisenberg as a
villain like that I actually thought he
was the only sort of like entertaining
part of I don't think he does this like
condescending that you know Bazeley
thing that's this thing that's default
thing and that I don't know if I like
that I'll watch this movie will you pay
fifteen dollars a pop for this mu no
absolutely not not paying me neither and
I hated the last one I don't know I
think people are really
said I've spoken to people that liked
Superman the last Superman movie which
baffles me but and like think they show
car gods corpse right was Lex Luthor
gonna like reanimate so that's what
happens a parent his dad as I understand
un's day is they kind of looked like him
right he comes back to life and they're
honk why would that happen because magic
Jamie's wonder what he just like
chilling out this whole you see an alien
I don't even know I don't know I don't
know anything about comic books Jeff I'm
relying on you I don't like DC stuff I
only read us Batman right now the only
stuff i read superhero is Batman and I
read saga right and i read this new one
I like called the fade-out right but
it's not tied to the major DC can no I
don't no one cares about right your DC
canon yeah it's i get there people i'm
sure they do but you know i don't know
what this I don't know what to think or
feel right now yeah I thought it was a
terrible trailer like I've not liked any
of the trailers that came out it was
actually a teaser that I kinda liked
where Superman ripped Batman's mask off
at one point you see that well you see
that you see that in this trailer right
so is this movie just gonna when they're
fighting yeah just gonna be Superman
being like I don't want to kill this guy
so I'm just gonna leave well there's a
line in there that says I could kill you
if I wanted to right oh yeah I mean yes
the whole back obviously Batman has that
soup that's probably kryptonite and
emailed it into the source or some crap
there absolutely is the problem is
having two people that strong fight each
other is not interested Batman's not
that strong well in a suit potentially
he could be this kryptonite suit he's
got like a metal suit going on he could
be you black iron man equivalent
Superman can move planets but his
ability varies from movie to movie like
he traveled through time in the first
movie he hasn't done that sense he can
can he move at the speed of light no I
don't think so that seems outrageous I
believe he had no then he'd be faster
than the sun rays hitting him anyone
have the power anymore that's when he's
moving I feel like wasn't there a movie
where he like spun around the earth
since we can't turn back to that
the first Superman movie he did that
because Lois Lane dies in like an
avalanche or something and then he spins
the earth back away back around and that
turns back time because of science
that's pretty much how things work if
you turn things around again they just
revert I think that's why i hate
Superman so much because all the
storylines in his movies make me want to
kill myself yeah it's just like okay so
what what is the limit here like where
is the stopping point like gray he gets
weakened by kryptonite oh then the
Kryptonite goes away and then he's like
away just any exhibits an entire
building and drops it on someone's head
like that's the deal yeah like all of
his all of his story lines yes and make
me feel like what why do I constantly
have to like make excuses for this guy
and the only as i understand it like for
a lot of people the interesting stories
around superman cast him as a villain so
like what does it read son is like a
very popular one where he's essentially
like a very foreboding militaristic
character which they sort of allude to
here where he's got like guards with
guns and all sorts of stuff yeah but
yeah none of this interest me in the
least and the fact that they showed as
much as they did that's a very long and
very revealing trailer I think the one
thing you can take away and i'll
obviously watch it again because i'm an
asshole but no self-control yeah uh it
gives you a little insight as to what
kind of uh of Bruce Wayne Ben Affleck is
going to be and it sounds like he's
going to be like the badass leave me
alone Bruce Wayne he's not a
wisecracking Bruce Wayne he's like a
pissed-off sassy what's your favorite
who's your favorite Bruce Wayne I
obviously Michael Keaton yeah that's
probably my favorite but I mean whatever
i'm fine with people taking their own
twist on it sure although he's Batman
voice is like weirdly robotic it is I
don't like so everyone I don't like the
everyone's upset when Ben Affleck is was
announced as I don't have a product ER
he's a good actor I'm a problem with him
I like him as an actor as well sure my
problem is that we do he get he's mr.
Hollywood so it's like you're letting
mr. jolly would be Bruce winter at least
what's his name of Henry but the bat
Superman that Henry Henry Cavill yeah I
didn't know you know so you don't have
your not thinking oh this is Henry
Cavill on screen you're thinking of the
Superman I would have taken like Colin
Farrell before would have taken yeah Ben
Affleck I think a lot of it you want you
need a star I think that's part of it is
like we essentially that serious doesn't
have a star without Batman without you
know this dude yeah have fun yeah and
they have the luxury of like he's
interested in directing a Batman movie
and honestly like that's the only thing
that could get me interested is like if
ben affleck directed because he's a good
director he has like two chops where
Zack Snyder makes me want to jump off a
building man is moving so what's more
sad thing is why was dawn of the dead so
good yeah and then he proceeded to make
 box after box he's a shitbox
guy it's crazy to me like he had this
one rock star amazing great super
entertaining movie yeah and then since
that has just been I think it's a budget
thing I think he get he sees the
infinite money they pour on him and he
just doesn't know what to do with it so
I gotta spend all this kind of like 300
but that's fine that's neither here nor
there I feel like how do you screw that
movie up yeah I did want to say that we
don't have to watch it but someone
online actually re-edited that trailer
to make it look actually much more
interesting and entertaining already
yeah it took like six hours it was crazy
but they recut it just with oh the way
the music builds and like certain cuts
and they like cut off the doomsday part
at the end you just hear the roar so
there's some at least some mystery to it
and actually made me like more I mean it
goes to show you how important an edit
is into impacting like whether you like
a movie or not it is a much better edit
somebody on reddit made a good point to
the line that Lex Luthor has towards the
end of the trailer he says the Son of
Krypton is that the whatever of god I'm
bad of Gotham know why wouldn't you say
like the Sun and the night like he's the
night oh yeah why not do that a lot
smarter
it says that might be the line and then
studio was like no the people are gonna
know when they can buy night well yeah
maybe baby here right we'll give them
benefit of the doubt yeah um so we're
going to pivot into this thing that
happened last night real quick before we
hit the first break last night our buddy
Jeff Keely if you're not aware who jeff
Keely is he is I would you describe mr.
Kealey he's a he's a video game
ambassador yeah I mean he's done video
game journalism I mean I have like
Church 15 years ago like before he
turned into the guy he is and now and
for the last I would say decade or so
he's been on camera kind of an on camera
person for doing video game stuff you
know varying between sponsor stuff and
vga awards and stuff like that right he
sort of made it his mission to
legitimize video game award shows yeah
no no no easy task he had a deal with
Viacom for a while and they seem to have
parted ways I do not know the specifics
of that relationship nevertheless um
last night his produced show the video
game awards did happen i think was only
streamed was it on TV i think it was
only streamed it was the second time
they've done it seemed to be a pretty
big deal and well yeah I mean they I
think honestly I think the reception
video game people are not universally a
pod they can be very critical myself
included and generally people seem to
have really liked the production for
obviously there was a lot of sponsorship
stuff and like you know very clearly
like come to the AMD lounge to play
battlefront that sort of stuff i were to
shoulder with you gotta pay right for it
somehow as i understand it jeff actually
put up his own money for the first year
and did okay with it so that's rule one
though yeah you know it's risky so but
you can you do get the sense that he
really is in it for the betterment of
the industry definitely so good for him
for doing that absolutely but there was
something pretty interesting that
happened during the show yeah so yeah
metal gear solid 5 which is game came
out this year very good game i really
enjoyed I know
I think maybe also enjoy it enjoy there
you go won the award for best action
adventure game during this award show
but suspiciously the person who made the
get the lead guy on the game this guy
had a Okajima was not there mmm and it
seems that he was banned from attending
by his boss Konami right so for a little
backstory Konami and mr. Kojima had a
big big very publicized falling out here
and it got ugly it got really bad yes
they were deleting this game called PT
that completely w off the face of the
planet the kijima made because you know
it was part of his contract or whatever
and they're just like they're doing
weird things where it's like Kaname is
saying oh no he still works for us and
kojima is like has photos of him at his
going-away party right there's a lot of
conflicting stories I guess the takeaway
and the way it appears the perception
the way it sort of reads is that he was
kind of blackballed yeah and you know
he's sort of just and he's probably
under still under contract right
whatever the years whatever it is and
he's and I guess they're just like
painfully waiting for this contract to
expire what it seems like it's happening
yeah and they don't seem to care that
every step every decision they've made
with regards to him has made them look
really really bad why should they care
yeah I mean they're they're obviously
not going to win any you know
personality award but why should they
care I mean you're right you're sold
really well it's doing really well
they're making money hand over fist yep
apparently there's there's a lot of news
reports that they treat a lot of their
employees like but whatever yeah
that they don't you know I guess you can
say for whatever that's not cool but
it's not hurt from their standpoint that
is not affecting the bottom line yeah
they're going to continue to play this
 you know petulant toward a game
with kojima and contractually legally he
was not even allowed to represent the
game and accept the award at the award
show last night uh this is a quote from
the video game rewards mr. kijima had
every
being with us tonight but unfortunately
he was informed by a lawyer representing
Konami just recently that it would not
be allowed to travel to tonight's award
ceremony to accept any awards he's still
under an employment contract and it's
disappointing I kind of wish he did like
a Bobby Valentine move where he just
showed up in a mustache that would have
been okay that would have been all right
can you believe but how dickish that
makes Kaname look that they don't care I
mean even like all this stuff why they
don't care is because they're moving
their entire business into mobile yeah
and so none of these franchises matter
them because they're making money hand
over fist with like really schlocky
mobile stats bad stuff so it's like sad
but what are you can at whatever the
upshot of all this kajima will be fine
and he's only authorized in his life and
he's easy to go Kickstarter a
ten-million-dollar baedal gear for ya
starring solid Drake yeah yeah all right
we're gonna take break when we come back
a lot more to talk about please stay
with us we'll be right back so you
remember in duck tales when Scrooge
McDuck had this number one dime and it
was like the first time he ever made
super proud of that dime you wanted to
hold it on to hold on to his so he knows
that he's got to grow exactly yeah
anklam gold kept trying to steal it yeah
his original Don yeah yeah there's only
ten cents but he wanted it well if
you're a company owned if your business
owner maybe that makes you think about
your first dollar your first penny that
you made in your company from 1813 maybe
you remember that half cent with penny
candy well there weren't any apps back
then there's only one form payment but
now payments I've radicalized and
there's all these different kinds of
content payment programs and platforms
you need an easy way to accept all of
these various types of payments and
Braintree is the answer braintree lets
you accept every payment known to man at
least we think they do yeah it's a lot
if it's not everything it's all it's
close to it pay
pal Apple pay venmo everything in
between Island heads Bitcoin they even
take bronze slippers what no they don't
but if some Bron slippers takes off yeah
and that's a thing oh they'll be 10

the 404 show thank you so much for being
with us on this Friday December fourth
holidays kicking into high gear medium
gear I don't know about high gear we're
in a low gear for now yeah it's slow
down after Thanksgiving oh you I you
spending money on cyber monday I did
actually I did good I actually walked
into it I haven't done this in years I
actually walked into a store on Cyber
Monday well that's okay because I'll
wait no sorry that was bike Friday I
actually spent money on by friday and I
never ever do that you should do that in
person in person IRL IRL we're at
gamestop okay I needed a ps4 controller
and I was like and it was on sale how
much 40 bucks that's not bad yeah not
bad traditional black ones you're gonna
know tradition I asked to see it cuz all
the other controllers I needed a fourth
controller and all my other doors are
black but the deal only applied to black
controllers alright so there you go I
felt a little bit bad because once you
go to there's one in Forest Hills
they're like a few blocks from my
apartment is crazy no it's quiet cuz it
was at 4pm I wasn't good door busting
I'm not there at 3am to get crazy
moronic deals I just went in it's a
friday i just walked in i was working
that day my my soon-to-be sister-in-law
yeah she's got those she what she's
actually a crazy by friday person yeah
and I know my brother's gonna hear this
is gonna play play this conversation for
okay she's crazy I saw her I don't like
our Friday night yeah it's all like
popped up so she got all the deal
she's up she's I feel like she was up or
for a time I saw her she we had been up
for like 19 hour I need to know how like
does she keep track of how much she's
saving it I mean it's legit like she she
guess you could save some money but like
I don't know I feel like people end up
buying a lot of stuff that they wouldn't
ordinarily by so in the long run you're
really not well I would imagine unless
you're not unless if you're not a pro
like her right I'm gonna cuz she has
been doing this for so long that like
they have a very methodical plan of
attack so they like splits up people I
don't they go with like a crew cuz I
feel like they do a lot of char she was
telling me I Macy's and she spent I feel
like she saved like 800 like she she
bought all this stuff yeah and then when
she finally revealed the price for it
all yeah I was like oh wow ok that
sounds litter I mean I'm not saying
there's not deals to be had yeah saying
to me I just aged like not food why am i
waking up at 1am to go to a store in the
freezing cold that's my mentality right
and I get that and I've never done it
and I'm sure there's a thrill to it too
uh and there's adrenaline yeah and all
that but the way what she was describing
it was pretty gnarly and I was like all
right it's legit it's still fun to make
fun of her absurd because you're like oh
because when we saw her on Friday night
when I was back in mall row yeah she was
like jacked up on something it had been
she'd been up for like 19 hours and she
was like boom boom and I'm just like
she's gotta be done by probably 10 a.m.
that day right like she's not going to
another store after she picks her I
don't know I don't know when she finna I
know she like got to lay down for a
little bit but i don't think i don't
know i don't know it's just I had noisy
she stopped by one the thing that goes
give it more crazy think it was that is
so there's deals on so everyone that
granted they are not the insane crazy
Dora doorbuster deals that they have on
black friday but like consider the
difference like let's say there are
twenty percent more expensive on cyber
monday still like that twenty percent
you're paying for the luxury of not
having to make yourself miserable for a
day and that is a good thing to spend on
like I went nuts on Cyber Monday man you
got a lot of stuff
600 bucks what did you get I just got a
lot of clothes yeah I bought cologne
weird I just started going crazy yeah
that's what happens you see all these
deals and you like feel like you need to
take advantage of them I'm a big t-shirt
guy and there was just one side I buy a
lot of t-shirts from yeah six dollar
t-shirts man how much they normally like
15-20 yeah that's pretty good deal you
know yeah I went a little crazy I spent
a lot of money you know you're helping
the cops treating myself treat yourself
right uh so this is uh this is something
I saw a headline of the other day and I
was like oh my god that's kind of crazy
uh or some kind of miss all this in a
forum somewhere someone brought up the
idea you know it's entirely possible in
the next toy story movie yeah that there
could be Star Wars toys Oh a hundred
percent it's not entirely possible it is
a hundred percent thing that's
definitely gonna have definitely a
hundred percent can have its gonna be
like a little storm trooper for sure or
a little darth vader that like tries to
force choke one of the toys get a one
hundred percent good how could you not
how could you not it's so easy and even
if it's not like one of the main
character like you could potentially see
one of the droids or something being
like in the new gang of toy story movies
yeah and the toy store a gang is it were
but even if it's just like a throwaway
gag like take it to one of a now they're
making one movie a year for the next
infinity they've literally said we'll
just keep making them song as they're
interested so it would star wars so of
course they're just going to jam it into
whatever they want to do do you think JJ
Abrams looks like a Dick Tracy villain I
mean I don't know that many Dick Tracy
villains offhand most of them are like
gangster looking guys and then there's
blank who's just like looks like
Rorschach right no blank has a blank
face doesn't have like a hood over his
face well in the movie was it was
Madonna right cuz he had a hood over his
face she she but that was that was a
twist right she know she wore a hat the
blank wore a hat okay it was like oh
yeah big boy so what is it about JJ
Abrams that you think makes him look a
good villain from Dick Tracy I just I
think he's just and I hate to just make
fun of people's appearances
sure he's just a funny-looking dude I
don't think he looks that weird he's not
like Steve Buscemi looking weird where
that's like his you know he's got this
Lyle Lovett thing going on too no we
does not look as bigger it as well I
love it well the hair a little bit
that's just it's just the hair is like
standing up hair there was a look like
flat top just the hair so you're just
going this based on the hair and he's
got like a he's got like a meatball nose
a little bit he's never coming on the
show name I don't I don't see it I would
be honest if I did should I not look
same I'm just having fun looks pretty
joking around it's weird that I don't
know it's weird that you're saying it
because I don't think he's identified
but he's not like identifiably ugly like
I was just watching this commercial with
fern espresso with George Clooney and
Danny DeVito okay we talked about that
how it's supremely strange that
commercial it's really bizarre it is
like I go on youtube and watch the
George George Clooney a daddy defeat of
espresso cover and I watched it a second
time the best is at the end he just like
walks into scenery right oh really weird
it's so weird and I was watching a
second time I was like are they is this
george Coney like handing over the
Nespresso advertising deal to Danny
DeVito so now George Clooney's out is
that was that like passing the torch oh
he had done he did so George pony's been
an espresso guy for a while and the best
part about Danny DeVito's appearance is
that it's Frank Reynolds in it that's
not Danny DeVito well no I mean he
brought him in a suit or is Danny DeVito
in real life Frank Randall possible I
did see a photo of him like barefoot
walking his dachshund through me yes I
saw that too it was very hot barefoot
not know but he definitely look like
Frank Reynolds TV yeah his hair was
Frank Reynolds e ne and his dachshund
was wearing like a tutu yeah but while I
was watching that commercial i was
thinking okay clearly they're making the
twins reference where george clooney is
like the gorgeous guy and dana's videos
like the schlub yeah
and how Mike is Danny of you okay with
that at this point like is he just like
yeah that's me I'm like kind of like a
little troll man I guess he definitely I
mean I'll come on this entire career
yeah yeah I would just feel kind of bad
i don't know there's really not one
movie where he's not playing like a
sniveling weaselly little runt yeah and
that's and and and and that's not
including the right on the nose penguin
bro yeah right yeah I mean that's just
this thing right that's how he does a
great accurate is a good director yeah
he's done some really good stuff yeah
that's funny yeah oh man I don't know
how we got into that JJ room is no Danny
DeVito is what I was trying to say chage
he looks like I don't know go watch go
watch Dick Tracy ok ain't broke you guys
up front the back the movie to come out
the Warren Beatty movie that that's
where I'm getting it from ok I haven't
seen that movie in about 20 years it's
amazing it's a good it's very good you
don't think it's good I adds 20 years
ago I don't know Pacino this big boy I
forgot he was even in it we got output
you remember Madonna and down her Dustin
Hoffman's in it yeah well um it got
panned if I remember and I think it also
did not make a lot of money i think was
it bomb i remember this must admit it
must have been like 1990 yeah I'd say
it's about 1991 maybe um yeah it's a
nineteen ninety film it didn't get great
reviews but I just remember there being
like a lot of cool stuff about it
because it was it had like these really
nice hand-drawn scenery yeah painted
scenery things oh yeah kind of like
ahead of its time in that way yeah I
mean Danny Elfman's does the score in it
too I don't know enough about Dick Tracy
like he does he just go into a room and
just machine gun the hell out of
everybody that seems like an easy
solution he just like takes the law into
his he'll name but he's got like double
machine guns he's always got a tommy gun
a tommy gun so like you know Batman has
a challenge ahead of himself he get dick
tracy kicked the door down just machine
guns the world the funny thing about
Dick Tracy is that he
they treat I don't know man it looks
like a detective right a lot of money at
the box office did it it made 162
million ok back down that's a fair to
had a 50 million dollar budget though
yeah but um know what's cool about Dick
Tracy is like they stay desensitize
violence in a way that like when people
get peppered with like tommy gun yeah
it's just like Oh bad guys dead is like
no blood or anything right like the way
uncharted truth yeah it's just like it's
not wise crack yeah he might as well
just be playing like sound effect anyway
there's Dick Tracy for you um I want to
get into a conversation about I guess I
was going to use like the toy story
still any that would've been the Segway
parlayin to know but you started
insulting JJ from sound dude I'm just
saying kind of looks like it's actually
fun just I don't know what I want to
call him I like a lot of his movies I
have nothing against the guy sometimes
people I have a thing where I sit I
always say like oh that guy looks like
this guy ok or looks like this or some
that's your thing that's right thing
we're like TL he looked like a pineapple
yeah something like that wow you know I
don't want to ask whatever it is ah so I
want to get into like all right here's a
little backstory ok I've been looking
for something in my house what is it
it's instant it's not important I'm
small ok let's say it's a postcard ok
but it's not is it a postcard with the
inverted Jenny on it it's postcard with
the super rare stamp of the upside down
plane what's that it's the inverted
jetty it's the most the rarest stamp in
the world why do you know that the
rarest day of the world it's the protiv
sorry go ahead that's weird you know
that I can't find it ok it was on my so
I'm less obsessed with finding this
danger and more obsessed with the fact
that I can see it in my head I can where
you left it when I close my eyes I can
feel it and I know exactly what it looks
like sure but i have i've become
obsessed and overtaken by the fact that
i simply cannot find ok so for the art
for argument's sake i'm going to imagine
this is a brick of cocaine no
it is insignificant it is not about the
thing sure it's about the fact that I
lost but it would have to be something
somewhat like valuable to you to care
enough that you've been obsessing over
lose no because I don't care if I ever
find it okay it's more that I can't
believe that I had it yeah knew where it
was sure I keep a lot I have a lot of
 in my apartment it's no see it's
it's tight y'all do it's not a mess on a
mess not a rat the but there is a fair
number if there's a lot of right we
need a house sure uh and I know where
certain things are yeah and I place
things because I know where they go yeah
this thing I can't find ok so let's look
at variables you have a dog in the house
could have eaten that though he doesn't
do that but this is a simple man gyros a
is a textbook case of it has been
misplaced and I just it just drives me
crazy yeah that I can't just get the
thing that I want to get back because
it's gone was it thrown out yeah I guess
I just want to know what the hell it is
postcard oh it is literally a postcard
okay fine the postcard with a bunch of
stickers on it okay and I remember being
like all I want to put a sticker shirt
on my hockey helmet and you don't have
and you don't have like the drawer where
you write placeable I understand but you
don't have the drawer were you like
shove do the random stuff and I do and
you've looked through that drawing in
there a tanner I have a lot of places
like that yeah and I have a mental
inventory right of what all of those
places contain yeah and I simply cannot
find this there's no way that Stacy
threw it out it's possible just say that
seems possible did she know of its value
to you it's a good question we talked
about it after the fact we talked about
it last night for about five minutes and
she yeah she said oh no maybe I did
throw it out but I don't but she doesn't
remember throwing that yeah because it's
insignificant it's a postcard why would
she even think about it but
I first stuff out all the time but I
think if she saw it yeah she would have
been like Oh Jeff probably wants us the
front or the back so maybe that's in
significant really fun besides images
like a devil's thing and just really
into this he would want to keep pecking
explain it help me find it yeah i mean i
don't know it's been a really long time
since i've had that situation cuz i'm
very good and i'm very good okay all the
more upsetting right the last time i
lost like something was when i left a
bat this is like eight or nine years ago
something of value was when i left a bag
full of like my digital camera i was
like going coming back from the airport
and left it on the train ah and it was
gone meanwhile my fiance alex has lost
her bag numerous times on the subway and
invariably there's good samaritan good
cop somebody finds it has everything
label everything's still there all the
cash is still there like but may
the one time i leave something somewhere
gone gum friggin unbelievable I got a
guy yeah buddy who left in 1995 yeah
left his entire CD book collection on a
plane okay from that point on yeah it
changed his musical taste because he had
lost all that music everything and you
don't you don't feel right about rebe
eyeing albums he already bought you feel
like an ass so it changed we're rock and
roll to rap to hip-hop that's really
weird isn't that weird yeah yeah well
losing things you lose a piece of
yourself but then you find another piece
of yourself when God closes a door he
opens a window that's not a thing I i'm
pretty sure cold out there so he opens a
window I'm gonna find this thing okay
but it's gonna be when I don't want to
find right it's gonna show up when I
don't but I don't know it's gonna be
covered in cockroaches I've turned my
apartment inside out sure looking for
the stupid thing yeah I did I spent like
two hours yesterday yeah it's crazy yeah
am I crazy a little
it and well again more obsessed with the
fact that I'm have such a good track
record I know I'm trying I am
100-percent the same way and it would
drive me up a wall like when I get like
a bug for that stuff when there's
something that like I need to find I
don't know where it is and even if it's
like eleven o'clock at night it like
keeps me up like I'll walk around like a
madman for an hour trying to find it or
I just get like very weird about this
there is something about that like I and
I don't want to you know trivialize OCD
and say that sure I know that's not a
very PC way of doing things yeah and I
think that terminology has just sort of
been like you know it's an anxiety yeah
I wouldn't necessarily diagnose it as a
solution it's an anxiety thing where
it's like you put so much effort and
time into this thing which is to say not
losing stuff that when it goes awry you
feel like the screw-up is even more
major whereas most people feel like yeah
whatever exactly yeah like not finding
this thing yep I'm gonna be okay yeah
but inside it's like even this morning
now I went through a storage room in
them in the office cuz like i got maybe
friday Brian let's not be on me Wow
driving me crazy um alright i'll keep
i'll keep everyone updated on that ok
serious stuff pressing ok and check that
stamp because it could be worth a lot of
money maybe it's this damn it could be
the Sam why Russ fresh dick yeah this is
a today I learned why is a second hmm
the thing that a minutes got 60 out an
hour's got 60 0 yep why is a second call
the second did you read it already know
you want to guess sec it never even
occurred to me that the name had a
meaning was like that convenes to it
does me too good but there's 60 sure
seconds right to me is it like a like a
bipartisan a thing like we're like two
of these things is one second no okay I
was a good guess that was an interesting
guess
why is now idea no a second is the
second division of an hour after a
minute what if that that that is that
you said that I heard it it may not have
seen it so a you have an hour hour
whatever it is when you do you divide an
hour in two minutes right and you divide
assess like the second level of
inception for an hour cisely is a second
that's why it's called second
todayilearned it's interesting I never
occurred to me that that had a meeting
so then why yeah and why is it by our
and not like a day like wouldn't I mean
there's a lot of words on the page that
I generate over the top level is an hour
yes so how come a minute shenzhen first
right like there's right it should
be first in our weird isn't an hour a
division of a day right so that's the
for a second third what a day yeah i
guess a day is technically a measurement
of time sure and a pretty universal one
like people came up with day before they
came up with our when i was in college i
had like serious anxiety anxiety but
like serious stoner e conversations
about like the existence of time like
everyone goes short everyone reads a
free feel most boring thing ever is that
boring not when you're 10 knowing your
20 yeah you're 21 char you're like
starting to understand the world and
sober in the judge yes hopeful so we're
like I this is in college I made a
student film yeah about these like three
guys who became obsessed with the fact
that time wasn't real okay maybe then
they like went insane about it what is
that did you make that super cheap time
travel movie that everyone loves oh
that's no but that's called uh what is
that called prime prime yeah yeah I'm
primal is asleep Ron I think it's so I
might have been a second movie at oh so
I'm like yeah yeah crazy Austin 16 feel
like I was very into like donnie darko
at the time her and but don't write it
off I know it's just
I know is that a unique thing to be like
I 20 year old into Donnie Darko in the
mid to late 90s early two thousand have
that DVD but like I you can still talk
about the fact that like we did invent
that right like yes time is real things
age and like we remove in one direction
yeah but like the concept of like
keeping track of it is invented it's or
is it not we're like the Sun hits the
same part of the sky every day and you
can never get to metric that up in
writing it's increments well it's also
measurable in the sense that like a mile
is measurable right Mike distance and
time I mean they're 20 year old Jeff
yeah had a lot of obsessions about
fourth dimension right a lot of
obsessions about like oh it's not real
you know that's yeah did you identify
with Donnie Darko and is like rabbit
quest no no wake up Donnie sure it's
great movie that it is a good movie i
like it you you it's impossible to
dislike that movie if you're 18 10 yeah
right that's the thing you're watching
it it's like no it's still good good
it's got great performance it does it
really does like Idris way she's like
very good in that as a pet oh yeah and I
mean Jake Gyllenhaal that's like a
breakout breakout movie uh there's a lot
of other act of Drew Barrymore yep as a
danger um so kind Nolan no or not no
Noah the teacher oh the guy from ER ya
know whatever my wild no Wiley Wiley ya
know like uh there's a lot of good
performance than that it is enjoyable
and it was sort of in that sweet spot of
like a knee it was sort of like it was a
pious Lee after like the pulp fiction
era of indie movies right but they sort
of like died down and that was
definitely one of those cult favorite
indie movies for sure yeah give them
donnie darko enough love on the show
we're gonna take one more break stay
with us a lot more fun to hit right
after this you know Russ I used to talk
a lot of smack about
these online website builders yeah you
should think they weren't powerful

hey welcome back to the 404 show very
exciting stuff finishing up the week ahh
bra we're gonna have a voicemail I'm
gonna do the voicemail now yeah let's do
the voicemail let's see what I smell now
this one comes from I was gonna play
like our calls from the public thing who
the hell knows where that's at remember
that you know yeah that's the theme song
I don't wait yeah yeah anyway these are
calls from boom link right uh yeah
that's how I when Russ well thank you
now you have a new one thanks thanks
Russ that's exactly how it went cool
let's listen to this one about marijuana
oh hey this is Cleveland from Katie I
was just listening to your podcast from
friday about why Ohio didn't legalize
marijuana and as someone who actually
voted against three legislation I wanted
to give you guys a little clue as to why
for well over the last decade I thought
that it should be legalized and was
thrilled when I heard that it would be a
ballot measure in Ohio however when I
actually have the legislation it created
a monopoly where can people advil
inflation was written with basically
just the right to say I want to grow
marijuana on my land would be permitted
to do so and no one else would in four
years if they supposedly couldn't keep
up with it then they could add one more
for the entire state what it created a
monopoly it wasn't about the
legalization if it was it would have
been fantastic it was actually just
about a business practice which was
really sad that they took this issue and
made it something completely different
wow so hopefully we'll have against in
2016 with some different people are in
charge advantage of this time harga day
that's crazy so this is crazy on so many
levels first of all great great voice my
grade voicemail Katie this is what we're
talking about thank you so much for
taking
thank you so much for taking time for
calling in for laying it out there and
explaining it to us because you know
what this is effing crazy that's crazy
it's crazy one because the how could how
could this be what that's it yeah that's
what this freakin thing was and yeah
that's what's crazy number two the fact
that the national press coverage of Ohio
voting down pot was just that headline
sure like it wasn't about the
monopolistic thing that I'm sure I mean
I someone did that and talk about like I
read an actual target that said no right
and say the specifics right it said no
this is they don't want to happen not
about the fact that it was only going to
be grown by like a handful of people
right it's crazy i would have 0 today on
that too totally it def allow it
definitely reeks of you know you have
lobbyists of whatever these ten people
that spend a bunch of money to get this
law passed because they were like oh we
are going to be the owners of water
essentially like we will command like
these ten people will be all oligarchs
to the weed empire in ohio who is that
okay and I mean that's clearly why I got
pushed forward and that's awful because
obviously that ends really poorly the
other weird thing is granted i'm sure
they would have gotten a lot of money
from these ten people but you would
think the state would get way more money
by having it taxed all like across the
state for everyone you know so like if
every they have all these like
legitimate like a liquor store
equivalent for weed and all that stuff
is being taxed but like why having it
come from like ten farms rather than
like all of the points so you can have
you know competitive prices and Baba
like that's very strange and weird and
yeah I don't know so makes perfect sense
why people voted it down I am educated
now when you have ID when you find out
the real story you're like oh right okay
yeah yeah they good good on you oh I
think they would just follow the model
of these states that have done it
successfully and like past those law at
which they probably will the next time
they try it like what yeah yeah
lo it's just a shame where it's gonna be
another four years before they can put
the ballot up again I don't know no I
think you do it next year every year or
every two years I don't know that's how
that works laws laws I gotta watch that
schoolhouse rock episode again feat I
look I don't claim to be a scholar in
that department but i'm pretty sure laws
can be voted on once a year my lecture
on election day okay right well not yeah
maybe i don't know yeah we honestly
don't know the answer there's a lot of
things we don't know ladies and
gentlemen but that's okay yeah um this
is a weird story Russ let's put this on
Facebook first oh yeah and I kind of
became a little obsessed with it yeah
because I like scary stuff sure so I
don't remember where this city is where
is this located I don't know either well
the link is in there what's up oh the
link is in there yeah yeah yeah okay
let's so there's a dude we're going to
confirm the city in a second but there's
a dude in this city that essentially has
been dressing up as a clown not a
friendly to Wisconsin way it's in
Wisconsin hold on I want to pronounce
this Wicca Shah Wow good shot what it's
java shah and of the Wabash about Max
revealed man city very cocky Shah Baba
uh no it's yeah waukesha ok well there's
a gentleman in waukesha gentlemen a guy
i mean i don't know i don't want to
judge who has been better let the judge
of this boy he's been dressing up as a
clown and a pretty scary clown at that
and just sort of standing around he's
not threatening anybody he's just
standing on street corners and sort of
looking in your general direction okay
when you say he's dressing up as a clown
yeah you are painting a picture of a man
in a rainbow suit no I think people
understand it's a scary clown so it's
like the clown from like it yeah it's
like the it clown okay hurry and it's
also as I wouldn't confirm that this is
not Kim curry 22 occurs in a bad place I
know but maybe he's doing okay now maybe
he's he's I'm pretty sure he's not doing
this in waukesha right okay um the week
so he's wearing the it clown mask shark
and then he's also wearing like almost
like a
a polygamy dude it's like an orange
jumpsuit yeah it's creepy and yeah it's
scary I would definitely be a little put
off by that the amusing thing is that
you can't really do anything about him
because what he's doing is not illegal
he could stand somewhere and like so
long as he doesn't mess with people yeah
but I'm pretty sure and again I do want
to protect these guys right sure but
there probably comes a point where he's
now a public nuisance and like and what
is the definition of that though that's
the way waukesha interpreted town bylaw
know it seems like a bit of a slippery
slope like oh that guy's wearing a
sweater that we don't like let's throw
him in jail yeah I mean you're right if
he's not bothering anyone he could be
like if he's going up to people in their
cars and he's knocking on their nose
he's not doing that that's a problem but
he's not doing that he's just sort of
being creepy in public right which yeah
he's allowed to do that and what's even
better is the the police quote on this
article essentially they so I spoke to
the parents apparently according to the
article he's developmentally disabled
okay so they spoke to the parents of the
guy that's doing this and they said
basically they said yeah it'd be super
great if you could not do that video
real favor to us if you cannot do
because they have no other recourse all
they all I can do is like ask nicely I
feel like this if this keeps going on
for like another year this becomes a
tourist attraction people just like
flock to see this kit and then it's good
for them then it becomes a common goal
yeah he's like the thing of what else is
going on at Wickett sha-sha Wisconsin
nothing there you go and he's got a
clown a freak on you don't even need to
book him for your party he just shows up
yeah it's a weird G doors over the fence
feel like he'd been doing this before
well there's this is not the first time
we've heard this is actually been a
thing over the last couple years where
people have dressed up like clowns and
like gone into graveyards or like just
like been generally creepy so it sort of
been a thing but this is
the most recent incident and again
there's like not a whole lot you can do
about it you know they're talking to a
bunch of people uh who I've seen him
there's a good shot online of him just
sort of standing there but you know what
are you gonna do you know what do you
think Jeff would you arrest him no man
you gotta follow the law man yeah he's
not like you know I would I think
eventually like the guy if it becomes a
thing where it's like yeah it's it's
people are concerned about their safety
yeah but it but if there's he's not
actually doing anything he's just
standing there yeah guess why he's
allowed to do that yeah you're also
allowed to go up to him and yell at him
like you could do that he do you think
he is what the framers of the
Constitution imagined when they were
writing it up yep like freedom of speech
because generally there's going to be
this person that wants to dress up as a
clown and just sort of stand there or we
who are we to stop that initiative amen
to stop that head slavery we're not
super sure about right all men are
created equal right that's hard your
self determine for yourself yeah all
