you it turns out that holding your phone
a certain way might actually kill your
calls
I'm Jessica del Corp from CNN and here's
how you can murder your $200 or $300
wonderful ever since people have been
getting their hands on the iPhone 4
there have been reports flooding in that
covering the black antenna seams with
your hand can slowly suffocate data
signal we tested it ourselves over 18
t's 3G network on several iPhone 4s and
were able to consistently reproduce the
results the left antenna seems
especially susceptible and after
covering it up for about a minute we
repeatedly saw signal drop off one bar
at a time on one of our iPhone fours
signal popped back into view after about
five seconds our other test phone had
much stronger staying power and didn't
always choke when we blocked the seam
what's interesting is that not every
person we through the problem could
reproduce the results exactly the same
way each time
some people's hands seemed to have the
Midas touch while others appear to be
all thumbs in addition to your own
personal chemistry we also found that
the problem is highly dependent on your
reception to begin with it was much
easier to kill off the signal when it
was already weak and of course some
individual handsets may be sturdier than
others what we do know is that using a
rubber bumper like the one that Apple
retails for about $30 should help
resolve the problem Apple has been
pushing that item pretty heavily which
makes us wonder if the issue was already
detected in-house for CNN I'm Jessica
