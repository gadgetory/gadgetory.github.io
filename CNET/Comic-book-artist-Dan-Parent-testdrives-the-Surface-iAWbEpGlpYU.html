artist and a writer for Archie comics
I'm mainly known for creating kevin
keller who's the first openly gay
character at Archie comics and I work on
a lot of special projects like Archie
meets kiss Archie needs Glee I just
worked at Archie meets sharknado
this past summer and I am going to test
out some really cool equipment here so
um
bear with me to be pretty sensitive and
you press down a little harder get a
little bit of a thicker line and you let
up a little bit you get a thinner line
so that's convenient for people to ink
their own work you'll get used to that
sensation in the pen because pens that I
use it's not that sensitive and this is
very sensitive a lot of artists they use
like a non repro blue we call it it's
very light blue and then they'll go over
it with black yeah the eraser is much
much improved over the tools I use I
have a eraser on my pen the Wacom pen I
use at home but it's not anywhere near
as sensitive as this so that's that's a
nice feature I'm kind of old-school so I
still draw the old-fashioned way where I
drop with pencil and pen on paper and I
scan it into the computer and then from
that point on I use a tablet I use a
Wacom tablet the one advantage I think
of doing it the way I do it is you have
a physical piece of artwork if you ever
want to like give it away or sell it or
whatever but I don't see a lot of
artists yet using a tab like this that
you just that you draw on so I haven't
seen a lot of that so maybe that's like
the next wave maybe I said maybe that's
where we're going just from messing
around with it I'm able to really you
know test how sensitive it is and it's
very sensitive I could definitely see
artists getting very used to this
yeah pretty impressive I'm at first with
the eraser there's no difference really
we'll get here we'd get on paper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
