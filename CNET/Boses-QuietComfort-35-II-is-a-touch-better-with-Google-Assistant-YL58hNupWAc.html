cancelling headphones looks sounds and
performs just like the original except
for one key feature there's a new action
button on the left ear cup that allows
you to connect to your Google assistant
without having to touch your phone and
that makes the QC 35 version 2 the first
headphone to integrate Google assistant
Google assistant is available for
Android and iOS devices instead of
talking to your phone to access Google
assistant you just press and hold the
action button on the QC 35 version 2 and
issue commands like what's the weather
currently in New York City it's 81 and
partly cloudy tell me the latest news
here's the latest news find a nearby
Japanese restaurant I found a few places
you can also control your music playback
with your voice as well as smart devices
in your home you don't have to use the
action button for Google assistant using
the Bose Connect app you can choose
instead to map the action button to
noise cancellation levels toggling
between low high and off with each
button press beside from that new button
nothing else has changed the QC 35 has
the same comfy fit same top notch noise
cancelling identical controls on the
right ear cup yes you can access Siri on
iPhones and the same battery life at up
to 20 hours in Wireless mode with noise
canceling on and oh yeah the price is
still $350 not exactly a bargain how
much of a game-changer is the direct
connection to Google assistant after
using it for a week I'm not exactly sure
it's one of those things that some
people will appreciate and frequently
use while others may never bother with
it it currently does have its quirks and
limitations but like Alexa it is
evolving and acquiring new skills and
will get better over time if you already
own a pair of QC 35s I don't think it's
worth upgrading to this model for the
integrated google assistant but what the
new feature does do is give an already
excellent wireless noise cancelling
headphone a little bit more personality
and despite the fact that the
performance and sound hasn't changed it
helps Bose keep pace with Sony's
slightly upgraded MDR 1000 X mark - and
improve to studio 3 wireless both of
which also cost 350 dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
