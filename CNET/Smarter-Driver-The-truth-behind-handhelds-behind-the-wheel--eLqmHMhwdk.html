has been approached three major ways
first of all you've got the family of
Bluetooth hands-free either brought in
or built into the car and headset
technology secondly you've got an
ever-increasing voice recognition both
in the car and on the mobile device
itself to try and get your hands and
eyes off of it and thirdly you've got
laws and public awareness campaigns that
use both stick and carrot to try and get
you to do the right thing or at least do
it in a safer way 17 states currently
ban any handheld use of a mobile device
while driving
48 banned texting specifically with only
Montana and Arizona holding out how's it
all working well the latest US
Department of Transportation research
indicates two things the numbers aren't
as high as you might think and those
numbers aren't changing much either
in 2013 the latest data available
researchers observed over 37 thousand
cars stop for at least 10 seconds in
traffic or at a light at almost 1,400
locations around the country drivers
holding a phone to their ear has been
observed to decline modestly from 5.2
percent in 2012 to four point six
percent observed in 2013 that's still
about six hundred twenty thousand cars
at any given time during the day being
driven by someone who has half their
hands and at least half their mind on a
call the other interesting trend line is
visible manipulation of a handheld
device now that rolls up texting email
entering a GPS destination skimming
facebook what have you it's gone from
point four percent before the iPhone was
introduced to 1.7 percent today or about
230,000 cars on us roads and any given
time of day
it pays to double check your state's
laws on handheld calling texting while
driving and handheld use at all and
follow them there so many technologies
that make it easy to do now it's just
the right thing and remember that even a
small percent of drivers doing those
adds up to the better part of a million
accidents waiting to happen
