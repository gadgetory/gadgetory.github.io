high-volume electric car yeah they got
some electrified threes running around
but this is the real deal it's a whole
new lines like they spawned another
company it's the I division of BMW this
one's called the i3 over my shoulder
there you see the i8 will do a video on
that some other time when it's closer to
production that's a hot little plug-in
hybrid sports car now what's going on
here is what they call a mega city or
mega urban vehicle it's highly urbanized
electric vehicle it's got a lithium-ion
pack in the belly the motors in the back
the rear wheels are driven you get about
80 to 100 miles of range unless you
option into a range extender two
cylinder BMW motorcycle engine they can
stick in the back that will give you 70
miles more range but it's not like a
Chevy Volt where it just keeps going
forever as long as you have gas it's
kind of in the middle ground so how's
this different from a Nissan Leaf first
of all got some BMW driving DNA in it
we're going to check that out in a
future episode of cnet on cars get this
thing on the road and really find out
one of the biggest differences though is
this is a carbon reinforced plastic
construction this car only weighs 2,700
pounds including a 450 pound battery
pack inside you're going to find an all
LCD cabin you've got a small display
right in front of you for traditional
instrument panel and a great big 10 or
11 inch I Drive display on the right
that is not much different than today's
I Drive in top-end BMWs so the basic
idea here is BMW has got a new line of
cars that says they've planted their
flag heavily in electrification not
hybridization not so much diesel not so
much anything that's got to go in the
hydrogen space they are talking strongly
about battery electric in these vehicles
and a very different look and feel comes
out q2 2014 it's about 42 grand base
before you get those various state and
federal subsidies so they're not setting
a new record for cheapness but that's
not what they do anyway
