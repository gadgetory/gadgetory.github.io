cnet.com here to help improve the
terrible battery life that came with iOS
5 especially on the iPhone 4s the issue
is so bad that Apple is investigating
the problem and might release a fix but
until then I have a few solutions you
can try right now grab your phone and
head to settings to get started
one tip many people swear by is
resetting your network settings first go
to general reset and select reset
network settings enter a passcode if you
have one and your phone will restart
this won't erase any data but you'll
have to re-enter your Wi-Fi passwords
now go to location services and turn off
any location services you don't need
these services drain a ton of battery
since they force your phone to
constantly find your location the
biggest offender in this list is
probably reminders because if you set up
a location-based reminder your iPhone
will always monitor your location as it
waits to activate your reminder so you
can either disable it here or hold off
on using location-based reminders until
this battery issue is fixed once you
turn off these services head down to
system services and disable
location-based I ads and setting time
zone which you can turn on again when
you travel across time zones alright
we're done with location services and
the next step is to turn off diagnostic
reports your phone may be sending to
Apple periodically so now head to
general about diagnostics and usage and
select don't send this next setting is
Siri related and only applies to the
iPhone 4s go to general Siri and turn
off race to speak this is a handy
feature but it consistently drains your
battery by monitoring your iPhones light
sensor to activate Siri it's not fair
that we have to disable useful features
for better battery life but until Apple
releases a fix this could be the best
solution if you did all of the above and
you're still seeing crappy battery life
some users in the Apple community forums
say you should condition your battery so
let your battery die which shouldn't
take long then
completely recharged it by using an AC
adapter in general you should do this at
least once a month with these settings
in place you should see your battery
life improve but this doesn't mean Apple
is off the hook for this issue if you
have any battery saving tips let me know
on Twitter or my facebook page and I'll
repost them on how to see Netcom for
