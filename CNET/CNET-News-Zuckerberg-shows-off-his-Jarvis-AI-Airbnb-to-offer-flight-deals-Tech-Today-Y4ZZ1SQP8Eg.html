that matter right now
Mark Zuckerberg has been quietly
developing a form of artificial
intelligence something he calls Jarvis
named after Tony Stark's personal
assistant Jarvis can do some simple
smart home functions like turning lights
on and off though it's more of a pet
project for Zuckerberg than anything
else it's been reported that Facebook
has been working with AI for some time
so we'll have to wait and see if Jarvis
ever joins the team Bloomberg is
reporting that Airbnb will soon be
competing with flight search services
like Expedia though still in the early
stages word is that Airbnb will
eventually let users book flights
through the company that's always
focused on rental services in the past
the report says Airbnb hopes to launch
the service before the company files for
IPO and finally the smash hit minecraft
has made its way to the Apple TV
platform simply dubbed the Apple TV
edition minecraft will go for twenty
dollars and include seven content packs
for free for a limited time only
you can say up to date with the latest
by downloading the CNET tech today app
in the Apple App Store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
