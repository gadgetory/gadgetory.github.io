2017 everyone from BMW to Ford to
Hyundai showed off their self-driving
car technology it knows as a crosswalk
here so it had stopped and shown even a
little yellow there it is that says okay
when you see that it means I've detected
a pedestrian and I'm making a decision
based on that that says I'm stopped for
that reason so now we're all clear it
goes on its own you're a car company and
you don't have an autonomous vehicle
offering you're gonna go the way of a
lot of tech companies that didn't keep
up with paradigm shifts in their
industry in the future the controls of
your car may not be on your dashboard
they may be in the air BMWs concept car
has Holograms to start the car play
music or even shop but with tactile
feedback so it feels like you're
pressing a button so these three
components work in tandem so when you
see for example a start button now you
can very slowly with a single finger
dive into this and you fail the haptic
feedback each seat has its own speakers
built into the headrest and because only
the driver can see the hologram video
calls could be more private you take the
call the audio is switched off I
continue to listen to Beethoven until
you listen to the conversation you were
having in addition to being your ride
cars are becoming a sort of remote
control for your smart home Hyundai and
Ford have incorporated virtual
assistants like Amazon's Alexa and
Google home so your car can connect with
your smart home devices Alexa set the
thermostat to 68 degrees setting
thermostat heat to 68 perfect so this
actually communicated to my home in
Michigan from Las Vegas
so the temperature of my house is now
going to go to 68 degrees doesn't matter
it doesn't matter yes one over the
internet yeah yeah if you're not driving
your car what are you doing inside your
car automakers are envisioning a new
place to work or relax
Microsoft is working on putting Skype
and office features into cars to help
with productivity because what the
assistant does the assistant knows about
you and about you
and when it finds in the point to
meeting for example tonight a PM with
Susan do you want to book a restaurant
yes show me the best restaurants here
are the top three restaurants close to
your destination
Toyota unveiled a concept car that is a
feature called chauffeur mode which
reclines the driver's seat sets mood
lighting and even blows cool air on your
neck and you should even that's an air
blowing in my back to Faraday future
hopes to be the car for now the electric
car maker that wants to compete against
Tesla unveiled its FF 91 production
model which Faraday says will hit the
road in 2018
