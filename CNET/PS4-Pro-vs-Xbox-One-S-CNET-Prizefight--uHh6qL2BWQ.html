the console wars are now embracing the
4k generation but how much do the
upgrades actually pay off it's a
Throwdown showdown for game console
supremacy between Sony's PlayStation 4
Pro and Microsoft's Xbox 1s let's get it
on
round 1 is designed most of the time
consoles get smaller when they go for
their first update Sony did make the ps4
slim but we're talking about 4k consoles
here and the ps4 pro is actually bigger
in size than the previous ps4 it's now a
three layer sandwich
that's one pound heavier deeper and
wider and size by two centimeters and
just around the same height but we're
getting a lot more packed into that
package now the Xbox 1s reduces its size
from the previous Xbox one by 40% and
the power supply is in the console and
not some extra brick it's a nice compact
package and I like how they mix it up
with white for the standard console
color and controller so if we're just
talking aesthetics round one goes to the
Xbox 1s for me round two is navigation
and interface
the ps4 brings an even cleaner single
bar interface with their latest system
software it's simple to use and it
really can't get any easier for a gaming
home entertainment console the Xbox
one's interface takes a cue with a
Windows 10 tile interface I like all the
game and video images but it's a little
messier to get around with this
navigation bar that's throwing community
it's one guide and store at us with
slightly different looks to all of them
now it's just trying to showcase too
much at once where the ps4 interface can
do other things but it's primarily
focusing on the games Microsoft brings
face recognition and voice control with
the Kinect but the Xbox 1s doesn't even
include the Kinect anymore the ps4 also
supports facial recognition and voice
commands through its add on camera and
headset as well but I've never regularly
used them for either console the cleaner
the better and we're giving the ps4
round to round 3 is hardware
4k support is what takes these consoles
the next level up but they do it
differently the ps4 can play 4k
supported games and constrain 4k content
from services like Netflix and Amazon
but it's disk drive does not support 4k
Ultra HD discs the Xbox 1s can also
stream 4k content but it's also one of
the cheapest blu-ray players that
supports 4k Ultra HD discs and if you're
someone looking to upgrade your home
theater system it makes a difference
sure there are services that stream 4k
content but you still can't beat the
fidelity from an actual disc both
consoles support HDR content and it's up
to game developers to decide how they
want to use the extra power available to
them it could be higher frame rates
higher fidelity textures HDR support or
all three it just depends and moving
forward we'll see how developers really
take advantage of this now when it comes
to console power the Xbox 1s gets a
slight processing power edge from the
Xbox one by overclocking the processor
but in most real-world tests it helps
keep frame rates locked in consistently
their support for HDR but there isn't a
drastic amount of new power available
for devs to play with on the other hand
the ps4 pro is a different story an
entirely new GPU and more efficient use
of system memory has boosted its power
to point to 8 times compared to the
original ps4 but again it's up to
developers to take advantage the Xbox
one also supports a cable connection for
you to watch TV through it and it might
be a difference maker for you while Sony
has our PlayStation View TV streaming
service but we're more focused on the
gaming aspects here so let's not forget
that the ps4 platform supports this
thing called psvr the most affordable
and easy way to get a legit virtual
reality experience now when it comes to
hardware you'll probably look at these
consoles differently Xbox 1s has the
drive but the ps4 Pro has improvements
that directly affect gaming
and until we see Microsoft's project
Scorpio I'm picking the ps4 Pro this
round next up is game library each
console has their own flagship
exclusives and in a perfect world we'd
own both consoles I mean some of you do
now Sony hasn't charted for and
Microsoft had Tomb Raider as their
answer as an exclusive for a year
Microsoft has Halo Gears of War and
sunset overdrive sony has blood-borne
rocket League and Last of Us remastered
now we know about all the blockbusters
on both consoles like Call of Duty
battlefield and I got to show love to my
NBA 2k ballers but the list of games
from both consoles with improved
graphics better frame rates or HDR
support is all over the place but at the
moment the ps4 Pro has more titles
available now I won't turn my back on
the Xbox is backwards compatibility it's
important when I'm playing newer games
compared to ones from four to five years
ago and this always comes down to a
personal preference but Sony gets the
edge here not only for its great indie
games it has a longer list of games that
are supporting the new power available
to it but it's also the ability to enter
the world of VR but you just can't do
with the Xbox one S at the moment
advantage ps4 pro the final round is
valid
Microsoft listen to the people and put
out a console without a Kinect and it
helps the price at $2.99 the best way to
sum this up the Xbox one s has two
terabytes of storage and one of the most
affordable 4k blu-ray Ultra HD disc
players and HDR support for $2.99
now the ps4 pro brings more raw power a
one terabyte drive with 4k streaming and
HDR support for 399 but if we're talking
just pure value I'm going to lean on the
Xbox one s and it takes this final round
so let's take a look at the breakdown
the Xbox one s took design and value
while the ps4 took user interface
hardware and game library but the final
decision always comes down to you the
Xbox positions itself is really more
than a game console with cable TV
capability and now a 4k Ultra HD disc on
top of a gaming console the ps4 pro is
even more focused on gaming than ever
with the addition of its psvr so if you
already own the previous generation of
either of these consoles it's even hard
for me to recommend an outright upgrade
for either one unless you're committed
to a 4k ACR TV set moving forward but if
you're still deciding between the two
right now and you can only pick one here
telling me I have to pick one I'm going
to go ps4 pro with the hope that
developers truly take advantage of the
new power moving forward but ultimately
you're gonna be happy with either one
i'm brian tong thanks for watching I
will catch you guys next time for
another prizefight
