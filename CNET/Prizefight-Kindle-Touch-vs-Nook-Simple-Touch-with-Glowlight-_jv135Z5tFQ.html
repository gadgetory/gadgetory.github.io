and the ereader market continues to be a
hotly contested battle ground so hold on
to your butts it's a prize 5 push out
between the Amazon Kindle Touch ad free
version and barnes &amp;amp; noble's nook simple
touch with glowlight now our judges for
this fight our executive editor John go
home falcone executive editor David the
bad boy car nguoi and myself Brian King
Kong Kong will take all three judges
scores and average them out to the
nearest tenth each round the final prize
fight score will be an average of all
rounds using the same decimal system
we're going five rounds deep first up is
designed Amazon's Kindle Touch
streamlines its design with an all touch
interface removing the keyboard and
using a physical home button it has a
minimalist design with a soft textured
backing and is barely slimmer compared
to its competition now the barnes and
noble nook simple touch has a unique
ereader design with rounded corners and
a backside contoured design it's more
ergonomic and comfortable to hold and
the glow light version has a gray accent
on the border we wish it was a little
thinner but it's smaller footprint is
nifty and gives it the edge the nook
simple touch gets a 4.3 and the Kindle
Touch gets a 4 next round is navigation
in
the Kindles navigation is simple and
straightforward but there are a few
curious things you have to use the power
button to wake it from sleeping instead
of just pressing the home button that's
right there the home button serves
literally no other function than to go
back to the home screen and when you're
reading you have to press in a specific
area up top to bring up options even
though it's a minor annoyance but really
the OS is just too plain Jane and lacks
any elegance or polish now the nook
simple touch has both touch and physical
control navigation when reading books
you can move through the pages by their
touching or using the physical controls
on the side to turn pages pressing on
the screen brings up more options and
the home button not only helps to wake
the simple touch but it's really the
heart of the navigation for the main
functions in a tool bar plus holding it
down activates the glow light for
reading overall the feel and controls
here are just better the Duke simple
touch gets a 4 and the Kindle Touch gets
a 3 so after averaging two rounds Barnes
and all the leads next round is features
the Kindle Touch can listen to music or
audio books through its speakers or
headphone jack and it really makes it
more than just an e-reader text to
speech is supported but not all books
can take advantage of it what the fall
never come to an end amazon also touts
their x-ray mode that breaks down
important people places or topics within
the reading but again it's not available
for all books they've continued to leave
in a web browser that's still not even
worth using even if it's pinch and zoom
is more like pinch and doom another
killer feature is Amazon's lending
library and if you're an Amazon Prime
member you'll have access to one hundred
and forty five thousand books that you
can borrow including the recent edition
of the entire harry potter series and
that's huge so how does barnes a noble
counter that well the note simple touch
brings the most innovative feature we've
seen on an e-reader since the invention
of ian technology with its low light it
illuminates the entire screen and allows
you to read in the dark without
disturbing the person next to you is
truly a one-of-a-kind groundbreaking
feature that trumps any single feature
we've talked about and the Kindle team
drop the ball on this one the nook
simple touch brings an SD card expansion
slot for storing more content you can go
into a physical retail store and read a
selection of books for free and native
epub support is a big deal for hardcore
users both ereader support overdrive for
borrowing books from your local
libraries there's PDF reading support
plus social hooks for facebook and
twitter this one's a close one but the
Nook Simple Touch gets the edge
where's revolutionary glow light and the
Kindle Touch gets a 4 next round is
Digital Ecosystem the content that's
being offered has become more and more
significant and this is where Amazon
shines amazon has a larger offering of
titles and often offers slightly better
prices their lending library is a huge
differentiator if you pay for amazon
prime both e-meters offer books
magazines and newspapers you can lend
some books to friends but Amazon's
Kindle Touch also lets you download
audible audiobooks subscribe to blogs
and even download games Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
can't max the Amazonian beast when it
comes to content and the Kindle Touch
takes this round with the 4.7 and the
note symbol touch gets up 3dr averaging
four rounds we're tied at 3.9 the final
round that decides it all is valued
the Kindle Touch ad free version is 139
bucks and if you're okay with having an
ad-supported version it will cost only
ninety-nine dollars not first I didn't
mind it doesn't get in the way of
reading when I was hammered with
Twilight ads for about a month I had a
change of heart the nook simple touch
with glowlight is also one hundred
thirty nine dollars but it sets the
standard for readers moving forward and
is well worth it if you do any nighttime
reading and you won't ever see a
third-party ad on either of these the
note simple touch gets a 4 and the
Kindle Touch gets a 3 so let's average
out all five rounds and in the battle
where the milk came out firing amazon
hit back hard for digital ecosystem but
it just wasn't enough and the milk
simple touch with glowlight takes this
battle 3.9 to 3.8 and is your prize
fight winner i'm brian Tong thanks for
watching catch you guys next time on
another prize fight
