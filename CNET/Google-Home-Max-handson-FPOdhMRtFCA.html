version of the Google home smart speaker
called the Google home max just like the
Google home Google home max has Google
assistant built-in meaning you can say
hey Google what's the weather right now
in Mountain View at 61 and partly cloudy
today it'll be partly cloudy with a
forecasted high of 63 and a low of 43
and it'll answer your questions it'll
control your smart home you can set a
timer you can do all the other things
we've come to know with the Google home
speaker the plus with the Google home
max is that it has a very advanced
speaker in it so if you were an
audiophile
if you really like sound quality you can
use this to blast the music of your
choice and make it sound beautiful to
your ears so we haven't gotten to fully
test it yet but we're here at Google's
headquarters in Mountain View and we got
to hear a little bit of it and got to
see some of its cool new tricks such as
the fact that you can play a song in
stereo pairing two of the speakers you
can of course pair them to any of the
other speakers with chromecast like you
could do with a Google home but this
speaker will both adapt to the room it's
in and adapt it sound accordingly but
more than that it will play in stereo on
its own using its left and right side
accordingly you can flip it on its side
and it'll turn into just a mono speaker
so all that is pretty cool if your
particular about how you like to listen
to music as a demo hey Google sing me
twinkle twinkle little star and is
coming out of both speakers in stereo
sound hey Google that's sweet but stop
so we're excited to give this the Google
home X will be available for three
hundred and ninety-nine dollars on
December 11th so there'll be a premium
gift out there for the audiophile in
your life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
