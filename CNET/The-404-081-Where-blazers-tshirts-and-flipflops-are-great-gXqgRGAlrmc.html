fresh dick yeah well he's in yugioh
right UGL in case you know all these
video game which i say i like we're
telling names i mean journalist but
anyway the whole point of the
presentation was all about we fit yeah
will is has now convinced me that it's a
lot cooler than I thought I cooler
you're gonna get in deep more wine well
I don't know if it's gonna actually get
me into shape because anything old me
hows Yusei like there's no lady play I
play a lot of hockey with that to old
people maybe yeah I designed for all
will that will that's the cool thing
about is like anybody can can use this
thing if you can stand on a scale you
can fit I'll give you your weight on the
scale yeah or does it that's good they
can handle the US one can handle up to
330 Japanese when can we hand up to 250
300 leds people over to exert their sumo
wrestlers exactly and that sign that's
actually how like the whole mentality uh
came together did you did you try it and
work up a sweat oh no I did not get to
play with it too much but uh you know he
basically went through the yoga duh
section yeah would you do with the bid
due to teaches you balance and
you know you'll wind up having correct
posture it basically forces you to like
Center your your yourself your core yeah
and you know there's all these different
exercises you do seem very center today
yeah so then he was like to I hate you
Rendell Bennifer wearing flip flop yet
cuz your loser but all that uh scoliosis
gone belly-up God is cracked out sis
Conda always get scared you have a spine
you can add its final shape voices all
the different ages yep it's true yeah
but um I was very informative arm really
convincing and uh did they sold two
million of these in Japan earning really
that's cuz Japanese people are the first
ones to buy crazy stuff like that I mean
you go ddr ddr caught on 15 years ago
yeah but I think it will be a good one
people are gonna buy the damage I it's
the next thing you can do with it isn't
wii sports yeah it was great you know it
after so many a year and a half i still
lovely sport for sure i know that i did
not know doesn't get old yeah arm but a
Tetris exact for sure time time what's
really cool though is like you have to
look at it as if you know they're
they're trying to get the this bounce
board into all these homes right once
they have this installed base then
that'll lend itself to a surfing game
yeah stuff like that is skiing game in
Japan you know when I saw this I was
like oh that's like the power pad I like
I used to have a power pad and then I
learned to totally rigged it like the
like and I was like oh you can totally
cheat that but I think that they've done
a better job with this is not just the
next enter yeah for sure this is not
your grandma's parapet really is not for
sure funny is that 330-pound limit is
probably not give me enough for some
Amir to bottom a yes which is that is
that I don't know well there's a hole up
the issue of obesity and she like that
came up i bet w how a bunch of people
who hacked as in called the power pad
who have the wii fit yeah to make it so
like I still reinforced I didn't see we
could just like put a little bit of
extra
and I like insulation yes so the
switches don't break it or we can use
two of them all that work conferred
antics a section of your body oh that's
right he was entering side turning
upside with your turn like vertical yeah
yeah put both your feet exactly that'd
be even more accurate if you think about
it because then you have like the two
normally when you stand on it would be
like your two feet sensors whatever but
like that it would be like super
perfectly accurate with four different
spots you think I'm just saying so fat
people we fit could be for you too it
might you have to spend my old is also
speaking of fat people and watching
things like that you know about so you
bought it well no I didn't know unbutton
a bong HD DVR HD no he's my TV yeah so
what would you think a cool thing I
watched I was kind of like you this is a
good movie it's not no business being
the Oscars nobody yes and see it um the
cool part about it it comes with an
extra disc that has the digital copy of
it already on there so like you want to
put on your iPod instead of having to
rip it you just don't you can keep it
yeah you can keep it Ivan actually done
yet to sign of his dear I'm do whatever
new regardless like I don't even mind if
it seemed to be honest no because I read
my ipod I don't care so you got the
digital copy the thing that they were so
can you lend it to me though or is it
sure I'm sure just bring it in will find
out let's find out so I was pretty
excited except you like it was a
watershed moment for the movie industry
in my home because like oh wow they
actually do you care about digital
distribution and the way people are
consuming me yeah you know it's like
well instead of just ignoring pretending
like people don't wash things on their
ipod they're actually giving a shot mmm
pretty cool I don't know what you're
saying are you uh would you are Natalie
would you would be an incentive to buy
maybe like a two dollar extra price DVD
if you had a digital copy with it no but
I don't really ever buy movies yeah so
and when I buy them these days I do buy
them digitally so yeah um I don't want
the disc yeah I'm a minimalist I don't
want stuff yeah Harry I'm like a movie
amiss aficionados so like the digital
copy at macworld you know when they
announced all that that was I think my
favorite moment from
show like I was really excited as I
could bali not have to spend due to four
or five hours and breaking the movie to
put my ipod did you for five hours a
handbrake a movie for your ipod well I
mean you if you want to rip it straight
from the disc you have to take like
twice the length of the movie yeah and
and if you want to do like a second pass
you know yeah I wanna go on I mean I
guess I just never rip it up oh boy i
put up bad quality yeah i'm gonna call
her call her I'm not picking up that's
should have taken that I took up on the
marker doesn't cave in it could have
been someone who called Bruce Willis I'm
glad you could have been fun 30 rock

blog post this morning that called me
out and said that that was really uncool
for me to do and I shouldn't have done

Randall that allows me then I'm gonna
yeah then I'll pay his settlement well

to publicly apologize for calling out
Randall Bennett who is fooling around
right now Randall's Stan trying to make
this thing happen I'm sorry I'm trying
to have a moment you here and you're
completely rolling around the dude i
revoke that apology punish beggary fine
fine whatever we almost had a moment
exactly speaking that is sincerity
speaking of douchebaggery uh mortal
kombat vs marvel really well i just saw
this on game is this just like a fan
fiction by jana it's on gaming age
scorpy metallic experiments as men what
that's a joke get on i know i won't you
love it it's a joke like my touches i
would i would watch their a like a
cartoon that maybe would you nope not
watch a movie of it let's see why do you
think they did this who's they and where
is this coming from world to live com it
says Warner brother it sounds like
fanfiction let's see world's co was just
an Apache server so it's obviously not
real
ah that's what you know what you were
all on would you want the Immortals
combat marvel or wait we're going back
down first that would be DC the Mortal
Kombat franchise does not even deserve
to be mentioned in the same sentence
really is marvel horrible is a
world-renowned yeah but ok but the movie
trailer is a culture yeah movie was
there for 15 years legit move aside now
it's not legit because it would be more
converses DC I'm trying to bring up the
movie first why is it Batman ever met
and also that's that guy's a fake but I
was gonna say with mortal kombat it's
like it got a lot of people in the game
you forget got it yeah but that is is
nothing to do with comic books or
anything oh come on everybody my age was
like there's blood in a video game oh
you do do is it is kinda there's a look
there's what about comic books too after
the fact yeah so like man I don't know
yet and I'm sick of those elections are
feeding the fanboys movie this weekend
coming out speaking of movies let's take
then let's take bets oh yeah we're doing
the betting thing out now on so we're
doing this thing where Jeff Wilson and I
and Natalie can get into on this if you
want we're gonna guess which movie we
think is gonna gross the most in the
rocks I was whichever wins we're gonna
start keeping score of like who's better
yes so far it's 110 rekha not use pick
me as you know well I said 21 that time
yeah and when I said that spoof movie
yeah so I won that so fortunately you on
that cuz Lord you know I don't want in
on this because I'm not a very good
judge of what movies no I'm I just can't
believe that people like Martin Lawrence
still make movies and that they still
make money about the family completely
baffles the mind and so because I can't
understand that element of our culture I
don't think I'm yeah right well that's
the thing I Perry Tyler Perry Martin
Lawrence all you gotta do Murphy in fat
women ensues body fat suits all you
gotta do is bang your head against the
wall for 10 minutes and then you see
what people want to watch so Wilson you
put in here forbidden kingdom 88 minutes
forgetting sarah marshall zombie
tripperz tripperz I think forgetting
sarah marshall and ugly for you so much
marketing no question about i would bet
i'd bet 5 grand
real although i was gonna say this but
if you want to bet bhajan I'm agreeing
with you though so what we can't do them
but I do but if someone said I'll take
action on that yeah okay sure there's
mugabe strippers why don't I just write
you a check right now they're exactly
you know I was the one of the movies
forbidden kingdom that's come excited
I'll see this I do not want to see real
I because someone's hair fights did you
know it bothers the hell out of me
because it's like about China first of
all that's why it's called the forbidden
kingdoms when is one of those uh uh
wasn't starting out what are these
people like maybe if it bothers the hell
out of me cuz the main characters a
white guy who so I don't know I just
like I'm tired of these like but like
you gonna laugh really exactly I go she
goes back in time though and then it's
with jet li and oh it's a charger gently
and Jackie Chan and they speak English
so you know it's just it bothers the
hell out of me like I mean I don't know
I'm sorry it's it's like bothers me that
everyone in Star Wars spoke English oh
it's a popcorn what are they like no no
long ago in a galaxy far away but add
english it's not i don't know i just
think you like it I Figgis movies just a
popcorn movie it's not like a cultural
Great Society movie it's like another
short duration of tiny it is like on
like look dude we're sorry no this is
what happened I don't like big la yet
all right look everyone you know there's
it's the way it is it was yes i think
was about two weekends ago I flipped on
packs or something with one of those
like I love paddle channels ax they had
a taxes exist anymore sign at all it was
was called I IRS is that use me pax yeah
but I was watching it and it it was
Africa was called but it was like it
took all these Chinese mythic stories
that are partly religious okay yeah
about like The Monkey King the Jade
Emperor and they turned into the this
forest where they had again a white guy
day like the main character now you know
saving Chinese culture a white guy right
I'm sorry and it bothered the hell out
of me because it'd be like Jesus like if
they took Jesus and put them in a movie
in China where he came back and beat up
a couple people yeah like that's the
same
and it just I don't know and there's
this comic that I saw this morning of a
guy pros testing and a big sign that
says like boycott the Beijing Olympics
and you know boycott china and then
there's signs pointing to everything
he's wearing it's like made entirely cat
is but i thought on curry dot-com this
much about the salaries but less is
wearing likely knees yeah yeah it's an
eye if you wake up and go to work it's
your your bitching dollars I where
Chinese clothes all my food every time
II what do you want you know unless you
like one of the really rich people you
know what I heard this morn so this
morning I went on The Today Show and I
was in the wardrobe and they were
steaming my clothes and you know just
trying to get me ready and they were two
guys like fashion asst fashionista guys
and what was that I said fashionista
type yeah and they were too and so they
were rolling footage of the Pope live on
the morning show and the guys like he
only wears prada and I was like wet and
they said um prada personally makes all
the Pope's shoes no well yeah isn't that
interesting that's way interesting yeah
I guess Prada worse better I wish that
were the headline of the shoes me like
you guys that was like low-hanging you
right there and because Prada you know
as an old Italian family they became
famous because they've always made the
papal choose when that great fact that
will get you nowhere in life that it's
not you know goodness it smells like you
know how valley-wide calls me factoids I
have tons of this kind of stuff but
that's like I feed on this stuff so I
don't Wears Prada were you able to like
pimp loaded on uh no no just like no doc

never get a pimp the 44 well you're on
some radio station this week yet in
getting interviews you know yeah I'm
gonna be on again you've been on maxim
radio a couple of times and they totally
pimp out loaded um that's nice of them
yeah yeah I ask you some like really
crazy stuff on did you know that was
Maggie you remember oh no that was not
exactly exactly called me so they did
this thing where it's like okay we're
gonna ask you what you think of these
things that guys do like you know
wearing flip-flops do you love it or not
oh that kind of thing they asked me what
I thought of crew cuts
and I said that it reminds me of the
brother in weird science when he gets
turned into a frog he has a crew cut and
we were arguing and they're like he's
not a frog he's a pile of poo and I was
like no he's a frog some random person
like a PR person or something heard it
and then called me and in my pitch i was
like hello this is Natalie and he wanted
me to pitch me his company which is like
a mobile social network and he's like
yeah I'm the brother from weird science
I was like what are you talking about
like I totally forgotten about it always
be that they think that if the eighth
they give you a relevant thing that you
talked about in the last like ten
minutes that they will I mean to or two
weeks ago or something that's insane dad
since I don't know didn't but then they
ask you like your top ten list of things
like like oh yeah they asked me a deal
breakers on a date and what watches 05
okay that I will not stand for on a date
so you have to be nice to this number
one or two that these are in no
particular thing like the first date the
second day oj number one you have to be
nice to the waitress even if you can't

much jewelry and I'm not into the pinky
ring and then yeah and then one of my
big ones is um oh it's escaping right
now oh you cannot high-five me after
every sentence yeah what kind of dude
like let's have the crab cakes yeah I
think that way yeah do it no high-fiving
