what's the day June 28th June 2006 20
babies three of the 359 podcast and
sorry we're late I got locked out of my
apartment this morning but you know who
didn't
Alfred Inge and Roger Chang hey guys
that's right right here on time so we
knew the date I try ah look we're we're
to do a short show no Q&amp;amp;A today just
because we've got other stuff it's got
other meetings kind of wealthy lives I
don't know why I just have to work
basically that is your life is my life
anyways we've got a busy show we talking
about Netflix with their choose your own
adventure style videos uber and lyft
teaming up in Texas and a universal the
attempt to build a universal digital ID
it's an interesting concept
oh yeah it's super interesting I kind of
wish it exists it now but it would be so
hard to create that it's just one of
those things that's what I'm yeah that's
why that's why it intrigues me because
it's a very ambitious goal I just can
you imagine just carrying like a like a
universally you and did your life I just
wish it was like some universe that I
could wake up in and it's already there
right I feel like this would definitely
cut a lot of headaches out and just
travel you know things like that so
alright as always well you can leave
your comments to the leave your
questions your comment section but we'll
probably ignore them we'll probably have
to today but we're gonna try to get
through this as fast as possible thank
you for joining us regardless thank you
and we'll talk to you as soon as we can
hopefully maybe we'll see probably
tomorrow yeah or tweet at me here we go
tweet at us tweet at us ere we go we're
still gonna come back afterwards so we
can shut it down proper and here we go
for the recording of the podcast in
three two welcome to the 359 I'm Roger
Chang I'm Afra dang remember those old
choose your own adventure books
well netflix is bring that style
storytelling to kids videos
the first is Puss in Boots trapped in an
epic tale which debuts on the surface
today
Alfred you found those books back yeah I
actually read a lot of them for
goosebumps I died every time or there
was that one where I turned into a
seagull Wow yeah it was the one where
his shoes had like wings and then he
like kept floating in the air and then
I remember one that was based I read
more the general
choose-your-own-adventure building but
there was one time travel I remember I
kept getting stuck in this weird time
loop where I was that time leave I was
stuck like five minutes ahead of
everyone else so I would show up and
then like everyone would react to me
five minutes later and just kept going
like that oh I thought that's kind of
trippy for a kid if you think about I
thought it was a time loop where I just
kept turning you back to the same page
on page five go to page six go to page
four terrible loop that would be uh but
yeah that's an interesting thing because
Netflix is known for sort of yeah you
sort of you turn on whatever you want to
watch you just you Chuck your remote
because it just automatically plays that
this is sort of a big change for them
yeah I think they had an amateur version
of this on YouTube for a while where
because on YouTube you could do like
timestamps on videos yeah it would be
like choose-your-own-adventure videos
but on YouTube but I think Netflix is
trying to make this more of like a
professional like formal version yeah um
but yeah I guess with this case you
can't really binge on it anymore because
you just have to like oh I have to like
pay attention in this now exactly you
actually have to be fairly active and
you know allows you to sort of skip not
necessarily chapters but I guess their
their plot points that have branching
options for you I think it's smart to do
it with a like starting with like a
children's series first so it's kind of
like Dora the Explorer but you know
instead of like the dead blank stare
that she gives you is like you can
actually like interact with it so I
think I think it's really interesting I
think kids would like actually love this
thing totally
Joan Salzmann actually wrote the story
she asked Netflix about whether or not
you know man the high castle or house of
cards might get some sort of choose your
own adventure type alternate universe
take on it
Netflix was pretty mellow that they
didn't think that was actually going to
happen this is really sort of experiment
to see how it works for kids videos I
think you're right doing with kids
starting with kids on content is a
pretty smart movement alright next up
our own Derek Kerr has an exclusive on
frenemies we were in lift actually
partnering to lobby the Texas government
to get its way when Austin tried to
require fingerprint checks on
ride-sharing drivers the two companies
lobby together directly to the state
government who overrode the city's rules
become a blueprint for how companies
makes these companies may expand to
other market
it's interesting that you know when it's
they're both up against the government
they will come together on something
like this so this is actually also
happened in New York in 2015 when Mayor
Bill DeBlasio was trying to you know set
more limitations on uber and lyft not
get rid of them but in the same way that
the Texas government or the Austin
government was basically saying we you
know we want more identity we want more
regulations the same way that we have on
our taxi industry like they do in New
York right
uber and lyft were just saying no way
they got together for this too they
lobbied a lot of you know um state
officials and they put out like a huge
ad campaign like Ashton Kutcher tweeted
out about like in New York like well you
know we're laws but actually Kutcher
speaks we almost listen it's like he
doesn't like do that that often in here
alright so lastly we gotta get to the UN
is attempting to build a universal
digital ID however you wrote the story I
mean tell me more about this this
attempt this this project so last year
was their first ID 2020 summit and it
was basically the way to address the
issue going on with refugees yeah where
a lot of them didn't have their IDs on
them because they're fleeing from their
homes from like chaos and things like
that and then once they get to the
border they can't provide any
documentation proving who they are and
it would be turned around which tragic
so they wanted to come up with this
digital solution where you know they
could scan a QR code that's like on
their bracelet or they'd show an app if
they haven't have their phone on them
and things like that and now that goal
is expanded from like just refugees to
like they want to try to build this for
literally every human being on the
planet I think that's fascinating
because it's I mean one that would take
the hassle out of a lot of things like
travel Commerce I mean you're talking
about IDs that store education history
medical history getting a bank account
ever exactly getting health care in a
foreign country like having this ID
would be useful that said it's super
ambitious cuz I can't I can't see a lot
of you individual countries adopting
adoption is actually the hardest problem
right now yeah the tech isn't the issue
the issue is you know getting around all
the government paperwork right all right
we got to leave it that we're running
late so for more of those stories check
us out on CNET I'm Roger Cheng I'm
alfred Aang thanks for listening
so I have like one minute until you got
to run yeah and this is still again
mostly my fault because I got locked out
this morning I screwed everything up but
I think the cheesy adventure thing is
really cool as hell yeah I'm excited I
see how it works in principle or
practice I mean just hearing about it
seems really cool like I think it's
something I'd love my kid to watch when
he's older to watch videos if you like
it'd be great for kids I even if they
made an adult version of this though I
don't think I'd watch it just because
it's too interactive I wanna sit down
and I would watch what it yeah there's
that like if I watch a show I'm there
like binge watch something I mean like
think about like the old crush on
Netflix and chill this would totally
screw the game yeah uh um and but but
like the whole thing is if I want
storytelling interactively like I would
just play a video game that has a lot of
like immersive stories in it and like
you know I can actually do a lot more
than just watch what's going I can like
that sure this is sort of like watching
all the cinematics from a video game
with a couple like quick action but yeah
you know just choosing Lefter which was
actually an old arcade game I forgot the
name of it but yeah it's the it that
we're 3d one right the holographic yeah
something like that but remember the
game I remember the title but I mean
it's essentially QuickTime events which
after I spent the entire weekend playing
Shenmue oh yeah relevant to her interest
yes yeah so it's basically so he did it
he's totally yeah it feels like that
games have been going their way for a
long time I could stuff like heavy rain
yeah basically just interactive movies
now yeah I'm kind of astonished that
this hasn't happened sooner with the
advent of like I think it YouTube a
nanotech it has I mean YouTube
definitely has yeah a history of these
kinds of used you choose your own
adventure type storage structures I
think Netflix it's taken a while for
Netflix because obviously they've got a
huge base they they don't they want to
be a little conservative about this to
plant a little bit safer yeah kids
content this is dream DreamWorks license
stuff so obviously there's gonna be a
peel their production value yeah its
introduction this is from DreamWorks
yeah well it's like Puss in Boots is
this wreck yeah right put some boots and
put his puss and booties no no no no put
some this is licensed from yeah that's
what I was wondering
okay should have made a Shrek book come
on no what any questions we'll take one
or two I I wasn't really looking to be
on
that's all right I don't know I think a
lot of people are also kind of intrigued
by this concept of well that so it's out
today because you can actually check it
out oh it is Netflix i'm alessandra died
I don't think exception pretty sure
that's not an option this is a kids book
man or kids videos bumps is a kids book
like in Dark Souls ooh goose bumps was
dark for its time though like it's
surprising I wake it was like really
popular in the 90s I think was exactly
as dark as it needed to be
guess so all right let's edit let's wrap
it up yes sorry again everybody thanks
yeah with us thanks for joining us
regardless we'll be back in full force
