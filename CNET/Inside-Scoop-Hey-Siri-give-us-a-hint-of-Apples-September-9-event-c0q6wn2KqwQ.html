something big happening on sep tember
ninth hi guys and welcome to the inside
scoop I'm Lexus avedis from Cena joined
by brian Tong mr. Applewhite himself now
Apple invite September nine we have the
date we have also a hint by using Siri
to give us an idea of what's coming can
you get a hand no you may however get it
would want look deep within yourself and
you will find the answer especially on
sep tember 9 why don't you check a
rumors blog that's what I do so Brian
what are we going to expect from this
well I think the event you know all the
rumors and stories are really pointed to
definitely without a doubt this is a no
brainer iphone 6s 6s plus and without a
doubt I pulled Apple TV we probably
won't see the apple TV subscription
service based on the deals that Apple is
still trying to figure out that looks
like that's going to be pushed in the
next year I think there's a coin toss
here though with the iPad some people
are saying it's going to come out some
people saying it's not but if you packed
in iphones ipads and Apple TV into one
event that's going to be a lot of stuff
I would love it but I think it might be
smarter for them to spread it out
definitely in terms of some of the specs
that we're kind of seeing circulating
about this 6s we're seeing things like
4k camera resolution what else are we
getting from the new model supposedly
yeah everything points to really as a
phone this is going to get improvements
in a lot in different ways we're going
to get a faster processor and a 9
processor in it force touch technology
which we've seen in the Apple watch
where you can push on the screen and
give up some new functionality that is
expected to be in this phone also like
you said an improved camera so just
those three things alone three main
hardware features that's that's a big
deal already as well as a better chip
for broadband and LTE and what about
what updates can we see anything
significant there do you think well
really also we're expecting just for
Apple to officially announce that all
the operating systems watch OS to OS 10
and iOS 9 will be available for all
these all the different devices that's
just kind of a piggyback what happened
at WWDC so it won't be anything major
one of the features that might we might
see about the iphone success though is
kind of some of those cool
animated wallpapers that you see on the
Apple watch they are expected to be
coming to the iphone as well this year's
venue is slightly different from
previous Apple events it's happening at
the bill graham auditorium in San
Francisco previous events have been at
apple HQ or Moscone Center what do you
think this means well I think sometimes
we try to read so much into every small
move that Apple does I don't know if
it's going to really change anything
because in the past right Apple music
has already launched so just because
it's Bill Graham auditorium where we've
seen legendary axe doesn't mean that
it's going to be all about music we've
seen Kanye West John Mayer Tony Bennett
performed in all these different venues
if i had to guess who they bring out I'm
gonna go with weekend because you know I
can't feel my face how can you not love
that song if they bring that out that's
my guess but I don't know what people
think well stay tuned to seen it for all
of the latest on the apple event
happening on sep tember 9 of course
we'll have the scene at live stream
hosted by yours truly oh yeah and check
out cnet com for everything else Apple
related see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
