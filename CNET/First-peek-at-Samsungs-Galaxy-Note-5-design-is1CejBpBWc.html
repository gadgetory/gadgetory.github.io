your google issues it's everything
google that we can pack inside of a show
lots of news around the latest
smartphones and the biggest buzz is
around the samsung galaxy note5 this
week after on leaks revealed a video
with a rendering of the device from his
Foxconn sources now the note 5 will
still have a spot for its signature
stylist but it will take cues from the
s6 with curved glass panes on the front
and rear with a metal frame between them
the camera lens will also still be
protruding from the body now we're still
expecting an announcement sometime in
July on leaks also shared an image of
the cab design for the galaxy s6 edge+
with its 5.5 inch screen design that
aligns with the leaked images we've seen
of the purported device over the past
month or so and something is finally
being done about blow where on your
phone samsung an oppo are facing
lawsuits by the shanghai consumer rights
protection commission over their use of
pre-installed apps now in their study of
over 20 phones these preloaded apps were
not only found but also unremovable you
know what I'm talking about now
Samsung's Vegas offender the note 3 with
44 pre-installed apps out of the box and
a pose fine 7 a phone had 71 we'll see
how this all shakes out but it could be
a starting point to minimize bloatware
from every manufacturer which is a good
thing and in other phone news here's to
keep you things ambiguous but a less
ambiguous with the 1+2 phone CEO Peter
lau says the phone will cost less than
four hundred and fifty dollars after the
company earlier said it would cost more
than three hundred and twenty two
dollars so somewhere in between for the
base model thanks guys this marketing
strategy really just has to be a joke
right also evelyn's has released an
image of BlackBerry's latest android
based slider phone codename venice that
was reported by reuters last month the
assumption is this phone which looks
pretty sleek will slide up to reveal its
keyboard and if so it's still really
slim when you look at the USB port and
headphone jack on the bottom of this
image and there's a new kid on the block
take a look at the Turing phone built
from what they call a rev
Lucien ery liquid metal called liquid
morphine this phone is touted as being
stronger than titanium and steel it also
features end and mobile authentication
to keep your information and
communications locked away from third
parties with a 5.5 inch 1920 x 1080
display three gigs of ram and a 2.5
gigahertz quad-core snapdragon 801
processor now the company says it will
be available to pre-order on July the
31st also a Google device recently
passed through the FCC code named Gigi
one and the interwebs instantly thought
it was google glass but according to
reports it's believed that this version
is being referred to as the enterprise
edition or google glass eee if you
remember google glass explorer edition
was referred to as XE there's several
glass for work startups where the new
hardware is being tested for
applications including its video
streaming capabilities but it's
specifically targeting the workplace
right now internal images for the filing
are expected to be available to the
public on December twentieth of this
year so we should be able to get a good
glimpse probably before that time for
Google's latest glass iteration and
finally a Wall Street Journal report
says google is testing out their own
carpooling service for commuters in
Israel it's being offered through the
navigation app Waze and another one
called ride width in pairs commuters
looking for a ride to work or back home
from ride with with ways users going in
the same direction google says it's a
test pilot that's not competing with
uber but really a platform they're
building to enable local drivers to help
during busy commute hours and who knows
it might be an easy ways to find love
alright that's going to do for this we
show you can always email us at google
issues at cnet com or tweet me at brian
Tong thanks for watching it will see you
all next time for some more of that
delicious
