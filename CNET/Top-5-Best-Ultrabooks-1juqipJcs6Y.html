wholesale to smartphones and tablets all
of a sudden the notebook is red-hot
again or more precisely the Ultrabook
those machines that have forget about it
battery life instant on architecture
cases so slim you'll worry they're not
eating that's what I'm talking about
i'm brian coulis with CNET's top five
ultra books as of q1 2012 five machines
that might make you forget about some
laptop called the air or something like
that
number five Lenovo's IdeaPad u310 and
austere the lines are on this guy like a
piece of art compared to a 13-inch
MacBook Air it matches it pretty much
head for head costs a bit less though
and it also offers USB 3.0 HDMI even
Wireless external monitor support which
is kind of cool for a portable machine
but this is one of the earliest Windows
ultrabooks we tested so it ranks a
little lower than the ones that came
next like these number for the assist
Zen book UX 31 this one stands out for
great audio from its speakers I'm
looking at you MacBook Air it's got a
higher res screen than a 13-inch share
lots of ports and look so much like the
Apple product it ought to be embarrassed
we have found better trackpads however
and the keys a little shallow and kind
of mushy but it matches the top-end
macbook air for about a hundred less
MSRP number three Toshiba's portage a Z
835 the way we tested it this is sort of
to the MacBook Air as the Kindle Fire is
to the iPad which is to say a little
smaller and cheaper smaller in the sense
that the keyboards kind of cramped and
odd and cheaper and that it's 799 bucks
for our configuration that does have an
Intel Core i3 CPU bit of a give back
there but overall this one says so long
luxury tax on light and thin number two
the Dell XPS 13 this machine is almost
an optical illusion the body seems
barely large enough to contain a 13-inch
display but it does and the aluminum
magnesium and carbon fiber construction
makes you wonder if you've got
laptop or a Ferrari racecar great unique
design on this one as well but no HDMI
port like several others and battery
life is a little soft for this crowd
okay the number one machine in the
Ultrabook category that we are loving
right now is the HP folio 13 we gave it
a C net editors choice that's largely
because it succeeds on so many important
fronts you're gonna notice everyday
great battery life good keyboard lots of
ports a good trackpad as well great
display all in a sub $900 price point
now it's not so long on style frankly
kind of plain and a little thick around
the ankles but you can get your style
points somewhere else this is currently
the best of the bunch
for more top 5s like this head the top 5
dot cnet.com and for all our notebook
laptop and ultra book reviews they're
right there on the front door at
cnet.com i'm brian coulis thanks for
