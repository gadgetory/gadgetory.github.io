new MacBook Pro Apple and Microsoft
introduced new machines they hope will
revive the personal computer market
that's lost ground to smartphones and
tablets and they added a personal touch
now touch bar can do so many things to
help us as we use a MacBook Pro first it
replaces the standard system functions
were used to Apple's latest MacBook Pro
doesn't have a touch screen but a touch
bar it's a thin touch strip that reacts
based on the context of what you're
doing if you're in a MATLAB will give
you male commands if you're in a web
browser it'll show you the different
tabs you have open if it's things you
can reach out and touch and get to
without thinking too much about it I
think it could be useful
the MacBook Pro keeps the headphone jack
but replaces traditional ports with the
universal USB seaports you can do data
it can do video it can do power so you
really only need one type of plug in
your machine Microsoft Surface Studio
has a hinging monitor that folds down on
your desk we want you to be able to move
effortlessly between those perspectives
of drawing drafting up to typing it's
meant to turn your desk into a studio
the surface dial is a knob that controls
features and changes settings
manufacturers have been coming up with
new features to entice buyers they're
trying to enter the experience without
fundamentally changing it and ruining
what makes it so productive but
consumers are less willing to buy new
devices with incremental updates Apple's
quarterly earnings showed a slowdown in
iPhone sales take a lot of most exciting
things we're seeing right now in
technology or in computers we're seeing
things like full OLED displays obviously
virtual reality drives a lot of computer
sales the new MacBooks range from 1,500
to 2,400 dollars available in two weeks
the surface studio starts at three
thousand dollars and goes on sale in
December we think you are going to love
this new macbook pro
