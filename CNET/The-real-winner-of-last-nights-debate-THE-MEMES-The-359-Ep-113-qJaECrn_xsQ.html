27th Roger and Ben are both not with us
anymore far as they decided to stay home
today not with us so welcome to another
edition of the 359 podcast with Alfred
Inge and Michael Sorrentino good morning
fellas good morning I now kind of want
to cry as if they're gone but there by
I'm hoping that they're listening and
now they're ticked good morning it is
definitely a good morning glad to be
here uh you know the relay team yeah so
we've got a great show for you guys
today if you watch the presidential
debate from last night you're in for a
real treat and a big happy birthday to
Google but I guess apparently doesn't
know when its birthday is so we're gonna
find out today do a little scoop little
snoop looking around it's the big
mystery alrighty you can't also you know
you can also google when google's
birthday is but i don't think anyone
there has done that yet hey i mean it is
google so maybe they just whenever the
hell they feel like maybe tuesday's just
a better day for them for some reason
not friday like most people yeah
probably all right shall we get this
underway yep let's record a podcast and
we'll be back to join you all in the
chaps we want to know what you think of
the means what you think of the new OS
and we'll be back in exactly three
minutes and 59 seconds from 32 welcome
to the 359 where we talk about the top
tech news of the day and all the other
crap you want to throw in I'm Alfred
ring and i'm mike sorrentino did you
watch the presidential debate on Monday
night an estimated a 112 million people
did the political showdown between
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump set
social media ablaze with memes mentions
in fact checked articles both Clinton
and Trump's names alone were getting a
combined three million total mentions
and that's just on Twitter so were you
following along on social media yeah i
was watching on TV on a plane ride home
last night and was just as great as
watching a wrestling match because there
was just lots and lots of argue argue
argue argue argue and that's all like to
me so did you have any favorite moments
from it or any favorite kind of memes
that were popping up there was there was
a 400-pound hacker that Donna
said was from Russia the cyber which is
I guess his term for what the internet
is now you know at his tweet denying
climate change and of course his
sniffles throughout the night if this is
the only thing I remembered be honest
this is like every couple of minutes if
that even came out of the microphones
know so much sniffling what if we did
the entire podcast just that oh gosh I
think we'd lose everybody cuz they be
like breathing all these all the hairs
breathing well or change the name the
fresh air well let's listen that's
another thing entirely I'm sorry so
let's shift in from that Andromeda
Google is rumored to combine its Android
mobile OS with its Chrome OS under the
new name Andromeda which could
potentially be on a new pixel laptop and
a nexus tablet uh what do you think of
that do you think they should have
stayed a party and thank you know
they're better together that's kind of
how many google google OS as they have
there's android android wear Chrome OS
Android Chrome OS and Android seem to be
merging more everyday Chrome Android
apps are coming to Chromebooks
eventually it sort of makes sense i
think that they're going to combine
eventually it has been more a matter of
when not so much will they I mean do you
think that you know people would would
be annoyed from the different features
oh do you think it's better that you
know we just combine them now if they
could find a way to sort of bridge it
over people might not even notice they
might just think Oh cheap laptop and it
runs my web browser and my apps I'm good
how similar already are Android and
Chrome OS there it's Chrome OS is just
like having the Chrome browser on your
computer and that's it you could look up
your websites you could check out apps
and then Android is more the phone
experience so ideally if they were to
merge it over it would be kind of more
like having those android apps natively
on the computer Chromebook as if it were
computer programs um I'm personally
looking forward to it i think you know
it's about time they have a unified you
know system or network and you know with
across all its devices it'd be nice to
like buy a nap it's somewhat but bridge
from that be nice by a nap and it would
just run on everything that i happen to
be using not like buy this game on steam
in this game again on chrome on google
play and then one more on iOS if i have
an ipad like it's one thing would be
easier and speaking of Google when is
its actual birthday
google doodle if you noticed it today
its celebrating its 18th birthday but
it's never been on September 15th when
the google com register was domained and
it's also never been on September fourth
when you know Google was incorporated as
a company so I guess the question is
when is Google's real birthday because
it's it's been on September 27th which
is today it's been on September 26 in
the past and in previous years it's been
on September seventh in September eighth
but they're really they're 18 right yes
okay so that part is accurate yeah so
Google can vote maybe and in three more
years maybe they'll drink in their
doodle in America in the in the rest of
the world your google will be legal I
presume yeah well that's our show thanks
for listening you can check us out on
itunes what else are we got there
stitcher stitcher do you want his go
ahead itunes stitcher feedly tune in and
oh man now even I forgot it's not slack
radio we talked about this yesterday and
youtube for a longer version yeah right
either way let's wrap it up alright
thanks for listening I'm Alfred a I Mike
Sorrentino and we will delve into the
chat shortly but I just kind of want to
go back onto the google doodle thing
they really can do whatever they want i
don't know like can we really even
criticize them cuz they'll just be like
okay fine no internet just decide when
your birthday is it's just you know i
mean you can do it on a on facebook you
can change your birthday whatever and
then just repin all the happy birthday
posts but you know that's your facebook
that's your personal choice but you
can't just tell people hey it's my
birthday today when it's not that's as
weird it's it's marketing though like
maybe the for some reason they feel like
tuesday will be the day yet they're
choosing to bury their birthday
underneath the morning after the debates
which is an odd decision I mean let's be
honest if Google made some big splash
following the debate they probably still
lead the news well yeah everyone's going
to go on their website regardless I just
I just want to know when it's real
birthday what is where's the Google
birth certificate the Google affected
long
Google by mean if you think about it
though with the way the internet was in
early 90s all those this probably is no
real birthday either because it probably
took weeks to sort of even get their
server lunged and they mounted maybe
they don't even consider a server launch
day as the day which Google was born
yeah but if they're picking a day though
if they're gonna pick September 27th
they could at least stick to that yeah
you know I mean the September what like
26 last year when was the date on it my
birthday my birthday is October 24th
just saying does anybody actually
celebrate the birthday on the actual day
though I mean usually you're like oh no
there's better specials at the bar well
yeah for humans it's mostly like rounded
out to the better day of the week so
maybe that maybe that's it you know
they're picking the better day to
celebrate a Tuesday yeah yeah that's
helpful uh where did everybody watch the
debate last night I did the YouTube
stream and it was iffy I had a lot of
connection problems and hiccup problems
granite I was trying to chromecast it to
my TV but there was a lot of bouncing
around a lot of lag and what the heck
was going on with the audio did anyone
else experienced that what what stream
were you watching it on though like what
yeah the NBC Oh the NBC NBC News all I
know is like every couple of minutes
like the audio would spike and dip like
like a full 6 decibels and it was just
very very distracting to me coming from
like a production background so when
it's jumping around like that I'm just
criticizing the sound guy I'm not even
paying attention to issues i was
watching on a plane last night so i
thought that that was just my static
from using a i was flying southwest and
i was just using whatever way they allow
TV through with a free Wi-Fi it right
work and so I thought that would just be
a static thing but like if that
experience and other platforms that's
like interesting I was watching it on
two platforms so I had it up on my
laptop on mute because it it's about 15
to 45 seconds behind what's on TV and
then I had the audio on on that because
I was waiting for any time there was a
good moment or a good quote that came
from it mm-hmm I could pop it up on my
laptop and I
unmute it so I could get either the
video clip or be able to get a
screenshot from it and then tweet it out
yeah so I wasn't really listening on my
laptop screen but as far as audio from
my TV stream it was perfectly fine hmm
like it never completely fell out but it
was just very distracting how much it
would change and range and it was never
it's like oh no there's something wrong
with Trump's mic or something like that
it was just all over the place it is
frustrating though that the streams
online are a bit behind because you can
tell you know what screams people are
watching just based off of like when
they're tweeting out a moment yeah oh
yeah yeah Leonard our chat said he
watched on Twitter and he found it
perfect I tried Twitter for a little bit
um only I started running out of data on
my personal data plans and stopped
immediately but it did work apply pretty
quickly I said a hard time figuring out
where I types in search for debate and
then it came up under Bloomberg I didn't
really know where exactly to find the
street well usually when they do streams
like that you find it in the moments tab
oh yeah that's what they did with the
football game last week to two weeks ago
I forget already but that's what you
find stuff like that don't promote the
hell out of it right in the front
instead of like invading your personal
space which i think is kind of nice on
Twitter's behalf and from an
organizational standpoint facebook I had
a hard time tracking it down because
they don't have anything dedicated like
that I was kind of waiting for it to be
advertised to me and it didn't happen so
that's why I defaulted to YouTube you
just go to the live page on there and of
course there's like you know a zillion
options at the top from all the legit
ones do the less legit ones yeah
interestingly enough if you actually
went on Donald Trump's website he had a
live stream of the debate on it it did
not go to a legitimate a stream no
really did it did not best send him more
sarcastic than I intended it where did
he pick it up from um it was it wasn't
any of the major channels um I can find
it again in a bit but it was like right
wing does something media or something
like that I got to find it now so it can
stitch you it yes yeah pretty much fair
enough I don't know it up and down for a
little while but eventually I got NBC
needs to work out for me but I know PBS
querida as well ABC all in all I thought
it was well
produced outside of the audio issues I
did kind of sympathize for poor Lester
though I wonder if I did not envy him
last night it's a tough job and then
they tell me to you can't fact check
live right either which you know okay
cool i'm just gonna sit here and accept
this then but NPR was fact-checking life
everyone thought was a really cool
feature on the site though did anyone
else see that but they had a fact check
live somebody was live transcribing
every gum every speech and then they'd
go and then annotate it in real and are
the article yeah yeah bloomberg
Bloomberg was live did they do have a
fact-checking too and they were they
announced that they were doing it on the
Twitter stream yeah I don't I didn't
watch it on the Twitter stream so i
don't know if they did or not but they
said they were going to see in the realm
of like cool stuff that technology can
actually better I'm all in favor of
stuff like that no matter what your side
what your perspective is that is a great
thing to see in happening in real time
like that because you can never get that
in a traditional television broadcast
setting maybe barely in a radio setting
but definitely with this the
incorporation of multimedia tech and and
text more importantly that was really
cool to see cuz i saw screenshots of
another live stream where it basically
be approval ratings of the candidates
like in real time as there's talking
really and what were they measuring that
against though were people like in an
online poll scenario I'd only seen a
screenshot of it like on Twitter there
was so much content going through
Twitter yesterday that it was just it
was almost impossible to keep up i had
to put a filter on it that like unless
they got more than 20 favorites like I
wouldn't see it favorites i what am I
saying likes likes yeah was that I am
surprised there wasn't any I feel like
true candidates are becoming gift
trained or jiff trained but there wasn't
really any moment I felt like was really
motion-based that could create a gift
jiff meme plenty of words and sounds
obviously but not like I would have
maybe someone like dancing around even
like Bernie Sanders would pull off like
quick like here's some quick thing on
the podium that he did it became a
motion noble thing and I'm I don't I
guess I'm kind of looking for that now
because that's sort of way
now is that where we've gone like we
used to be you shoot to be quotable now
you're me mobile or giftable yeah
whatever i did it i mean the Donald
Trump campaign bought that fill a filter
yesterday yeah advertising hit hit the
debate last night and this pride is more
and more like people just buying
wherever the eyes are at the moment yeah
one of the interesting things that I had
seen on snapchat last night was everyone
was doing the face filters on their TV
screens of the debates yeah I Mc Donald
Trump and Hillary with the dog knows
haha filters why oh god why and
surprised we didn't see the entire
Hofstra auditorium turn around for a
selfie yeah um I had seen several tweets
yesterday from like reporters that were
there at the scene just you know a lot
of people yelling about Harambee there
so this is a very meme heavy election
we're in a very meme Heavyworld it yes
it's fun but sometimes it got to take it
a little more seriously imagine baby
just a little and those reporters are
potentially pay I remember it was a
store yesterday or some of the Wi-Fi
Heather same dollars to be on the Wi-Fi
at all pill reporter yeah I still have
to confirm that with some people that I
knew that were there okay but I had seen
screenshots also of it that's what it's
so absurd and apparently they were also
cutting down on reporters that had their
own personal hot spots you know kind of
no pay us to use our Wi-Fi it was just
that seems unnecessary yeah two hundred
dollars for a night of Wi-Fi is a little
bit ridiculous to I would I honestly
would rather just file from my phone how
was the case let's let's go to the
elephant in the room the 400-pound
hacker shot that he took at every single
potential member of geek culture that
was that was hurtful Donald he was also
hurtful he was also in his bed that
lacquer is supposed you know because
they also can't get out of can't get out
of their beds either in front in their
mom's basement right because we're all
just yeah and it's illicit images from
that the world of warcraft player from
oh okay so that means flying everywhere
like within seconds I i went with graham
the guy
who's this who's designed to survive car
crashes from Australia yeah yeah yeah
the block head dude with like eight
different like nipples like that's what
I were with that's my vision of the
hacker yeah that sounds about right well
maybe we'll get away from that we're not
trying to show of politics down anyone
show but it was a big monumental event
to experience and seeing how it gets
incorporated into multimedia social
media and two to go yeah yeah well I'll
up I don't think the vice-presidential
one will be that big though I mean Mike
Pence and Tim Kaine to not that me
mobile well yet this could be a whole
new era and then one more there's the
least be one more Donald Trump Hillary
what yeah that one uh ya know the VP's I
don't it might be a little Celine Dion
before we let everyone go let's uh let's
delve a little deeper into the OS hybrid
Alfred could you enlighten us a little
bit more some people are interested
about it in the chat well it's still all
rumors right now but I mean they'd been
talking about the Andromeda OS for some
time now rumors had been swirling for a
while this is just kind of the most
concrete that we've gone as far as the
Android Chrome OS hybrid I did see a
question earlier wondering if it would
be replacing it I think for their future
devices they most likely will be I think
you know your device that you have on
you right now is going to be fine but I
also believe that more so headed toward
you know its tablets and you know
Chromebooks I don't I think phones might
not be affected as much from Andromeda I
think it's kind of like that situation
when they had a few years ago when there
was Android Honeycomb meant for tablets
only yeah and then Android Ice Cream
Sandwich was then from that point on
phones and tablets I think they're going
to slowly just sort of transition it in
and I think like beginning with those
the Chromebooks that will allow android
apps under the existing Chrome OS and
then they'll take a step further and
it'll just be one thing yeah I'm hoping
that they're going to be talking about
it at their October fourth media event
but I think that one is more
specifically for their new
phones Google home and chromecast yeah
so you can expect more news about this
closer to its release around the end of
2017 though I'm definitely interested
like this could be a new opportunity for
Google to get into this market a little
more strongly being that it could be
argued one way or another the Apple may
have slipped up with their latest
release not bad just disclaiming but I
mean I'm personally interested
especially in this new alleged google
phone and if this really kind of becomes
an all-encompassing thing they might buy
me out I I've always wanted you know
just a unified ecosystem I mean Apple
does it pretty well with its OS and iOS
you know compatibility but androids been
missing that for some time but I mean
you can make the argument that you know
you didn't really need it on your laptop
by other way because it's connected to
all your google accounts mm-hmm so you
know I do something on my calendar here
i would use calendar on google either
way right and you know gmail all just
everything within the google ecosystems
already can connect it but now they're
adding an OS element to it which I'm I'm
looking forward to seeing and I mean I
personally like the way chrome performs
better than an apple TV and that's a
very personal experience so put this all
under the same hood I've actually never
used apple TV but I am very satisfied
with my chromecast and I can compare it
I guess with my Roku's right yeah I have
Scott in the chat says I think it will
be similar to how windows 10 mobile and
pc he hopes i think i think that's a
good hope i don't know how similar it
would be but I it's a fair assumption
yeah if it could flip like have maybe
more of a desktop style thing well if
it's if they know there's a keyboard
attached to flip into tablet mode and
there's a no keyboard or anymore because
there is definitely like different
screen it's definitely different screen
displays at work when you're using a
typing machine versus a touch only
machine versus tiny phone touch only
machine it definitely is a bit weird
that now that Windows 10 is kind of
leading you know the market on this this
kind of thing and you know Android is
one that will release Google is the one
that needs to follow on it
I mean Google's own their own semblance
of everybody's soul for a time being and
yes this is a part where they have been
weaker they've more or less floundered
so this would be interesting to see them
kind of take advantage of some weak
points in the other markets and then the
next thing I just wonder is not even
tech related at all just what suite with
a code name maybe this minor update with
maybe they just call it birthday cake
these are not celebrating it otherwise
they don't even know when their
birthdays are not gonna get in a cake
that's probably a good place to leave it
off we'll wrap it up for today yep all
righty Alfred let's say goodbye all
right thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
