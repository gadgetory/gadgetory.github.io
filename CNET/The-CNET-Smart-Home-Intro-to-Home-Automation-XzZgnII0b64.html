covers a lot of different devices that
do a lot of different things but when I
talk about home automation I'm talking
specifically about the tech in your home
that you can program to act
automatically on your behalf whether
that's for a convenience or security or
entertainment or something else
altogether
is entirely up to you so how do you get
started with home automation and more
importantly how do you find the right
gadgets for your living space you've got
a lot of options at this point including
smart lights like these that turn on
automatically as soon as they see you
walk into the room you've got connected
kitchen gadgets like this beam or coffee
brewer that can whip up a cup of java
automatically in the morning you've got
smart shades like these from Lutron that
can rise and fall with the Sun to help
let a little bit of extra light in
you've got connected ceiling fans that
look luxurious and sync up with your
smart thermostat in order to help save
energies you've even got a lot of
connected entertainment gadgets now that
can make for a better TV watching
experience it can all get a little bit
overwhelming so my advice is to start
small and find a gadget that you like
and understand once you've gotten used
to using it in your home it's a lot
easier to find gadgets that are
complementary and that can make it
smarter this $35 Belkin Wemo mini switch
is a great example it's very affordable
and it can automate anything that you
plug into it say this lamp for instance
once you've figured out what you like
about it and how you use it in your home
you can add motion sensors or contact
sensors or other third-party services
that make it even smarter there are
plenty of other good starting points too
maybe you're really interested in voice
control so start with an Amazon echo or
a Google home smart speaker then expand
your set up by adding compatible gadgets
that those speakers can work with of
course you'll want to be mindful to keep
things secure as you add cloud connected
gadgets to your home I recommend
sticking to established brands with good
track records of taking your security
seriously avoid products like cheap
Wi-Fi cameras that come with default
passwords and if you're really concerned
about security look for products like
this nest cam that require you to scan a
product specific code during setup for
