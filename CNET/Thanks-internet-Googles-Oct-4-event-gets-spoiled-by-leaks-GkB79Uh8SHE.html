welcome to Google inches for everything
Google you can think of all the big
Google leaks from last week dropped
right after you posted our show so we're
gonna have to play a little catch-up
like that's what happens with the weekly
show so I'm sorry all but let's get up
to speed now you can basically thank
droid life for spilling all the beans
with crystal-clear images and new
details for Google's October 4th event
now if you don't want to see this you
really should just stop watching right
now so first up the pixel 2 will come in
three colors just black clearly white
and an all new kind of blue because that
sounded better than calling it
periwinkle and yes I know my colors now
it will come in 64 gigs and 128 gig
options and priced at 649 and 749 as for
the big boy the pixel 2 XL will come in
just black or the black and white combo
that they should have just called panda
panda panda panda I know you know that
now it will also come in 64 gigs and 128
options price at 8:49 and 949 up next
from droid life the Google home Mini
their answer to the Amazon echo dot it
will be priced at $49.90 seen by Google
describes it as a media streaming device
that has 2.4 and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi
support with Bluetooth le as well
alright a new Google daydream will also
make an appearance with similar colors
in charcoal fog and coral with a more
streamlined design we'll be using a
finer nylon type mesh material it will
include the controller and retail for
$99 $20 more than the current daydream
and we expect some new tech in there as
well and guess what droid life isn't
done yet dropping another bomb with the
new Google pixel book now Google looks
to embrace the pixel branding moving
forward it will come in silver with 128
256 and 512 gig storage options starting
at 1100
$49 now this Google pixel book will be
able to fold into a tablet and support
its own pixel book pen for 99 bucks
that's pressure sensitive with tilt
support like I didn't see that one
coming at all for this keynote Android
life just spoiled it all but you know
what that's just how it is these days
it's going to be a hefty announcement
but we'll get more details soon so stay
tuned for October the 4th now the latest
google app beta is rolling out and
reveals new features for the google
assistant but the rumored squeezable
frame of the pixel 2 looks like it's
getting a confirmation with a feature
called active edge now we've seen this
functionality first from a TC su 11
phone but squeezing the frame will allow
you to do things like squeeze for your
assistant in fact Google liked it so
much that they recently announced the
roughly 2000 HTC employees who worked on
the pixel will be joining alphabets
hardware division moving forward in a
deal valued at one point 1 billion
dollars now HTC will still run its own
smartphone business but this move was
for talent to allow Google to continue
its path of controlling its own software
and hardware Lala Apple alright nest is
up next whose parent company is the goog
they also dropped a whole bunch of toys
last week with most of them aimed at
home security now the new one is their
nest hello a video doorbell that's
basically a nest cam for your front door
a back door that's the answer to the
popular ring doorbell it looks nice and
compact and will be available in 2018
with no pricing just yet
now nest also introduced their own
modular home security system called nest
secure with a central hub called the
nest guard and a variety of sensors and
even a tag that can arm or disarm the
system as you come and go now the
starter pack costs $4.99 and ships in
November plus there's a new nest
thermostat II that has most of the
functionality of the current line but
comes in a more affordable one $69
package with a frosted plastic design
and if you're still looking for tech
fashion that you would actually want to
rock Levi's and Google are finally
releasing the Levi's commuter truck or
formerly known as project jacquard that
allows you to swipe and tap on the left
cuff of the jacket to control your
smartphone for both Android or iOS now
it will be priced at $350 and available
in only a few stores this week with a
wider rollout and online
sales at Levi's calm on October the
second now I'm gonna check it out
is it overkill maybe and it's really for
commuters or people who want you know an
expensive fancy denim jacket as long as
they make one in a man small or
children's large I'll give it a shot all
right that's gonna do for this week you
can email me at Google is just at
cnet.com or tweet me at Brian Tong
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
you all next time for some more of that
