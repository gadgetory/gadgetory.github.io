i'm joined by cnet editors dan ackerman
and scott stein the three of us are
headed out to e3 2012 next week let's
jump right in there's three major press
conferences that start III 2012 first up
is Microsoft so Dan what do you think
we're going to see from Microsoft at e3
microsoft usually goes first with big
press conferences kind of sets the tone
and they have to have two kinds of years
they do some years it's big hardware
maybe it's the Kinect maybe it's a new
slim xbox and other years or software
years where they just had some big games
like a new halo game or Gears of War 3
or something like that to rely on yeah
I'm going to say this looks like a
software year halo 4 is a big game
beyond that I'm sure life a new forts a
game if you're interested in that if
they start the press conference with
black ops 2 i'm not going to be a happy
man though because that's how they did
it last year's 20 minutes and they just
showed exam in a demo you saw over and
over again everywhere you went and not
only that it's a game that's going to be
available on another platform so stay
exclusive Microsoft is what I guess the
takeaway is right let's move to Nintendo
real quick there's no problem being
exclusive they do is right they've made
it that way with their Hardware you have
a a 3d glasses free 3d handheld with two
screens yeah that's pretty exclusive as
far as the games you put on it and then
you know the wii u was shown last year
in a very preliminary form sure actual
games just a lot of software demos that
thing's got its own kind of tablet like
second screen and who knows really what
that may and hardware box looks like or
or what the graphics capabilities are
truly going to be so that's really going
to be the coming out party here is what
is the wii u what will the release date
be will we see the launch games for it
finally and can it be maybe more than a
middling debut because i think right now
the expectations are really pretty low
right and there's a sense that nintendo
has jumped the shark that nobody's
really talking about that we anymore is
the we really good brand nature and can
they recapture that can they make that
box compelling is the price going to be
interesting is this can they recapture
the casual gaming crowd that Apple seems
to have taken but if that genius having
low expectations have they actually
exactly the right thing and set that bar
low a terminal echo the we was just a
fluke they actually don't know what
they're doing well attention because all
along the 3d s you know we think of as a
failure but actually the sales numbers
have been steadily increasing right it's
doing well and they're generating
profits on the systems and the games and
it's it's not a TS like success but
right I wonder if there's a could be a
maybe slow rebuilding all right time to
move to Sony what is Sony going to do I
think it's safe to say that the move is
sort of dead in the water I would be a
little shocked to see if they came out
and was like satiation move for wait to
for your arm your leg or your legs and
that's it I guess what Sony needs to do
is sort of reestablish themselves as the
software powerhouse come up with maybe
exclusives like what Microsoft should do
I think they're going to show stuff like
the new god of war game they'll probably
show the new Naughty Dog game the last
of us that new zombie game yeah i mean
and i also think solidifying themselves
as the content provider that Microsoft
has been able to do with all of their
multimedia platforms and portals and
whatnot so so many sort of has their
work cut out for them too but this is
the company that makes the TVs and the
stereo systems and they make computers
should they make tablets and they make
phones and even gaming phones now and
the game console and they co-invented
blu-ray you'd think if anybody could
knit all these things together neatly it
would be Sony but they've had a really
rough couple of years even outside of
the gaming industry for sure outside of
their consoles I mean let's be honest
going on they're really not doing that
well I mean I don't know anyone who owns
a sony tablet I don't know anyone who
bought that sony 3d playstation
television it's a tough marriage to
combine all of those properties together
it's not going to be easy let's move
away from the console manufacturers
maybe get into more specific games do
you guys have a specific game that you
are losing your mind that you can't wait
to see v3 absolutely not all right not
at all stunning how a few games I'm
excited about it this c3 does sort of
have the hype meter at kicking level
when I o Shah checked out so did I yeah
there's not going to be metal gear right
that won't be around which is something
that people have been marginally excited
about I'm excited to see maybe something
about the Last Guardian you guys are
okay Jeremy fun se didn't have it at all
waiting yeah I know and it's it's
frustrating that it seemed great I'm
hoping there's some new product and by
that I mean maybe not even hardware but
something a new concept a new idea
usually they tend to do like a two-year
tease so you remember like connect you
know the year before it was project in
the towel and that was the year early
they didn't really have anything to
announce just this is going to show up
in a future means that you show that and
then the next year you show the product
so maybe we'll get that you didn't even
mention connect and that's kind of
telling in a way that it didn't even
occur to us to bring this out there
because there's no reason to bring it up
that ship has sailed all right so
hopefully things will work out better
than we're anticipating right now
hopefully but you can head over to e3
cnet.com for all of our e3 2012 coverage
the three of us will be out there along
with some of our San Francisco friends
and we'll see you there thanks for
tuning in for Dan and Scott I'm Jeff
Bakalar will see you guys in Los Angeles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
