com they were take a first look at the
beyond etec duet d8 this phone is
similar to the duet d 888 which we
looked at a little while ago and that it
is a dual sim card phone so that means
you can put two SIM cards in here from
two different carriers if you want and
actually get two different numbers on
the phone this is useful for a couple
scenarios perhaps if you want a phone
that will work for business and for
personal use you can put both numbers on
the same phone and keep the number
separate keep the message is separate
you can also use this if you travel
overseas you can keep your US sim in
here you can get a prepaid sim in
whatever country you're traveling in and
get calls from both numbers so that
functionality still is pretty rare in
the United States it is more common
especially in phones from Asia it is a
touchscreen phone not a great touch
screen though not the best graphics and
resolution for photos but should be fine
for most things does look a little bit
like the iPhone in some senses at least
the basic shape but your notes down
below you actually have a lot more
controls you have a toggle in an ok
button here in the middle to talk he's
one for each line an end power key to
soft keys and then a dedicated button
for your music player here on the side
is just a volume rocker over here you'll
have the camera with a couple of
speakers the SIM card both the sim card
slots and the memory card slot are
located behind the batteries so how to
remove that to get those out menu system
is icon-based pretty easy to navigate
and understand some of the menus in the
phone are a little frustrating though
very much like the duet dat you can find
things but they're just a lot of steps
to get to where you want to go touch
screen is a little clunky you really
have to press down firmly and it isn't
always accurate either phone does have
an FM radio if see there's an antenna
down here at the bottom a little unusual
you don't see that much anymore the
phone is gsm quadband so will work in
many countries around the world really
that attraction is the dual SIM card
slot like i said but i think you can
find that functionality and more do wed
phones that aren't so difficult to use
i'm kent german and this is the duet d
hahaha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
