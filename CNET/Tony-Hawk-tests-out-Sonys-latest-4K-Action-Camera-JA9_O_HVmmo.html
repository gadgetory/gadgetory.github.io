cam for the active enthusiast the
adventurer and the mobile content
creator or the mom and dad in the moment
our light and compact 4k model has four
times more resolution than Full HD and
now it offers shootin capability at a
high bitrate of 100 megabits per second
while delivering 4k images with
exceptional realism additionally when
you capture a full HD video with this 4k
action cam the steady shot function
enables outstanding image stabilization
three times more effective than the
previous model and what this does it has
allows users to capture high quality
movies movies during surfing cycling
skateboarding and fast moving actions of
all types in fact sports legend Tony
Hawk spent a little bit of time with our
new 4k action cam and sent us some
recent footage so let's please take a
look at the footage what's up I'm Tony
and I just got the new sony 4k action
camp and
pretty major trips coming up I think I'm
more excited about the cameras at this
point than the actual trips but I'm
gonna document them well and here we are
mammoth mountain day one Bluebird are
you serious
check it out
lazier Monto and she's
ladies and gentlemen please welcome Tony
Hawk
so Tony let me just actually a couple
questions about the sony action cam and
then we'll get we'll get the 4k but it
wasn't long ago that you know to capture
a video actually you couldn't capture a
video in 4k like that but it wasn't long
ago to capture video like that you would
need a crew you need tripod you need
multiple people with cameras now with
the sony action cam it seems it's become
more personal so how's that helped you
are creative you know we it's it's now
we can take the cameras for granted it
used to be so clunky and it was a
process and if you were trying to
actually shoot yourself you get this
giant lens and you couldn't very do some
of your better tricks and things like
that and it was just more of a
compromise and now it's seamless and you
turn this on you hit the button and you
know that the exposures right you know
that everything's gonna work out and you
take it for granted and you literally
strap it to your skateboard and it's
really changed the way that I view how
we video everything so let me ask you a
little bit about shooting in 4k so
you're always doing something fast and
now we can capture four times resolution
in the pide definition and a whole lot
more data so how is how has that helped
in your crap and how is technology
helping capture more of what you want
the audience to see it puts them right
in the POV you know the way that we use
it the way that we use the selfie sticks
the way that we put it on our equipment
it doesn't interfere with what we're
actually doing so we can do their best
stuff and put you right in the center of
the action and with the 4k the clarity
is unbelievable I mean I had a blast
with those cameras for the first couple
weeks and and in shows let me ask you
also about I don't even want to call it
the form factor but you know from a
style in design it's it's sleek it's
trend-setting but it also gives you a
convenience I would think it gives you
convenience and flexibility as an expert
to do different things like you said you
know mount it to the bottom of your
skateboard yeah that was day one
actually when I got my first mini
putting on my skateboard and it's
intuitive too I mean you know the way
the way that it you can hold it you hit
the button right away and it starts from
core I mean immediately starts recording
which is a huge bonus for what I do and
you know I've never I've never been able
to get shots like that before and I
actually have shots of my board from
underneath and learning new tricks and
things like that it's it's been it's
been a fun journey that's a pretty
amazing invention right there I wouldn't
recommend that to everyone because when
it goes wrong it goes really bad yeah
Tony thanks for joining us thanks for
being here great video ladies and
gentlemen the legend Tony Hawk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
