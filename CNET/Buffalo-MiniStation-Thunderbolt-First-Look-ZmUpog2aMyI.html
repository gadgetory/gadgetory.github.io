very special today to show you the
buffalo ministation Thunderball now this
is the very first thunderball drive on
the market that's also support USB 3.0
now Thunder bone is not new and you
speed through prego is not new either
but when the two of them are put on the
same storage device that is totally new
that means you can use a drive here with
any Thunderbolt edible computer or any
computer at all with the USB port now
another thing knew about the Buffalo is
the fact that it comes included with a
short Thunderbolt able now to dry it use
this cable for both data and power which
means it will need a separate power
adapter it works the same with is USB
cable which is also included this is the
micro SP three pointer and work with it
micro USB port now the buffalo requires
only one cable to be plug in and ate ham
to work but if you happen to plug it
into a computer using both cable at the
same time you're not gonna destroy it it
only works with whatever you plug in
first the buffer dry is very
good-looking with aluminum casing on the
bottom and very slick plastic on the top
the drive film solid and actually look
expensive like many other apple products
the good news is the buffalo actually
very affordable for a thunderbolt drive
costing some two hundred dollars for 500
gig or two to four dollars for one
terabyte the dry is formatted for mac
but can also be reformatted to use
window for now is the only Thunder bone
dry on the market that you can use also
with non Thunderball computers for more
information is perform and check out the
food with ESL calm once again my name is
dumb go and it has been the very fast
look at the buffalo ministation
Thunderbolt drive
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
