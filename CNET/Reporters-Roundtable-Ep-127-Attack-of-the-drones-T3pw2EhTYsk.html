roundtable I am Rafe Needleman in San
Francisco and today on the show it's
drones under the Christmas tree in the
deadly skies over Afghanistan soon
perhaps replacing traffic helicopters
unmanned aerial drones are showing up
everywhere a combination of
technological advancement and necessity
has led to the creation of
military-grade unmanned flying vehicles
all most affordable toy grade
quadcopters and a growing commercial
hobbyist industry in between to build
new increasingly cheap and increasingly
smart robotic flying vehicles of course
we're all familiar with the stories of
remote-controlled drone airplanes that
perform reconnaissance and increasingly
carry lethal weapons for our armed
forces these drones are primarily
remote-controlled but many have a
measure of smarts that enables them to
fly parts of their missions with
complete autonomy how smart can flying
robots get just ask your neighbor the
geek he or she may be one of the tens of
thousands of community members of DIY
drones working on improving the state of
the art of the autonomous aerial drone
using open-source hardware like the
arduino microcontroller and the
quadcopter architecture that's becoming
ubiquitous what are the privacy and
legal implications of a world in which
governments businesses and private
citizens can buy or build smart and
perhaps silent reconnaissance vehicles
welcome to the future it's being built
today okay so for this great topic which
I'm really really excited to do today we
have two great guests that I bet you
have heard of first they're both here in
the studio with us first chris anderson
who is the editor-in-chief of Wired
magazine perhaps you've seen this issue
here come the drones he is also the
founder of DIY drones the community site
of people who are building these things
and of 3d robotics the manufacturing arm
of that community Chris thanks for
coming in thanks good beer also joining
us Daniel Suarez who is the author of
this book kill decision a thriller which
I highly recommend
this is a book about Chris's drones gone
bad oh not not specifically but yes
drones ganda drones gone evil and is a
really really fun read Daniel is also
the author of demon and freedom to other
great techno thrillers that I highly
recommend before that he was a systems
analyst so he knows of which he speaks
thank you for coming in thanks for
having me um well we've got just a ton
of things to talk about now I want to
start with this about a year ago on
right after we took out bin Laden we did
a show with wired Danger Room writer
Spencer Ackerman on the role of the
unmanned vehicle in in that particular
campaign and in the military overall
that was may of last was it was it last
year yeah it was last year um what has
changed in the world of the unmanned and
autonomous vehicle since then and I used
those words separately because I know
you have a point of view on that yeah
well you know this is like technology of
any sort which is to say that it starts
with big companies in the military the
internet started that way mainframe
started that way computers in general
and then and you pay attention to that
you think that's the only way it can
happen then and then slowly and quietly
in the undergrowth the hobbyists and the
home brewers and the hackers start
fiddling with it and they start burbling
up from you know from the grassroots and
that's been what's happening over the
last year the grassroots drones movement
has now exceeded the military drone
world in terms of just numbers of drones
out there in terms of number of physical
Jones there are or diversity or in what
way as it is it exceeding the military
so a little bit definitions a drone is
as you mentioned before is at an
aircraft capable of autonomy sometimes
it's flown remotely but it can fly by
itself takeoff landing gps waypoints
cameras all that kind of stuff it can be
just anything as simple as a
radio-controlled model airplane the kind
of you'd see in your part flown by
children and then somebody adds this
this is a this is an autopilot it's a it
just a little box that has computers
sensors GPS lots and lots of software
and then suddenly gives the plane a
brain or the cop
a brain that means that all those toy
airplanes out there are just one box
away from becoming drones now these
costs two hundred dollars as opposed to
the military military ones which can
cost tens or hundreds or millions of
dollars so as a results what you're
seeing out there was a lot of basically
what formerly we're ready to control
toys being turned into drones at a very
low cost which is why there's so many
more of them than the military ones
Daniel it is it this particular movement
that gave rise to the central tenant of
your book of these autonomous swarming
armed relax line drones it's the
ubiquity of it it's you know as is
mentioned in this wired article that's
this whole industry that is you know
made accelerometers and the specific
chips that empower this so cheap has
brought the price point down to the
point where many different entrance have
come into the industry and just created
this sort of Cambrian explosion of drone
species and and now even very very small
groups can use this in conflict that's
what I thought was interesting it's
almost a miniaturization of war to the
extent that hobbyists are taking this
these larger drones and turning them
into toys that they can use or for civil
use cameras and so forth it's also
occurring to people in conflict that
they can take these larger drones and
shrink them down and we were just
talking about in this missile that's
only two feet long that they're
designing to put on smaller drones now
and the idea is having a swarm of much
smaller drones is more survivable it
makes war more personal less collateral
damage all of that stuff so you
carefully target the person you're
looking for with a small drone so it's
this Venn diagram there's a slight
overlap between the the hobbyists drone
and the wardrobe and it's not going to
be the same people using them but the
technology is going to be similar in
many ways you know what's interesting to
me about this is that it was literally
just slightly more than a year ago that
we were talking about drones and what we
were discussing then were big flying
primarily fixed-wing machines and that
that we're getting we were seeing them
getting bigger and bigger and bigger the
phantom ray I believe as a several
million probably 100 million dollar
delta wing aircraft that flies that
40,000 feet completely I don't know if
it's completely autonomously but that's
that's a scary aircraft and
now we seem to have gone in the corset
in the space of 15 months completely the
other direction well it is what happened
it's an ecosystem you're going to have
different different species doing
different things you're going to have
the global Hawks that are going to set
up there at 60,000 feet stay persistent
eye on the sky looking down and then
acting perhaps an information will be
smaller drones or a whole constellation
of smaller drones doing various things I
mean 85 percentage of drones are I think
less than 24 pounds in the military's
fleet you know they're still that
they're they only represent four percent
of the cost eighty-five percent of the
drums but then you have the much bigger
ones that do you no connection to
satellite very high detailed imagery
from high up that type of thing so it's
different they have different purposes
so if you go out right now to the San
Francisco Bay and watch people surfing
odds are that increasingly you'll see
something that looks like this flying
overhead with a camera on board this is
a drone and it's a drone being used to
film extreme sports and probably
autonomously might be that someone is
having actually having we have one of
these follow it while the person is as
they're doing stunts just kind of
positioning itself above and behind
that's a that you know that's the kind
of thing that's cheap and possible and
fun it's a complete non-military I'm
application and it's not what people
thought of as drones but increasingly
will as these become much more common
you know I find that almost hard to
believe thinking but just because what I
know about this which is my parrot
ar.drone this is a you don't even call
this a drone because it's not fully
autonomous however it is a very
intelligent airplane frame you know you
control it with an iPhone and no matter
which way it's pointing the direction
that you tilt your phone is a direction
it goes which is cool now granted that's
just a simple algorithm but I happen to
think that's cool no no these vehicles
work but this thing in a two mile an
hour wind becomes almost unplayable I
are you saying that that that device can
handle winds on the bay of san francis i
mean that's that's the difference
between these two i mean we do small
ones as well but that's really designed
for indoor use this is this is a
quadcopter but they come in six and
eight as well these have quite powerful
brushless motors big big
in polymer batteries this can handle I
would say 15 knots is it is about
optimal I've seen it go in 20 but 1550s
about right in other words this is
designed for outdoor use as opposed to a
parrot ar.drone which is really designed
for indoor use I see and oh okay so we
talked briefly about using these things
as kind of flying spotter BOTS some
measure of autonomy you know maybe it's
following a beacon or on a on a
sailboard or something all right I guess
it could be with those things are so
brightly colored probably just lock onto
the sale I you could you could do I mean
typically what happens is you you carry
a little GPS device again that little
box that looks like this it has a GPS
device in a little radio and then it
just transmits your position to the
drone the drones positions itself behind
you now Daniel in your book you talk
about swarms of drones being used for
assassination and taking out ships with
laser cutters Chris your hobbyists clan
out there you're twenty-five thousand
strong communities members of DIY drones
what are they doing with these other
than just doing it because they can
because it's cool yeah this is very much
like the homebrew computing club in the
70s and if you'd asked jobs and wozniak
what's a computer for they'd say so you
can program it you know and that was a
sufficient answer for a lot of people
for a long time and then people thought
of word processing and spreadsheets and
video games and ultimately email on the
internet and all that um we're a little
bit further along than the because you
can program at stage but but by and
large the application and most people
are doing it for just coolness now I'm
interested so it's a fun education
platform aerial robotics taking robotics
from the 2d world to the 3d world and
all that increasingly is being used as a
camera platform not just for hobbyists
but also for mapping barriers like
Google Maps for agriculture to look at
you know croplands through different
filters that can tell you how the water
fertilizer is going Hollywood's using it
a lot so right now if you're watching a
car commercial and there is a camera
following a camera in the air that used
to always be a manned aircraft a
helicopter typically increasingly that's
an unmanned aircraft is doing the same
thing cheaper
less dangerous you can get it up in the
air any time any time you want a
scientific sensing is another good
application you know that that whole
zone that's sort of 400 feet below the
clouds so satellites are great but
they're far away and they're above the
clouds airplanes can get low the clouds
but they're expensive and hard to get in
the air and notion of anytime anywhere
access to the sky is what a drone can
offer for anybody from farmers to
scientists whoever you want anytime
anywhere access to the sky has so
interestingly put it well do we have I I
assume we wouldn't know because you know
over a couple thousand feet these things
are pretty much inaudible are their
drones flying over our cities right now
doing Google Maps or watching our
traffic I wouldn't think by official
entities they'd be concerned about
permitting and things like that there
are there are none I can pretty much
guarantee they're none flying over San
Francisco right now for commercial
purposes I think there is one flying
over San Francisco right now for a man I
think I don't know one of my team
members is flying right now over San
Francisco you wouldn't know that they're
flying below 400 feet so it's not like
you know why Novartis a line of sight
but the the way the FAA you know the
national regulations work is that
they're say amateur category where
basically anything goes as long as below
400 feet within visual line of sight so
you can avoid if there's that manned
aircraft that comes by you can take
control get it out of the way away from
built-up areas people airports things
like that if you're a commercial entity
it's almost impossible there's a long
permitting process that you can't you
can't get through and so ironically my
nine year old can fly drones but the San
Francisco Police Department can't I have
to think about whether that's good or
not look at that i relieved or worry
Daniel a you know as somebody who looks
on the dark side of what these uh these
platforms can do is that make you feel
good or bad well actually that parts in
different and i have to say that I look
at like I of necessity look at the dark
side in this I actually am very excited
about drones myself because they're
going to happen anyway I think soon the
fááá is going to rule on this around
2015 we were talking about and then I
think you'll see lots thousands of
permits approved for various uses of
drones and I just hope that what's put
in place is some sort of system by which
if you see I drone you can go to a
Google map type thing and find out what
it is
the oats the Department of Water and
Power they're inspecting lines something
like that so there's some visibility
some transparency there but I look at
the dark side principally because I
techno-thriller that's happy and ends on
a happier note is not very exciting so I
always look at the really dark stuff and
plus it'd be unbelievable yes and it's
easier to believe that these things are
being used for these purposes now I got
an email from from I'm not going to read
his name my name is donzo and I'm a
drone operator for and builder for new
vero flight systems you know them just
so you're aware drones for commercial
use are illegal in most countries here
in canada we require permits for every
flight and must provide detailed flight
plans and info about every job most
companies that attempt to turn drones
into a business especially in the USA
where national security is such a scary
topic either go out of business or get
shut down within the first year for now
probably that's right I just don't see
flight plans being I mean these things
are ad hoc aerial vehicles I don't see
fly commercial one though go on if
you're going to be inspecting power
lines let's say over a hundred mile long
stretch and again their potential to
interfere with the manned aircraft to go
haywire it is going to be some sort of
transparent transponder on it that will
tell it if it goes off couldn't you
build a database of no-fly zones into
the little GPS you can I'm the way it
works is that there are absolutely no
fly zones and where we get emails about
in text about those so we know about
that what if your commercial you have to
fly what's a file for what's called a
certificate of authorization from the
FAA and you need to say where are you
going to be and you know what what zone
you're going to be in when and it
basically clear the airspace and the
reason they do that is because the
number one rule of the national airspace
is sense and avoid the ability to see
other aircraft and avoid them so even if
the you know you can't count on air
traffic control to keep you apart you
need to be able to have eyes in the you
know eyes in the cockpit these things
don't have eyes in the cockpit and so
because they can't avoid a manned
aircraft you have to keep manned
aircraft away from them so with amateurs
we do that by staying 400 feet that
manned aircraft basically stopped at a
thousand feet there's a 600 foot buffer
and there's 400 feet which is where
kites and balloons and toys go so we do
it with this vertical segmentation beer
so
bass but commercial ones typically want
to go beyond that and with that you need
to notify the FAA and have them clear
the airspace someday we'll have sense
and avoid technology on board whether
it's going to be transponders as you say
but that would require you know all
manned aircraft to have the same
transponders and there's some political
opposition to say nothing of economic
opposition to that or whether they're
going to have just onboard sensors that
can achieve what eyes can achieve which
is spotting any potential potential
manned aircraft out there and getting
out of the way so what's the future look
like I mean these platforms are so
inexpensive the cost of failure if it
doesn't involve you know flying into
some other aircrafts manned aircraft and
windshield or engine is very low and one
of the things falls out of the sky it
could it could cause damage but not
nearly as much damages or helicopter are
we going to 10 years from now look up in
the sky and see you know delivery drones
zipping back and forth like the
pneumatic tubes of the 30s and 40s you
know delivery drones which is what
everybody always goes to they go
straight to pizza I don't know why um
that's actually one of the hardest AI
problems there is I mean think about it
you know you have to navigate a urban
environment you know telephone lines
trees buildings in street signs pigeons
people you know all that kind of stuff
you need to you know inner in GP you
know your GPS multipath bouncing off
wallets it's a terrible environment and
then you have to get to the right place
you have to find place to land and have
to be safe that's my happen in my
lifetime maybe a much more likely one
would be like an Africa delivering
medicine right you know there you have a
case where the roads are very poor and
the end the thing you're delivering is
actually quite light that's a perfect
application for it but this son you know
the taco copter there's a there's a
video on in your story about this yeah I
mean we did it we for fun we delivered a
pizza but we did it manually and i would
say that you're not going to see
delivery vehicles overhead anytime soon
i do think you'll see drones overhead
frequently in the next 10 years simply
for the kind of things that Google Map
aircraft do right now which is you want
your traffic helicopters you know
updated view of the
you know the land the houses the you
know the urban environment right now
that Google plane comes by once a year
mm-hmm you know it wouldn't it be nice
if it was up there all the time you know
if you had a live view wouldn't it be
nice if there was a Google platform with
cameras looking down on my house all the
time I leave that question as an
exercise for the reader would you like
your google maps would you like your
google maps to be real time or six
months old I'm not sure depends I see
your point but I'm still not sure okay
you know I mean well that is it that
society's questioned answer me this way
you only have to keep your backyard tidy
once a year but I'm telling you guys
just as a little side note the business
I'm going into if this publishing thing
doesn't work out for me is urban
camouflage nets for backyards I
shouldn't have said that because I know
there's no matter this gonna be a big
business am i right like that netting
they have a match that type it's totally
accept a student is gonna be of a clean
backyard with an empty swimming pool
well you know it's interesting that with
the privacy rules are actually not
enshrined you know specifically on a
federal level it's based on reasonable
expectation what working what kind of
privacy can you reasonably expect in
your backyard and once upon a time when
we are houses far apart it was Infinite
then we got closer together and they
were fences and they were senses and
then we had satellites overhead but they
only had certain resolution that we had
planes overhead they had a certain
resolution you know you could probably
nude sunbathe in your backyard and
assume that no one's going to be able to
recognize you but how much longer is
that true as the cameras get closer and
closer to Earth you know that's that's a
fascinating topic in Germany for example
when the google street view camera goes
by and takes a picture of your house
here i mean i think that the culture
says it's my house it's facing the
public street somebody takes to make
sure but there's very little I can do
Germany is like no I can have anything
as Germany I can have that blurred um so
there are different cultural
expectations uh where is this going to
go I mean are we going to walk out of a
door and immediately expect that any
sense of privacy what we're doing what
we're wearing what we look like is
completely blown away you're including a
better we're there yeah it's just
whether my luck on my walk over here I
walk two blocks I probably
five cameras I'm saying I let me check
yeah oh yeah yeah now that that's that's
done you know between camera phones and
you know public surveillance you know
once you're outside of your house it's
it's it's fair game purchase records
everything geolocation yeah now but the
backyard is still sacred space in some
sense and the question is how is that
you know reasonable expectation changing
now I want to talk about the technology
a little bit we've probably all seen
those videos of drones at various
research universities doing amazing
things flipping over perching on walls
flying through thrown hula hoops
cooperating with each other to build
things there's a great one of a bunch of
drones playing the James Bond theme or a
bunch of oversized instruments how of
course that's research being done by
smart people in universities and
eventually they're going to leave the
university and productize some of that
stuff but where are we right now what is
the state of the art for the autonomous
or remotely piloted a quadcopter yeah so
that's a great question there's a really
important distinction between those
videos which you see which are all done
in a motion capture room so those what
it's called a Vikon room basically what
happens there's cameras around here it's
like it's like motion capture where you
have little dots will sort of like
ping-pong balls on the device itself and
cameras looking around it and they then
they they're watching and ascertain the
position of the copter because the room
figures out where the copter is the
copter doesn't know anything and then
the room the room controls the copter so
it's basically a big it's a room making
the decisions now you take it outside
and they don't know anything anymore so
none of them is there's a half dozen of
these Vikon rooms around the world they
cost like five hundred thousand dollars
so that is a that's unobtainium you
can't do that once you go outside you're
dealing with GPS much lower resolution
so maybe you know a few meters rather
than a few centimeters um you're looking
at wind you're looking at sort of
difficult radio in environments you know
it's a much tougher problem so the state
of the art right now in the outside
world is that for for two hundred
dollars this is rj pilot which is the
ones that that our community DIY drones
community
created sold by three robotics my
company so this cost two hundred dollars
and it's got GPS and all those other
sensors inside and this will do full
autonomy take off waypoints you know you
point and click on a map and you just
tell it where to go and you press go and
off a dozen it does its thing probably
plus or minus about you know about a
meter which is about as good as GPS yeah
it gets and it'll work you know almost
all the time but you know things things
can go wrong it's still kind of
leading-edge technology the you know
swarming is the next where you get
multiple ones communicating with each
other and these things all have these
special radios on board which are
designed to communicate with it base
station ground station telemetry but can
also communicate with each other so you
know the algorithms to let them work
collaboratively are going to come out
and and and they're going to get smaller
and lighter and cheaper and all that the
indoor stuff is is is still kind of a
research exercise it's a good way to
test algorithms we haven't found any
particular useful applications for it
indoors yet but someday perhaps we will
now Daniel I don't want to give spoilers
to your book but I'll leave that to you
you want to but knowing full well of the
limitations of the current technology
you develop I don't know how much you
invented or extracted from public
materials a technology to for
cooperative from the for autonomous
drones to to reinforce each other's
behavior do you want to talk about a
little bit is really interesting idea I
based it of course on social insects the
hymenoptera Weaver ants and it is it
relates to a concept called stigma G
which means modifying the environment
basically to communicate between members
agents in a system so that they can
iteratively interact with that and
navigate and read messages from each
other so it's sort of like a swarm can
upvote something that they discover in
importance so that more of the agents
converge on that point all of them up
voting as they go and that's how it sort
of manifests itself as intelligent
reaction i would say i extrapolated you
know I i took some poetic license but
really it's sort of just an over the
horizon thing it's not completely beyond
the realm of possibility mmm but that's
you know what i wanted to
was I wanted to look a little further
ahead to say if things keep going in
this direction and one word devoid of
ethics one could do this and and again
designing a system that's not perfect
that has lots of casualties that makes
lots of mistakes but the fat part of
that bell curve gets it right and and
although the extremes on either side
might get it wrong whatever goal the
swarm has can be achieved and it depends
on how important that goal is so if that
goal is attacking an important political
target I mean how much is it worth
somebody 22 for a political reason to
send a thousand dollar a
hundred-thousand-dollar drones to get
rid of somebody I mean that's not a very
big investment especially if attribution
is difficult that was one of the key
things here autonomous drones could give
you anonymous warfare the idea that it
would be very difficult to determine who
is attacking you particularly in a world
that has a profusion of drones
everywhere Oh many of them off the shelf
and again I'm not trying to be negative
this is going to happen we're going to
have drones everywhere they're going to
have manifold civilian uses and it's
going to be great but I always look at
what groups that are in conflict how
they might use cheap technology and
again we were talking about this earlier
this is sort of bringing the price point
for an Air Force down to sort of the boy
scout troop level of course I own Boy
Scouts doing this but let's say narco
I'm going to get the badge look at narco
traffickers I think of this let's say
they're moving I don't know what the
cost is for a kilo of cocaine but the
point is let's say it's thirty thousand
dollars if you're sending a swarm of
drones over the border with a half kilo
each and you lose half of them you still
made a lot of money and you didn't
endanger anybody on your team and in
other words things like that could be
driving in illicit market in drones and
it would make financial sense and then
there's warring parties and all these
things so I had to look at this dark
territory because to me conflict human
conflict in particular is always an
early adopter they're always going to
take whatever technology comes down the
line that gives them some advantage and
use it and I thought that was
fascinating how you could use these
again extrapolate a little in the
technology try to use them cooperatively
and it's it's amazing when you look at
it as a swarm if you have modern weapons
it's still very difficult to knock down
a swarm going to crissy as the editor of
Wired this is a topic
the shrink ification of technology in
the distribution of technology from say
a hundred million dollar platform to ten
thousand ten thousand dollar platforms I
don't know if I didn't I know yeah
whatever yeah but is that you seen that
happen not just in drones but in every
other technology is it is that what is
happening here are we moving away from
the big vulnerable aircraft carriers in
the sky to a swarm of PT boats yeah um
the secret is this oh I'm going the
smartphone revolution yeah and you know
may not think about this but inside your
phone you have all the sensors necessary
to fly to fly blank it's got gyros and
accelerometers and magnetometers and GPS
and wireless and cameras and processing
and memory and all that kind of stuff
and thanks to the economies of scale of
Apple and Google and others what used to
be super expensive technology to make an
autopilot is now pennies so so
absolutely we now by circo tailing on
the smartphone industry you know this is
these are the same things just in
different form factors and as a result
this which would have cost you know a
hundred thousand dollars ten years ago
now is gonna be one hundred fifty
dollars and ultimately they'll be
disposable and disposable drones I mean
we were going from from commercial
drones in military drones to personal
drones and now disposable drones that's
when you get into the kind of you know
statistical approaches that Daniels
talking about Daniel one of the things
you talk about in your book is a
government reaction to the obvious
proliferation of potentially dangerous
vehicles under the control of people who
are uncontrollable and an outlawing a
bam on this technology well yeah I had
to show that that is sort of knee-jerk
reaction yeah that do you think we're in
danger of that though well as one of the
reasons I put it in there yeah to kind
of I don't want to say market but it
would be an absurdly ineffective thing
to do because this is going to happen
it's perfect that I was reading recently
the LA Times mentioned that there is a
1987 agreement that the u.s. government
signed to limit that that limits our
Expo
tation of drone technology I think it's
got to have the name of it it's a
missile technology control regime and
drone manufacturers in the United States
we're complaining that that's the reason
they can't sell drone technology
overseas what they're doing is pointing
to the fact that all of this stuff is
happening in the civilian space but that
we shouldn't be restricted from doing
this and that sort of shows that that
that restricting it if we don't embrace
and understand and and meaningfully
regulate drones they're going to happen
everywhere else and and then they're
going to come in from the outside so
again there's really no stopping this
way I think we have to be reasonable
about it I wanted to show it or
dramatize it such that that's the first
thing they would do is just well we'll
just retract this this license to use
this for hobby use and that'll protect
us and no no it won't protect them the
cool thing is I didn't get a license to
get this thing yeah just bullet yeah I'm
air you actually they sent to me but
yeah you just would you what would you
ban I mean you know again the cheek and
by the chips in a radio check is that
you know the software was developed on
the internet and it's open source it's
getting away for free that via their
frames or toys so uh to get away from
you know the the doom and gloom here and
under the stuff that we can all enjoy
and participate in you you have a
inexpensive autopilot autonomous pilot
there what else is happening in the
approachable world of these products I
mean you've got batteries motors sensors
who wears the state of the art right now
in this yeah so so there's sort of three
breakthroughs that allows something like
this the first is I mean these are these
are this is called Archer copter and
it's a it's an Arduino base this is rj
pilot which is the autopilot and this is
the copter version of it there's planes
and others these are in unstable
platforms it's impossible for a human
being to fly them basically the way the
way they work is that you just speed up
or slow down the various props to go in
one direction to go in the other
direction and it goes 200 times a second
that can only be done by a computer so
we had to invent three things first of
all the ability to put sensors and
computers on a really small platform
this required MEMS sensors these are
microelectronic mechanical devices which
are found in your phones and started
with things like airbag sensors the
second is these motors are called
this motors and these were kind of it
first invented for DVD drives and the
third is that high efficiency batteries
I didn't bring one but lithium polymer
batteries which again are the kind of
thing to have in phones and laptops so
what's interesting is that all three of
them came out of the computer industry
these came out of DVD drives the lithium
polymer batteries came out laptops and
phones and the sensors again came out of
phones etc so ten years ago not possible
is that why we didn't see quadcopters
until now because they're inherently
unstable platform exactly i had a
regular helicopter with it with a big
road or in care order that's human
control day early but yeah exactly they
need a compute thing to be flown by
computer or flown by wire which is in
other words the human beings controls
they autopilot the autopilot controls
the aircraft fascinating so when it
comes to autonomy which is one of the
things that you're working under your
group your community members are working
on how autonomous are these I mean can I
so say you know drone make me a sammich
or I mean how what can we do exactly so
so what you do is there's a piece of
software that runs on your on your
laptop it's got a mission planner and
you called up and it opens up a Google
map and you 0 and 0 in every area you
want is you just click and you say go
here go there go there at each at each
waypoints you can as even say loiter you
look at a certain point of interest
change your altitude whatever it's just
you just click and pick from any items
and you just click your way into a
mission and then you upload the mission
to this which includes an automatic
takeoff and landing and then you just
press go and and that is full autonomy
you look at the lat you look at the
laptop and watch maybe the cameras view
in real time but the aircraft flies
itself a year or so ago I think we heard
about a group of protesters in in a
country I forget which it was forgiving
me who were using drone technology to
monitor approaching dangerous force of
military or police I think I think it's
been a number of places but the home was
the first war song possibly so r is this
technology changing the I mean I guess
an obvious question but how is this
technology changing the equation of you
know government versus people when that
happens so look what happens when you
know we've seen a lot of videos that
this people trying to film the police
which is a legal activity and then
getting arrested
going to be much harder if you're
filming them from a drone it's probably
safer and again there's that attribution
thing like well somebody's filming us
and then I know that there's been some
talk about getting police drones I don't
know what they would do with them other
than film protesters other for legal
reasons but I think it's only a matter
of time and still until they start to
put together some sort of countermeasure
to knock down protesters drones it's
gonna get pretty weird will that work if
these things are autonomous oh yeah no
it's it you know there was a pita group
was protesting a bird hunt I think was a
pigeon shoot or something and set up and
set out drones to film the hunters and
so the hunters simply took the shot
doesn't pointed that in shines and shot
them down yeah turned out they were
sitting to access if you will so the
there's something called drone
journalism which is the notion that
journalists what you know in their in
their function is or you know being a an
oversight and the authorities would use
drones to do this um I think it's a good
idea I want to be really really cautious
about the use of it putting a flying
lawnmower you know with spinning blades
over the head of a crowd operated
possibly by amateurs is a really really
bad idea and it's illegal in most
countries so I you know I'm and I think
that people who are responsible about
promoting drone journalism are very very
quickly recognize that that's particular
examples is a poor one you know among
other things you really should keep
multicopters away from people an
airplane a foam airplane would have been
a much better choice even though that is
also technically illegal and most in
most countries so it's easy to get too
ahead of ourselves and sort of start to
think that it's going to be you know
occupy wall street with their air force
versus the police with their Air Force
and the drone battling over the skies um
I think that would be kind of dangerous
we've talked about quads and I guess
octocopters or whatever they hexacopter
copters of course we're all familiar
with flying fixed-wing autonomous or
unmanned vehicles are there other form
factors that are emergent here we we
focus on for in our communities there's
the multicopters which range from
traditional helicopters with one blade
all the way up to eight or more blades
aircraft as you mentioned and typically
relatively small ones they can be to
foam light really wouldn't actually hurt
a plane if they hit it or wouldn't do
much damage and we have Rovers which are
autonomous ground vehicles which are
also supported to see any put with the
box and a RC car and a rover and then we
have blimps and blimps are a lovely
platform for for teaching autonomy
inside the home with children a
completely safe space this also votes in
submarines although we haven't gone as
much in that direction and and the
flying in the wired store you talk about
bug box a little bit briefly yeah those
are those lemos mostly research efforts
and you know right now this I should
have brought in but right now the
smallest sort of quad copters are about
this big once you get smaller you're
dealing with kind of basically power
management issues you know it's it's
really hard to get enough power insects
use use chemistry you know they get food
in the environment they converted into
glucose and to power their very
efficient muscles we're nowhere near
sufficient is that with electric motors
and batteries and so you end up with
some as you get smaller the aerodynamics
get harder and the power issues get
harder and you know your weight power
wait thrust ratio gets all wrong so
we're not there yet I suspect that
something more biologically inspired it
Daniel were there are other form factors
that you look that get left on the
cutting room floor mean there's this
great scene there's this great scene in
your book where you have blue bots yes
um swarming yeah yeah and you can buy
those I've seen them in start-up offices
around great fun with mine it upsets my
cat though it's noisier than you think
it is it upset you that sounds like a
good reason to get one to me but anyway
go ahead you know but there's many
different form factors also the as far
as the submarines I know that there are
some universities using them for doing
environmental monitoring basically to
set them on some sort of pattern to
measure things in the deep ocean which
is a really it's a great use for it I'm
submarines are a lovely as for autonomy
so what robots do is jobs that are dull
dirty and dangerous
right so so you know dull is actually
the most interesting ones just go out
and watch something forever right and
and then maybe great thing about the
submarines is that they can just say
just these gliders they just kind of use
the curves and the texture gradients in
the ocean to to be out there for months
at a time I'm the only challenge for for
submarines is that you can't get gps
underwater so they really don't know
where they are at any particular point
in time and because they don't have
because they're out there for so long
they can't carry a lot of energy with
them so they tend to kind of go with the
currents so they're little they're kind
of think of it as a is it kind of a as a
kind of a sensor that's out there
somewhere you can every now and then it
surfaces and you know where it is etc
but it's not highly controllable as
opposed to these others which are you
know pinpoint accuracy they go exactly
where you want well let's wrap up uh
Chris people watching the show probably
is like think are probably thinking I
have to try this what's the best way to
get started with with this technology so
I'm I actually although although
everyone's you know loves copters
because they're really cool they're
actually a little hard to fly for a
beginner so I actually recommend that
people start with a foam airplane so go
to DIY drones com which is the community
that does this and you'll see lots of
getting started guides etc but I would
recommend that someone start with am a
foam RC airplane they cost about sixty
dollars one there's one that's called a
pixel that way that we quite like and
just learn to fly it and it's super easy
and you'll crash a bunch of times but
it's okay they bounce then once you're
comfortable with that then get a this is
the cheapest auto pilot you know out
there it's called it's called autopilot
do I get one of these and just put it in
there and at that point you've got a
drone now you can experiment with
mission planning you can you know put a
camera on board you can start to do fun
stuff ok call ms DIY drones dot DIY
drones calm calm uh Daniel I recognize
full well that this is a thriller yes
and that the conflict is for the sake of
the story but you do spend a fair amount
of time thinking about this or to come
up with these books what are you
concerned about or excited about in the
realm of autonomous vehicles
uh I am both excited and concerned I
would say as far as my concern I in
particular focus on again the kill
decision that is giving drones
autonomous drones the authority and the
power to pull the trigger on a human
target that that crossing that line is
very worrisome we have not gone there
yet we have not gone yet there yet
officially I know there's a couple of
systems out there now I think I've
talked to you about them before their
sniper systems but that that that
features turned off right now so in the
DMZ between north and south korea none
on the Gaza Strip Gaza Strip those are
sniper stations those are not flying
drones but there is no technical
impediment to this so I am glad that
people are reluctant to make this this
choice although I do know that with 50
other nations developing drones
somebody's liable to do this and I'm
concerned that we would cross that line
very hastily because I think there is a
a dangerous concentrating effect of
giving that authority to machines
because then suddenly you don't need
other people's buy-in to have a war you
just need some resources some money and
you can conduct a very large scale
secret war rather invisibly that
concerns me in the context of a
democracy that concerns me so that's
really one of the concerns I had in
writing this book now as far as the the
hope I mean I think drones can do so
much from a civilian point of view from
environmental monitoring search and
rescue I mean many many tons of uses and
we'll find more all these people working
on this so they're going to happen I
just wanted to do a cautionary tale that
was thrilling again that sort of
exploded Daniel Suarez is the author of
kill decision which is orderable now
it's order one out now comes out July 19
really really fun book Chris Anderson is
the editor-in-chief of wired and the
founder of DIY drones or you can get
your own make your own thank you guys
for coming in it's been a great show
mejor thanks everyone for watching
reporters roundtable be back soon with
another great episode Thank You Steven
for producing we'll see you all later
