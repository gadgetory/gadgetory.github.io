rear camera and retina display as last
year's iPhone 5 but Apple didn't just
slap a series of colorful plastic cases
on an old phone on the inside the 5c is
a new device with hardware upgrades and
design elements from both the five and
the new 5s I'm Bill Detweiler and this
is cracking open on the outside it's the
iPhone 5cs colorful polycarbonate cases
that really set the phone apart from the
5 and the 5s and thanks to this case
it's also slightly longer wider thicker
and a bit heavier than the other two
phones but peel back the case and the 5c
reveals itself to be a unique device
which borrows traits from both the other
phones now one thing that all three
phones share is how you crack them open
using a special pentalobe screwdriver
remove the two external screws then
using a suction cup lift up on the front
panel and display assembly from the
bottom you may also need to use a few
thin tools to pop loose the panel unlike
the new 5s there's no ribbon cable
connecting the home button to the lower
connector assembly just a series of
connectors at the top and once you
detach them you can completely remove
the panel the 5c shares the same general
hardware layout as the iPhone 5 and 5s
but there are both differences and
similarities now first the 5c has a
slightly higher capacity battery than
the 5 but a lower capacity battery than
the 5s and like the 5s it lacks the
battery removal pull tab found on the 5a
second the 5 C's camera is covered with
a metal bracket the 5 has no bracket and
the 5s is camera is covered with a
rubber flap a third while the 5c may
have the same a6 processor as last
year's iPhone 5 the main system board
has the same general design as the 5s
notice the connector and metal shields
layout one bit of 5c hardware that is
more like its counterpart on the 5 than
the 5s is the external speaker and lower
connector assembly now this isn't
surprising given the 5s is new
fingerprint reading home-button I'm
turning our attention to the front panel
assembly all three phones have the same
Retina display but like the 5s the 5c
has an upgraded FaceTime camera and
redesigned screen connectors the home
button and it's pressure contacts are
more like those on the iPhone 5 as I did
during my iPhone 5s teardown I'm going
to leave the battery in place as I
remove the other components I am however
going to disconnect it from the main
system board before doing anything else
now with the battery safely disconnected
I'm going to detach the remaining
mainboard connectors remove several
screws and standoffs and finally lift
out the board now unfortunately like the
boards in the 5 and 5s the EMI RFI
shields are soldered in place as I want
to put this phone back together in
working order I'll need to leave the
shields alone next to come out is the 8
megapixel rear facing camera
unfortunately the external speaker
lightning connector and headphone jack
are all part of the same component
assembly and like the vibration motor
flash and a bevy of connector wires
running throughout the case they're held
in place with both screws and adhesive
if any of these components were damaged
removing and replacing them is possible
but I don't want to risk damaging them
during removal so I'm going to leave
them in place
I'm glad Apple took the opportunity to
not just give the iPhone 5c a new case
but also upgrade the phone's hardware
and tweak its internal design and while
it's still no walk in the park to crack
open the 5c is no more difficult to work
on than either the 5 or the 5s now for a
complete list of specs pricing and
