truly wireless home theater systems on
exactly zero fingers but in the past few
weeks we've seen two and there's the
promise of more coming
while many sound bars include a wireless
sub the clips reference premiere HD
wireless 5.1 speaker system takes us to
the logical extreme and makes everything
Wireless it uses a system called Weiser
wireless speaker and audio this systems
approach has two advantages firstly you
don't need to know how to wire an AV
receiver and secondly you can easily add
more components as you go set up at the
clip is really easy first plug your TV
and components into the HD Center then
you click the button on the back of each
speaker to tell the system where it is
in regards to your seating position the
control hub features four HDMI inputs
one with 4k compatibility and you also
get bluetooth streaming to operate the
system you can use the controls on the
unit itself or the skinny remote with
it's kind of unreadable grey text on
grey buttons if you're interested in the
system you could start with just the
five hundred dollar HD Center and a pair
of $1000 bookshelves the system we
looked at though included towers a set
of channel two rears and a sub the
resultant price tag 5000 bucks the clips
does sound really good though with
plenty of low-end weight and nice
mid-range detail in both music and
movies however you can easily spend half
of the clip to sticker price and get
better sound of course you'll need to
assemble the system yourself with the
system you end up paying a lot for
wireless convenience but it's still not
truly Wireless yet be aware that you'll
still need to plug every component into
its own power socket</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
