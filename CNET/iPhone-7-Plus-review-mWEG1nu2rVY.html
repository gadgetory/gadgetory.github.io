just like the other 7 it's
water-resistant it's got better battery
and it's got a faster processor but the
real difference is the dual lens camera
on the back each 12 megapixels
wide-angle and telephoto how does it
work
we gave it to one of our photographers
in San Francisco to try it for himself
would this be a particularly good place
to do a selfie
I'm James Martin I'm the senior
photographer at C net I've been spending
some time with the iPhone 7 plus for the
past week and kind of taking it around
San Francisco and the Bay Area and kind
of looking at some of its capabilities
as a mobile phone camera and seeing what
can do it's been really impressive
the two lenses a wide angle and the
telephoto lenses on the back has an
impressive range to it and the zoom is
incredible the button the 1x button here
switches between one lens and then we
use the hit it 2x we switch to the
telephoto lens so we're getting no
digital zoom this is all optical zoom
certainly I can see this being a
replacement for a point-and-shoot
cameras the the photos are amazingly
sharp even in low-light it has it has
really good range of tones it evens out
the highlights and the shadows very very
well the software I can tell really is
doing an amazing job of isolating the
color pixels and there's no bleed in the
color all of them are very well defined
it's really pretty I don't know if they
quite is up to the level of replacing
DSLRs but this is the kind of camera
that certainly is going to be fun for
amateurs and even professionals to shoot
with as a replacement for
point-and-shoot camera it's in terms of
snapshots and even taking you know your
artistic Instagram types of photos this
is a very incredible quality camera
I think everyone's really going to like
this camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
