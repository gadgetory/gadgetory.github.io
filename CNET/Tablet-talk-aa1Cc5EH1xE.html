at CES 2014 in Las Vegas
i'm donald bell he's Eric Franklin and
we're here to talk about tablets its
tablet talk with Donald and Eric it's a
new show no more episodes tablet talk
yeah you know I'm just you know I
haven't talked to you all week I hope
you guys don't mind yeah because we're
like I've talked to you for a little
like five minutes cuz I don't get to
talk tablets with you that much anymore
like I usually talked that was with you
and like you with TV seen at TV so you
know you don't really get to do this
that much now this is good
not everyone can see it so tell me about
the tablets of CES what do want to know
what do you got a roundup here I'm gonna
go off the roundup okay first off the
snakebite Viper a three in one home
gaming console and tablet in your hands
right right that's basically a
seven-inch tablet it has a kind of a
customized interface I has adopted you
connect the tablet to and then you can
hook it to your TV comes with a remote
control you can control it with your mo
control like you can watch Netflix
movies and stuff like that it's $200 and
for an extra $50 you can get this this
Bluetooth gaming controller and this
Android bass but plays android games but
you know the problem with this and a lot
of these kind of gimmicky tablets like
this is that it's too expensive you know
it's $200 to for a kind of streaming box
it's portable yeah but it's a kind of a
streaming box gaming device you know if
I'm gonna play games on my TV I'm gonna
play xbox 360 I'm gonna play ps3 those
are both I feel like especially if they
go into the gaming thing there's already
systems that are dedicated towards
Android gaming content like the we are
in videos like shield yeah which can
connect to your TV via HDMI I feel like
also the fact that you can use like a
Bluetooth controller with your tablet
and connect your tablet over HDMI that's
a feature that has been in like every
Android tablet over the last year yes
putting that up front as something that
you'd go buy it and do it's not really
doing anything new I mean it's you know
gives you the remote control and they
you know for an extra 50 bucks like I
said then you get the Bluetooth
controller but like you said it's it's
there's nothing novel here the dock is
the dock that makes it kind of cool I
don't know I mean you may be you know
the dock it has an IR blaster on it you
can control it with a dock then you
control it with the remote controller
you know I mean it's on the list
so that's why we're tied to give it to
them at least they came up with a really
badass man yeah the snake bite Viper yes
like it's like a new Cobra character
rights like a new like GI Joe toy like
coming this summer this make my Vipers
alright next one's got a pretty great
name too but not quite as you know macho
it's kind of an ironical name for sure
Seba push you back the Toshiba Excite
yes yes seven yeah because there's many
excites before yeah we've been more or
less excited about yeah I've yet to be
excited about one of them to be honest
and this is the first thing unless like
the first rule of product naming is name
it exactly the opposite of what it is
what's all I mean that's you know this
subjective I guess right I mean I'm sure
there's it's excited about it it's $99
its Android base you know it has you
know modest specs and if you want a
functional Android tablet from Toshiba
this is one that you can buy you can buy
this tablet functional forgettable
device that you know money is you for
you can spend money on this alright
excite seven hands on go check it out
a Seuss transformer book duet TD 300 now
we put a few of these two and one tablet
laptop II devices on our must-see list I
think this might have been one of them
this is a dual not just dual boob but
like a switchable yeah OS so you can go
from Windows 8.1
yeah really quickly like there you go
it's happening in like two three seconds
so that's cool what it has windows-based
specs you know it has core i7 I believe
inside 128 gigs of storage you know it's
kind of a neat
idea in that you know you get the dual
boot windows and Android and you're
getting the the powerful specs of a
Windows machine on Android sure so you
know if you like you know but the tablet
itself I mean a lot of the windows
tablets I've seen they're chunky they
haven't quite quite got as thin as
Android is still suffering from that it
does don't suffer because it has those
windows that Intel based architecture so
it's always gonna be a little bit
thicker than like you're you're in video
or qualcomm based architecture but you
feel like this is one of the the big
tablet stories of CES this guy I think
it's I think it's the start of a big
tablet story for 2014 you probably gonna
see a lot of dual boot duals you know
easily switchable Android Windows
tablets and this is probably the first
one all right next up the Acer Iconia b1
720 right now the naming people have
clearly phoned it in at this point no so
yeah this is another like one of those
cheap modestly spec tablets if you just
want just pure function you don't want
do anything special you just want to
tablet that you can I guess stream
movies on you know surf the web check
email it's pretty cheap I think it's 129
I believe you know it's it's what all
things cuz I'm such a hardware guy I get
excited about you know like high
resolution screens bright Smee this one
it feels like almost like that specs
wise it feels like a tablet from 2012 I
know it has like a 1024 by by 600
resolution screen that's not exciting
you know it's not exciting to me you
know but for someone who doesn't care
about that kind of stuff and there
wasn't to pay that kind of money I do
feel like there's that whole segment of
Android tablets and has been here for a
while but it's it's rare that I see
names like Acer or even Toshiba even
bother with it of like the tablets that
you just fall into as like the person
who buys it just you know like I'm it
you know electronics store X and there's
a bin of these tablets II write on sale
that's you know or 200 bucks I'm uh
whatever the name is right it works I'll
buy I'll pick it up yeah yeah yeah like
that's for that person like a flagship
device where like you
going to the specific store to buy this
exactly that's me that's like who that's
for you know that's who that's that's
for those bargain bin bargain shoppers
who just want a tablet just what an
Android tell it doesn't want to it
doesn't care about specs and stuff like
that and it'll probably work another
back of the box right from Aaron
Franklin Cena's there at frame he'll
probably work
all right a soos yes again these tab
note eight this is them starting with an
actual stylus oriented tablet kind of
getting into the Samsung Note realm yeah
yeah it's kind of taking on Samsung
although this one is running Windows 8.1
not Android and you know it's you know
people are interested in using their
tablets with a stylus this one is using
Windows so there's not really that much
like native functionality for the step
that the stylus built in like the
Samsung no you know Samsung oh you can
search by just you know writing and you
don't have to type anything in yeah this
one I'm not sure if it has that you know
when we use it this week it didn't
really have that kind of functionality
ask me this question is this ever gonna
go away where the branding is very
specifically in one orientation you know
you know what up I'm wondering what's
gonna go away the Nexus 7 2012 designed
from Asus I feel like they've been
leveraging that you know they've been
loving that for like a year and a half
now that's why I'm wondering I know I
mean I know there's not a lot to be done
about making a tablet that much sexier
at this point it's a slab of plastic all
that all the content as well basically
the screen usually screen quality black
bezel but I really feel like that
branding annoys me just my type a right
you know if I want to use it this way
and have masseuse running running down
it just feels yeah you just want to
throw it across the room when you see
that is exactly you know how I get all
the acer the a1 a 30 another tablet here
from CES 2014 that one yes what makes
this one memorable well it and what's
make it's basically a like a slight
upgrade from the a1 820 which came out I
think last summer it has a seems like
I'd like a little thinner design it
still has this like but again it has
this like low resolution screen
it's when it was like hey it's
functional it works it 150 bucks you
don't want a lot of you know you know
high specs you want a lot of features
you just want to tell but that works it
has a you know a larger than usual
screen for a small tablet 7.9 instead of
7-inch but then it has that 1024 X 600
resolution which is always disappointed
in me yeah you know I'm just kind of a
you know I'm a kind of a graphic snob
and when it comes to that kind of site I
got another question for it all right
you got it
answer this honestly are some of these
designs to be used as a cheap tablet for
the bathroom you know I would imagine so
I don't care what the resolution is as
long as it's $200 I just need to you
know I need it for five minutes at a
time pretty much and it needs to be
portable you know so yeah I think you're
right they should make the naming more
suggestive of that asu's well it is
called the B was it they was the a1 yeah
maybe a different tablets for different
uses all right Samsung finally we're
kind of getting into I mean let's just
be on a Samsung kind of owns the
high-end Android you know not I've had
tablet category sure what are they
showing off here it's yeah they're
showing off something pretty exciting
they're showing off the the new proline
denote Pro and the Tab pro the Tab pro
comes in 8.4 10.1 and 12.2 inch sizes
first time going up to 12 point - that's
person they've gone yeah yeah I think
Toshiba had a like a 13 inch a couple
years ago that's right but yeah and the
no pro which is a you know stylus based
tablet goes up the 12.2 inches and you
know it's high-end specs 2560 by 1600
resolution on all of them even the low
be smaller 8.4 you know using you know
high-end Exynos processor three gigs of
ram you know you can do multi window you
can have four apps running concurrently
on the the 12 point 2 inch screen so
that's part of the story here is the
update is also the interface for has
been updated so yeah so it's widget base
it's all widget base now is I mean you
can still go back and you can look at
app icons if you want to but most of it
is just widget base so you can have
basically you can't be weather on your
left side you can have
News you know on the right you have
below that you can have like your recent
apps and stuff like that it's just a
very much more graphical hopefully much
more for most people intuitive interface
for me I it was it was a little hard to
get used to but for someone just
starting their tablet career whatever
where do you fall on that debate though
about yeah pure Android versus like the
skinned Android I mean Samsung it's
really big on their particular version
and Stan of for you actually how do you
feel about TouchWiz is what they should
call the bathroom tap the more Samsung
invests on making the Android experience
on a tablet their specific flavor of it
yeah there's they're alienating some
people but they're also hopefully
chasing after like a new person who's
only gonna seek out a Samsung tablet
because of that experience right as a
person that says you know who people
there are fans of the Samsung interface
people who you know maybe haven't used
tablets before I think that honestly the
TouchWiz has come a long way since when
you were reviewing tablets it's much
more customizable as much more useful
has like a lot more features than even
you know stock pure Android 4.3 4.4.4 I
like in the last couple of months I've
really come to like touch ways and this
is kind of an evolution of that that's
just much more graphical but still just
as customizable I'm kind of excited
about it you know I haven't used it that
much you know I got a few moments to use
it this week with Samsung but you know
it has a lot of potentials all right and
then also in that Samsung family was the
note Pro this was the like the twelve
point two inch yeah mega tablet so yeah
there's a tab pro this 12.2 inches of no
pro less 12.2 inch this is just a
stylist version of that same time exact
same specs as the 12.2 Tab pro just the
uses of stylus if you want to stylus
right if you're so inclined to use a
stylus yes I never got the stylus class
Alcatel OneTouch pop seven and pop eight
yes yes I think the you know the kind of
like defining feature about these
tattles is that they're gonna offer if
they come out here Alcatel tells me
they'll be released in North America
this year they didn't really say the US
but I push them and they were like
Canadians get ready yeah they were just
silent they're there but um so like they
it's the seven inch will be under two
hundred dollars and will offer LTE the
eight inch will be under $300 and offer
LTE as well it's pretty cheap for
cellular LTE based based tablets usually
if you're gonna go that you know the LTE
cell your self cell your small tablet
rail you're gonna pay you know upwards
of 350 bucks so now I remember back in
the day back in the day that was the
first strike against the iPad was like a
wave of tablets they're all carrier
attached yeah came with 3G right data
and there was no way you could get
around it if you're gonna buy that first
wave of like Galaxy Tabs right there all
carrier subsidized if you're gonna buy
that you're gonna be stuck with it for
two years very much but then I felt like
everyone came to their senses and all
the Android tablets you're gonna buy
would be Wi-Fi only and maybe you would
buy like like a month-to-month kind of
plan or you could like just you know
attach it to your current plan you have
a so you a cell phone plan you're gonna
attach it like that they think a lot of
them are offering that kind of right so
are trying to lock you in anymore okay
which is great there's it's still a
thing though to go out and buy your
tablet at a Verizon store or something
and come with like a month by month yeah
yeah that's still thing that so what
happens yeah I mean luckily they're not
trying to like I said they're not trying
to lock you in for two years it's a
little bit more freeing these days yeah
all right so what on this list is do you
think if you're you're you know putting
as the the one you had to write about or
actually you know be excited I have to
write about all of them you know I was
like the the tablet the takeaway tablet
to see yes you probably the pro line
from Samsung Galaxy Pro line I just
think that you know see yes I want to
see something exciting I want to see
vendors doing something risky you know I
want to see them doing something that's
you know kind of off the beaten path of
Talas like oh here's another tablet
you know app icons or whatever and
that's fine that worships functional but
I see yes I want to be excited so I'm
being kind of selfish here you know so
those things excite me because they're
doing something really now but these are
not all the tablets we're seeing this
year right I mean yes it's not
historically the place where the the big
tablets aside from maybe the Samsung
crop yeah yeah I think I think over the
last couple years Mobile World Congress
has kind of been more of a kind of
staging ground for tablet debuts I think
we're gonna probably see I think it's a
good it's kind of a good in-between you
know it's still early in the year so
they get that that quarter that quarter
one buzz but it's a little bit later
than January so they have a little bit
more time to work on it so if you have
to project though what you might be
saying Mobile World Congress but we
didn't see here who are the players that
you think I'm gonna be showing something
off worth getting excited about well I'm
really excited about you know Nvidia
announced the NVIDIA Tegra k1 this week
it's a new processor it's supposed to be
as possible for computer products yeah
well they say that but then they go well
it's as powerful as a 360 or ps3 you
know graphically which is not really a
super I don't know how do we define
super computers these days does that
change like every years like there's
like more as long as they're all super
I'm getting really I guess yeah I'm
really excited to see tablets announced
with that process I'm really excited to
see what that can actually do but the
thing about that is is like yes you have
the three six you have the ps3 those are
really capable devices but there's all
those are also the best game developers
in the world working on those those two
devices and you know making their
engines and you know fine-tuning their
engines they're really getting to know
the heart where you don't really see
that that much on Android you don't see
me you might get some good developers on
there but you don't see that maybe we're
talking about Android gaming
specifically right - like maximize that
gaming performance from an Android
tablet or an Android box like yeah we
are something like that right exactly
you don't really get to see that kind of
stuff and you know a lot of these
developers don't have that that was the
claim from the Nvidia conference right
was that Android gaming was gonna be
like the future
of where things are going yeah they were
saying that I don't I'm not buying it
you know I I'm gonna still choose to do
my gaming on like my console gaming my
console box is my dedicated console box
my Nintendo is my almost almost a Sega
man how old am I
my sonís my Microsoft I'm gonna do it on
my PC a high-end PC you know so like
that project Christine that kind of
stuff I'm getting off subject you know
that's what really amazing never come
out sounds like weird science to me you
start naming your different computers
after women after women weird science
great movie though yeah okay no talking
about the projection for this year
beyond CES right k1 tablets interesting
yeah anything else any other but it was
like Nokia is a Nokia coming out well
I'm trying to think of you people aren't
you aren't represented here I mean
hopefully you'll see a new version of
surface tablets hopefully they will
probably go in a more refined direction
you know surface 2 was fine was a fine
upgrade from the first surface I'm
hoping to see a new design from that
open and see you know a little bit more
powerful specs a little bit more
thoughtfulness on Microsoft Microsoft's
part and designing that you know it's
pretty good but it just didn't didn't
push it far enough above the first
surface you'll probably see you know new
Nexus tablets um I still feel like isn't
there like a stock pile of surfaces like
buried in like the Nevada desert on it
but I also don't really have a sense
that it's that it's did what they wanted
it yeah I don't think it did I mean I
think I think you're touching on
something that's I think you're right
about that I think I think it's it's
kind of a weird thing because it's a
Productivity tablet but it's also it's
not that powerful so it's a you know it
has to like the kickstand so it's not it
you know you have it on your lap or
something like that it's not really that
comfortable you always do the lap test
let's turn it into wearable tech at that
point all right well thanks so much Eric
for talking to me for doing some hello
Tom Donald with Donald Bell and Eric
Franklin
we are going to have more coverage here
at CES and you can stay tuned for all of
it at CES CNN comm we've got Bill
Detweiler heading to the stage shortly
to break apart another expensive device
and cracking open it so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
