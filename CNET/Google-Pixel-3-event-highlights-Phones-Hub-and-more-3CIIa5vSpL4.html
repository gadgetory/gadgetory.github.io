intersection of AI software and hardware

how to poach an egg now I'd like to tell
you a little bit more about YouTube on
hub the YouTube experience has been

dollars and it's also available on
October 22nd at retail locations here in
the US UK and Australia and today we're
sharing a new chapter for our vision for
Chrome OS with the launch of Google
pixel slate
here's Tron to tell you a little bit
more about it
Google pixel slate is a completely new
experience giving you powerful
productivity in a fresh mobile form
something that isn't a laptop trying to
be a tablet because who wants a fan of
their tablet or a tablet that's really a
phone pretending to be a computer we
design pixel slate to be both thin and
light it's crafted with beautiful lines
and rounded edges in a stylish midnight
blue it has a perfectly balanced center
of gravity so it's incredibly
comfortable to hold pixel slate is
engineered with a stunning detailed
display so sitting back to enjoy a movie
is better than ever
it has 293 pixels per inch that's 6
million pixels for the sharpest picture
in the category to get to this level of
quality pixel slate uses a custom
display with low-temperature
polycrystalline silicon technology which
allows for a hundred times faster
movement of electrons versus a standard
display as a result you can efficiently
light up a massive number of pixels your
movies photos and games will be stunning
in vibrant colors and brilliant
resolution it's designed to be as
versatile as you are with a desktop
operating system a full keyboard and
trackpad a brilliant display and the
mobility and app support of a tablet
pixel slate comes in several
configurations starting at 599 pixel
slate keyboard is $1.99 and picks a book
pen now in matching midnight blue is $99
all three will be available later this
year on the Google store and at major
retailers in the US Canada and the UK
finally it's time to talk about phones
Google pixel three is designed from the
inside out to be the smartest most
useful device in your life it's a phone
that can answer itself a camera that
won't miss a shot and there's a whole
new experience when it's charging pixel
three was built with exceptionally
beautiful and thoughtful design choices
it feels great to the touch and light in
your hand the matte finish on the all
glass back is the first of its kind it
carries over our iconic two-tone design
while providing a beautiful silky
texture that helps avoid fingerprints we
developed a new etching process that
allows for both matte and glossy
textures on the same piece of curved
glass with smooth lines and seamless
transitions pixel three comes in three
colors just black clearly white and a
new color which is not pink the new
pixel comes in two display sizes the
five and a half inch pixel 3 and the 6
point 3 inch pixel three XL both of them
share the same features but we know
users who want a bigger phone really
want a bigger screen so we've designed
pixel 3 excels screen to extend all the
way to the upper corners giving users an
edge-to-edge viewing experience with
some extra extra useful space at the top
the flexible OLED is the best pixel
display ever the new adaptive color
profile provides a bright vibrant and
viewing experience from any angle and in
any lighting both phones have bigger
screens than last year's pixel and a
larger screen to body ratio they feel
smaller and more comfortable to hold and
we're going even further to help you
with phone calls with our new call
screen feature let's say you're at
dinner with runs or in a meeting at work
and a call comes in it could be
something important and you can't or
don't want to pick up just tap the
screen call button and your phone will
answer for you and ask who's calling and
why as you can see here the trip
conversation is transcribed in real
on your screen you can decide whether to
pick up Sena quick reply or mark the
cost spam you'll never have to talk to
