Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas at CES and I'm
here with the net atmo welcome
so the welcome is the newest product
from device maker netatmo it's a Wi-Fi
security camera that will do Full HD it
has a 130 degree field of view and it
even has night vision the coolest thing
about this though is that it has face
recognition it'll know who you are it'll
know who your kid is and it'll keep
track of whether you're home or whether
your kids home in its app dashboard for
both iOS and Android you can customize
alerts so when a new person comes you
can know about it instantly you can tell
the system who that person is and
because it's compatible with if and has
face recognition well when your kid gets
home you can have the TV locked down via
a recipe until you arrive home as well
and make sure hey they're doing their
homework looks like you're gonna have to
train the system a little bit over time
it'll recognize at different angles
it also has entirely local storage so
via an SD card if you swap out the SD
card you might have to train the system
all over again but depending on how big
of an SD card you put in there it'll
help roll those footage and those video
clips for you and it'll always record
five seconds before trigger and five
seconds after trigger so whenever
there's movement
it'll have it so again having face
recognition and having an app to help
you keep track of who's coming and going
is a really great idea
I've got a couple of questions about how
well it works since it might not be able
to see people going so clearly and it
might timeout if they're sitting at home
so after a couple of hours it might
forget that your wife has been here the
whole time it just hasn't gone near the
front door but this shows a lot of
promise and I'm excited to see what if
can do with a device that actually
recognizes who you are and who your
family is
at fabulous Las Vegas at CES with the
netatmo welcome i'm andrew Gebhardt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
