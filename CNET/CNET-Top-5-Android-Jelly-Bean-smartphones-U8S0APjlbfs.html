is android 4.1 also known as jelly bean
ice cream sandwich is so 2012 right now
it's all about the beam on thamma Bell
and in this week's top 5 i'm counting
down cnet's top 5 android smartphones
ranked by cnet senior editor Jessica
dole court that either ship with
jellybean installed offer a 4.1 update
starting off the list is the motorola
droid razr maxx HD the very popular
phone with the road warriors because
that long-lasting battery life they also
get a beautiful 4.7 inch AMOLED screen a
dual-core processor and a recent update
brings this tough guy up to Android 4.1
making it one mean bean machine at
number four the samsung galaxy note 2
now if the razr maxx HD is in max enough
for you how about a smartphone with a
5.5 inch screen the note 2 is one of the
first smartphones to ship with jelly
bean and it's on every major US carrier
personally I feel like a child when I
pick this thing up but if anyone
questions your masculinity on this one
you can always impress them with the
size of your stylus but for the android
fans who want nothing less than the
purest jelly bean experience there's
number 3 the LG Nexus 4 latest in
google's nexus branded phones runs
android 4.2 point one making it the most
cutting-edge phone in terms of software
version and because it receives its
updates straight from the google
mothership you'll be able to ride that
cutting edge for quite a while the
number two phone on this list needs
little introduction it's the samsung
galaxy s3 cnet's highest-rated android
phone of 2012 and the product most
frequently mentioned by Tim Cook as the
angrily shakes is fist into the air it's
an extremely popular phone is available
on every major US carrier and the recent
infusion of Android 4.1 just keeps that
momentum going that said if you want the
best most powerful jellybean experience
out there our number one pick goes to
the HTC droid DNA on verizon quad-core
snapdragon processor on this guy is
currently the fastest available on any
smartphone we've ever tested add that up
with verizon's 4g a beautiful eight
penge pixel camera good battery life and
the fact that it runs android 4.1 out of
the
box and you've got the best of the beans
right here so there you go five killer
smart phones running android jelly bean
that you can go out and buy right now
