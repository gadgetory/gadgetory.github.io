iPhone 4 or so you might think with all
the breathless hype that seems to be
even more over torqued around the launch
of this iPhone maybe it's the fact that
the lost prototype triggered a response
typically only seen in Central American
Republic's around voting time or that it
arrives in an era of smartphone and
tablet fever
but whatever the reason we're gonna cut
against the grain this is top 5 reasons
to pass on the iPhone 4 number 5 no 4G
in spite of some numerical similarity in
the naming the iPhone 4 does not run on
a 4G network
that might just be theoretically
interesting if it weren't for Sprint's
Evo 4G that phone does use the more
advanced Network and AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon
will light up their 4G networks and
phones in the months ahead then we're
all gonna be reminded why 3G isn't
really broadband yet that's all your
iPhone 4 will handle number 4 goodbye
unlimited data AT&amp;amp;T is no longer writing
new contracts with unlimited flat rate
data so if you change carriers to come
over and get an iPhone 4 you're gonna
have to pay some kind of tiered pricing
for data with all the complication and
vigilance against overage charges that
go with that I don't like it number 3
Verizon yeah yeah I know an iPhone on
Verizon has been just around the corner
about as long as Lindsay Lohan's
sobriety but we really really think the
iPhone could be coming to Verizon in
less than a year and that's almost too
good to imagine number 2 the flipside of
number 3 two more years of AT&amp;amp;T and
their new-hire 325 dollar early
termination fee I know
AT&amp;amp;T works fine for many of you but they
didn't become the but of all wireless
industry jokes by accident sure maybe
18t does handle several times more
wireless data than any other carrier and
it still isn't my problem fix your
network but the time for that passed
years ago now it's time for you and me
to spend our wireless dollars ethically
before we get to the number one reason
you can yawn at the Apple fanboys as
they stand in line let's take a quick
peek at the two smartphones
CNET thinks are as good or better than
what the Apple guys carry the HTC Droid
Incredible runs on Verizon and the Evo
4G found on Sprint okay at number one
the top reason yet don't need to rush
out and get all lathered up about iPhone
for Apple lied all this world-changing
stuff is kind of a crock that most of us
who do this for a living came away from
the iPhone 4 announcement thinking is
that it sure to cameras lush display
video calling multitasking HD video a4
cpu all tasty upgrades but I'd venture
to say at least half of those are
playing catch-up with the competition
and the rest don't really change the
playing field there are too many other
great smartphones out there to make a
unilateral decision so you can relax let
God and the fanboys work out the bugs on
the iPhone 4 while you wait to see what
plays out on 4G networks whatever HTC
and RIM have up their sleeves and maybe
even look for an iPhone on Verizon oh by
the way if you want the good news about
the iPhone 4 check out another top 5
here on CNET tv.com top 5 reasons to
rush out and get the iPhone 4 I see it
both ways i'm brian coulis talk to you
next time for another CNET top 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
