byte extra crunchy podcast with your
host mr. Brian Tom what's up everybody
what's up hey welcome to the show this
is another kind of it's an Apple week so
we got to keep on bringing you the
goodies this is an extra special show
because we're gonna have a sit-down
one-on-one with the great one I don't
know if you guys have heard of rumors
anything around Apple this is the man
mr. Mark Garmin with Bloomberg mark
thank you so much for coming out this is
this is a long time coming bro no no
it's it's it's my pleasure I'm happy to
be here I've been watching your stuff
for as long as I can remember how long
is that oh my god probably upwards of
seven years do you still do prizefight
you still want that stuff like a
wrestler and like your ring punching you
know yeah old school he's old school
no thanks for watching that's that's
funny and embarrassing we do prize
fights once in a while when they're like
worthy of it now but I don't dress up as
much although I do dress up on my free
on my free time in your free time yeah
my free time I think that's actually
normal normal normal here yeah so what
we want to do is bring mark into the
fold and just talk about his impressions
of everything that dropped over this
week just kind of have an open
free-flowing conversation with you about
everything so I just wanted to start off
what did you think of the event and what
were some of your highlights and
lowlights so let's just start what do
you think what do you think of the space
because I was the first time you were
there he was quit were you there
I was not there I was here in this room
you're here doing live coverage they
don't they don't invite me anymore do
you know that no what happened they
don't like how I speak my mind really
you know how they are well you're on the
good side you're on the good side but
you know that they can be interesting
I'll just I'll take the fall for that
they can be interesting but anyway so
you know the event space is awesome the
glass sort of a circular place up there
it was actually interesting I got there
around 5:00 a.m.
remember - yeah yeah I got there and
when I when I got up to the area where
the TV cameras were nobody was there yet
it wasn't really secure yet right so I
was able to walk up to the
it's circular thing the table Steve Jobs
theater and took like the first picture
of it when it was still dark out and
everyone's like how did you get up so
close to old no one was there took a
picture you took one of the first like
like videos that came out of there cuz I
remember it was it was it was trending
on a Twitter moments just let you know
it was on the Twitter moment that's
great I mean that's that's the perks of
getting there before it's light out so
awesome awesome space like it was
amazing to see it before was filled with
people exteriors all glass glass on the
top the craziest question people are
asking me how do they hold the glass on
top I don't know I'm not an architect so
stop asking me but it was uh it looks
really cool a huge huge space up there
and then you go down these stairs and
the whole building like below the top
floor is like all Marbley and you can
see like they got their their money's
worth or they spent a lot of money on
that it's sort of like if you've been to
the Apple store in London on Regent
Street how they sort of RER connected it
with a mix of modern and old school but
like high-end materials it's sort of
like that so you go down the stairs and
you walk right into the event hall and
the event hall itself is about a
thousand seats the most impressive part
in there are the seats themselves
it's these like Ferrari leather like
gents benches and chairs themselves
really nice really comfortable the best
part honestly it was that there's
outlets right because I needed to use my
iPhone after the event to sort of do I
do this gadget German now on Bloomberg
live oh you can plug a baby I mean
that's why you're here baby well okay so
check out my gadgets the German live
show there you go facebook periscope
anyways to the point needed to film the
the hands-on area afterwards so I needed
the phone to have a full charge so I'm
super happy they had plugs and I was
able to charge my phone I throughout the
event when they were talking two hours
of charge gets you pretty much up there
enough to do a Facebook livestream so
that worked out pretty well
very very nice seats and I was sort of
at the back of the auditorium and it
still had a good view the monitor was
pretty high resolution I wasn't able to
get a super good look at the projector
in the screen but people who were closer
say was you know the greatest Dolby
vision have you ever been to Adobe
cinema I have I have one here right and
I know the Metreon here they have the
yes IMAX wasn't like that but it was
nice
yeah hands on room is different sort of
hands on room than I've ever been in it
was sort of like you felt you're outside
we had to go to underground right well
the whole the the auditorium in the
hands-on room were sort of on the same
on the same level but obviously the
auditorium dips down like a stadium type
seating situation but pretty much all on
one level very nice so they had these
white tables and then they had a section
with the iPhone 8 plus then they had a
few iPhone tens very few iPhone 10 sort
of in between that the eights and eight
pluses and they had a two Apple watch or
three Apple watch series so three tables
and then in the middle they had sort of
like an array of iPhone tents they had
the same thing last year and seven and
seven plus came out really good pictures
lighting the Lighting's really even and
bright and not like over saturate there
it's like you can get some that's
deliberate obvious you were outside you
liked it felt like you were outside
that's very cool so here let me ask you
right off the bat like what were your
everyone's talking about the iPhone X so
they have a different I phone 10 Brian
iPhone 10 I'm gonna call it iPhone X
this is why you don't get invited what
everyone has their thoughts about the 10
yes well what do you what do you what
are your thoughts on what is your take
on it I'll think about that are you are
you are you going to 56 yeah probably
yeah I mean okay so what they did here
was really interesting in terms of the
capacities they got rid of the 32 and
they got rid of the 128 so you're either
getting 64 gigabyte which is not enough
or are you getting 256 gigabytes which
is too much so what there's clearly
doing here is they're pushing people to
go on the high-end one 256 is great I
use about a hundred gigs so in a normal
circumstance I would go for the hundred
28 but they don't have that version
anymore so I'm gonna go 256 even with
iOS 11 and they're better compression of
everything it 256 is I don't want to
feel crammed yeah I know you never want
to feel like you've I always hate it
when you have to unload like photos like
you start deleting pictures and stuff
just cuz right I mean I take a lot of
selfies and stuff so but yeah I mean did
you like the phone it's nice it's the
screen really pops it's like I saw few
people describe it as like a punchy
colourful
screen I agree with that the OLED is
nice but to be honest the screen didn't
seem that much better than the one on
the 8 and the 8 plus or even the 7 1 7
print as you are it didn't seem that
much better but again it's a little bit
better it's an OLED screen it gives them
more flexibility maybe the colors will
look better over time with the software
remember at this point phones are all
software software's wait you're coming
for them so here's the thing when we
talk about software I'm not a fan again
for the record let's be clear I am going
to get an X a 10 I know it bothers you
that I say X does it I see your eyes
does not bother don't call it X right
here I won't say it but that notch that
notch to me on the top visually it
bothers me there's a camp that says who
cares get over it don't worry about it
but I just um I always felt when I saw
it even in the early renders and the
stuff that was leaked and you know the
information that was out there I just
think it would look so much better it's
the clear black bar across I know that
they they have their own reasons maybe
stylistically they wanted to look
different or whatever yeah the sensors
are all there I don't care about that
but I just wanted a clean black line and
I just think it it's kind of an eyesore
did it bother you at all or as you've
seen some people said when they were
there now that they look at it a couple
days later it bothers them right
sometimes it takes people's hot take to
turn into what they really feel like
right what do you think of the knotch
personally yeah I don't care for it it's
there you see it you get over it I've
been using this essential phone have you
seen that phone mm-hmm so you get over
that one pretty easily as well and they
do some tricks to hide it especially the
central an Apple doesn't hide it yeah
that's what I'm saying right which is
it's an interesting move I mean I see
some people up there Apple bloggers
whatever you want to call them that you
know our self-described design machine
Otto's who you know or are trying to you
know you know tell Apple design to you
who's done all this stuff you know how
they should design there's a reason they
did a was deliberate they've been
working on this for many years so they
felt this was the way to go it doesn't
distract me at all I mean honestly like
when you watch video before you
double-click to fill the screen sort of
black bars to distract it and you're
getting a little bit more screen area
right if they eliminated the black bars
I mean it's all software right
they could decide that in iOS well of
next year they want the knotch to look
differently they want it to be sort of a
seamless thing they could do that it's
all software all they have to do is just
change the status bar structure so maybe
they'll shift to that who knows but for
now this is what they're doing and
someone at Apple was telling me that
they sort of want developers to lead the
way on this so developers are going to
be able to design their apps however
they want just because obviously the SDK
is so versatile and if a lot of
developers are moving to a direction it
sort of hides the notch maybe Apple and
move toward that direction as well I
think we're in the early innings here
with it with the notch which I honestly
don't think it's that big of a deal you
know I get over at Brian get over the
knotch it's not only you I mean there's
lots of people and I'm just coming at
that perspective just as a consumer like
it doesn't bother me I'm like I'm so
down on this cutting edge tech you know
the slimmer bezels and whatnot I think I
think the phone's awesome for my brief
15-20 minutes of usage the face ID is
fantastic that's what I wanted to talk
to you about you got to use it it's
still not and this isn't we're not
trying to knock here it's still not as
fast as touch ID though is that correct
like from your experiences there what
did you feel like it's different so
touch ID is something that you have to
do you put your thumb on the fun print
you click the button it's super easy
seamless I was making a Apple pay line I
was like well that's awesome
now that you see the the comparison and
what else is coming right but the face
IDs a little bit different you don't do
anything it's just when you're holding
the phone it just knows it's you and
then you slide to unlock and you're in
right so it's not an action that you
have to do this the phone it's sort of
an ambient security type of deal where
it knows it's you just by looking at it
so I think people are going to stop
eventually after using these things for
a few months feeling like they're doing
something to unlock the phone they're
gonna just start using the phone
I saw a few other people talking about
how face ID sort of you know this is
something okay let me step back yeah I
saw some people saying that Apple didn't
want to ever have touch ID on the iPhone
10 that the face ID was sort of a
deliberate decision from the very
beginning that's that makes no sense to
me obviously Apple wanted to have touch
ID on this thing from the beginning they
weren't able to get it done it was not
working properly they couldn't get it in
high supply under this
play so they move to face idea my
thinking is they wanted to have both on
this why not right because to your point
about it taking longer did you face it
even touch ID I disagree with you on the
unlocking portion but everything else
I'm in complete agreement with you
whether that's unlocking an app like
mint or etrade those are the two demo
apps they had on at the hands-on area or
making an apple paper just in having to
click the side button twice then I think
to get your face so unlocking I think
it's better than touch ID but everything
else which is still a big part of the
equation the big part of the story it
takes a couple more milliseconds or
seconds you want to say so I think the
ideal situation is they would have face
idea for this ambient unlocking as well
as using that same sensor for the an
emoji feature which I'm sure will get
you and I'm sure you would love I think
that features is fine for you you know
it's sure I'm not buying the phone for
the an emoji yes it's there I'll use it
okay are you fine actually you know when
you talked about it has the latest
technology I'm gonna get that phone I
looked in your eyes and I saw an emojis
yeah that's really that's what you were
really reporting out literally it's like
bursting out of your it's gotta be the
poopoo yeah but and I think they would
wanted the in screen touch ID for Apple
pay and for making purchases and whatnot
or you could choose the two of you want
but having both that would be pretty you
know cutting-edge as well so I think
that's what they wanted they couldn't
get it done and face ID and it's fine on
the other stuff but yeah I think do you
think that look we always have to
preface this cuz sometimes people get
mad like we're lucky to be able to just
talk about this stuff have fun with it
give our opinions and thoughts on it
we're not the actual people that are
making this and you know how much work
and how much skill and how hard it is to
make this stuff deadlines the timelines
things happen during the product cycle
do you feel like we know that they you
know all do a lot of your reporting
specifically alluded the fact of you
know the fingerprints sensor under the
screen did when you see the final
product today do you feel like if you
ask someone deep down inside at Apple
does this feel like really more of like
a iPhone 9.5 than a full 10 you know
what I mean if if what do you what are
your what do you feel you know it's
Marketing right totally totally the ten
is representative of so many things they
said the ten in the name represents the
next ten years but whatever that's just
what they have therefore their tagline
right the reality is is that this is a
big upgrade over the iPhone 7 plus if
they I think there's a two things going
on here if they didn't Kim won't come
out with the iPhone 10 and they only
came out with the eight and eight plus
the other day that would be a disaster
based on the competitive land that would
have been a horrible disaster all right
but if they only came out with the
iPhone 10 it also would have been bad
because of the very short supply and the
higher price so I think the eight and
eight plus are sort of you know
mitigating that that that space between
when these things are going on sale how
much they're gonna cost and what the
supply is gonna be these things are
going to be very hard to find up through
probably the first quarter or second
quarter even of 2018 and I think it's
very interesting because eventually
they're gonna not want to sell these
eight and eight plus designs remember
the iPhone 8 design is the same design
as the iPhone 6
other than the glass back that came out
in 2014 so that's using the same design
in new generation products for for life
cycles something they really haven't
done but here we have the iPhone 10 as
well and I think it's it's a big step up
from the from the 7 plus I feel like if
I I i feel like i would not upgrade from
the 7 plus to the 8 plus but i feel like
going from the 7 plus the 10 is a
significant upgrade what's your what's
your daily driver right now for you
personally so 7 plus it's uh it's jet
black one right here it is scratched up
I've never seen your no case guy from
what I can tell I'm a no case you're
right not an on the case here's the
thing Brian I always buy you always buy
a new case every year maybe two
different colors and whatnot don't ever
use them never no never never actually
that's a good point a lot of people been
asking me I'm sure you beginning the
same questions will the iPhone 8 plus
and 10 with the wireless charging work
when it's in a case so yes yes there's a
Belkin in the tech specs on the Belkin
posting it did say it should work with a
case that's around three millimeters or
around three millimeters which is pretty
much almost every case yeah or like some
super metallic one maybe they're you
know
yeah maybe a metallic one that might
block that that charge so
we're gonna come back in a second we

slash crunchy we keep it Munchie here
thanks Jim all right buddy back to it uh
we talked a lot about let me think if
there's anything I phone that we didn't
cover Oh what do you think did you think
Apple was going a little crazy with the
marketing names this year like I felt
like they were really overextending with
like the 11 Bionic and like the super
Retina to split I know they have
typically I just feel like they're a
little more elegant when they said like
a 11 Bionic neural engine I'm like bro
that's like five or six syllables for
your little marketing speak they need to
tighten that up it's an interesting
shift isn't it right now super Retina
display feels like out of a cartoon or
something but I also I also think
they're trying to appeal more to this a
lot of people call the Millennials right
I'm not a fan of that term I don't think
it really means much you know that
doesn't represent me that's that is a
derogatory term like you know what you
know some people it is but it's clear
that they're appealing to those types of
peoples and have you seen the ads that
they're doing now they did this last
year in this year where it's these ads
where they splash the device colors
people running around in the different
words describing it really bad yeah
they're basically snapchat and Instagram
and Facebook bite-size sort of product
teasers and previews and I think those
crazy names like Bionic and neural
Engine and super duper super turbo
Retina Display 3 now you know ads that's
the general theme when we talk about
Millennials and who they're appealing to
I think over the past two keynotes
specifically it's interesting because
last year they spent a lot of time on
messages right and a lot and you know if
you talk about what feature did they
spend the most time on I had to look at
a clock I'm pretty sure was the aunt
emojis I'm pretty sure and so I think
it's interesting because see from a
standpoint of people who love technology
we know Apple loves technology obviously
they're in this business but also
they're in the business of the
mainstream consumer now and I just find
it interesting that a keynote how they
spend a lot of time on things like
messages and an emojis and yes they are
fun and they're part of the ecosystem
but you know they they didn't really
talk about maybe they didn't think it
was sexy enough Bluetooth 5.0 they
really didn't address quick charging USB
see click charging in the keynote and
they didn't really talk about I think it
would been interesting to get a little
more in-depth about dude we have a we're
recording 4k video at 60 frames per
second some of those things that I I
felt like in past keynotes that were
more about the beef of the tech in it I
think it's now pushed aside a little bit
and beat and pushed towards like hey we
have an emojis more because it's about
the ecosystem keeping people in that
ecosystem it's not less about the device
but there's a higher priority to just
keeping people in the Apple ecosystem in
not jumping over with things like that
I've noticed that as well and I think it
makes sense given they're no longer
appealing to you and I five years ago
where they have this loyal base and
they're coming up with products for this
base now they're trying to grow that
base to everyone who would buy a phone
and the market size for a smart phone is
billions of people so that's what they
have to appeal to it and that's what
they're doing can they do more of both
yes but you know for this one I think it
was such a big move the 10 that they
they have to focus more on what you know
not you and I want but everyone else I
didn't get your verdict on emojis yay or
nay I'm never gonna use them are you
sure
okay I'll try it if I send you an an
emoji I think you're gonna an emoji me
back like I'll choke you so I'll
probably get an an emoji and just get
like frustrated okay I'm over this Beach
are you down with the animo geez same
camp he isn't probably to use it once or
twice to be like okay that's how it
works you'll never use it again it's
like it's a proof of concept of what
could be college yeah you know when we
talk about let's talk about someone like
the cool tech and all the sensors inside
that that that hold not although I may
not like it visually how they handle it
the potential of what it can do not only
be this is just the you know scraping
the surface which Apple does a lot with
their early early models the first time
they rollout tech but you know you could
see this face recognition may be more
easily being used to unlock like doors
or you know home smart stuff security
stuff it's not integrated into yet we'll
see how much they give to the the API to
developers but I think there's a lot of
power with what their face recognition
is doing compared to what we've seen
from other companies just what what it
actually can do ya know I mean there's a
lot to do there I'm honestly really
excited to see what developers are gonna
do the AR stuff is going to be
interesting how that plays and could
have they done more I think they could
have done much more in terms of first
party stuff but with that camera I think
setting setting the stage taking a lead
on it is something they should have done
more other than an emojis obviously yeah
yeah no really
ya know face ID they showed it with
Apple pay they showed it with basically
what you were able to do with touch ID
already plus an emojis it would have
been nice to push the technology a
little bit further did you people were
complaining
I think everyone over reacts and we
poked fun at the fact that people are
overreacting at the fact that face ID
had a hiccup onstage and you know right
instantly everyone comes at Apple like
it didn't work it didn't work and then
when you kind of look back at it it
wasn't that it necessarily didn't work
it might have been it was set off and
then you had to put in your password
what what were your thoughts on that
because I'm sure people were hitting you
up about that yeah don't face ID sucks
it doesn't work so yeah my take is very
simple it was the tech okay I get that
it was the technology okay it failed by
design yes exactly it failed by design
but using that
as a defense for the demo hiccup is not
okay it's not an excuse
Apple is a trillion dollar company they
practice these things a lot they
probably went through that demo upwards
of 50 times over the last few weeks
they've been testing this thing for
multiple years probably two to four
years they know that they have that
design failsafe in their touch ID has
had the same failsafe so that's great it
did not work by design it wasn't a flaw
but it was a flaw in the demo that they
should have taken account for they
should have known was possible so people
defending a trillion dollar company
messing up in their demo by saying it
was the technology's fault it's not fair
just deal with it live with it
face ID works it works by design it is
super quick it is awesome I actually set
it up on one of the demo phones for some
reason yeah employee in there let me
maybe that's what I'm good at so I set
up the face unlock you spin your head
around once spinning around again and it
works awesome it's quick its seamless
the eye thing is really interesting you
look away then you look at it yeah I
thought that was really cool so it's
doing multiple things it's scanning your
face but it also has eyes scanning to
augment that which is which is really
interesting so it's sort of a two-factor
ish type of thing you know I'll go all
the way and say yes it is a two-factor
type of face face and eyeball indication
no no that's what it is and it's quick
it works well unfortunately demo didn't
work but here we are take it from me it
works do you have any other thoughts on
the iPhone before we move on that you
wanted that you didn't get to or that
you wanted to talk about I wish it was
coming out sooner than November way it
gives people time to save up that really
want it and you know the whole premise I
always found it silly that people were
complaining right they see this headline
that was literally I remember it being
talked about the iPhone might be $1000
arguably I think in like six or seven
months ago but right you get sometimes
mainstream newspaper outlets that put
that headline out a week before the
announcement just to kind of get people
all riled up and who are you calling out
here Brian
I will not name those outlets but you
know the mainstream outlets that got
people all in a fussy about it and we
talked about this before I talk to my
friends look most of us in our pockets
have a phone roughly around seven eight
hundred dollars already yeah and if you
really want that device you're telling
me you're not gonna pay about 10 to 15
more dollars a month if you really want
that device yeah yeah if that right so
this whole argument that $1,000 it's
like then when Apple showed their lineup
of phones available then I'm like okay
they do have a price point for every
phone but it was too much like it was
ten eight seven six se that was like
that was a lot yeah like a six being
there that's yeah that's what I was
surprised about that they kept the
success in addition to the 7s and
whatnot
who knows why they did that but I know
they can clear out I know that if
they've said or they've always been like
okay we're off in these cheaper phones
for different countries whatnot it's not
like the iPhone is blowing up in third
world country you know third world
countries per se I mean overseas it does
well but it's not nearly as popular as
here in the US what do you think of the
$350 price on the SE I think it's good
for kit for like for someone like if I
had a niece or nephew and they were
gonna get a phone there's no way in hell
you know or if I did have kids that I
was gonna be giving them a iPhone ten or
eight or seven maybe it was that was
that one at $5.99 I think yeah anything
yeah maybe maybe it depends how good a
kid they are
I think the plus yeah so that was that
was cool um Apple watch yeah I liked you
know even though they did what they had
to do meaning just putting LTE in the
Apple watch I'd use the word lightly but
I thought it has the potential at least
from that first up to be the most quote
unquote I know I don't like to over blow
this transform a device because it's
like although it's only an hour of call
time I'm gonna try I bought one last
night because I wear an Apple watch
right now really more for like I like
the looks of it I haven't charges thing
in three or four days good
I don't like charging it it's annoying
but going to a movie and not bringing my
phone maybe or especially going to work
out and not having a phone I want to see
if I'll actually do that if it actually
will supplant and be able to fit in my
life what do you think about the Apple
watch you don't have to agree it did you
like it or what do you think it wasn't a
big upgrade other than the LTE but again
the LTE itself is a big upgrade it
wasn't we know other phones other
watches have had LT for quite some time
right yeah one hour pretty pretty pretty
pretty week here's a scoop for you and
yeah yeah baby so you saw the Lake Tahoe
demo yes so she actually fell off the
paddle board in some of the rehearsals
before really yeah you keep your big
scoops for you okay you get you could
drop as little nuggets here sure so we
won't parse this out and the headline
will be lady on paddle board at Apple
Keynote fell off the paddle board that
will not be a headline or a story
although that's in this day and age it
happens like that but you know what a
cool thing would have been is if she was
on the phone and then she fell off still
and she got off on the pad weren't you
stolen that would have been that would
have been cool probably people would
have said all that was intentional but
maybe it would have been did you create
real quick you know what just struck me
about the Apple watch is it's really
cool you can get phone calls and stuff
while you're on the go while you're out
enjoying your life you know but I'm
watching this this commercial or I was
watching this this commercial here and
this two dudes like surfing he's having
a beautiful it's just out there enjoying
nature and just beautiful call like it's
gonna take you out of your old beautiful
serene nature thing you know I just
thought that was funny I just wanted to
point you're expecting this like
dramatic turn oh look I surf
there's no way oh it would be worse you
sir the phone while you're at a Rip Curl
no no no no so funny so uh that was fun
Apple TV with it did you pre-order
anything yes here's my yeah yeah I want
to tell ya I fell asleep like at 11:50
p.m. I was like I put my head down for
one minute
like 11:50 goodnight with Garmin not
gadget right yeah yeah but then the
thing the thing is that most of the
products were actually available still
it wasn't like yeah I shall waste time
it was super battery comes out next
month I'll hit you up on text and just
be like yo Angie wake up that way if I
honestly wanted to preorder something I
want to fall honestly yeah I would have
been fine but it happened and I'm not
gonna get an 8 I'm not gonna get an 8
plus the 4k Apple TV so I have a 4k Sony
very happy with the quality on the
current Apple TV I don't see the need to
upgrade bit maybe if I go to someone's
house and they have the 4k Apple TV and
I'll see it in action they did not have
a demo of the 4k Apple TV no not at all
as far as I saw in the hands-on area
that may have convinced me if I saw it
in action but uh maybe I'll check it out
at the Apple Store if they ever put it
up there Best Buy or something did you
expect more things like for example I
I've always kind of been a critic of it
but I wish I've always wit it's more
because I wish Siri was better and
smarter and I know it's doing more
things they didn't really show that it
really could do much at WWDC I thought
maybe we'd see something here at this
event just because it's phone and Siri
were there any things serene or an
answer that you thought or you were
hoping I know you know so much but that
you were hoping to see a little more of
the or that Apple could have brought to
light to help their case whether it was
home pod or whatever you would have been
nice to see a home pod demo because
they've been saying or hinting that
there's more to come on the home pod but
you know would've been nice they would
have demoed it I don't think they are
gonna hold another event specifically
for the home pot maybe they'll have
another event later in the year that has
the home pod a bunch of other stuff but
I think they can just put a bunch of
features online or briefings or some
videos on YouTube they're using a lot of
YouTube and Twitter you know it's been
days so let's see what they do with that
the you are the source man like you're
honest I mean I've been giving you props
since day one quite honestly let's be
real
and our shows there's plenty of times
right this is the mark Garmin show oh no
no like we have outright said look you
have provided so much content for the
Internet right like I know you're just
doing your job you're digging in you're
hungry but you've literally provided
like years worth of stories and coverage
that it's fun because people want to
know about it
you're as being like the source of story
and people that you know let's be honest
I I'm I can all right say like people
recycle them and sometimes but their own
spin on them and maybe sometimes
regurgitate them and interact in
accurate or even steal them and they
don't always give you credit like does
that bother you
Wow how do you feel about that as your
the top of the food chain with this
story and then it trickles down all
these bottom feeders fine we can call
ourselves bottom feeders worth no no but
you know what it you know I'm saying
like how how does it feel kind of being
at the top of that chain though you
don't happen these days I I don't think
about it that way my my number one
priority is making sure that you know I
I get the story put it out there and
working with great people and making
sure you know me and everyone we work
together and collaborate whether it's
the work we do from San Francisco
working with the Bloomberg piers in
China and Taiwan and Asia and making
sure we're all working together and
working with great people and just
collaborating you know that's that's how
you do good work
collaborating with great other great
people I don't look at it in terms of a
competition with other publications I
feel like if we collectively and this
doesn't matter if this is when I was at
nine to five or no Bloomberg
collectively come to work each day with
excitement and work hard and you know
that's all we can do if we get beat on a
story we get beat on a story but as long
as we put the effort in and do the best
we can
that makes me me happy so you know as a
super what did you feel about the iOS 11
leak because that actually was there's
so much that was given up that took away
some of the mystery of what was
happening that the event did that bother
you or you know whether you're as a fan
reporter like it was it was just so much
and I almost felt like wow a lot of
those things that I probably would have
been more hyped up about if I saw them
on that day instead of hearing about two
days before the keynote did that type of
level of leak bother you at all or would
you have probably reported or posted the
same thing if you were given that gold
master I'm I'm just curious you know
that's a good question and obviously I
have a little bit of bias in this
situation because this was a scoop that
was done by 9:00 to 5:00 Mack where I
you know I helped you able to build that
yeah baby well I mean there's Seth
Weintraub owner of the 905 sites gets
all the credit but obviously I played a
very fairly significant part at least on
the nine if I max out on the Apple side
he does great work on Google and
electric cars and Amazon toys and all
that but great scoop for them the and I
tweeted this after their story the the
site nine of five is built and sort of
the fundamental element of it is very
hardworking reporters who always want to
get the story first get the information
out there and are willing to work at all
hours work very hard and collaborate and
that is what that Iowa's Levin scoop is
representative of other publications got
that scoop as well got that news but the
fact that 905 knew exactly what to do
with it knew how to drill down on it and
they were able to make that judgment
call in that decision whether or not to
move forward with the story or not and
always doing it in a very timely manner
and being respectful of the situation
and knowing the limits I think they did
a really fantastic and admirable job on
that
and so I'm if it means anything I'm very
proud of them it worked out well I saw a
lot of criticism of the scoop and people
calling it malicious and people saying
oh the person who leaked this let down
their teammates groomers and you know
and everyone just blame everyone because
this came out and this is other people
who cover or claim to be members of the
media saying this that's a little
disingenuous I told it is there's
there's a jealousy factor that comes
with criticizing that too right let's be
honest right sure like in the
competitive landscape this like you said
the scoop is what matters
yeah right this is what matters that's
why people go that's why people go to
these sites you know go to the sites to
get the information that they want it's
the scoop and if you miss the scoop you
know it reflects poorly on yourself
because I feel like anytime I miss a
scoop in the rare occasions I do I think
personally I always ask you know myself
and those around me what could have I
done better what could have we done
better who could who we talked to you to
get that story because you know you talk
about this food chain I disagree with it
meaning much externally but internally
obviously you know you want to be you
you want to be the best you want to get
the stories out you want to collaborate
so getting the scoop is very important
that's the name of the game that's how
you build up a reputation that's how you
expand your career that's how you grow
that's how you build up a website in our
following and you know that's what we do
at Bloomberg obviously the best news
organization in the world because of
that you know decision that scoops are
very important and I'm very proud and
honored to be part of that that's a good
plug too I enjoy my work at Cena but I
don't have a elegant sentence like that
before we wrap up sure thank you so much
for your time of course you'd want to
talk about one more thing do you one
more thing well actually I wonder about
way more things than one more thing we
can talk it forever it's Apple and
Samsung competitively there's always
this back and forth between them you
know Android community there's more than
just one manufacturer but they've done
so many of these things Apple has their
own polish and their way a presentation
that makes it different in the way that
they give it to the consumer the did
Apple or Samsung this year do anything
to change the market dynamic or really
are we locked into the ecosystems for
the most part of who's using what phone
yeah nothing's changed it's just they
both have gotten better and more
polished to your to your point is the
iPhone 10 a gigantic leap over anything
we've seen before no is the note eight
or the Samsung sa a gigantic leap over
we've had before well I guess the note
is a gigantic lead over the note seven
because they buy it
but burn yeah but other than that no
these are not huge leaps forward but
they're showing a continued dedication
to the product line and showing the
smart phones gonna be around for a very
long time I don't think we're gonna see
a big leap in any major technology until
2019
all right last two questions I know and
Mark knows we have some fun beef on
Twitter between Laker nation
dub nation was waiting for this what
what's your projection for Lakers this
season 82 and oh no just kidding my
inner Lavar ball la defenders the
d-league team or the oh my prediction 39
and whatever the other I don't know 39
wins I was gonna be modest and say 81
and 1 for the Warriors I'm gonna go with
71 wins with the dubs this year really
yeah that's about what I would say I
think they're gonna actually be better
than last year but they won't exert
themselves as much in the process what I
just felt like 58 wins they'd still win
the title baby you really think we're
gonna win again this year yeah probably
well yeah the only reason why I say that
is because this is a fool they've been
with that team for a full year it's
gonna be even crazier this year just
because of the familiarity dude it's
it's crazy like I feel spoiled as a fan
like there's people that just started
watching the Warriors two years ago that
have no idea what real basketball looks
like yeah this is not basketball we're
watching no it's pretty amazing um last
question yeah okay who's in the finals
I'm still gonna say I think the Cavs are
gonna pull off some sort of a trade
during the season I'm gonna say calves
calves or you're still I don't think
Boston's gonna be able to do it yo no no
I agree
Cavs warriors I take his word one for
two for one okay I'll give a LeBron a
game all right whatever okay for two
okay LeBron leaves Cleveland signs with
the Lakers whoo it's good the writing's
on the wall man yeah
Paul George joins him in LA would you
rather have Paul George or Russell
Westbrook I was Paul George Paul George
I'm huge and Russell but he's does that
mean oh yeah yes he's a beast though I
love that guy okay I know you have to
get going
do you have a favorite I like this also
I'm a foodie guy like you have a
favorite restaurant or maybe a favorite
place you ate recently that you would
say you guys have to check this out
you know I can't I can't think of a name
for anybody like sushi okay you have any
recommendations they'll be great there's
this hot spot called Junie but it takes
like three months to get into just got
Michelin Rail rated what if I tell them
I know you you'll still have to go
through their reservation system no they
six months instead of three months they
might do that all right everybody I just
want to say thank you so much to mark
