there that are trapped on cassette tape
to rescue them I'm going to show you my
preferred method for turning tapes into
mp3s now there are dozens of ways to do
this but I like this one because it's
free and it's fast first step make sure
you're dealing with a recording that you
can't easily buy on CD or mp3 check eBay
check iTunes but avoid the hassle of
converting if you can next find the tape
deck in the best case scenario you can
find one like this one that has RCA
outputs and is in good condition
an old walkman will do too if you're not
too picky now figure out how the deck is
going to connect to your computer in
this case I have RCA output coming out
of the tape deck and a mini Jack stereo
mic going into the PC if you have an
older PC with a blue line input that's
the preferred way to go if your computer
doesn't have a line input like this Mac
you'll need to get a USB audio adapter
don't go overboard you can find
solutions for under $50 next install a
free program called audacity which is
available for both Mac and PC once
that's installed let's do a sample
recording to make sure everything is
working check up here to make sure that
the recording input is set to where the
tape deck is connected if you're using
the mic input turn that mic gain all the
way down to line level now hit record
and hit play on the tape deck and if all
goes well you should see the waveform of
the tapes audio right in front of you
after a few seconds hit stop and listen
back to the recording to make sure it
sounds ok
assuming it does you're ready to do the
whole thing rewind the tape hit record
on audacity press play on the tape and
now just let the whole side play through
don't forget to stop recording when it's
over now listen back to the recording to
make sure everything checks out
to maximize the volume I'm going to go
into the Edit menu and select all and
then go into the effect menu and select
amplify by default it will set itself to
the maximum amount this recording can be
boosted before distorting hit okay
next comes the real pro move that will
cut the project time in half instead of
individually copying and pasting each
song into its own file we're going to
drop markers at the beginning of each
song and then export them all in one
batch
I'll find the beginning of the first
song and click on the waveform to place
the cursor there then go to the tracks
menu and select add label at selection
since this is the first song I'll label
it number one now do this for the rest
of the tracks
numbering them as you go typically you
can eyeball this by looking at the
spaces between tracks but be sure to
double-check your markers a dramatic
pause in the middle of a song can easily
fake you out if you want to do this
really fast learn the keyboard shortcut
for adding a label on a PC control B
will let you fly through this when you
get to the end trim the silence off of
the last track by selecting the silence
and hitting delete finally use the
export multiple command in the file menu
you'll see an intimidating screen of
options but all you need to worry about
is that the export format is set to wave
and that the export location is
somewhere handy I would opt for a new
folder on your desktop hit export and
you'll be shown a series of windows
where you can enter and track
information I have a better method for
adding track information which I'll show
you at the end so for now make sure that
the numbers you labeled each track
appear here as the track names if so
just hit OK on each one of them to close
them now audacity will export individual
WAV files for each of the tracks you
labeled on side a now you can flip your
tape over and go through the same
recording process with side B just make
sure you pick up the numbering where you
left off at the end of side a once you
have WAV files both sides of the tape is
time to start archiving them and
converting them into mp3s now with a few
tweaks you could have it so that you're
exporting mp3s right out of audacity
me though I'm going to make iTunes my
last stop so that I can archive my high
quality wav files to CD convert to mp3
and add track info more quickly so let's
do it make a new playlist and name it
after your tape drag your files on to
this playlist to add them to iTunes and
wait for them to pull over make sure
they're in the right order and then
right click on the playlist to burn the
files to CD you'll see options here to
burn them as either an audio CD that you
can play in a CD player or a data CD
where you can copy the files to another
computer either one is fine for the job
of archiving so it's up to you burn it
label it file it away now to convert
these to mp3 go into the iTunes
preferences open the import settings and
make sure that the import format is set
to mp3 at whatever quality you want hit
OK and go back to your playlist select
all of the tracks right-click and select
create mp3 version when that's done
click on your music library and sort by
date added to see the mp3 versions of
the songs you just created at the top of
the list above the high quality wav
versions select just the mp3 versions by
holding down the shift key and then go
up to the file menu and select get info
now you can enter in the artist and
album info for all the tracks at once
and even add cover art then hit OK to
enter the individual track names select
just one of the tracks and get info go
into the info pane and enter the track
title then hit next enter the next title
all the way through to the end when
you're done hit OK that's it you're done
you have an mp3 version of your tape
plus a playlist and a backup CD of the
high-quality wav files for more tips
