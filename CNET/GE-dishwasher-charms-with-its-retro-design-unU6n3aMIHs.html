appliances you want something that looks
different or bold and maybe you have a
penchant for retro stylings take a look
at this $500 GE artistry dishwasher it
struck a chord with me because of those
old-fashioned books
it'll sounds a really nice list of
features for the price you can wash just
the upper rack or the lower rack if you
want to you can pre wash your dishes
using steam you can keep track of
everything with the countdown timer and
the wine stem holders are removable if
you need them to be I also really like
how flexible the silverware basket is
and it's quiet to boot with a rating of
only 54 decibels now this thing's a
dishwasher so you need to know if it can
clean yeah it's fine it's even better
than some more expensive models that
we've tested it's just not quite as good
as the very competent models from
Kenmore and Frigidaire that we've
reviewed recently other problems it's
not a great dryer and it doesn't have
any fold down tines so you'll need to be
creative if you want to fit in your pots
and pans you can also change the height
of your upper rack but doing so is a
pain so if the look of this thing
doesn't strike a chord with you if you
look at the front of it you say what's
the big deal Andrew you should keep
looking for a different model but if you
do prioritize style and find this retro
exterior charming this $500 GE artistry
dishwasher will handle the rest well
enough to be worth your consideration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
