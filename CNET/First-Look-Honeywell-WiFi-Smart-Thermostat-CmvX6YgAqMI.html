is the Honeywell Wi-Fi smart thermostat
it operates like a regular thermostat
but you can also control it remotely
using a web-based app or one of the free
Android or iOS mobile apps it costs two
hundred and fifty dollars which is the
same as the popular nest thermostat so
what sets it apart the most obvious
difference is its looks the nest
thermostat is round and is probably a
little bit more in-your-face with its
unique design this one looks a lot more
like your standard digital thermostat
the nest is also way more minimalist in
its display it basically just shows the
current temperature and that's it the
honeywell on the other hand has a lot of
information on its homepage it'll show
the current temperature it'll also show
the outdoor temperature and humidity
which I really like another thing I
really love about this Honeywell is its
usability it's a lot like regular
thermostats
so there's not much of a learning curve
but don't fret if you haven't had a
smart thermostat before the app is also
incredibly easy to use with the app you
can set the temperature or even set your
vacation schedule from the road and it
really works honey little made claims
that they could get the temperature
within one degree of accuracy and that's
true but if you don't want the fan
kicking on all the time you can actually
adjust that however you like one problem
I do have with the app is that it logs
out a lot which is really frustrating a
small issue I had with this thermostat
in general is that it doesn't come with
different sized wall plates so as you
can see I can't cover up my old paint
job on the other hand the nest comes
with two different sized wall plates so
you can cover up any unsightly paint
jobs another problem I had with the
installation is that it requires a wire
that I just don't have and since I'm not
really familiar with messing around in
the HVAC unit I had to use this cord as
a last resort I'll talk about this more
in the how-to video but the Honeywell
thermostat requires a C wire whereas
nest thermostat can be hooked up using a
G wire so depending on which one your
house has that will kind of inform which
one you choose they're both great but
it's kind of a matter of the
installation overall I really love the
Honeywell Wi-Fi smart thermostat it
works it looks nice and it's going to be
a great addition to your house I'm Megan
Willerton frisina and this is the
Honeywell Wi-Fi smart thermostat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
