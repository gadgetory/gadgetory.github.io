a tone death virtual reality video that
toward hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico the
Facebook CEO demonstrated the Facebook
spaces product it lets users make
cartoon avatars of themselves to talk in
virtual reality Zuckerberg stood
alongside Rachel Franklin the head of
social VR for Facebook and in poor taste
called the technology magical as they
gave a high-five to each other in front
of flooded homes one of the things
that's really magical about virtual
reality is you can get the feeling that
you're really in a place right it's a
pressure to mention this before but
Rachel and I actually aren't even I
think in the same building and in the
physical world it feels like we're in
the same place and we're making eye
contact we're talking to each other and
listen now I mean this is where we're
looking around and you know it it feels
like we're really here in Puerto Rico
the billionaire was slammed by users on
social media for looking completely out
of touch and for exploiting the disaster
to show off the technology while people
are still suffering from the damage of
Hurricane Maria zuckerberg also spoke
about how the company is donating to
help relief efforts and then the two
cartoons decided to fly off to somewhere
less depressing all right somewhere else
yeah maybe
back to California if only everyone
there could just magically transport to
another place right Zuckerberg will
discuss more virtual reality news at the
oculus connect Developers Conference
going on now the Facebook owned oculus
will be touting reasons why consumers
should buy a gadget to put on their face
and why developers should make programs
for it I'm Bridget Carey for more
coverage on oculus connect pedasi Netcom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
