line model in gredos prestige series
which has been updated for 2014 it
retails for $295 and is one of the most
open detailed headphones you'll find at
this price point and an impressive
headphone overall hi I'm David karna and
welcome to another CNET headphone video
review as you can see Grado has not
changed the exterior design of the
headphone and like the SR 325
predecessors this one has the same
bowl-shaped pads that apply a little
more pressure to your outer edges of
your ears than the simple foam pads of
the $99 s r 8e e which is arguably more
comfortable like all open-back
headphones the SR 325 e doesn't block
external noise and also leak sound so
it's not ideal for travellers or
cranking your music in an open office
environment and with its industrial
grade cord and beefy plug the reality is
that it's designed for home rather than
mobile use Grado headphones are known to
have an exciting sound and the new 325 8
kicks that excitement up a notch this
new model balances the energy with a
richer and fuller tonal balance in
previous generations of Gredos prestige
headphones thanks to its open back
design its stereo imaging is more
spacious and wider than that of closed
back headphones like the sennheiser
momentum and bear dynamic t51p as well
as the somewhat pricier Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins
p7 this model is also more immediate
brighter and more detailed sounding than
those three headphones but the bass is
nowhere as full so if you crave really
plump full bass this isn't the headphone
for you and that's the great o SR 325 e
in a nutshell a great headphone just not
necessarily a great headphone for bass
lovers I gave it car Noi thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
