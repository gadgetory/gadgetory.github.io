robot friend the super-cute I below bot
dog is back and on sale now in Japan
it's said to arrive in January
you may remember an older version of AI
both at Sony launched 18 years ago it
was discontinued in 2006 but this old
dog has since learned new tricks
the new model reacts to your voice
commands and responds to petting it can
also play with toys like the special
bone and it has blinking olette eyes and
oh my goodness well you just look at
that little robot face clearly Sony
spend a lot of time on animation to make
the dog look alive and create
expressions but Sony says this companion
bot also learns and grows with owners
there is an app that helps teach him new
tricks and it's where you can access
photos taken by the dog
yeah the connected canine has cameras
the cameras and built-in sensors also
help the dog learn location and map out
rooms so he will learn your home sony
says i bow will remember what actions
make the owner happy so it can detect
words of praise even your smiles by
analysing sounds and images sony says
the dog has artificial intelligence to
develop a unique personality over time
collecting data on an owner's reactions
so no two AIBO are the same only on sale
now in Japan I will cost 198 thousand
yen and if it does come to the US that
price would put it around $1700 like any
pet he may need checkups Sony has a
support care subscription service for
repairs and inspections one year of this
robot insurance costs about one hundred
and seventy-five dollars the mechanical
mutt also has a power button and volume
button if you need a break he does not
shed but has a SIM card slot and comes
with a charging stand and mat with a
battery that lasts about two hours are
we entering the age of the robot
companion pet another socially
interactive robot named G Bo just
launched in October for a $900 I'm
Bridget Carey and you could be doggone
sure that CNET will be there to fetch
all the latest news on this Robo pup
it's unleashed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
