going to talk about Philips friends a
few light strip so the light strip is a
six foot set of adhesive-backed LED
lights it's designed to work with
Philips hue connected bulb lighting kit
the idea is that this works as an accent
light it's adhesive back so you can
connect it underneath or on top of
pretty much any surface and then control
it with your smartphone you can use it
in conjunction with Philips hue lights
or you can use it as a standalone accent
light now this should be obvious this is
a novelty product it's definitely not a
very useful light to have just day to
date around the house we can't see kind
of putting it underneath a cabinet in a
kitchen or somewhere that you might want
to utility light but mostly the light
strip is designed to be used in
conjunction with Philips hue bulbs as
part of a decorative lighting scheme at
home so if you look closely at each
little cluster on here you're see it's
made of three tiny LEDs there's a blue
red and green one you can change this
output to up to 16 million different
colors via your mobile app now that
sounds like a very broad range but what
it does not include is sort of that
color temperatures that we're familiar
with from standard incandescent light
bulbs at home now what's also
interesting about this product is that
you can actually customize the length of
this strip there's little indicators
here that let you snip it every 4 inches
but of course what you've cut off no
longer works so you have to keep that in
mind now you can see we haven't
connected this strip to anything it's
kind of free-floating and the colors on
this side got a little bit messed up
during the review process but it did cut
off a strip just to see how well the
strips adhered to a surface and you can
see there's a four inch strip here and
it's really pretty solidly connected to
this piece of wood now like the Philips
hue bulbs there are quite a few ways you
can program these lights through your
smartphone app the app lets you change
the color like I mentioned but you can
also set it to work on a timer you can
have the lights go off on an alarm or in
response to your GPS location
it also supports IFFT which is the if
this then that standard that lets you
tie the behavior of these lights to
certain online services thanks to the
open software in the hue family you can
also find other apps available to
download that perform different
functions so that can make the lights
change in response to the stock market
they can change in time to music and saw
some other things that are kind of Handy
kind of a novel one thing I do is those
that Phil said may be extended
more functionality in its own software
the fact that you can't get these to
chase for example perform other sort of
sequencing functions this is a little
bit lame considering these of such a
novel product the same that they cost 90
bucks it might be nice to have a little
bit of advanced functionality for these
overall though the novelty factor is
very high here even higher than with the
hue bows themselves but if you do
already own the hue bulbs you just give
you sort of a nice way to extend that
product family and give you some other
lights to play with some rich Brown this
is the Philips hue lightstrip</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
