DVD rental store in a place called
limerick that's a city in ireland right
and for the last six years there's been
a local priest from the Vatican that's
been calling in for customer service and
to rent movies at the store look at this
I didn't grant I didn't know as good as
I read it he loves it so uh back in
January uh this priest from the Vatican
that calls the video store he kept
mentioning that he had watched Lincoln
and he was giving sort of an anecdotal
review about the movie and he said that
you know he had watched it in the
monastery the night before and that they
had gotten the movie and had watched it
in sort of a film Club inside the
Vatican the problem is that at the time
in January Lincoln wasn't out on DVD yet
yep right so uh this film guy that the
guy that owned the video store suspected
that the priest had pirated this movie
in some way Christ's pirating movies
what else weird where else will this
world turn to the same thing for other
movies because he had mentioned others
to like Django Unchained lame is rob and
zero dark thirty all of which hadn't
gotten out on DVD weird i shot it
because it was like a handheld camera
yeah i thought it would be shot more
professionally right and it didn't take
a trip to the movies they actually watch
this inside the monastery so what we
have here is basically a an illegal DVD
download ring of priests one of those o
is a commandment thou shalt not steal
it's weird right bunch of priests that
don't know the difference between right
and wrong what's legal what's illegal
never heard of anything like that before
so torrentfreak decided to do a little
bit more research and they took a look
at some of the downloading habits within
the Vatican itself this is crazy so it's
the Vatican is really small it's a small
part of the city so it's easy to track
what torrents are coming based on IP
based on IP addresses they noticed that
one IP address kept coming up they
released a list of the things that are
being watched inside the Vatican right
now this is this phrase apprised of
everything you would expect someone to
download from victorian right so TV
shows let's start with the clean stuff
TV shows are really popular in the
again uh ironically enough the Americans
is is one of the most downloaded
interesting right uh one of the only
three hollywood movies appear in the
list Love Actually are a cam copy of
snitch and then the last stand that's
the wolverine movie right uh I don't
know last stand yeah okay didn't
download any music no please hate music
hey hey music com no are we sure
someone's not spoofing could be someone
could have been spoofing it but listen
to this apparently someone within the
Vatican has also been downloading adult
material no that's not surprising I
never heard of any controversy with with
sexual behavior and the vances that I've
ever heard you heard it first on the
floor breaking right now apparently
priests are human too they downloaded
one title and it was only labeled RSS
episode 1 right that could mean anything
sure but it only means one thing because
I did the research for it and RSS
episode 1 it's a video of two ladies
kidnapped in a Russian BDSM Club oh my
can this exists within the BDSM /
punishment category of BitTorrent in
their servers right and then there's
also other videos I are downloaded
featuring such starlets as tiffany starr
sheena shaw lay alexis and krissy lynn
of which i viewed all of their
repertoires over the weekend yes they
are result actors yeah they all do they
do engage in an elective in these videos
so isn't that crazy I mean that they
have all this porn downloaded and you're
right it could be an IP spoofing thing
and that's what the controversy is all
about why wasn't this getting picked up
and but what incentive would anyone have
to spoof this IP address not knowing
that to make it look like the Vatican's
downloading porn yeah but they didn't
know that this video store guy it would
have to be some kind of sting operation
right like right without an lung
prompted why would they do that I mean
it's a little and you would imagine I
don't know the Vatican has some sort of
internet security in place to prevent
something like this from happening right
you would yeah one would one would think
you think this is like a Vatican IT guy
it's a firewall
run by God</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
