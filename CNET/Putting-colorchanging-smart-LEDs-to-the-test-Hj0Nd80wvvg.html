taking a look at the color quality of
two color changing LED bulbs the Philips
hue LED and the lumen LED from taboo now
these are both bulbs that have great
smart features that you can program on
your phone and set to come on and off at
different times and automate and
interesting ways but today we're not
taking a look at that we're just taking
a look at how well they actually produce
color and that's their core function
what we've done is we've compared how
each bulb puts out color at different
parts of the wavelength to see if they
are accurate to see if they give you the
light that you want and in some cases
like with the color green we found
pretty interesting results let me show
you what I'm talking about here we have
the green incandescent party light that
we picked up for about three bucks at
the hardware store it's a nice clear
bright green light now let's compare
that to the lumen LED here in the center
it's also very green also very bold
striking color looks good but now let's
switch over to the Phillips hue we
switch to that one on and you can see
it's kind of a yellowy tennis ball green
and that's as green as it gets with the
hue if we play with the app and move
that slider around through the green
part of the spectrum that is as green as
it gets so how does an LED make green
light anyway well it has diodes inside
of it and here we're looking at a
Philips you bulb that has the bulb off
of it so we can see the diodes and you
know you'd want an equal number of
yellow and blue to add up to really good
green light and with the Philips hue
we've got five really bright yellow
diodes and then two rather dim blue
diodes and that's your problem you just
don't have enough blue to add up to a
bright vivid green it's going to be
yellow and washed out because those
yellows are so overpowering now funky
colored light that you'd use it a party
is all well and good but these bulbs
also offer basic warm white light and
the Philips hue does a much better job
with that then the lumen bulb does the
Philips hue bulb has an entire spectrum
in the app where you can select all
different color temperatures of
incandescent style light you can go 2700
k yellow light or you can go higher up
around five 6000k that kind of white
bluish light and we tested this out and
all of those were very accurate you can
see that little curve on the graph there
that's the range of light that a
incandescent bulb will put out at
different color temperatures and you can
see as we
move the Philips hue bulb around that
spectrum it's always falling right on
that curve and that's a really really
good sign that's a good result tells us
it's a very accurate bulb at
representing what an incandescent would
give you so if you want a bulb that can
accurately produce different
incandescent style lights the Philips
ego is much better than the lumen bulb
which only gives you one default warm
white setting at about 2700 k we've
talked a lot about the novelty factor
with these color-changing bulbs and i
think that the lumen LED is more of the
novelty bulb it's a little better a
color better at greens and blues and
probably better for a party if you want
to have a light that's changing colors
in the corner of the room but for
overall basic lighting a bulb you can
put anywhere and use however you like
the Philips hue is actually the more
comprehensive and better option it's got
that wide range of warm white sand
daylight and soft white type light
you're not going to get that with the
lumen LED so just a little food for
thought next time you're shopping for
bulbs for seeing that I'm red crest
