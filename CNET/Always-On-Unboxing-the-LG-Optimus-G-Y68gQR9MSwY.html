recently unbox the nexus 4 in here i
have the LG optimus G this is basically
the phone that has the guts of the nexus
4 but the friendly partnership with the
carrier's which means one major thing
LTE there are some other significant
differences too let's open it up and
check it out hey I'm getting so many of
these little expanses boxes lately ok we
got the international unlocked version
so we do have a useful power adapter
here and here we go LG optimus G we have
the AT&amp;amp;T model the GSM model which works
on 18t now there are significant
differences even between the models that
you get on different carriers in the US
will go through those a little bit later
but just want you to know this is the
18-team model and since it is texting
and driving it can wait I shouldn't make
that funny voice because it can wait I
took the pledge let's see what else we
have in here before I take the stickers
off we have our LG Optimus information
packet and add for uverse thinks they
get enough of those in the mail and some
other stuff or micro USB charging cable
and power brick ok let's go by the way
all right here is our phone now it's a
little different shape than the nexus 4
you may recall that one we get these
stickers off you're out do it not cool
sticker I cut my nails and now I can't
get those stickers off
we're going to do specs I'm going to get
help and a band-aid the LG optimus G
comes in black or white it has a smokin
fast Snapdragon s4 pro quad-core CPU
with an LTE chip now that's a big
difference between this and the nexus 4
that LTE capability plus a fast
processor that's a pretty hot phone one
big drawback though it is only running
android 4.0 point for otherwise known as
ice cream sandwich not jelly bean and
there is no word on when this phone Mike
at the upgrade to the latest operating
system the AT&amp;amp;T model weighs about 5
ounces and the size and weight are
slightly different on AT&amp;amp;T and Sprint
also the AT&amp;amp;T model has expandable
memory it comes with 32 gigs total but
supports up to 64 gigs of expandable
memory now on the sprint version you
only get 32 gigs with no microSD card
slot it has a 4.7 inch display so it's a
good size phone and the display itself
is true HD 1280 by 768 pixels and our
reviewers say it looks great I agree it
has a 1.3 megapixel front-facing camera
the AT&amp;amp;T model has an 8-megapixel back
camera whereas the Sprint model gets a
13 megapixel camera in our comparisons
daylight photos look about the same but
the Sprint model does seem to take
better photos at night it is equipped
with NFC Bluetooth and of course Wi-Fi
and the camera can do 1080p recording it
has a mid-sized battery 20 100 milliamps
which they say is good for up to 10
hours the unlocked model that we have
retails for 549 with contract though you
can get it for 199 or ninety nine
dollars depending on your carrier now
the lg optimus G is a super nice phone
the hardware feels beautiful it's big
and it looks a little bit bulky not
totally sleek and rounded off but it's
not heavy it's a very nice size and
weight and it's sort of a little present
for those of you who wanted a nexus 4
but we're really disappointed that you
didn't get 4G then again the big
trade-off is that you don't get jelly
bean with this bone and of course it's
not
pure Android experience LG has tweaked
the interface a little bit as you can
see it's interesting because the lg
optimus is a phone that doesn't make
very many compromises in terms of
processor speed and design it's a really
high quality phone but between the nexus
for the G on ATT and the G on sprint
you're going to have to make some kind
of compromise so what's the lesser of
two evils here or three evils as the
case may be for me I think it's probably
Optimus G on AT&amp;amp;T because you get a
pretty good selection of features you
get expandable memory and more
importantly you get that 4G but you
should go to cnet and read our full
review on this phone for all the details</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
