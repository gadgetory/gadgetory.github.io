recently unbox the Nexus 4 in here I
have the lg optimus G this is basically
the phone that has the guts of the Nexus
4 but the friendly partnership with the
carriers which means one major thing LTE
there are some other significant
differences too let's open it up and
check it out
I've been getting so many of these
little expanses boxes lately
we got the International unlocked
version so we do have a useful power
adapter here and here we go
lg optimus G we have the AT&amp;amp;T model the
GSM model which works on 18 T now there
are significant differences even between
the models that you get on different
carriers in the u.s. we'll go through
those a little bit later but I just want
you to know this is the 18 T model and
since it is texting and driving
it can wait I shouldn't make that funny
voice cuz it can wait I took the pledge
let's see what else we have in here
before I take the stickers off we have
our lg optimus information packet and
add for you verse thinks they get enough
of those in the mail and some other
stuff or microUSB charging cable and
power brick okay all right here is our
phone now it's a little different shape
than the Nexus 4 you may recall that one
you're gonna get these stickers off here
out do it not cool sticker I cut my
nails and now I can't get those stickers
off
we're gonna do specs I'm gonna get help
and a band-aid
the lg optimus G comes in black or white
it has a smokin fast snapdragon s4 pro
quad core cpu with an LTE chip now
that's a big difference between this and
the Nexus 4 that LTE capabilities plus a
fast processor that's a pretty hot phone
one big drawback though it is only
running Android 4.0.4 otherwise known as
Ice Cream Sandwich not jellybean and
there is no word on when this phone
might get the upgrade to the latest
operating system the 18 T model weighs
about 5 ounces and the size and weight
are slightly different on AT&amp;amp;T and
Sprint also the AT&amp;amp;T model has
expandable memory it comes with 32 gigs
total but supports up to 64 gigs of
expandable memory now on the Sprint
version you only get 32 gigs with no
microSD card slot it has a 4.7 inch
display so it's a good size phone and
the display itself is true HD 1280 by
768 pixels and our reviewers say it
looks great I agree it has a 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera the 18 T
model has an 8 megapixel back camera
whereas the Sprint model gets a 13
megapixel cameras in our comparisons
daylight photos look about the same but
the sprint model does seem to take
better photos at night it is equipped
with NFC Bluetooth and of course Wi-Fi
and the camera can do 1080p recording it
has a mid sized battery 2100 milliamps
which they say is good for up to 10
hours the unlock model that we have
retails for 549 with contract though you
can get it for $1.99 or $99 depending on
your carrier now the lg optimus G is a
super nice phone the hardware feels
beautiful it's big and it looks a little
bit bulky not totally sleek and rounded
off but it's not heavy it's a very nice
size and weight and it's sort of a
little present for those of you who
wanted a Nexus 4 but we're really
disappointed that you didn't get 4G then
again the big trade-off is that you
don't get jellybean with this phone and
of course it's not a
pure Android experience LG has tweaked
the interface a little bit as you can
see it's interesting because the lg
optimus is a phone that doesn't make
very many compromises in terms of
processor speed and design it's a really
high quality phone but between the Nexus
4 the G on AT&amp;amp;T and the G on Sprint
you're gonna have to make some kind of
compromise so what's the lesser of two
evils here or three evils as the case
may be for me I think it's probably the
Optimus G on AT&amp;amp;T because you get a
pretty good selection of features you
get expandable memory and more
importantly you get that 4G but you
should go to CNET and read our full
review on this phone for all the details</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
