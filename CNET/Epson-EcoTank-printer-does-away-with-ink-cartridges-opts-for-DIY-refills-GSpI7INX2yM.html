inkjet printers but it's hiding a big
secret that could save you tons of cash
I'm Justin with CNET and this is a first
look at the Epson eco tank ET 2550 when
you lift up the lid on this side you
won't find the traditional inkjet
cartridges that most printers use
instead the eco tank series comes with a
set of ink and bottles that you empty
yourself into a large refillable
reservoir now you're probably wondering
about the benefits of this new ink
delivery system and here's the thing
each bottle that comes with this printer
has enough ink to print about four
thousand pages of black ink and 6500
pages of color and that equates to about
the same as a two-year supply the catch
though is that Epson wants you to pay a
lot more upfront for the printer itself
the e-team 2550 is the cheapest in the
eco tank line and it cost 399 bucks
so basically Epson is asking you to
commit yourself to this printer for as
long as it takes to offset the high
retail price but if you can stick with
that the benefit is that after two years
you can pick up a new set of ink bottles
for super cheap it's only 13 bucks for
each bottle and that's about fifty-two
dollars for the set let's compare that
to a non eco tank Epson printer that
costs 50 bucks retail but the cartridges
only last 175 pages and refills cost 40
bucks for a full set aside from the eco
tank the rest of the unit is pretty
typical of a hundred dollar printer it
has print scan and copy functionality
and even though there's no touchscreen
you can walk up to an unplugged in an SD
card from your digital camera for direct
photo prints better still it can connect
to a Wi-Fi network to pull print jobs
from the cloud not to mention Epsons own
mobile app for outputting stuff off your
smart phone so who is this printer
really good for well you can save a lot
of money potentially on ink cartridges
refills here but you'll have to wait
until you exceed the cost of the retail
price first which will probably take a
few years and if you don't need a lot of
extra features and don't mind keeping
this printer around for a while it
really could be worth your dollar you
can check out more details in my full
review on CNET but that's going to do it
for me I'm Justin you just took a first
look at the Epson eco tank EG 2550
