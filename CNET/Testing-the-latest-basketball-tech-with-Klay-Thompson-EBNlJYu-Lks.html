my shot let's check them out the shot
tracker is really a two-piece system the
first part is this clip-on accessory
that you put on the net where you're
gonna shoot and the second piece is this
sensor that slides in this wristband you
put the wristband on your shooting arm
and then it's flash so how does it work
we went to a warrior's practice and
asked my best friend clay Thompson who
partners with shot tracker now a shot
trackers like the little personal
assistant well a healthy track where I'm
good at on the floor as far as shooting
and where I can improve you just get it
right there on your phone it's really
sweet the shot tracker app keeps track
of makes and misses will it turn you
into klay Thompson I wish but the app
does have drills and virtual camps the
biggest issue getting the thing on the
net we had to bring a ladder coming soon
shot tracker and Spalding will have a
team tracking system it will include a
smart basketball sensors on players and
around the court it's a multiplayer
multi ball really built to track data in
a real-time environment so what we do is
we automatically track and digitize the
basketball game with the team version
check this out this might look like your
average basketball but this is the
Wilson X inside their sensors that
measure when you make a shot but also
can tell you the distance you took your
shot and also measures misses as well
which I don't do a lot of check this out
now there are a few times that
registered mrs. as makes and vice-versa
everyone that plays worries about how
does the actual basketball feel and the
Wilson it has a little harder surface
and more feels like you could play
outside well with it but it has a nice
bounce and you know it's more than good
enough now the blast basketball replay
it's this guy it's just a motion sensor
really and you won't be wearing this all
the time while you play but it's fun if
you want to shoot some highlights like
so crazy layup take video and you can
see three different stats for the
highlights
bottom line all these guys won't turn
you into an NBA superstar overnight but
they will give you data that will help
you improve your game like mine all
right I heard that from flashes hell I
should tell my mom you just said that to
me we get that on camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
