Skylanders I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your scene that update times are tough
for Nintendo sales are down for the Wii
U and in its recent earnings report
revenue was down eight percent for the
quarter and profits slipped thirty
percent from this time of year ago but
Nintendo has a few ideas on how to turn
things around just like Skylanders and
Disney infinity Nintendo will sell its
own special action figures that have
sensors to work with video games these
Nintendo figures would use near field
communication or NFC to save data on the
toy and it can be used across several
video game titles on the Wii U and the
3ds when you put the character on the
Wii U gamepad it loads up your game data
you can also put it on a special
wireless platform for the three DS
Nintendo says we will learn more about
the figurines in June at the e3 video
game expo and that's not all that's new
from Nintendo when Mario Kart 8 comes
out later this month for the Wii U it'll
have a feature called Mario Kart TV it
lets players upload their racing
highlights to the internet and you can
watch them on a smartphone Nintendo also
plans to create new game consoles for
emerging markets it's not just going to
make a cheaper version of the wii rather
the goal is to design a whole new type
of low-cost system from scratch for
other countries let's move on to apps if
you want to spice up your podcast and
radio experience you should check out
the updated tuning radio app to name is
a free way to listen to live radio
broadcast streams and podcasts but it's
changing its tune so to speak to be more
social you can now follow people and
follow shows and share what you love
with your followers one neat thing is
that you can search for music that's
streaming right now so you can hop into
a station that's playing your jam and
while TuneIn wants to change the way we
listen another tech startup wants to
change the way we buy makeup what if you
could print your own makeup at home with
a 3d printer just pick the colors that
work for you and the 3d printer mixes
the ingredients and pigments to create a
cream or a pressed powder it's called
the mink and it was shown off at the
TechCrunch Disrupt conference in New
York City it will cost around three
hundred dollars for the printer when it
comes out later this year but if you're
interested in a different type of 3d
printer you can win one for free from
cnet we have a sweepstakes going on now
to win a MakerBot 3d printer and
supplies it's worth more than two
thousand dollars go to cnet.com sweeps
to win you have until May fourteenth
that's your tech news update from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
