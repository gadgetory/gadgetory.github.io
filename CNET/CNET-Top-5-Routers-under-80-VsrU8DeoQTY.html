that are more confusing and pumped full
of hype and jargon than Wi-Fi routers
some of you are spending big bucks on
dual-band wireless and routers with 450
megabit per second connection speeds and
USB 3.0 ports and Gigabit Ethernet and
VPN hosting and network attached storage
support and you know you don't need half
that stuff you just want something fast
cheap and reliable so here you go these
are the top five routers under $80
recommended by seeing its home
networking guru and all-around awesome
guy don't know starting at number five
the tp-link nano as the name implies
this is a small basic router but it's
also the least expensive router on this
list it's 20 bucks I only get one
Ethernet port on the back and wireless n
connection caps out 150 megabits per
second but it's great for traveling and
the thing is freaking cute I mean most
of these things look like they were
designed by Darth Vader but this one
looks more like Hello Kitty and like a
good way at number four the Linksys eat
when T 500 this one takes you right up
to that $80 price but you're getting a
lot of router for your money
it offers dual band wireless end support
so you get that 5 gigahertz band with a
better performance and less interference
there also plenty of Ethernet
connections on the back and the design
doesn't really call a lot of attention
to itself best of all the Cisco software
for getting it all up and running will
not make you want to punch a hole in the
wall which is pretty rare for a router
at number 3 the next gear and 600 here's
another one right at $80 is dual band
like the Linksys but the range is a
little better and you get some nice
extras back include the USB ports for
connecting hard drives and the software
includes a traffic meter so if your
roommate likes to binge on HD cat videos
and your ISP sends you the bill the
router can automatically throttle things
down and keep you from a very awkward
conversation but if you're looking for a
better value even at the expense of some
features try this old gem at number 2
the Belkin n plus guy's been around
since 2008 but it's still one of the
best single band wireless end routers on
the market and you can scoop it up for
about 60 bucks Wireless ranges arguably
the best
on this list so if you're lucky enough
to have a nice big place this is your
best value now before we get to number
one let's take a look at scene s list of
the best wireless routers overall now
there are some great options here but
most of these guys retail for around 160
bucks personally I like my routers to be
simple and fast and that's why I really
like our number one choice the d-link
vir 605 L cloud router $40 gets you a
tiny relatively fast single band router
and the killer feature you can monitor
and manage the whole thing with an app
that works for iOS and Android from
halfway around the world you can see
who's on your network you can block
access and even reboot the whole thing
you will feel like the god of routers
for just $40 so there you have it five
routers that will help you bring your
home Wi-Fi into the modern age without
putting you in debt more top fives like
this is it top 5 dot cnet.com you can
also find me over twitter or posting HD
cat videos over on facebook i'm donald
