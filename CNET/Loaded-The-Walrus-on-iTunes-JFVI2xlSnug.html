Apple announced that it is at last
carrying the Beatles music on iTunes how
many years have we been speculating that
this would happen it finally did happen
with an announcement on apple com on
Tuesday morning this is the first time
that the beatles have sold their music
digitally unless you count rock band
beatles edition which i kinda don't as
expected facebook unveiled a new
messaging system on monday it's going to
roll out slowly but basically it's an
integration with email texting and
instant messaging you will get an at
facebook email address and you can
communicate with people who are not on
facebook it sounds a lot like Google
Wave it's real-time communication with
basically everyone it will also have
integration with microsoft office so you
can share and work on office documents
within your facebook account Facebook
CEO Mark Zuckerberg was clear that this
is not email it's something much bigger
than email but i would say glorified
email google shopping will now be able
to run inventory checks on products that
you want to purchase so say you want to
get a microsoft kinect you can search it
on google shopping and see if your local
best buy has it in stock you can even
get a map to that Best Buy so you don't
get lost saving you both time and gas
walmart had some leaked black friday
deals on monday they include a 15-inch
laptop for around three hundred dollars

Books unveiled a new website with more
discounts social features and a lot of
free shipping the social features let
you share your book purchasing
information with your friends on
Facebook the asuste tablet is not dead

about this summer it was supposed to
come out in September and be called the
eee pc tablet but now we think it will
be out in early 2011 and be called the e
note or the digital note another reason
to look forward to the consumer
electronics show in january and finally
the world's first 3d heart surgery is
scheduled to happen today a cardiologist
in England will be performing the
surgery with advanced 3d mapping to
treat a 63 year old person's heart he
will use a software called cart 0 3 and
insert a thin wire catheter into the
heart to do
energy in two parts of the heart that
are causing the arrhythmia a little bit
over my head but sounds very cool those
