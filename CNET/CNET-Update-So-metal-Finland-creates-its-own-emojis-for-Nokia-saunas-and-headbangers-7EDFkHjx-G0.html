Bridget Carey this is your cnet update
emoji the cartoon images in our text
messages are becoming a more powerful
force in our daily communication so I
guess it should come as no surprise to
hear that the country of Finland has
made its own official emoji these icons
represent what the country is best known
for nokia phones head-banging to heavy
metal and sitting naked in saunas of
course this is not a joke the country
actually made an emoji for the nokia
3310 which was one of the highest
selling mobile phones of all time and
designed in Finland these are free
emojis to be released online starting in
december with one image day and it's
being made in the style of an Advent
Christmas calendar people will be able
to get the calendar at xmas Finland f5
back in the US companies continue to
find creative ways to use emoji the
aloft hotel in New York's financial
district which you order room service by
emoji menus in the room tell you what
combo of emoji to text to get certain
things so if you text a water droplet a
pill and a banana you'll be charged ten
dollars for the hangover cure package
which includes vitamin water advil and
bananas but if you're an emoji power
user you're going to need the Bluetooth
wireless emoji keyboard by emoji works
it's a normal keyboard that also makes
it quick to send the icons instead of
hunting through lists and copying and
pasting the keyboard includes many of
the newest icons like a unicorn taco and
I rolling smiley and you can also set
skin tones for people icons there are
three different models but the one with
the most emoji on the keys is a hundred
dollars it works on mac and Windows 10
machines of course this is going to be
hot for any kids in the house but
there's a product that parents may like
it's called circle and it partnered with
Disney to give parents remote control of
what their kids are doing on their
phones and tablets now aside from the
usual safe browsing parental controls
this can also limit how much time a kid
gets on a certain app and a parent can
pause the internet at any time devices
also have a bedtime and a wake time and
the master account can see how much time
is being spent on certain apps like how
long they play Minecraft
it pairs with home Wi-Fi and it costs a
hundred dollars that's it for this tech
news update and there's more at cnet com
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
