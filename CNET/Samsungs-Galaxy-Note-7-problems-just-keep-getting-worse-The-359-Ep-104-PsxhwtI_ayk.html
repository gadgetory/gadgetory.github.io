this time for another episode of the 359
podcast with Ben Fox Rubin and Alfred a
good morning guys what the hell are we
talking about today hey all right there
i am so we're going to hopefully not
scare the hell out of everybody with
this latest podcast but there's some
pretty unpleasant news in the world of
technology and we're going to try to get
to as much of it as we can in four
minutes I'll also pretend to be Roger
for today because he's working from home
so Roger will be back tomorrow as always
we'd love to hear your questions so
sending your questions and me and Alfred
and Brian will try to get to as many as
possible at the end of the show but I
guess that's about it anything you want
to say I offered before we get started
it's gonna be a great show looking
forward to talking about Samsung and
it's a never-ending list of problems
than it's been going through this
weekend yes yeah absolutely so without
delay let's uh let's get moving on the
podcast see you guys in four minutes
send us your questions will be back in
just about 3 minutes and 59 seconds
starting in three two welcome to the 359
where we talk about the top tech news of
the day plus whatever crap we want to
throw in I'm Ben Fox Rubin I'm Alfred
ring okay so first up the bad news for
Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 just keeps
getting worse on Friday the US Consumer
Product Safety Commission said it's
working with Samsung on an official
recall for the smartphones after about
three dozen incidents of the phones
overheating or exploding and over the
weekend the New York Post said a
six-year-old boy had to be rushed to the
hospital after an 07 burst into flames
in his hands boy that's bad can samsung
regain its credibility with the note 7
even after recalling these devices
Alfred uh as good as the samsung note 7
is I don't think it can i I think it's
the you know it's the hoverboard all
over again we're essentially it was the
big thing everyone was really into it
and then I started blowing up and then
you know you don't really see them
anywhere now and
they were hoping so that would be
horrific for samsung I mean like this is
one of its two main flagship phones of
the year that would be pretty bad for
these guys especially because they were
just starting to gain momentum on you
know their phone business everything was
starting to look really good for these
guys that that seems to be the biggest
problem is that you know they can't
really really can't catch a break with
this it's it's actually a pretty good
phone and the thing is that you know for
this separately explosions yeah and I
don't know how many samsung you know
note sevens are out there but I mean
I've it's it's happened enough that you
know that they have to recall it that
even you know the federal government is
getting involved in a sense of you know
we got to put the stop says you can't
bring it on planes you and it's
happening everywhere and it's just died
so they're actually the recall is for
2.5 million notes Evans that they had
sold within the first two weeks there
are about thirty five incidents that it
occurred before then so it's a small
number but it's enough for it to be a
really big deal and the thing is they
could have just recalled you know the
ones the model that you know they were
exploding but the thing is I feel like
Samsung wanted to just play it safe and
bring back all that we think they had to
yeah so next in our scare the hell out
of you about technology podcast episode
Tesla is updating its autopilot software
for its high-end electric cars making
the self-driving feature safer following
a fatal crash a few months ago the
system will rely on more radar instead
of optical detection and include more
visible warnings and on the dashboard
and sharper application of the brakes in
an emergency so Alfred do you think this
is enough from Tesla to get you
comfortable and get into a self-driving
car absolutely I oh really I love auto
pilot I tried it before I'm looking
forward to trying it so if anyone out
there wants to get me in one I I'm just
a huge fan of self-driving cars in
general I can't wait until they're I can
get one on my own I am also a huge fan
of this but I still feel like the
technology still has a ways to go and I
think that fatal crash was a very
unfortunate example of that but I think
autopilot had been out for a long amount
of time before that fatal crash happened
and you know for for you know however
many Tesla models are out there and then
just one crash I mean I feel like it was
bound to happen at some point again ha
it was horrible it happened to him but I
think with these updates I think we're
seeing a step yeah in a better direction
for it totally so with the last 20
seconds to have let's try to lighten it
up a little bit by just making fun of
apples air pods Alfred would you be
caught dead wearing these things um dead
yes because i think the moment I put it
on somebody would i'd tell mighty to
kill me for it Yeah right it's a great
opener i guess you know you could really
i don't know like start a conversation
with folks so anyway I gotta wrap up so
if you want to read more about these
stories check us out on cnet I'm Ben Fox
Rubin I'm Alfred aim thanks for
listening and that's a cut on the audio
recording for the podcast ok sorry for
depressing everybody in this night but
hopefully we helped some people because
you should not be using your Galaxy Note
seven at all well yeah you have one put
it down do not charge it don't use it
don't do anything with it they told
everyone to shut him off my friend that
hasn't note 7 the one that was his first
smartphone oh yeah i texted him earlier
today's like hate are you still using
your note 7 I haven't heard back so
probably isn't yeah but this is a good
example of like what happened with that
six-year-old is that we just kept kind
of have to keep repeating the fact of
like do not use this phone because
apparently somebody was still using it
even after the federal government on
Friday said put the phone down stop
using it all together we're gonna do a
full-on recall on these things just like
completely shut it down right like don't
even reset don't even charge it yeah
just like put it in a corner what maybe
not in this very flammable area right or
it is it also waterproof I think it's
water first put it in like a tank you
just put it in the toilet that way if it
blows up at least you know let's hope it
doesn't blow up but that's not the worst
idea I've ever heard you're gonna return
it the same song anyway so all right do
we have any
questions no real questions but John
says that Samsung should just implement
a global recall not locked on the
regional restrictions which i think is a
pretty good idea that's interesting I
don't really know how the recall is
going to work so I wouldn't anticipate
that there would be too many
restrictions they're really just trying
to get these phones out of here one of
the things that I wanted to get you in
the podcast but we didn't have that much
time was like I'm really curious and I
hope Samsung starts to answer these
questions as to why this happened in the
first place I mean like they've been
making smartphones for years now they're
the top smartphone seller like why did
this problem happen with their flagship
phone with the batteries i mean it's
primarily that I feel like it's one of
the factories that like made the
batteries for them and they can't figure
out or I mean they know which ones it is
but they're not like name it because
like 35 cases out of you know two
million something smartphone right it's
a needle in a haystack yeah some ways
yeah I mean if it I feel like they're
sophisticated enough to know which ones
it is but I think I feel like they also
just don't want consumers to you know
look fine figure out there's a model
it's a bit of a headache for them so I
think they're just going with the router
let's just call them all back I think
this also relates the lithium-ion
batteries just like what's with our
board so but like everybody has
lithium-ion batteries I think like
they're in a bunch of other people its
technology to its the really cheap ones
that are the ones that are exploring
that's how they turn up with the
hoverboards mm-hmm also where it
basically if you if you got you know a
premium hoverboard those weren't
exploding but if you got you know like a
really cheap one on amazon that's why
they had to you know recall those in the
sense of oh you can get it for a hundred
dollars and everyone was doing it
because it was really easy to get them
for christmas yeah we don't know it's
nice to see that some hoverboards did
not explode now that's really very
pleasant so hey so while we're at it do
we know who actually manufactured that
samsung battery do we know who's really
at fault here because I mean there are
some hardcore Samsung fans out there and
I'm curious to see who's trying to fight
the system here who's braven to try to
hang brave enough to try to hang on to
the phone but also who's really the
troublemaker here so as Alfred said
it appears it could be possible that
this is from a third-party manufacturer
that supplied the batteries to Samsung
we don't know we don't know I think
there's still a lot more that we have to
peel back from the onion and I think
Samsung still has to answer a lot of
questions as far as being gung-ho and
holding onto the phone I think we're way
past that at this point you really just
should get it replaced I mean like even
if your phone has not been causing you
any problems whatsoever this is one of
the more serious recalls that I've seen
since starting to cover technology so
like it will not hurt you to get the
phone replaced but it could to keep that
phone so with strongest recommendation
possible I would say just turn in the
phone if you really love the note 7 just
get the new one it probably won't
explode yeah I don't understand anybody
that feels like they should keep it just
because you're getting a new one either
way it's not you know what do you have
to go maybe a week or so without it I
don't know what the replacement you know
rate is but that would be horrible the
fact not have your smartphone for a week
I'd have to like talk to my family
members this movie but the fact is it's
a it's a new smartphone anyway if
somebody offered me to replace my phone
right now for free I would do it
immediately it's it's a no-brainer
except for the fact that like most
people have only had their notes Evans
for like two weeks so that's like pretty
close to his fresh out of the boxes you
could get and it is also like a huge
inconvenience to get a different phone I
think one of the other interesting shoes
to drop is how many people are going to
walk away from the note 7 altogether and
I don't know go to an iphone go to a
different samsung phone or go to a
different manufacturer so this only
spells trouble for samsung i would say
Anthony says one interesting thing is
how did Samsung know only a certain
amount are infected is it possible that
they knew somewhere that they were going
to explode and then if so why released
them at all so he's really going to the
conspiracy theory end of things I think
that that would probably be some form of
criminality if they were at least any
form a phone into the market that they
knew would explode or had the
possibility to explode the way that they
do testing on phones these days is
supposed to be extremely rigorous and so
if this was a giant screw up on
Samsung's part
they will be scrambling to fix for quite
some time into the future I mean like
even when they release the next note
people are going to this this whole
story will resurrect itself next year
too so this is going to continue to be a
black eye for these guys I would say
interesting conspiracy theory though
ghost Davis says so you can't take it to
the store I was told you have to wait
for them to send one in the mail okay I
don't actually have an answer to that
question we can look into it and try to
respond in the comments afterwards yep I
don't know yeah I don't know all the ins
and outs of the specific recall so but
thank you for the question and there are
still plenty of people who are very very
interested in the phone I mean it on
paper it's got great specs so even with
all the danger hand i'm curious to those
watching listening who's still like I
don't care once they fix this I'm still
all in yeah this thing got fantastic
reviews I mean like between this and the
s7 and s7 edge samsung had like a really
fantastic lineup of flagship phones so
it's it's very unfortunate i would say
that's what i was saying earlier it's a
shame because it actually is a really
good phone the one thing that i am
curious about though is you know why is
this only affecting the note 7 i'm not
sure that as a different kind of battery
that the you know galaxy s7 has any
active but it is weird then in this
flagship lineup that they put out that
it's it's only with the note 7 yeah
that's why I'm thinking that there is a
possibility it might be some sort of
like third party and battery
manufacturer but like it's a flagship
phone so it really shouldn't have a
cheap battery in it and that's why I
think it's like pretty problematic that
it would end up with like a cheaper one
if that is the case or if that is the
issue but I don't know like the way that
a lot of these things are logistics
possible that some bad batteries ended
up getting into the max I mean like they
make them with so many different parts
from so many different manufacturers
that that is a possibility what about
third-party chargers not only the third
party battery being at fall but there's
comments and discussion about people
improperly for lack of a better word
charging these phones which is causing
the problem I think that even if you got
a third-party charger that real
shouldn't be an excuse on samsung to
have an exploding phone you know like
that charger must be like what what sort
of third-party charger is there that's
actually going to cause your phone to
like really overheat and explode also if
you're getting the phone fresh I mean
they usually come with chargers I don't
know anyone that is using with the
third-party charger you know within the
first two weeks of its release yeah I
think one of the interesting things that
I'm seeing from the comments though is
that if people really are that gung-ho
and excited about this phone then maybe
there is a chance that it resurrects
itself after the recall because if
people really like it and it really is
this like you know best cutting-edge
samsung phone then maybe maybe people
will continue to buy it afterwards right
now I don't see it that much but who
knows some people are concerned that
there are still phones out on the shelf
that haven't been purchased yet that
could still be at risk I would assume
that Samsung's recalled yeah across the
board now they're recalling those yes
yeah I think they're smart enough to do
that I would imagine but these are
really good questions and i would say
that there are definitely questions that
we should be asking Samsung as well as
far as like what caused this why did
this happen in the first place I mean
like I'm sure that's something that
they're looking into as well yeah it is
scary though like the just the thought
of this and how even though it is
relatively isolated when you think about
the grand scheme of the Samsung sales
like how prevalent it is we haven't seen
anything really like this ever have we
from Samsung in general with this much
danger and a piece of tech that was so
highly coveted I would say that this is
probably the most prominent in recent
years there there have been smaller
incidents I mean like one thing that
comes to mind is antennagate which was a
couple years ago with the iphone they
built the antenna into the iphone that
if you were holding it the wrong way it
wouldn't make a phone call properly or
something like that and they would have
to fix those but that wasn't a safety
issue that was like more of like a
features issue and they were able to fix
it so yeah this is like a much much more
serious safety issue I would say but
yeah some of these things like they pop
up every now and then but they're very
infrequently like this much of a safety
concern yeah that might be it for today
we've got a lot of fantastic listeners
and fans contributing but no new
questions coming through at this point
I want to just maybe call today yeah and
I'm sorry to sound like a broken record
but if this helps anybody I'm gonna say
it again if you have a note 7 stop using
it don't charge it and you know follow
the recall procedures you should not be
holding on to that phone that's that's
about it all right all right let's write
all right so if you liked what you saw
or heard check us out on cnet com we're
also on iTunes feedburner google play
soundcloud tune in did I get everything
got it oh my god alright and Roger will
be back tomorrow I think with Alfred
will try to figure that out and yeah
