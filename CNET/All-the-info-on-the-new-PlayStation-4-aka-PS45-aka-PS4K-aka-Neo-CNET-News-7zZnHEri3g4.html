true Sony is in fact preparing to
release an upgraded PlayStation 4 call
it the PS 4.5 or the ps4 Kay whatever
you want though sony has been referring
to it internally as neo so what is
improved in the ps4 it's the hardware
according to giantbomb the Neo ps4 will
contain a faster CPU updated GPU and
higher RAM bandwidth for now
sounds like the hard drive that's gonna
stay the same now here's where things
get interesting beginning in October
every new ps4 game is required to ship
with two modes a base mode for the
current ps4 model and an updated mode
for the Neo model the Neo mode is going
to allow for games to presumably run and
look better than they would on the
current ps4 the Neo ps4 can support 4k
but there's no mandate that says games
have to support that resolution so what
does this mean if you already own a ps4
well nothing really I mean the Neo ps4
won't have any special treatment they're
not gonna get any exclusive features and
it won't be games that will run only on
a neo ps4 in fact the look and feel of
the interface will be the same including
the store online etc out of the gate
that doesn't really seem to be a reason
why anyone would have to upgrade however
we still don't know how this all affects
PlayStation VR there's no word if this
will improve the overall VR experience
aside from the likelihood that PS VR
games will also run better on a neo
system now we don't have a release date
just yet nor a price though there have
been reports that the Neo ps4 will debut
for around 399 the Neo deadline for
October games may indicate a late 2016
release but odds are we'll get more info
at e3 2016 in June</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
