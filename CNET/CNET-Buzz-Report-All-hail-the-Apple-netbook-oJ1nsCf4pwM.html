buzz report the show about the tech news
that everybody's talking about let's get
right into the gadget of the week
because we've got a special show for you
today the gadget of the week is the
apple netbook rumor the word is that
taiwanese manufacturer wintech will
start shipping touch screens for a new
apple netbook sometime in the summer and
I'm here to tell you it's probably true
why because first the last time there
was a flurry of wind tech touchscreen
rumors was in july two thousand seven
right before apple launched the ipod
touch in September yeah wind text got a
leak second the new nine hundred dollar
sony vaio p series not a netbook proves
that it's perfectly okay to launch a
super expensive netbook as long as it
looks pretty and we all know apple luvs
super expensive and pretty apple netbook
take it to the bank oh and in case
you're wondering i'm not even going to
mention that new shuffle they announced
that thing is ridiculous I mean the
controls are on the cable of the junkie
earbuds that no one even wants and you
can't replace them unless you buy a
dongle for them they cost extra that's
just I am not mentioning that moving on
and now for the news this week a buzz
reports special report the death of the
newspaper this is the week that
newspapers turned terminal they've been
on the ropes for a while in fact back in
the buzz out loud prediction show for
2009 I predicted that one major u.s.
newspaper would go online only this year
man was i shooting low in newspaper bad
news this week alone silicon alley
insider estimates that printing and
delivering the New York Times cost twice
as much as it would cost to send every
subscriber a free kindle minimal they
refer to the technology of newsprint as
laughably expensive and inefficient ouch
also this week Time magazine put out a
list of 10 US newspapers that it
predicts will either fold or go digital
in the very near future the papers
include everything from the Cleveland
Plain Dealer to the San Francisco
Chronicle to the Miami Herald meanwhile
new ID
is for replacing newspapers are rolling
out faster than breaking news media news
group the fourth largest newspaper
company in the u.s. is creating a new
system for printing only the news you
want on a special printer at your house
great so we're well on our way to
becoming a world of narrow-minded myopic
ignorant fools I can't wait that's going
to end well or we're all going to end up
as well-rounded well-read intellectuals
feeding our minds at the all-you-can-eat
internet buffet oh look it's Tom Merritt
CNET's resident expert hmm I think it's
time for a little point/counterpoint Tom
it's obvious that the death of
newspapers will signal the arrival of
intellectual armageddon where will we
turn for high quality writing and
reporting oh no Molly intellectual
Armageddon happened a while back in the
1980s I think probably with the launch
of Fox no I can guarantee you the web
has just as much intellectual quality as
any other journalistic mediums says you
but we need newspapers as curators of
information helping us discover news we
wouldn't otherwise see in academia we
call that agenda setting it's the idea
that some snooty nose trained
journalists like me knows more than
people the web frees us from the chains
of our oppressors who force us to read
about gardening tips and puppies come on
okay well a gardening tips are important
and me it's not like people will educate
themselves on their own you can't tell
me that blogs are higher quality
journalism you cannot trust these
internet people trust them you can and
trust them you will Mollywood it's the
wisdom of the crowds they are wise like
wizards except instead of embarrassing
gallons with moons and stars they're in
their underwear downstairs in the extra
room and you get to pick what wisdom
from which crowds you want to read in
fact the web lets you sort it by region
political bias and underwear brand
exactly which means that people just
start reading only the news they're
interested in they continue to harden
their own opinions they refuse to read
counter arguments and they ultimately
lower the level of the debate to
constant close-minded partisan shrieking
or maybe just maybe it will mean the
monopolistic control of the news cycle
by bloated corporations with business
models stuck in the time of the
spanish-american
war will go under and we'll be able to
experience a richer wider number of
perspectives that allow us to open our
minds and gain greater understanding
well you're wrong that's where you're
wrong and there you have it open debate
in a free society and that's the buzz
report for this week everyone I'm
Mollywood and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
