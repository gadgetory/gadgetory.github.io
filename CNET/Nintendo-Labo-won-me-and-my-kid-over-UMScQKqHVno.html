programmable RC cars magic pianos
motorcycles fishing poles and even a
giant robot mech suit Nintendo LeBeau is
a crazy construction and gaming set
arriving this April turning the Nintendo
switch into a modular toy that
transforms into a wild combination of
paper craft things I got to play with
Nintendo lab Oh along with my kid at a
preview event in New York City designed
for parents and children to collaborate
the wildest project is the Nintendo lab
Oh robot an $80 standalone kit that
turns your body into a cardboard mech
suit a cardboard backpack arm and leg
controls and a flip-down visor control a
giant robots movements throwing punches
and stomping around a second $70 variety
kit does several things all in one
package it's got a fishing pole that
feels like you're casting a line into
the switch screen and rumbles when
you're reeling any cash a cardboard
piano really works and changes musical
styles depending on what cardboard plugs
you popped into it the switch can turn
into a motorcycle with a cardboard kit
that acts like handlebars and
accelerates when you twist the rumbles
even feel right a weird house to wait
turns the switch screen into a window
while cardboard plug in faucets and
buttons make things happen inside and an
RC car kit works with up to two mini
cars simultaneously turning the joique
on controllers in two buzzing moving
robot bugs each of these games is a
blast to play for the short time that we
got to play them many of them feel like
the sort of crazy ideas that once you
switch promise when the switch console
was first released last year the
construction process can get complicated
but for my nine-year-old and I it was
clear and fun really well-made
instructions show all the steps in 3d
coloring in the creations with pens and
stickers is totally optional but yeah
you should do it
we had time to make the RC cars and most
of a fishing pole and here's the
surprise the toys are programmable
LeBeau garage will allow anyone to
customize how the cardboard creations
communicate and connect use the
motorcycle handlebars to control the RC
car or maybe even make an electric
guitar with cat sounds we don't know how
deep all the games are and how durable
the cardboard creations are over time
but Nintendo lab oh one my kid over and
me it might be reason enough to get the
switch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
