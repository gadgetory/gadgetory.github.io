standing here beside whirlpools gold
series 6.2 cubic feet freestanding
electric range with fast preheat model
WFP 720 h0 a s let's call it the
whirlpool from now on like I said this
is a free-standing electric range that
you can slide into your kitchen wherever
you want and it's got four main burners
and one keep warm burner on this smooth
top cooking surface now the features
this thing has are kind of minimal it's
got a triple ring burner here that you
can expand choose how big you want it to
be kind of nice for flexible cooking
depending on the size of your pot it
also has this rapid boil burner here on
the front right that'll boil water a
little faster using a little extra
wattage when I tested it out the rapid
preheat decreased the preheat time by
about 20% that's not bad but it's still
not as good as the fast preheat mode on
this Electrolux model that decreases
preheating time by about 33% as for the
oven you're looking at a six point two
cubic foot convection oven so it's got
that fan in the back circulates the hot
air throughout the oven for more even
and slightly faster cooking in some
cases and that's about as far as the
seven will take you in terms of features
it's got a recessed baking element which
is nice that hides the coils you won't
drop food on it and you can put water
over top of that for an easy self-clean
cycle they call that aqua lift but again
not terribly uncommon in ovens at this
price range still the lack of flashy
exciting features aside this whirlpool
gets the little things right and it
cooks well in our tests that never
disappointed us we cooked the usual
roast chicken tests and biscuits and I
also made a lot of sweet stuff some
cookies and brownies and with all of it
the whirlpool did a nice job now let's
talk about some of these small little
things that I liked a lot first off the
knobs a lot of ovens right now are kind
of going all-in when it comes to touch
controls they got multiple buttons for
each burner
it makes for a cluttered display and not
a very practical one whirlpool has
resisted that temptation
with this oven and I'm really glad they
did because for me knobs just make a lot
more sense when it comes to how you
control your burners another thing I
like is that you've got this hot surface
light this comes on once the burners get
hot but it stays on even after you turn
them off because the burners don't
instantly get cold that's great because
it's not always obvious when the burners
are hot after you've turned stove
and that can help keep you from burning
yourself I like that it's a good little
feature this Whirlpool Gold Series
freestanding range
retails for 1249 and that's a little on
the expensive side but not quite as
expensive as a comparable model from
KitchenAid and it's also three hundred
dollars less than that Electrolux market
for its solid performance in the kitchen
and it's keen attention to detail I
think this is a pretty good oven and if
you find it on sale maybe consider it
for your kitchen for seeing it I'm right
