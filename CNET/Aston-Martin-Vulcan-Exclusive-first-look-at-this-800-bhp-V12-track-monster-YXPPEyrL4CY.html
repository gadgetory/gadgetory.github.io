rare very exclusive track based car
we're only making 24 of them it's a
hypercar for the track it uses all of
the technology that we have spent years
and years developing in terms of carbon
technologies lightweight materials based
on all the racing knowledge that we have
24 very very special units it's a v12
seven liter v12 it's plus 800 horsepower
13 50 kilos in weight it has an extract
sequential gearbox mated to a hand-built
handmade racing engine built by Aston
Martin Racing in partnership with
ourselves so really the most incredible
car that you'll see on a racetrack and
we like to call it the dark art of Aston
lot why 24 because we race in 24 hour
races and it just happens to be the 24th
Bond movie this year as well we
definitely won't see Vulcan in the Bond
movie but it is the car that will
probably get James Bond to take his odds
test to go on the track it's very
different from any other Aston Martin
because we can because we're able to do
it different but there are cues and
hints at a possible future design
direction we wanted something that would
be very different to all of the other
low-volume rare production cars that
we've done as well and the freedom that
we're given because it's purely track
based and the materials that we
really help with that as well it doesn't
have a typical Aston Martin grill there
are hints of things that we have
produced in the past I EDP 100 the car
that was in the Gran Turismo gaming and
it's there in the real life so you will
start to see the slow feed of all of
these ideas and Q's coming into our
production cars for us that's very very
important as well because if you're like
DP 100 becomes the test bed in terms of
the visual and it's now turning that
idea into production albeit only 24 but
they will be functioning lights so
there's a progression there of that idea
and the thought and really it's the
deconstruction of the light at the rear
it's a single LED element that we can
then place in our typical see graphic
but to this very very high effect in
terms of the kind of warp speed and the
light should look as though it's moving
through space the freedom that you're
allowed because we are purely track
based and again the timeframe the
materials that we're using really we hid
the lamps more than anything on on
volcom the lamp is all in shadow so it's
a graphic element that sits underneath
the shadow the face of the car and it's
something that you will start to see
more of if you reference db10 you'll see
that shark like face there and this is a
real predator so it had to have a face
that was basically going to pass the car
that's in front of it I think the part
that I really really enjoy is if you
look at the side of the car it doesn't
have what we would call a great amount
of wedge that's an extreme angle between
the front and the rear because it's so
low but if you look at the side of the
car there is a line that comes off the
side stripe that runs into the rear
haunch creating this wedge even though
the car itself sits very parallel to
ground so it's that beautiful playing
with in space with shape and form to
generate that excitement if everyone
else has hybrid then for us this is the
pinnacle of
naturally aspirated it's the most
powerful v12 engine that we've ever
produced and I think that's very very
important that kind of visceral feeling
that you have and it's named Aston
Martin Vulcan because there is a very
famous plane that we all know that
sounds incredible and the sound of the
Vulcan when it's driving is absolutely
we're building the engine so we can hear
they're on the test bed currently and we
will start to see moving car with that
engine in there sometime around the
summer
