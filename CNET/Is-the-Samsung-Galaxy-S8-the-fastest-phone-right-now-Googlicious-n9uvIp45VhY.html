welcome to Google issues for all the
Google you can think of now this is the
prime month for the cream of the crop
with Android phones the LG G six
officially went on sale in the US on
April the 7th and the galaxy s 8 will
drop on April the 21st so which one is
really faster in the real world between
the two well we know the SAT is using
the latest Snapdragon 835 in fact it's
the only phone to have it right now
while LG is using last year's best
Snapdragon 820 one and this was in order
to get their phone out before the s8
instead of waiting it out to get
supplies of the 835 s that Samsung
pretty much hoarded for themselves now
there are several videos online and they
aren't really scientific but the general
consensus is that the s8 is faster in
real-world tests when it comes to
booting up the phone or opening up apps
versus the LG G 6 but it's only faster
by a second or in many cases with apps
just a hair of a second now speed
matters but these are really small
incremental gains you see these days
year to year but right now
the galaxy s 8 is the fastest booting
phone on the market besting the iPhone 7
plus Galaxy s7 edge and now the LG G 6
alright the YouTube TV service
officially rolled out last week pitting
it directly with sling TV DirecTV now
and PlayStation View it brings a
familiar YouTube interface with DVR
capabilities for shows at $35 a month
the biggest catch it's only available in
five cities right now Los Angeles New
York Chicago Philadelphia and the Bay
Area one drawback is that you have to
use a chromecast or a cast compatible
device to get it on your big screen
until Google makes an actual app for
Apple TV Roku and Amazon fire now I know
it's for mobile users but you still want
to watch TV
easily on your TV it also has your big
four networks ABC CBS FOX NBC but it
lacks channels from Time Warner and
Viacom so that means no CNN TNT Comedy
Central or AMC now the service right now
is good but it's not great because of
its lack of cities and for $35 you're
not really getting all the poor channels
that people expect out of a cable
service but if the cable package works
for you then I think you'll like it but
it has plenty of work to do
to get more support for cities and TV
networks
that really rival what the others are
doing all right it's been rumored for a
while but a new card in the discover tab
of the Google home app shows that the
Google home will have multiple user
support the feature isn't live at the
moment but the idea is to allow Google
homes have a personalized experience for
each user in the house rumors claim the
speaker will be even able to recognize
individual voices in order to
automatically switch accounts this isn't
a big ass but Google start handling
basic options like reminders sending
messages and creating calendar events
that haven't been available yet once you
get individual users set up thanks in
advance
all right the LGG 6 and Galaxy s8 are
the Android phones for April but there's
still a lot of you waiting to see what
can google do for a follow-up to the
well-received google pixel and really my
personal Android phone of choice now the
next-gen pixel might feature a flexible
OLED display from LG according to the
electronic Times in South Korea that
claims the goog has offered to make an
880 million dollar investment in LG's
display division now that offer could
change but Google is looking for a
stable supply of flexible OLED for their
next pixel phone apple signed a similar
type of deal with Samsung to ensure
they'll have the screens they need for
the next iPhone dropping later this year
but just remember what Google did with
their first phone ever the pixel 2 could
be special all right that's gonna do it
for this week you can email me at Google
issues at cnet.com or tweet me at brian
tong thanks so much for watching we'll
catch y'all next time for some more of
that Google ishes
you're delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
