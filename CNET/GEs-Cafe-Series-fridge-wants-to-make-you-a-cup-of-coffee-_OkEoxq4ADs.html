using a $3,300 refrigerator that fridge
the GE cafe series French door
refrigerator model CF v2 8u s HS s now
the cafe series fridges have always been
good at dispensing out hot water for
coffee or for soup but now this model
has a built in Keurig k-cup coffee maker
so you actually take this little
attachment out and then put a k-cup in
pop it back in to help heat up the water
and boom you've got coffee dispensing in
a couple of minutes I say a couple of
minutes because that hot water needs to
heat up and that takes a little while
but this fridge has another trick up its
sleeve to help with that
it's got Wi-Fi so you can pull out your
phone when you're waking up in the
morning and say start feeding the fridge
is a water tank up and then by the time
you get out to the kitchen to make your
cup of coffee it should be ready to go
it will keep that water hot for 15
minutes now design-y this is basically
the same build as existing cafe series
models just with the addition of that
cake cut maker you've got the same
controls here on the front including
this precise fill feature if you hit
that button you'll be able to dial in to
a specific amount of water to dispense
out and then dispense exactly that much
into your pot I like that a lot but I
don't like that you have to hold down
the paddle there for the entire fill you
can't just leave your pot and go do
something else like you can with
autofill another feature and other GE
fridges that will automatically fill
your pot so the bells and whistles are
pretty good with this fridge but how's
the fridge itself it's also pretty good
if you take a look at these performance
results you can see that the body of the
fridge stays well below 40 degrees on
average and the doors aren't that bad
either so all-in-all very good result
$3,300 is a lot to pay for a fridge but
for a twenty seven point eight cubic
foot model that performs well and has
cool features like those hot water
smarts and the precise fill actually not
that bad a deal at all
especially if you want your fridge to
make you pop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
