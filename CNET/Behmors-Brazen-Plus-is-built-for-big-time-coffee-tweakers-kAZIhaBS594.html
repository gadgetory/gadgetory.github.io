it and right now we're taking a first
look at the bay more brazen Plus coffee
maker
now this coffee machine is not your
ordinary countertop kitchen appliance it
is one of the only coffee machines out
there that meets the sca A's
requirements to brew a golden cup of
coffee second it is a coffee geeks dream
in that you can tweak so many different
variables of the brewing process right
down to how hot the water will be and
how long the grounds will be pre soaked
you can select how hot the water can be
you have a range from 190 degrees
Fahrenheit all the way up to 210 degrees
you can also select how long you want
the coffee grounds to be pre soaked from
15 seconds all the way up to 4 minutes
also pretty slick is that the brazen
plus has a calibration mode it will tune
the internal thermometer and time how
fast it will boil a set volume of water
that way you always get the same
performance no matter where you are as a
matter of fact there's also an elevation
setting which allows you to enter in the
altitude of your current location so if
you live 500 feet above sea level 1000
2000 feet you can adjust the brewing
process accordingly other nifty features
that the brazen plus has is the ability
to use a manual release function so you
can heat up your water to the
temperature that you want and decant it
into another brewing chamber like a
French press or even a chemical
containers and this coffee machine is
programmable too so you can set the
clock and have it turn on and begin
brewing at the time of your choosing
there are some things I don't like about
the bay more brazen plus first off it
takes a while to brew it has to heat up
its water first to the optimal
temperature and then start the brewing
process so we're looking at a brewing
time of about 10 to 12 minutes total you
also have to take into account that the
stainless steel thermal carafe doesn't
keep coffee as hot as other devices and
other coffee machines I've
that it essentially has an open part up
here which lets heat escape so we were
looking at a max of about two hours to
keep your coffee hot
so priced at two hundred and twenty nine
dollars the bay more brazen plus is
definitely no impulse buy but it
definitely brews a tasty pot of coffee
it also costs a lot less than the Tecna
for mocha master devices which run about
three hundred dollars or even more that
said you can expect the same level of
brewing performance from a less
expensive bonavita bv1800 review of this
coffee machine as well as my other
