your Google Isha's for everything Google
we can pack inside a show and the
headliner this week Google Maps goes
offline this is a legitimate reason to
get excited about maps because you'll no
longer need a reliable internet
connection if you want to use navigation
now once you enter in your destination
it will download the area data that also
includes business information for lookup
even without an active connection this
version of Google Maps starts rolling
out today but iOS users will have to
wait until later with no exact date
announced and Google for your next trick
please bring offline viewing of YouTube
videos to the US already thanks in
advance now Google is also opening up
after the company has decided to
open-source their machine learning
system called tensorflow to the public
what's so special about this tensorflow
powers speech recognition in the Google
app which is the best in the business
visual search in google's photos and
smart reply in your inbox now anyone
around the world can use these tools for
its own research and development and the
report from the information says Google
wants to design its own smartphone ships
to help it compete directly with Apple
Google hopes to create a more uniform
offering of Android phones by being
actively involved in the chip design
process with companies like Qualcomm
it's really a similar approach to how
Apple designs its own chips for the
iphone and ipad with samsung and tsmc
now the hope is that working directly
with the manufacturers will enable them
to roll out Android features that
require more complex hardware and
software relationship in the future and
the google has also just acquired fly
labs and plans to fold them into the
photos team fly labs calls themselves
creators of the world's best video apps
and has a video suite of applications
that's only available on iOS right now
they bring some interesting features
like changing the speed of a clip
multiple times within that clip or their
fly up lets you use gestures to edit
videos alright new reports from users
online are claiming that the rear glass
panel on the Nexus 6p is spontaneously
cracking it's not widespread yet but
several people have posted their stories
with pictures and it could become a
bigger issue that
we'll follow now I just got my 6p and
I'm enjoying the pure Android experience
like a whole lot but this week there's
really only one product to talk about
and that's the official announcement of
the Tag Heuer connected SmartWatch it
looks like a tag it costs $1500 with the
sapphire glass a titanium body and one
gig of ram
it's the prices Android wear device out
there but I'd already call it the best
build Android wear device to date there
are multiple interactive watch faces
that you can change up with themes from
timekeeping to weather to fitness but at
the end of two years when the watch
pretty much becomes outdated you'll have
the ability to pay an extra $1,500 to
get a similar Carrera watch so that's
three thousand dollars for a watch that
normally retails around five thousand
what a business model for the connected
trade your old SmartWatch in for a real
watch so what's new is old is new but
really it's timeless all right that's
gonna do it for this week's show you can
email us at Google issues at cnn.com or
tweet me at Brian Tong thanks for
watching we'll see you all next time for
some more of that Google Isha's Google
