year I know it's a little early there's
still time for a company to completely
alter this list but that's a risk we're
willing to take let's talk turkey coming
in at number 5 is the end of the whole
wham-o uber feud the tech world has seen
some crazy battles over the years Apple
suing Microsoft Apple suing Samsung the
US Department of Justice suing Microsoft
then there was way most suing uber over
theft of trade secrets in February this
seemed like there would be a serious
battle that could go on forever
and it went on for days for days as in
one more day than three days the two
companies decided to settle
wham-o ended up owning 0.34% of ubers
equity that amount could be worth around
two hundred and forty five million
dollars
waynebow was seeking 1.8 billion dollars
in damages so this was like a
firecracker that ended up being a dud if
the two companies were just going to
settle there was little reason to go and
waste a Court's time at all and number
four is airpower I've seen wireless
power device has been pushed for years
the wireless chief standard was a huge
step forward I will say I was really
surprised when Apple jumped onto the Qi
standard bandwagon then it announced air
power a device that could power multiple
products at one time air power was also
supposed to let devices talk to each
other regarding power consumption this
was back in September 2017 then a year
went by in that time Apple took a lot of
references to air power off its site but
there's a tiny shred of hope air power
was mentioned in the iPhone 10's manuals
number three is Elon Musk and his use of
Twitter I don't even know where to start
with this one on one hand we've got this
guy who's regular compared to the
fictional Tony Stark on the other hand
we've got these tweets this tweet by
musk got Tesla in hot water with a DOJ
because musk claimed in 2017 testa would
produce 5000 model threes per week by
December 2017 the company didn't hit
that mark until June of this year
this tweet got musk in even more trouble
he got slapped with a 20mm
dollar fine Tesla the company was hit
with its own 20 million dollar fine
musk also had a step down as chairman of
Tesla's Board of they'll remain CEO why
because the SEC said the tweet was
misleading
which cost test a stock price to jump
over 6% and let's not even talk about
the whole submarine thing criminy at
number 2 is Facebook and Cambridge
analytical okay let's recap this mess
data from as many as 87 million people
was improperly shared with Cambridge
analytical a data analytics firm the
information collected by Cambridge
analytical may have been misused for
political ads during the 2016 US
presidential election the company also
had a connection to the Trump
presidential campaign Facebook did take
actions to correct things by purging
pages linked to a Russian troll farm the
company also tried to make changes to
avoid election shenanigans before the US
midterm elections this year then for
some reason the company introduced a new
video chatting gadget by the name of
portal that's right Facebook is trying
to sell camera-equipped devices for your
home after all of this good luck with
that before we get to number one let's
discuss an honorable mention Google a
lot went wrong for the company this year
but let's keep it light the pixel 3 was
one of the worst kept secrets in a long
time it was leaked so much that even
Google made fun of that fact when it
formally introduced the pixels and the
biggest tech turkey of 2018 was u.s. net
neutrality getting audit pied back in
2015 the FCC made net neutrality a
formal thing in the United States the
concept of net neutrality is basically
all bits are treated the same you should
receive data from any service without an
internet service provider interfering
then the u.s. got a new FCC Commissioner
they comically large coffee mug object
PI led the Commission in killing the
previous rules and also stripped the
agency of its authority to regulate the
internet now noting Horrible's happened
yet we don't have fast lanes for
specific services yet but this is like
deciding to keep your front door
unlocked
sure
nothing could happen for a while but
there's a big opportunity for something
to go wrong several states are trying to
build workaround methods to ensure net
neutrality but that can cause issues
with the federal government we'd like to
formally apologize to actual turkeys
there's nothing inherently wrong with
being a turkey to you I say gobble
gobble gobble
