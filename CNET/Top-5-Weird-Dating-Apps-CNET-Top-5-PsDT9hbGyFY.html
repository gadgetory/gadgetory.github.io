can be difficult to find the right
person who is a real connection with you
there are now lots of ways to meet
thanks to new apps but here are some
that use some unusual criteria to match
you up and number 5 is taste buds with
half a million users tastebuds hook is
to match you up space on your taste in
music the app can scan your iPhone music
library or you can share your favorite
music then taste buds will match with
people's nearby and number 4 is a pets
it's an app that forces people to get to
know each other before profile
information is given out here's an
example if you match like shirt
interests or messages you can unlock
info about your matches interests
profile photos must also be unlocked
it's kind of like a reverse tinder and
number three is padieu but do claims it
has 350 million people on its service
over 190 countries it's added a new
feature called look-alikes you can
search for people who look like
celebrities your friends or you can even
upload a picture so if you're seeking a
particular look or type Badu has you
covered
a quick note users of the app can opt
out of being searchable by this new
feature number two is hotline this is
truly strange after you match on this
app you will not be able to message each
other until you engage in a voice call
that lasts for more than five minutes
the voice call is set up through the
hotline app so if the call goes poorly
the phone numbers are not exposed
matches are also limited to three at a
time before we get to number one
honorable mentions go to bris lair and
sizzle Brits learn matches people with
beards with those who want to stroke
them sizzle from Oscar Mayer matched
people who like bacon those services may
or may not be functioning anymore and
then number one it's Biloxi's who cares
about music or phone calls Luxy is all
about matching people who make lots of
money if you earn more than $200,000 you
can join for free alternatively you can
be voted in by attractiveness I'm not
making any of that up Luxy claims one
out of every two active members earns
more than half a million dollars so good
luck
this is the part no one watches so I'd
like to discuss this master's
documentary I watched the name of would
escape so you know what it's called let
me know so in the old days master says
you want rope bass so you have a tight
little ropes asleep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
