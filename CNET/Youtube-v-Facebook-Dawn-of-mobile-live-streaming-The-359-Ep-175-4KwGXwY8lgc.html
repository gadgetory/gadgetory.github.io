February's seventh and somehow and by
God's grace we have made it to episode
175 Wow well that's a milestone that is
kind of minnie mouse minnie milestone
good morning Roger Tsien and Ben Fox
Rubin what is up guys what is up Wow 135
that is that's impressive I'm realize
you haven't fireside that's that feels
really good days aren't over yet then
shout out to a mirror who's in the chat
and feeling nerdy yes that oh my it's a
very very nerdy title to this episode I
know it is so let's really lean into it
yeah let's so what we're gonna be
talking about YouTube live going on
mobile soon soon not yet but there is a
feature they promised back in June but
yeah they're finally getting around to
bringing it out we will be talking about
LG g 6 a little bit more information on
that a little bit more of a tease and
lastly check out this cool video that's
what made using hololens an
interpretation of video game portal on
hololens sort of a a great example of
augmented reality so yeah it looked
pretty cool to live yeah totally so
let's uh let's do it if you have any
questions as usual in the comments
section Brian will pick out the best and
we will get to them in four minutes plus
all right here we go start the recording
in three two
welcome to the 359 when we talk about
the top tech news of the day and all the
crap you want to throw in I'm Roger
Cheng I'm Ben Fox Rubin so it's all
about live video YouTube said today that
would launch its live video service on
mobile phones soon didn't give a
specific date yet but it's a service
that's available in step top we actually
use it to broadcast a 359 live but going
on mobile means it takes on Facebook
live now you live streaming has been one
of the hot trends over the last year or
so but then what you think do you think
YouTube has a shot at sort of being the
next Facebook live Facebook life killer
jeez I I mean like don't you think that
it's like Facebook is the underdog in
this situation it is definitely
interesting to see and like by the way
what about periscope like whatever
happened to those guys or meerkat warmer
yet meerkat died but periscope was
actually like still a thing by like a
legitimately sized company right but it
is interesting to see how much video has
become like this really important thing
to all these major tech players really
that's how they make money these days
that's how they get a world ed bugs
we're all the ad money that's where all
the ad bucks are going so uh it's kind
of this continued tit for tat that's how
how YouTube is going to continue to keep
up with facebook do you think Facebook's
actually underdog here now granted
YouTube is still the most popular site
for video but in terms of live video and
mobile live video this is fairly new for
them yeah definitely I mean in that case
it feels like why didn't they do it
sooner yeah they kind of let Facebook
jump in the game and really start to
expand in mobile video a lot more and
basically eaten your cat and periscopes
lunch we'll see if you tube is then able
to gobble up a lot of what facebook has
been able to do so far what YouTube has
its advantages if they've got sort of
this huge stable of YouTube celebrities
who and then they can capitalize on that
you know one of the big features I think
sets this apart from facebook is this
feature called super chat allowing
viewers to actually interact and
directly talk to these youtubers for a
price right so for a youtuber smart for
youtubers this is this is huge because
this is another revenue stream gets them
in Courage's them to actually use this
as opposed to Facebook live I thought
this was a
just thing too because it potentially
cuts down on trolling I don't know what
the price is but you're much less likely
I would assume to go after somebody if
you actually have to start paying yeah
so think of that I was gonna make I've
got to make my comment I really work at
it right if I am gonna troll Ciotti I'm
just gonna do it once because I gotta
make rent this week all right next up
LG's officially set its g6 press
conference for februari 26 that's that's
at the beginning of Mobile World
Congress as we're expecting a pretty
busy day turns a lot of phones it's it's
gonna be a busy show but LG has
potential to really steal the show with
Samsung out of the out of the running
there so I mean the big tease is that
this phone is going to be almost all
screen virtually bezel asst thats not
pretty cool it's funny though because
the the rumor has it the you know iphone
will have a similar feature now you're
starting to see budgets companies like
Xiaomi now LG kind of come out ahead of
the rumor kind of capitalized that
tendency to the case right everybody
like sees what the Apple rumor is going
to be in September and they try to get
out ahead of it in hopes that you know
like hey we'll steal these customers
before they get the new iphone right and
we've already reported that again the g6
loses its replaceable battery but is
water resistant so kind of going in line
with what the rest of the industry is
doing lastly please check out this clip
that someone made using hollow lens and
augmented reality to recreate the game
portal and for those of you don't know
what portal is basically you're able to
create these little portals or wormholes
or whatever warp zones to to move from
place to place to escape this dangerous
lab in this video you're able to
actually take this virtual cube throw it
around from one portal to another and
the cube actually interacts with things
in real life like for instance you've
dropped the portal or you drop the cube
down a flight of stairs it will actually
recognize those real stairs and like
roll down them so it's a great example
of augmented reality that is really cool
and definitely shows the potential of
what you could do in AR so definitely
looking forward to seeing more of these
kind of things absolutely for more of
these stories should because I don't see
that Roger Tsien I'm Ben Fox Rubin
thanks for listening
that is super cool yeah as an avid
portal gamer that looks really awesome I
would definitely get into that I would
actually be dangerous like I wouldn't
end up talking to people I would just be
playing poorly just create a little like
portals from place to place right oh you
want me to write a story is how that
work a floral like on top of say like
been right with a cube fall hit Ben's
head I'm just curious how smart the
system is a luxury when you said if
interacts with stairs it just recognized
as objects in the foreground right right
it's just an obstacle by the way the
companion cube would probably bounced
off his head this is what's really which
is all about this by the way he's better
if it was actually real yes a recent
college graduate is the one that
actually created this his name is kenny
wang and he's still looking around for a
job apparently what hopefully seems like
i need to be employed ASAP yeah but
that's like I initially thought this was
a concept that came from Microsoft this
was from you know recent college grad
which shows the potential for you know
developing these kind of high knees once
I start getting of elements in for three
thousand dollars a pop I don't know that
is a good question they're not they're
not available for mass consumers it's
really just a developer audition that
they have right now to allow people like
any to experiment with potential of that
headset and yeah this is definitely one
of the cooler examples that I've seen of
hollow lens I mean I've seen a couple
but this is I'm and I'm not a big fan of
portal either you should be I don't gain
that much though um let's jump back into
the YouTube versus Facebook stream war
yeah um before we discover both their
mothers names as Martha oh nice Owen in
the chair really it's out okay fine I
get it get it I get it first off Owen
calls out that YouTube's been saying
soon for far too long yes and then read
more it's too basic more importantly he
says they're tote two totally different
platforms people on YouTube actually
watch videos facebook is where people
spend 30 seconds to three minutes on
video but rarely more and he's not wrong
with that no that's true you gotta
wonder if Facebook actually transformed
the YouTube audience landscape because
as you said it's it's a paid service so
people will pay to troll for one it will
listen they paid a chat even from
experience it
good chat and let's do I pay to watch
the videos so fair it could it could
evolve in two ways like it can work to
allow individuals to stream video more
easily from their phone as Facebook live
has done or maybe it just changes the
way sort of the the presentation of
YouTube videos are done now like most of
them are done in great and like studios
and sets or polished videos like you to
the YouTube celebrities right right uh
taking a mobile means maybe this you'll
see more interactive videos or just see
more videos that are on the road but
starring youtubers as opposed to the
average Joe who's just streaming you
know like the high school basketball
game I think the commenter is right that
Facebook has generally been used for
shorter video clips however the company
has really been pushing to get people to
watch longer videos they even said that
they're really going to try to impress
upon longer videos in the news stream
because once you're on Facebook getting
people to watch videos and getting them
to watch them longer is is a great way
to get more engagement feed you more ads
on Facebook make more money nightly i
said this couple times my wife uses
facebook but the newsfeed is basically
like her remote control she just keeps
swiping through videos she sees the
video she like she'll just keep playing
it yeah yeah it's kind of interesting
that YouTube's really gone to both ends
of the spectrum now with the YouTube red
and now this YouTube mobile live or it's
gone from premium extensive
feature-length content to periscope
clone right the haft and everything in
between that's like that's the tech
world you have to be everywhere and if
you you are in like YouTube had been
with mobile live streaming you're
basically allowing Facebook to come in
and start to build in that area and
that's a that's a big problem like
YouTube does not want to lose on video
it's just interesting though in the
world where periscope and vine are dead
and now we get instagramming YouTube
stories type situations yeah yeah and I
like that maxtor and the chat is pointed
out go Instagram I really love their new
update with stories it's so original I
think the first time I've ever
recognized sarcasm in the cheerio Bravo
I mean if that is true but if facebook
wants to keep stealing snapchat
playbook and you know none of that stuff
is actually like patentable or anything
now smart ideas or smart design if they
want to keep doing that using Instagram
then like go ahead I mean the killer app
there is that Facebook and take all
those ideas that snapchat pioneered and
actually put it in a user interface that
people understand right right like
snapchat is intentionally confusing and
they said that's a risk that's what
makes it cool but if it's kind of a
little you eternity on exactly when
you're gonna be gotta be a ute but if
you want to reach that billion users you
could just you can facebook steal the
idea and just repurpose it and make it a
lot easier to use I mean so kind of
Apple does that it'll probably do an
arguably better job of delivering that
kind of content since there are already
more household names I mean when my mom
and grandma know what YouTube and
Facebook are ya and if you start giving
this an opportunity like oh god I don't
want to think about like my mom making
vines vines this vine come back no no
but then it's got this that I i think
this mirrors a lot of that in execution
I would think it's true you could see or
do Facebook live video yeah I won't do
that really know anybody who's me
cooking a cake or baking a cake for my
lovely son for my son Brian tagi right
here who didn't want to watch me do this
for him I want to give note to cochina
in the chat YouTube's constant change of
algorithm hurts if your company and I
think that's very true there's been a
lot of outcry from the YouTube celebrity
platform yep the regular content
contributors about how the algorithm is
very very favorite favorite favorite
prefect ism whatever it is a selective
in who gets a better who benefits from
that algorithm yeah yeah and not
everybody can post every day and keep up
like you have to do to stay relevant
youtube and you think will will this
kind of platform become more of a
supplemental you see channels
contributing maybe once or twice a week
a full form video and then these little
clips in between kind of thing to fill
the gaps yeah I think that was part of
my original point was I think you
changing like you the concept of the
subscription-based media yeah I think
you'll see sort of a change in the
presentation of a lot of these videos
from more slickly produced
pieces of content that's longer form to
shorter clips done on the go done on the
fly yeah I think I mean that that's only
makes sense to me for the especially for
these youtubers who are looking to build
a connection with their viewers like it
doesn't get more intimate than like
shooting this random video on your phone
like on the go wherever you are right
yeah it's also to me fascinating to see
how you create new forms of celebrity
with each new format yeah and so this is
obviously another opportunity to mint
new YouTube stars just by creating this
new mobile live streaming platform
granted that hasn't really happened with
periscope correct me if I'm wrong here
but it did with mine but it did with
vine so this is this if done correctly
and if you don't end up suppressing some
of the new voices this could actually
help elevate some yeah some interesting
new people on YouTube and before we let
it go calling out to the chat again is
anybody excited about the new g6 phone I
am interested because I'm going to be in
the market for a new phone and I hmm I
hate the new iphone all right sell it to
me me I don't know I'm not a Salesman
hold it what was the big thing with the
g5 was that the modular yeah the g5 was
in one word like the the bottom half
kind of was removable you could swap out
different parts for it it was kind of a
failure it was a total failure yeah I
mean they've completely reversed course
right Dave this phone for better worse
if it kind of mimics a lot of the other
flagship phones right LG for a long time
was like we're the only ones with a
replaceable battery that's gone now
right they said well water resistance we
don't really know people care about that
that's in the new phone and it will be
again frameless not frameless will be
near frameless so it'll kind of follow
the iphone rumor playbook mm-hmm do we
have any info on like durability grading
anything like that yeah because you
think all glass front shatter mmm yeah
that's a really good point although I
mean if they're using gorilla glass lace
gorilla glass it should be ok right been
our Gorilla Glass expert yes and no if I
pop it on a flat surface sure if you
drop it on asphalt even if it's flat
asphalt if you're much more likely
dropped a brief phone on asphalt like it
doesn't matter if it's full glass or not
it's true still gonna crack right no
it's just it's it's a useful tip to
people
that I guess you should panic a little
bit more if you drop it on asphalt
because asphalt is not completely flat
it's got all those little edges to it
and that's what cracks your phone if you
dropped it on marble because marble is
mostly okay you're more likely to be
okay because not hitting can ever
guarantee right but it spreads out the
pain across the phone a little bit more
so the pain you shouldn't trap you
shouldn't drop your phone one more thing
before we wrap it up for the day when do
we know when is this the YouTube update
going live we don't know we don't just
said soon soon soon and its first gonna
come to the YouTube you have youtuber
killing thousands subscriber yeah
exactly so you've gotta be like a
youtuber basically to take advantage of
this first got it so follow us that
close and I start being lazier with the
show yeah yeah yeah it's the 359 from my
bedroom actually from my bed I just
