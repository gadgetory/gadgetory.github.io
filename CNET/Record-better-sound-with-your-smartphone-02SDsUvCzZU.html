this week we're looking at how to record
good quality sound with our smart phone
films now it's not quite as hard as what
you may think but there are a few
challenges you need to keep in mind
now smartphones are being fantastic
they're really really portable we've
looked at a couple of different ways
that we can get great quality pictures
out of these so far however why do they
let us down when it comes to sound the
reason simple it's the on-board
microphone now even for filming these
webisodes I'm recording a sound that's
going to this this particular clip right
now from a lapel microphone that's
pinned to the top of my shirt I'm going
to get Trent our cameraman just to
unplug that microphone input and you'll
see what this sounds like now when I'm
recording the sound direct from the
camera microphone okay now this camera
is about a meter and a half away from me
and you'll be able to hear a lot of
destruction in the sound room echo you
can hear the air conditioner in the
background all because the microphone is
that much further away from me
it plugs it back in however nice good
crisp quality sound because the
microphone is right near the sound
source okay now one way to get great
quality sound with your film is to
actually put a sound recording device
very close to the action that means
taking the sound away from your camera
now device like this is called a zoom
digital audio recorder is fantastic okay
now these come in a number of different
models but you know for a couple of
hundred dollars you can have a pro
quality audio recorder however that's
only good if you're going to edit your
film because you're going to need to
find a way to marry the pictures from
your smart phone to the sound from this
device to be frame accurate if you're
after a really inexpensive way to get
better quality sound from a smartphone
happily one of these are endless on ebay
fantastic little microphone just plugs
into a standard three-and-a-half
millimeter mini jack is going to improve
the audio over and above the onboard
microphone on most smartphones and the
great thing is you can angle it into a
number of different directions to your
sound source that's going to make it
nice and clear
would you believe you can actually get
better quality audio from your pocket
camera by adding a lens attachment to it
I'm going to show you how you may recall
an webisode one where we looked at lens
attachments for smartphones and I showed
this little one which was a wide-angle
lens attachment its optical glass it's
metal it's very good quality now my
iPhone here if I just snap this onto the
front of my iPhone what it does is it
opens up the angle of view so even now
in this picture here you can see without
the lens how far away I have to hold the
camera to get myself into shop there
whereas if I put this lens on the front
there I can drag it a lot closer to me
and still get the same sort of framing
now what that means is I'm closer to my
microphone so I'm doubling my audio
quality here's a little example out in
the field to show you how that works
okay quick experient I'm outside I'm
standing against the brick wall the
cameras held that by my arm here so it's
probably about half a meter away from my
face we can hear my voice okay you can
also hear Federative background stuff
coming in too now if I put this lens
attachment onto the iPhone I'll be able
to bring the microphone and the camera
bit closer to me so here we go probably
about 20 centimeters away from me now
and whilst you can still hear some
reflective noise in the background my
voice should be a lot sharper and a lot
clearer so there you go shows you how a
lens can help you get better quality
audio - if you want my absolute
must-have audio accessory for pocket
cameras got to be one of these Belkin
produce this it's a mini boom microphone
these things are fantastic because it's
got two sound modes on it it's got
switchable fields from narrow to wide
which opens up a whole scope of audio
recording possibilities again it just
plugs into the stereo headphone jack
there straight away professional quality
sound it doesn't get any easier than
that absolutely perfect increase or
rather film you've got to check out this
week is called space balloon you will
not believe it okay this family over in
America decided as an experiment to send
their iPhone up in a space via a helium
balloon it recorded pictures came back
to earth it's absolutely amazing gotta
check it out alright that's about it for
me
next time we catch up we're gonna look
at moving pictures so I'm going to show
you all sorts of crazy things like table
dollies
steadicam devices for pocket cameras you
won't believe what you see see you then
