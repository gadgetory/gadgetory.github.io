roadtrip we ran into trouble as the
Model S took us on some time-consuming
detours they saw it as a mess our hotel
by about a hundred and fifty miles we're
behind schedule so the pressure will be
on for our final days driving it's
Barcelona or bust looks like a nicely
charged car to me the back on the road
it's looking like a nice morning in what
I want to say in the South of France but
if I'm honest with myself is I'm still
basically the middle yeah we've not got
as far as we hoped so instead of trying
to listen to the car sat-nav
which explains how far we're going to
get on a single charge we found that to
be just a bit too conservative and kept
telling us that we're not gonna make it
to our next charge instead what we're
going to do is go with our Girton sort
of thing if it says we've got a hundred
kilometres spare then we can make it
question of the morning is this natural
cloud forming or is it some sort of
giant power plant
oh I was right oh it's a power punch
it's a as the Sun rises are not quite
southern France the miles disappear
beneath our electrically powered wheels
with an open road and a better sense of
what the Model S needs yesterday's
concerns feel a hundred miles away aqua
has only one album on Spotify aquarium
very recently I was looking at it and
they had both of their hit albums and
both of their hits albums aqua did not
have two hits albums some of those songs
and some of the happy boys and girls
don't call class in my oh my singing
every day barbie girl unforgettable good
morning sunshine legendary dr. Jones
classic of the genre heated Paco
another charge another few hundred
kilometers closer to our goal with the
Spanish border looming we're getting
more comfortable with the dynamics of
electric charging but we're still
learning new things about the car itself
cars making a new noise which is always
what you want from a car
it's a short and why is that unusual
because every charge of so far as being
in the back garden of a bad hotel
smarties four packs harrybo four pack
pick-and-mix
four packs shepherd shops for and I got
I got the Space Ranger on the Segway
frankly because it's four closest I
could find to a technology journalist
with our next charge point well within
range we're able to spend some time
getting to grips with the Model S's more
exotic hardware what's particularly cool
about this guys that is actually packed
with tech on the inside in particular
some of the well let's call it Auto
Drive features if I just double pull
this little lamp stalk towards me
firstly it's matching my speed to what
I've told it to but also it's using
sensors on the outside of a car to look
at the lines on the road
it was steer for you to make sure you
stay in those lines but also if you just
if you just tap the indicator then when
it it's safe the car can actually move
across the next Lane for you we're now
only stopping at charge points that are
close to the motorway and ignoring
charges when we confidently have enough
spare range to just power through the
hours roll past in a haze of Road
charges and killing time in hotel car
parks we even find time to take a
coastal detour before crossing the
border into Spain and making a final
smooth run into Barcelona Airport
hey Italy but it actually seems like
we're going to make it for mobile all
the Congress you know that means it
means that we're done means are actually
done as a thousand miles all on
electrics how many fossils have we set
fire to zero no I mean none in the car
but often those ammonites I don't repair
well Luke we made it any final thoughts
well I was struck by how different and
electric drivers all the variables that
we had to deal with things like range
speed charge time charge location
terrain charging an empty battery versus
one that's half-full it's all that
mental trigonometry that's always going
on it felt actually a little bit more
sometimes like sailing than driving you
know having to accomodate for things
like wind and tide that sort of stuff
always thinking yeah definitely but at
the end of the day though we did make it
like we've shown that electric cars
aren't just great for these short city
drives we did a thousand miles in that
Tesla and really that makes me extremely
excited about the future of electric
driving indeed well thanks for watching
guys
au revoir we agreed au revoir</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
