you know it doesn't make the hair on the
back of your neck stand up but I'll tell
you what I can drive one of these things
all day long as so many millions do
little secret sauce going on here and
it's a little saucy err
the 2016 Accord is not a completely new
car it's on the same platform as the one
we've had since 2013
so the basic volumes and dimensions are
all still the same but they've really
revised the front and rear in particular
on the outside look at the face it's
much more sculpted and scowling people
like angry scowling car faces for some
reason out back there's a lot more
accurate DNA to my eye and again more
finely sculpted and muscular you've got
LED tail lights on all the 16 accords
and up front you've got LED headlights
available now on the top line that's
called the touring when I got in this 16
accord in a couple ways I wasn't sure
was in a Honda first of all they've done
some really smart stuff with cabin tech
which to be honest they don't normally
do in this case it's Android auto and
car place side by side no excuses no
extra cost I've got my phone cabled down
here to a convenient USB data and charge
port and that's that and check this out
she's actually got a live web browser
now not while you're driving obviously
but this is normally really high-end car
stuff you can pull over and watch CNET
on cars but wouldn't I still have my
gripes about the interface though first
of all there's no volume knob yeah you
got to use that rocker on the wheel or
this touch thing to the left of the
screen
no thank you and you can get too many
weirdnesses on these dual screens like
having audio on one and the same thing
on the other one that's a waste the
overall interface though has been
revised to be more elegant yet still
featuring some of the cleanest largest
touch buttons in the biz I like that
Honda hasn't strayed too far from the
playbook under the hood a 2.4 litre
direct-injected inline 4
okay first thing I want you to do if you
go test drive this means sixteen acordes
it's coming to a stop like this cutting
onto the wheel and feel the petals I
find that it idle there's kind of a
vibration coming through that I don't
expect in a modern car that isn't
exactly cheap so you got to check that
out for yourself maybe I'm nuts I don't
know now once you get going all that
harshness kind of blows away and I'm
left with a surprisingly perky
4-cylinder but my coffee might have the
six when I first drove this I was
impressed CVT gearbox you can hear and
go into it smashing ations there that's
the only choice on this EXL trim it's a
good one I got to give you that you know
I'm not a huge CVT buff now it's not too
hard to plumb this engine and find its
breathless spots so it's not a real
super powerful engine but in everyday
driving you're not gonna notice them the
big tech ticket on the road is Honda
sensing their driver assist package
including collision mitigation braking
which can go to a full stop forward
collision warning lane departure that is
active to keep you in your lane road
departure mitigation which is different
from lane departure it keeps you from
going off the road and adaptive cruise
control first time in an accord are
amplitude reactive dampers that means
two valves in the shocks to read the
road surface based on frequency of
vibration and move between the two valve
sets to be either firm or compliant okay
if the onion ever does a special on
firstworldproblems there's a technology
in this car that needs to be the cover
story it's called great throat assist or
something I mean just the name is onion
esque
what it does is it uses the electric
power steering and the vehicle's various
sensors to help you steer straight when
you're going down one of those peak
crowned roads I never knew that was
fatiguing maybe I was missing something
and I continue to love this Lane watch
cameras one of the best cameras in the
auto v' is is that one that looks down
the right side right
a 16 accord 4-cylinder EXL which is very
high trim is little over 29,000 I'm
gonna load up some sensors and that
wireless charging tech but definitely
move my trim up one more notch to get
the navigation but more importantly the
Honda sensing adaptive Drive tech that
bundle for 2 grand you're stealing that
all day long
we're in about 32 - seen that stop for
cars driven seen in style standing by
