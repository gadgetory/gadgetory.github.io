stuff you'd expect from a home security
service but also lets you add in
third-party smart home devices to create
a custom home automation and security
setup for example if you already have
devices from partners like Lutron
Chamberlain Philips and nest you can
integrate them just by linking them
under the Xfinity home app that means
with just the one app you can control
your home and setup automations like
having the lights in your house come on
at a specific time or if a motion sensor
is triggered or have a camera record a
video clip when a door is opened you can
access and create rules through a web
portal too and if you have one of
Comcast's x1 DVRs you can view your
setup from TVs in your home and control
devices with your voice and unlike some
of its competition adding things like a
connected thermostat from nest or
Xfinity zone easy to install Zen doesn't
affect your monthly bill or contract
there is a contract for service in
general though a 24 month one that runs
$40 a month unless you hit a special
sale while that package does include a
few security sensors and a nice
touchscreen control center for
monitoring everything on your system
you'll probably want more sensors or
perhaps a camera or two which also comes
with their own $10 a month per camera
service charge if you want 24/7
recording so yes the costs can add up
but they're still competitive and if
you've already got compatible smart home
devices and want one app to control them
all Xfinity home is an easy answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
