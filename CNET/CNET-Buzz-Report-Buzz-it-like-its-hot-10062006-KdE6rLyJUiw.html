buzz report and now for the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week is the
new Bluetooth watch from Sony Ericsson
and fossil it's the mbw 100 and it
actually lets you control your calls and
music find out about incoming text
messages and even display caller ID
on-screen Wow how can you possibly cram
as much information into a single watch
Oh easy it's the size of a Volkswagen
hey you can't have everything and now
for the news there's been yet another
technology recall this week due to fire
hazard and officials warn that this
recall could have a much wider impact
than recent recalls of Dell Toshiba
Fujitsu Lenovo and other laptops as this
particular product enjoys much wider
adoption than any laptop ever could
that's right everyone its hello kitty
meanwhile Fujitsu this week joined Dell
Apple Lenovo IBM and Toshiba in
recalling laptops that contain Sony
batteries the news came after Sony
initiated a worldwide recall of the
lithium-ion batteries that have proved
to be such a problem for laptop makers
hmm wait a second Lenovo Toshiba and
Fujitsu recalled their laptops but wait
usually though only Dell is actively
recalling batteries or even
investigating and in fact HP went so far
as to say it's a Dell problem here we
are today mm-hmm here's looking at you
HP this week antivirus companies McAfee
and Symantec ganged up on Microsoft over
the Windows Vista operating system the
companies are miffed that Microsoft has
locked them out of the Windows Vista
kernel they say that makes the operating
system fundamentally insecure because if
there's a serious flaw that affects the
kernel McAfee and Symantec can't create
a patch for it Microsoft on the other
hand says that opening up the kernel is
what's so dangerous in the first place
and they have to close it off so that
they can make sure that Vista is secure
ok you know what first of all all y'all
aren't doing that good a job at stopping
Windows viruses so maybe you could have
a little sit-down with dr. Phil get all
your little issues worked out and start
fighting the hackers instead of each
other do I have to do everything this
week it was widely reported that the
United State
is loosening its grip over I can which
is the body that controls Internet
domain names European nations and others
welcomed the move which they see as a
step toward the u.s. no longer
controlling the Internet but I don't
know
I mean basically what happened is the
u.s. said it would stay in control of
ICANN and then in 2009 they would think
about loosening their control over I can
maybe the US should just rename I can I
can't let go in a Capitol Hill bombshell
this week congressman Mark Foley
resigned after it emerged that he'd sent
sexually inappropriate instant messages
to a high-school-aged congressional page
authorities were able to obtain
transcripts of the instant messages that
the congressman sent to the
sixteen-year-old page see now that's why
I use trillion it has built-in
encryption that way when I send dirty I
am 16 year old boys no one can read oh
isn't that right Justin
I'm Molly wood and this has been a bus
port thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
