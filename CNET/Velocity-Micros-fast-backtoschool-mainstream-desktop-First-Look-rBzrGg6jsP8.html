today we're going to take a look at the
velocity micro vector campus edition so
this is a 999 mainstream desktop it has
a few boutique PC kind of performance
tweaks to it but overall this is sort of
designed for mainstream computing
particularly if you need a lot of fast
cpu power so if you know a velocity
micro at all this should look like a
pretty familiar case the companies use
this sort of squared off Luminum design
for a lot of years now it's pretty nice
pretty clean it's may be varying towards
boring at this point but overall the
certainly worst cases out there so it's
kind of hard to complain frontal system
is pretty straightforward there's a DVD
burner here this is a spare optical
drive sled up top down here you have the
SD card reader on the side there's a
viewing panel here it was a nice little
touch down here you have a couple usb2
ports as well as analog audio jacks and
firewire here's the graphics card you
get a couple DVI ports as well as a mini
HDMI Jack so you need an adapter if you
want to go to a full-size HDMI cable got
7.1 audio ports here as well as two USB
three jacks and a book those are great
features so one feature that we used to
sing with boutique pcs that you get in
the system is a nice clean interior
novel asking my car always does a good
job at this and you can see the airflow
is pretty much perfect here all the
cables are out of the way and make it
really easy to upgrade or just generally
maintain the system and the other
boutique touch to the system is you have
a core i5 3570k CPU here that's Intel's
third generation I've your bridge chip
and it's actually overclockable
velocities bump the cpu speed up to four
point three gigahertz it makes the
system one of the fastest we've seen it
is price range this graphics card looks
nice and big but it's only a geforce gtx
560 se card which is sort of a budget
skewed card it'll play most games at 19
by 10 you don't really have to worry
about sort of basic gaming capability
but if you want to get say higher detail
levels or played high resolutions it's
really not going to do it you also get 8
gigabytes of 1600 megahertz ddr3 RAM
here and you've got two slots to expand
if you want to and finally there's a one
terabyte hard drive also a couple other
slots if you want to add extra storage
now you might wish the system was maybe
a little more well-rounded say a blu-ray
player for example would make it a
little bit more capable
but if you want a system that has
straight ahead fast cpu performance safe
you're a math major science major
someone needs to crank through a whole
lot of data this is actually a pretty
good computer so our merch brown this is
the velocity micro vector campus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
