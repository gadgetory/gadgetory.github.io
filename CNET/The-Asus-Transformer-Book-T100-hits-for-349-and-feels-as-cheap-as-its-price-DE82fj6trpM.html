com asus intel event in San Francisco
and if you haven't already had it up to
here with tablets that are also laptops
that are also tablets there are also
laptops that are sometimes desktops in
the case of the trio then asus has
something you'll probably recognize this
is the Asus Transformer book t100 it's a
10 inch Windows 8.1 tablet with a 1366 x
768 resolution screen it also is one of
the first tablets to run Intel's new
optimized for tablets Bay Trail CPU as
you can see it's a convertible tablet
and comes with a pretty full size
keyboard with a touchpad the keyboard of
course can be separated from the tablet
so you can go on in full tablet mode the
connections on the tablet include a
micro-hdmi port and microUSB port
microsd headphone jack and of course
power and volume rocker on the keyboard
dock there's a full USB port and a porch
a touchpad what you say it's a thinnest
tablet I've ever touch and stepping out
fat I probably call it moderately pudgy
the tablet feels pretty comfortable in
my hands at corners are pretty
well-rounded they don't really dig into
my palms and the tablet isn't heavy
enough for that to really be a problem
there is a front-facing camera but no
bat camera there is this kind of
rubberized plastic backing that gives it
kind of a tough feel doesn't feel that
plastic you but doesn't definitely
doesn't feel like a really ultra
high-end device the keyboard is probably
a little bit wider than you would get on
the Android side it feels a little bit
wider but it still feels kind of cramped
not as wide as like maybe the surface RT
touch cover the Asus Transformer book
t100 is coming October 18th starting at
three hundred and forty nine dollars for
32 gigabytes of storage and 399 dollars
for 64
gigabytes of storage stay tuned to CNF
