smartphone I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update Motorola is finally
opening up about the rumored Moto X
smartphone it's the first phone produced
since google acquired the company we
have no photos but there is a teaser
page online that says the Moto X is the
first phone you can build yourself the
page the sign up for more information
also says today you should have the
freedom to design the things in your
life to be as unique as you are it's
also said to be the first smartphone
designed engineered and assembled in
America but there's another motorola
phone that got an unintended early tease
the droid ultra an incomplete page was
temporarily published live on motorola's
website about a smartphone called the
droid ultra and while it was up it said
the droid ultra would be thin and as
tough as steel it also said it would be
available in a bunch of glossy colors
with a DuPont Kevlar body since it's
called the droid ultra you can figure
it's going to be sold by verizon which
sells phones with the droid branding the
page that it was published to now just
redirects to the home page so we'll have
to wait to learn more get ready for a
new rush of Internet domain names New
York City is now the first place in the
u.s. to get its own top-level domain
with dot NYC businesses can apply to end
their website URLs with dot NYC of
course comp will always be king but it's
just another option now for business
owners who wants something more unique
than dot biz expect more unique URL
domains from brands to roll out later
this year Facebook stickers can now be
sent in private messages to other users
from the website Facebook first launched
these goofy sticker expressions in April
on Facebook smartphone apps but now
these elaborate character emoticons can
be sent from the website you'll find 16
free packs of characters just go to the
smiley face icon when writing a private
message click on the shopping cart for
more sticker options if you want to
listen to songs up for free now you have

streaming music service has become very
popular for its pre-built playlist that
suit any type of mood you're in maybe
you want a playlist

background jams for your weekend
barbecue songs and now streams half a
billion songs every month and to pay
those royalties Songza has a new twist
