Samsung will not be showing off a new
phone instead we may only see a new
tablet every February at Mobile World

top-of-the-line Galaxy phone but that's
not the plan this year you may be able
to guess why the Galaxy s8 is delayed

Catching Fire disaster its phones are
going through more rigorous testing to
prevent another note 7 debacle but back
to that mobile event Samsung sent out
invites to press for an event on
February 26 to reveal something and
because Samsung wouldn't want to show up
empty-handed rumor is it'll be the
Galaxy Tab s 3 that's according to the
sites and mobile citing a Korean source
the tablet is reported to have a 9.6
inch screen with a 12 megapixel camera
in the back get a 5 megapixel camera in
the front and it could go on sale in
March but tablets just aren't that
exciting anymore so that means
competitors like LG are gonna get more
attention for their phones during the
mobile conference and that said there
have been some leaked details about the
upcoming Galaxy S a phone like this
