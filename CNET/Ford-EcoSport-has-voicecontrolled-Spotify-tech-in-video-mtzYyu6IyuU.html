Mobile World Congress in Barcelona where
we're a bit more accustomed to seeing
mobile phones than vehicles but
nevertheless Ford has announced that
it's bringing its eco sport SUV to
Europe the Eco sport has Ford's EcoBoost
engine inside it that's a one-litre
three-cylinder engine it's already out
in South America so this isn't a
completely new car we're seeing but what
is new is some of the mobile voice
control tech that you get on the inside
so Ford has this service called app link
which lets you do voice control for apps
once you're sat inside the car and that
service is coming to Europe with Spotify
in tow now the way that works is you
plug your phone in by USB that's if
you're using an iPhone if you've got an
Android or Blackberry phone then it'll
work wirelessly there's no support for
Windows Phone though unfortunately once
you're hooked up you press this button
on the steering wheel which lets you
make voice commands so you basically
have to ask open mobile apps open
Spotify and then you can give orders
like shuffle my songs or you can choose
specific playlists if you want to hear
the available options you just say help
to the voice control system and it'll
reel off all of the things that you can
say as a safety measure once you're
actually connected the phone will get
this Ford branded lock screen and that
means that you can't use the app itself
so that you have to keep your eyes on
the road and don't get tempted to start
meddling with the interface yourself I
love the idea of being able to control
apps using your voice while you're
driving so you can keep your eyes on the
road here's hoping the more app
developers bring their software to
Ford's app link system soon please
choose their play was to play Maccabees
something you do need to be aware of of
course is that while you're driving you
probably won't have Wi-Fi and if you've
got 3G it's going to be a bit shaky so
you'll want to download all of the songs
to Spotify offline mode saving them on
the phone one slightly less frivolous
benefit of Ford's Sync technology is if
you have an accident it can
automatically send GPS coordinates to
emergency services so they can come out
and help you as soon as possible I have
to say I quite like the style of this
car and I even like the orange color
that it's got going on here it's going
to be coming out at the end of 2013 in
Europe
Western casino and this is the Ford
EcoSport</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
