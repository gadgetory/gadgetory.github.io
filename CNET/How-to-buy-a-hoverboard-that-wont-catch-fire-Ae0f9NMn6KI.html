being called a hoverboard a self
bouncing board or a Segway thingy
it's also one of the hottest gadgets
this holiday season but there's so many
of them out there with different prices
battery life speed and how do you know
if you're even getting a legit one we
can't show you every single one but
we're going to do our best to help make
some sense out of it all now let's start
with pricing and there's quite a range
out there can you tell which one is
$1,500 and which one costs 400 well the
$1,500 one is the funky duck the
monorover r2 D goes for 600 and the swag
weight is around $400 there's also a lot
of cheap ones under $200 on Amazon now I
can't tell you guys how much to spend
but the general rule is to stay away
from anything under $300 we know there
are hundreds of companies selling these
and the cheaper ones typically have a
weaker motor a lower top speed a lower
quality battery and the biggest thing a
warranty that lasts less than a year
Amazon and eBay have the biggest
selections but there are a lot of
knockoffs out there the advantage of
getting a legit model is the one-year
warranty and bind direct through the
manufacturers website we'll guarantee
you that
design-wise these all pretty much look
about the same once you start writing
them you'll feel subtle differences in
the smoothness of maneuvering them the
funky duck is the most expensive at
1,500 bucks but it can also handle the
most weight at 300 pounds while the unit
itself weighs only 18 pounds the battery
lasts for about six to seven hours
covering roughly ten miles of distance
with a max speed of 12 miles per hour
it's also probably the loudest of the
three now the swag way for around 400
bucks weighs in at a beefy 28 pounds and
has a weight limit of 220 but it will
get you around 12 to 13 hours based on
their 20-mile distance estimate with a
top speed of 10 miles per hour I
probably found this one to really be the
least smooth between these guys to ride
on and the monorover r2 dee if their
latest model that cost 600 bucks weighs
in at 22 pounds and can handle 250
pounds of weight it covers an 11 to 14
mile distance with a top speed of 9.5
miles per hour
this one really hits the sweet spot with
a little bit of everything I just spit
out these specs as a point of comparison
but they're all pretty much comparable
to each other and there really is no age
limit on these it comes down to having
enough coordination to ride these
properly and if you're learning or
you've decided you want to take this out
on the streets it's up to you to decide
if you want to be safe about it and wear
a helmet or wrist guards best advice
make sure supports your body weight if
you want a quality one make sure you go
directly to the manufacturers website
and avoid any of them that you'll find
for under $300 on eBay or Amazon
