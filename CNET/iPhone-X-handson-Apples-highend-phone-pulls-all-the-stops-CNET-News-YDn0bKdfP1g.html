doesn't come out until November 3rd
iPhone 10 is one of three new phones the
iPhone 10 is the fanciest one with a new
design that gets rid of the home button
it also has a brand new set of facial
recognition cameras in front called true
depth that replaced touch ID with
something called face ID so now you're
going to look at your phone and it's
going to scan your face and Apple says
this is more secure and easier to use
although you're gonna have to learn a
whole new gesture system
now you're going to swipe up to be able
to get to your apps or swipe down for
control center and to get Siri you press
the side button all of Apple's new
iPhones have a 11 Bionic processors
which apple says are not only faster but
are enhanced for augmented reality and
what that means is better tracking depth
sensing and graphics processing all
baked in but what the iPhone 10 also
adds is that front-facing camera and all
of its associated bells and whistles and
there are apps are going to take
advantage of this and emoji is going to
look at your facial muscle movements and
animate emoji like poop or unicorn
snapchat has some new filters that take
advantage of true depth too but the
question is are you going to want to pay
$9.99 for a phone that starts with 64
gigs of storage but goes up to 256 and
higher models the iPhone 8 is going to
be available September 22nd and the
iPhone tens extra features which include
that larger screen that front-facing
camera array and whether or not you want
to have face ID camera improvements on
the iPhone 10 include dual optical image
stabilization cameras on the rear and on
the front you're going to be able to add
portrait mode to your selfies finally
that's the iPhone 10 in a nutshell but
it's a phone that's coming out a lot
later than the iPhone 8 which is going
to be available next week we'll see
whether or not the difference is going
to be a difference for other people
whether people want to wait or whether
you just want to get the 8 when it's
available
