we've got something that I've been
waiting for its the lenovo ideapad yoga
11s now we've seen the yoga 13 that's a
13-inch laptop that kind of flips around
at the different positions and Lenovo
had an 11 inch version of it but with
Windows RT now they've got an 11 inch
smaller version of that yoga but with
full windows 8 making it a much more
useful machine and this is it right here
the ideapad yoga 11s the S means it has
windows 8 now like the yoga 13 which
you've probably seen a million times
already this looks like a fairly
conventional ultrabook and it's actually
one of the tablet hybrid convertible
style systems that really does not
compromise the traditional clam shell
laptop shape at all which is probably
why we like it you can take the screen
however and bend it back and then you
can continue to bend it back and you can
first stop off in this sort of stand
mode that we kind of call kiosk mode
it's great presenting stuff and then you
can continue to fold it back and then
you have what's essentially a slate
style tablet and what it does here is it
deactivates the keyboard and touchpad
once it folds over so you still have
them under your hand a little bit weird
but it functions essentially as a
touchscreen tablet and then when you're
done you could very easily just flip it
right back quickly certainly a lot
faster than you can with a lot of these
sort of pop off screen or twisty screen
versions of systems like this now the 11
inch Windows 8 version of the yoga is
going to be available in June and it's
going to start at seven ninety-nine i'm
dan ackerman at CES 2013 and that is the
lenovo i give head yoga 11s
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
