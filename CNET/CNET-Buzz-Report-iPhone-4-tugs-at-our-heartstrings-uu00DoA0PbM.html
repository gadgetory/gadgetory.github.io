buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
it's FaceTime election day and finding
out who pirated The Hurt Locker but
first it's the gadget of the week the
gadget of the week is the iphone 4 of
course everything gizmodo said was true
but we did learn a little more at Steve
Jobs WWDC keynote a new 5 megapixel
camera with a flash the front-facing
camera the ability to take high def
video and even edit it with the iMovie
app just on the phone there improved
battery life thinner more square design
crazy antenna bands they go all the way
around and will hopefully improve
reception super high res display and
then the big keynote one more thing was
video calling with an app called
FaceTime hey Johnny how you doing I'm
good okay thank you which yeah I mean
it's kind of neat it's only iphone 4
iphone 4 over Wi-Fi right now so not
like a world-changing revolution
actually the biggest problem for me
really is that even the normally
hot-looking Jonathan Ive look like a big
nose big chin stretched out weirdo and
it didn't do Steve Jobs any favors
either so I'm just saying no thank you
but don't worry Apple totally
anticipated that kind of cynical
thinking from narrow-minded journalist
types and that's why they prepared this
video to convince you of just how great
the video calling is when you smiling
well you smilin
smiles with you whoo huh well played
Apple well played and now for the news
it was election day in California this
weekend tech took over the state's
political scene former ebay CEO meg
whitman won the Republican nomination
for governor and I sincerely hope she'll
use buy it now as her campaign slogan
and ex HP CEO Carly Fiorina got the
Republican nod for US Senate slogan only
term limits can force me out this time
haha not surprisingly Facebook's former
privacy chief chris kelly did not get
the democratic nod for State Attorney
General his slogan right now damn you
Zuckerberg damn you now sure the iphone
4 was the phone everyone was talking
about this week but the HTC EVO had kind
of an exciting few days to it debuted on
Monday and is now apparently completely
sold out so if you were waiting to get
one until after seeing if the iphone 4
was unveiled at WWDC well it sucks to be
you now granted it turns out sprint did
totally exaggerated the number of Evo's
they sold in those first days analysts
now think it's around 150,000 and not
likely to go up since it's sold out but
hey still any competition is good
competition moving on the producers of
The Hurt Locker are looking to sue
anyone who illegally downloaded that
movie and this week they filed a legal
motion to get ISPs to identify potential
pirates based on a list of IP addresses
and then that list became public and
it's all bound to lead to some false
accusations and of course we know that
IP addresses are notoriously unreliable
as a way to pinpoint pirates because
people can spoof IP addresses they could
sniff your Wi-Fi they could sneak into
your house and download stuff when
you're not there it's just not a good
situation although I will admit there is
something weird about the fact that this
universally well reviewed movie only
grows like 40 million dollars while sex
in the city to which I think even Sarah
Jessica Parker
a bad review has made more than a
hundred million dollars I mean that kind
of makes me want to see somebody just
like anybody and finally let's have a
look at what's clogging the tubes this
week it's the world cup the
international football / soccer
tournament starts Friday and it is on
the internet live streaming of almost
every game at ESPN 3.com mobile phone
streaming Yahoo's got David Beckham
pimpin soccer all over its pages and IT
managers say company networks might be
disrupted because of all the people
expected to stream the game during work
hours and who can blame us I mean the
action the gameplay the excitement of
the global stage Vanity Fair helpfully
reminds us what's important here and
Annie Leibovitz has a good gig why don't
we make videos like that it's seen it
sexy beasts of the tech world ok I know
football and that's the bus report for
this week everyone I'm Hollywood and
thank you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
