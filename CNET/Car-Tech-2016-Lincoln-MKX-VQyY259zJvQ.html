basically the Ford Edge platform but
with a luxury spin and in a lot of ways
it is Ford putting its best foot forward
when it comes to comfort
let's hop behind the wheel of this
EcoBoost all-wheel drive example and see
well exactly how good it is
now the 2016 Lincoln MKX is available
with a choice of two engines if you want
more power you want the smaller of the
engine that's this 2.7 liter EcoBoost v6
engine it puts out 335 horsepower and
about 380 pound-feet of torque and you
use premium fuel it also gets about 19
miles per gallon combined in about one
extra mile per gallon in the city when
compared to the larger engine that's
about 17 miles per gallon there now that
engine is paired with a 6-speed
automatic transmission that has a sport
mode and paddle shifters in this really
weird very interesting push-button
shifting mechanism there's no shift
lever and no shift knob if you want to
change directions or change gears use
these buttons right here it's very cool
it keeps things really sort of sleek and
frees up a little bit of extra space
right here for elbow room now that is
going to be paired into this case with
linking from all-wheel-drive system
that's going to split power between all
the wheels on demand now around town 335
horsepower is of course nothing to sniff
at this car has pretty good pickup when
you put it into sport mode and also
we're riding on the Lincoln Drive
adaptive suspension that's gonna help
soak up some of those bumps now this
particular example is also equipped with
a Lincoln's Lane keep assist --nt system
which you can activate with this sort of
stop next to the steering wheel and
that's going to actively work with the
electronic power steering to keep the
vehicle between the lane markers when
you get above a certain speed we've also
got a forward collision warning system
that uses a fork facing camera and an
adaptive cruise control system that will
allow us to maintain a safe driving
distance between
the vehicle in front of us automatically
when cruising on the highway now that
adaptive cruise control system is not
full speed it'll shut down at about 15
miles per hour so you can't use it to
creep through traffic like you can with
some other luxury vehicles and rounding
out the equipped driver rate we've got a
360 camera system that gives sort of a
bird's-eye view of the car and Ford
Lincoln's automatic parallel and
perpendicular parking system it's really
cool and very easy to use
now that's most of what Lincoln's done
really well with the MK X but there's
still a couple of spots that they fall
short particularly right here in the
center of the dashboard we've got the
old generation of my Lincoln Touch which
is a very subtle rescan of my Ford touch
the problem that I have with the system
is that it's just very laggy everything
you do takes a couple of seconds to sort
of render on screen going from the map
screen to the radio or for the home
screen to the map takes about two to
three seconds for every button press to
register and then render on the screen
now we know that Ford has an improved
version of sync 3.0 coming in to some of
its vehicles so we think in a couple of
model years we will definitely see a
Lincoln branded version of that system
in the MK X but if I were to end on a
sweet note it would be with the sweet
notes of the rebel ultima audio system
we have in this vehicle now rebel is a
name that we recognize from home theater
system this is their first in-car system
that they're working on with Lincoln and
they've kind of put their best foot
forward here and they've given us a
really good really clear system now
they're not a lot of bells and whistles
here not a lot of 3d surround and
digital signal processing tricks that
you can access in the menus but the
basic settings on this system are very
clear very well staged and just very
powerful I really enjoy what we got
going on here
our 2016 lincoln MKX EcoBoost all-wheel
drive gets off the line at forty two
thousand five hundred ninety five bucks
at a nine hundred twenty five dollar
destination charge at almost every
option in the list to reach our fully
loaded as mr. price of sixty thousand
eight hundred and fifteen dollars this
is the best in luxury in tech that for
has to offer but we know ford got some
things better in the pipeline
particularly where dashboard taken
concern I'd recommend you wait a model
year to see where it goes
