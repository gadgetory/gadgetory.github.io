the late lamented second-generation
doe ball that was the SC that died a
merciful death in 2010 here is something
fresh the RC North American debut here
by the way
three and a half liter v6 doing 314
horsepower 0 to 60 and 6.1 rear wheeler
all-wheel drive blah blah blah nothing
too unusual there but this cars got some
really different lines they've really
started to put some curvaceous nough sin
to this vehicle much more than just
saying it's a 2-door Lexus IS it doesn't
look at all like that
to be honest it looks kind of like an
upscale Subaru BRZ but they don't want
to hear me say that powertrains as I
mentioned rear-wheel drive with an
8-speed automatic all-wheel drive with a
6-speed automatic in the cabin notice
lexus has completely redone their former
remote touch controller which was about
to drive me to drink so thank you
now it's basically a trackpad that will
give you pinch and zoom you can also
flick up down left right all kinds of
directional control and as you can see
some shortcut buttons right alongside it
once something hotter they just did a
global debut of the RC F this car from
about that eight pillars forward is a
very different machine those fenders
those have real heavily functional
intake ducts and on top of the hood yep
that's a very functional vent as well on
the back you've got a power activated
wing that is probably there for pretty
good reason because this has the most
powerful v8 they've put into a
production Lexus it only shares a block
with an is-is v8 and the heads and all
the other mechanicals are much faster
revving more powerful now by the way
back to this RC it has a variable valve
technology that's now electric that
means that they can do just about
anything with valve timing and phasing
which means when you're not pushing it
very hard it can run as an atkinson
cycle in other words lean-burn like a
Prius step on it and it turns into a
high compression machine hard to do
without extremely addressable valves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
