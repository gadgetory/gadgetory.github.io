done to tech toys this year hey look I
found ray I'm here at New York Toy Fair
and this year the Toy Fair is a little
special for me because I'm gonna be a
mom soon if you could already tell so we
get to see how playtime is going to
evolve for the next generation and every
year
playtime gets a little more high-tech
for starters this year kids can make
their own plastic action figures with 3d
printing machines and depending on the
age it's safe enough for children to use
these machines unsupervised this fall
Mattel is selling the thing maker for
three hundred dollars the 3d printer
creates objects from schools of melted
colored plastic you use an app to pick
from a preset selection of toys but you
can snap several pieces together to make
an action figure or jewelry the door
locks so you can't get hurt during the
printing process we used to make things
with play-doh or the Easy Bake Oven or
jelly creepy-crawler bugs now it's all
about melting your own plastic toys and
it's not all so expensive the 3doodler
Start is a $40 3d printing pen it's so
kids safe you can melt the plastic right
on your skin and it won't burn you it's
sort of like a hot glue gun and concept
you load the plastic and draw on the air
it only takes about ten seconds for the
plastic to cool you can make anything
toys art jewelry chips in May and back
to Mattel it also upgraded the virtual
reality view master to now include a
headset jack you still need to put a
phone inside to experience the programs
but on some games a sibling without a
headset could play along acting as your
guide to decipher puzzles the new
viewmaster 2.0 model cost $40 which is
$10 more than before it comes out in the
fall barbie always puts a new touch on
tech and this year she has her own drone
but she would rather have you call it a
hoverboard this remote controlled flying
quadcopter has barbie fixed on top and
comes out in the fall for $60 and she
can fly her drone to her brand new smart
home dream house the barbie hello dream
house has
speech recognition say hello dream house
followed by a command and you can turn
on the elevator turn on different lights
or throw a dance party the party doesn't
come cheap the dollhouse is $300 and
when I look back at the tech toys from
previous years it's clear that companies
are moving away from just slapping an
iPad or iPhone screen on a toy and
calling it a tech toy not everything
needs an app and whether you're talking
to Barbie's dream home or to playmates
talk to me Mikey Ninja Turtle which has
hundreds of replies to kid questions
these toys are not storing information
in some server and a cloud the tech this
year just gives it a slightly twist so
kids still need to use good old
make-believe in imagination reporting
from Toy Fair in New York City I'm
