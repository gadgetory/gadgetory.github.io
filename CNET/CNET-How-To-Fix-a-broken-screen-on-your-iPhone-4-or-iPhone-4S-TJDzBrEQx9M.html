or cracked like this ones is you can
either live with it buy a new one or as
I'm going to show you here fix it just
know that this isn't something you
should do if you have an Apple Care Plus
or other warranty that covers accidental
damage and I suggest you watch my video
on what to know before trying to fix a
smartphone or tablet it will help you
decide if you should repair the phone
yourself or just take it to a shop and
lastly know that by following these
instructions you do so at your own risk
before beginning you'll need to get the
necessary replacement parts and tools as
the iPhones front panel and LCD are
fused together I suggest buying both as
a single unit you'll find them online
between 70 and 120 dollars just be sure
that you buy the right one for your
phone as for tools you'll need a few
thin metal blades a plastic spudger or
case opening tool tweezers Philips
triple zero screwdriver a tiny flat-head
screwdriver and a special pentalobe
screwdriver which you'll use to remove
the phone's tamper resistant outer case
screws again you can pick these up
online if you don't have them lastly
I'll be replacing the panel on an AT&amp;amp;T
iPhone 4 but you can use these same
basic steps on iphone 4s from other
carriers and the iPhone 4s you may
however encounter differences such as
the location and type of vibration motor
and the position of the motherboard
screws the first step is to backup all
the iPhones data using either iCloud or
iTunes just in case something goes wrong
you'll also need to eject the SIM card
using the eject tool or a paper clip
with those tasks done you can open the
iPhone by removing the two screws
located along the bottom edge then slide
the back cover upwards and lift it off
unfortunately before we can install the
new display in front panel we'll need to
remove most of the iPhones internal
hardware we'll start with the battery
remove the battery connector screw and
disconnect it from the motherboard now
carefully remove the tiny pressure
contact
located underneath noting its location
and position for reassembly by gently
prying on and then pulling up on the
battery's plastic pull tab
it should come loose from the frame next
remove the metal shields that cover the
upper portion of the motherboard and the
docking connector cable as you remove
each screw note its location the screws
are different lengths and will need to
go back into their original position now
disconnect and remove the rear camera
and then detach all the cables along the
top and side of the motherboard you'll
need to gently pry the docking connector
cable away from the metal shield
underneath remove the hidden motherboard
screw located under the round white
sticker near the battery pull tab the
screw under the docking connector cable
at the bottom and the metal stand off
from the top near the headphone jack
then remove the motherboard lifting up
from the bottom lastly remove the
speaker enclosure and vibration motor at
last we can turn our attention to the
broken display assembly now it's held to
the metal frame with ten screws three
along each side and one in each corner
you'll need to remove them all keeping
track of the washers under the six side
screws now carefully insert a thin metal
or plastic tool between the metal frame
and front glass panel along either the
top or the bottom edge and gently pry
the panel loose now two warnings here do
not insert the tool too far or you may
damage the phone's other internal
components also if the glass panel is
cracked take care not to injure yourself
during the removal process now as you
pull the panel away from the phone
you'll need to thread its cables through
the metal frame we're now ready to
install the new display assembly so
first remove the plastic film from the
back of the display if it has one then
carefully thread the displays cables
back through the frame making sure not
to crimp them in the process gently
press the panel onto the frame and
secure it with the appropriate screws
and washers all that's left is to
reassemble the phone by working your way
back through the steps we just covered
start with the vibration motor
the speaker assembly the motherboard the
rear camera the motherboard shields
battery and back cover as you work
through the process be careful not to
damage any of the small metal contacts
on the cable connectors speaker assembly
or the battery connectors pressure
contact as fixes go this one isn't too
tough but it does take a lot of patience
and attention to detail now if you have
questions about this fix or mine
