younger drivers who feel they're missing
something having never known or had a
car with a manual transmission
I'm Brian Cooley with my top five cars
that do have one these are all
mainstream cars that come in below 25
grand yet have a stick and a clutch to
make driving more fun not just to lower
the price here's our list number five
the Camaro v6 and the Mustang v6 that's
where I'm giving you a twofer here and
sort of a well-kept secret these two
classic American pony cars both come
base with a six-speed manual a lot of
folks don't know that and they also
committed some really low prices as you
can see though they're big brothers with
v8s and automatics tend to get all the
headlines add in the fact that these are
rear-wheel drive cars and you've tapped
into a vein of unfussy classic American
fun by the way if you're asking where is
the Dodge Challenger it doesn't offer a
manual on the lower price base cars
number four a Fiat 500 Abarth now Fiat
recently added an automatic transmission
to the 500 a barth but don't fall for it
all 500 Abarth or otherwise really
reward you for getting a 5 manual
version because you really need to wring
every bit out of these cars and they
reward it Italian cars of all prices
have historically been built to rev and
shift often they practically invented
the shift gate that doubles as art after
all number three Mazda's Mazda 6 now
Mazda styles the six as the driver's car
among its more defined competitors and
frankly we don't argue a great-lookin
good handling car with a 6-speed manual
offered on two of its three trim levels
they're serious about this it's also a
family-sized 4-door the only one on my
list and as we'll see in a moment you
can actually find one it's not just
theoretical number two Ford's Focus ST
and Fiesta ST the Focus and it's more
affordable little cousin are an
automotive dynamic duo these days very
celebrated and their unusual in that
they only come with a 6-speed manual you
want an automatic you go somewhere else
you seldom find that to be the case in a
pair of cars
a big volume manufacturer before I get
you to my number one pick know that
manuals remain small potatoes for the US
car business because dealers know they
tend to sit on the lot a recent survey
of mainstream cars done by cars.com
found that manuals made up anywhere from
a half a percent to maybe seven percent
of cars in stock they're just not a lot
of what people want out there partly
because most people never learned to
drive a stick or they don't want the
hassle of babying wanting to commute or
they notice that in most cases fuel
economy is actually better with an
automatic my number one pick if you want
a car with a clutch has got to be the
Mazda mx-5 the Miata hands-down my
favorite because it gives cars with a
stick a good name the Miata has always
offered an automatic but to order one
that way is to miss the point
this car has a short shifter throw a
nice linear clutch feel it's close to
perfect wrapped up in one of the truly
celebrated roadsters of all time and
with rear-wheel drive handling to
complement that drivetrain this is a lot
of fun per gallon stay on top of
everything regarding high tech cars and
modern driving at CNET on cars.com
