smartphones here at Mobile World
Congress these xperia x and the xperia x
a as if xperia x i have here as you can
see it's got what i would say is quite a
classic sony design quite a minimalist
back and a edge to edge screen on the
front on this edge here you can see that
was a fingerprint sensor and around the
back is an impressive 23 megapixel
camera the screen size is 5 inches and
it has a full HD resolution it's of
course running the latest Android
marshmallow software and it's powered by
a Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 hexa core
processor that's six processing cores so
should be reasonably powerful enough for
social networking this 3 gigabytes of
RAM as well and Sony reckoned you can
get two days of battery life from its
battery although that is something that
we will be putting to the test at a
later day one thing we don't see on this
phone or on the ex a is waterproofing
something that we've been a big fan of
on Sony's Xperia phone before now so it
is a big disappointment to see that go
and here we've got the xperia x8 now
this phone is also 5 inches but it's got
as you can see a very very tiny bezel
around the edge with this curved glass
which makes it look extremely premium
under the hood it's not quite as high
performance as the ex it's gross 720p
resolution and it's got a slightly lower
powered quad-core processor the camera
on the back has been toned down as well
it's now only a 13 megapixel camera
rather than the 23 on the xperia x but
it should be good enough to get some
good snaps when you're out at the beach
or partying or just being cool there's
an 8 megapixel camera on the front for
those embarrassing selfies and was a
2,300 milliamp an hour battery which
sony records will give you two days of
battery life again the XA doesn't have
waterproofing something that we are
going to miss on Sony's range of bones
sony has been given a firm date on price
or availability yet but these phones
will be coming to europe
us in the coming months so make sure to
keep it cnet's for all the latest news</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
