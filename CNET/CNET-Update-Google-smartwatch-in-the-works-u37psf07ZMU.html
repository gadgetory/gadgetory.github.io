Jeff Bakalar and this is your cnet
update you didn't think Google was going
to sit the SmartWatch party out did you
2013 will probably go down in history as
the breakout year for smartwatches since
the Pebble watch made a splash at CES
we've gotten word that both Apple and
Samsung are busy working on wearable
tech that will talk to our mobile phones
should come as no surprise then to find
out that Google is now exploring the
market with a watch based off its
Android operating system there's no date
on when to expect these watches but for
now you can read reviews of ones that
have already hit the market head on over
to cnet.com for our thoughts on the
pebble and Martian smartwatches in an
interview with Reuters HBO executive
Richard plepler said his company is
contemplating offering HBO GO as a
standalone product available as a
monthly subscription to those who don't
pay for the premium cable channel
customers could pay around ten to
fifteen dollars for the service and
stream HBO content on most platforms
this of course would cut into the
company's current business model so HBO
says they'll have to quote work out the
math before they roll something like
this out cnet editors got their hands on
one of the biggest products to come out
of CES this year that's the razor edge
gaming tablet while there's no review
yet first impressions of the tablet show
that gamers will have to make some
graphical compromises in order to play
the latest games that said the edge is
mostly a complete package that's ready
to go out of the box stay tuned for the
full review Apple is slammed the ban
hammer down on a controversial game that
hit the App Store last year sweatshop HD
is a real-time strategy game that puts
you in control of a production line
where you're encouraged to ignore human
labor rights and hire underaged workers
to save money
according to Apple the themes in the
game are quote too uncomfortable to sell
and finally RBC Capital Markets is
reporting that Apple is planning on
releasing multiple phones this summer
including a watered down version of the
iphone 5 called the iphone 5s that will
feature a plastic case and no Retina
Display of course the phone would go for
cheaper and would help appeal to
customers who don't want to spend
hundreds of dollars on a smartphone
that's your tech news update for today
