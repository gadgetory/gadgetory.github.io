cup of cool PC prototypes or concept
pieces this year they've got one called
Project Valerie and it's a big bold
17-inch gaming laptop it's actually
fairly different from razor's current
laptop lineup which is all very slim and
very minimalistic that's because behind
the thick lid here the 17-inch display
has two additional 17-inch displays that
means you have a total of three displays
it's a multi-monitor setup inside a
single laptop now how do these other
monitors get out what razer says it said
automated deployment mechanism where you
either press a button or use a software
command and the extra monitors slide out
from either side and put themselves into
place on the prototype that we saw the
mechanism wasn't working they were all
sent up just in the three monitor
configuration but it'd be very
interesting to see once they have an
actual working system to see the
monitors come out by themselves and go
back by themselves inside is an NVIDIA
GeForce GTX 1080 which is pretty much
what you need to power three monitors at
once especially if you're doing games
the three displays have a Nvidia g-sync
which is also helpful if you want to get
better frame rates from a graphics card
especially again across three UHD 4k
monitors now of course this is the
concept piece so we may never see
something like this actually for sale
but it's definitely very cool to check
out and you can see that raises booth
here at CES 2017</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
