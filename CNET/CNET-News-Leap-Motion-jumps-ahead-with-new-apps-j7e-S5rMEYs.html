that we have in the store today what you
can see here is that you have that
instant ability to control something in
3d with really no learning curve so not
only can you control it what they've
done is given you the ability to
identify what's on here from a learning
standpoint and start pulling it apart
and then zoom in and examine it in 3d
and what's nice about working with 3d
digital objects is that you can you can
basically re attach them any which way
and you learn about it so from a
learning standpoint this is the type of
thing that gives you incredible detail
incredible control and then uses your
hand when it's appropriate or uses the
keyboard when it's appropriate so you
really get that augmented experience
what makes each of these apps grade is
they all pick what element of
interaction they want to take and they
use it to their advantage so in this
case it's something as simple as
controlling a puppet
so this one should be arriving pretty
soon it's in the final stages it will
get some tutorials and some instructions
and here's another one something more
for a game audience this is a really
great mainstream title air supremacy you
can see how interacting with something
like a flying game is just a lot more
immersive and interesting I will
accelerate making a fish fist once i get
the critical speed they start taking off
i'll see if i can do this there we go
and i have instant control and faster
once you get up to speed it's mainly
controlling speed what you're doing is
you're getting a don't crash you're
getting a you're getting a real the game
is really designed for that
maneuverability and staying with your
your command but here if you want a fire
in this case unit uses the keyboard and
shoot these guys going to shoot you guys
without crashing okay I pressure I got a
little bit close but again it's it's a
great example of using something as
simple as a hand control and the
learning curve was instant and this is
coming out really soon and it uses the
keyboard use the mouse one needs to and
I control it this way and it's a full
experience that's using the space in
front of your computer
that is satisfied
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
