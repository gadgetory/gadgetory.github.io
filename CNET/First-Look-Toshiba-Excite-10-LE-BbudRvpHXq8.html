here with the toshiba excite 10 l e this
is an Android tablet a 10 inch tablet
from toshiba is running Android 3.2
although there will be an android 4.0
update down the line but right now I
open this thing up get Android 3.2 and
you are getting the lightest thinnest 10
inch tablet money can buy now it is
going to cost you a little bit it's
about five hundred and thirty dollars
for a 16 gigabyte model or 599 for 32
gigs you also have the option for micro
SD memory expansion over here on the
side the side here also has a micro USB
connection and a headphone jack and an
hdmi output so those are all great to
have especially on a tablet this thin
now one of the bummers here is that on
the other side down here on the bottom
you've got your charging port which
comes with this big honkin charging
adapter that's not easy to carry around
with you and not easy to replace if you
lose it you can still charge off of the
USB port on the side here but charging
is going to be a lot slower another
disappointment is that it it doesn't
feel that great in the hand there's a
they're using a metal magnesium backing
here which is nice but on the edges here
the part where you're actually holding
it with your hands the plastic on the
side has this kind of a sharp edge that
catches your your hands it doesn't feel
that great it kind of feels like
something that a tablet that cost more
than the ipad probably should have
figured out other than that though it's
you know if you're really putting a
premium on thinness and lightness this
is the tablet to go with at the moment
anything that you're wanting to do with
android as far as apps are concern seems
to be running grey here the screen isn't
the brightest it's not the most
responsive we seen and there are tablets
coming out right now that are that do
have better processors and are going to
be able to beat this in terms of specs
but you can't beat the fact that it's
really light and really thin especially
at the time when the ipad has actually
gotten a little bit heavier and a little
bit thicker so that's it for the two
