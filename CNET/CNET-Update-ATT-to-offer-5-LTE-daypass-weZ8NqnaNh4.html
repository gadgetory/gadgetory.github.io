LTE I'm Jeff Bakalar filling in for
Bridget Carey this is your cnet update
ATT is banking that it's LTE is better
than hotel Wi-Fi which isn't saying much
because hotel internet is usually awful
but the company is introducing a five
dollar day pass that will give users 250
megabytes of data usage which isn't
really enough to have a lot of fun on
the internet like streaming HD movie for
example but it might be a better deal
than what you'd normally pay to get
online at an airport or a hotel so are
you ready for the next generation of
video games the PlayStation 4 and the
Xbox one are just around the corner but
Sony is now offering pre-orders on to
ps4 games through the playstation 3
store on the playstation network right
now future ps4 owners can grab knack and
warframe in preparation for november
15th when the ps4 goes on sale but let's
be honest what exactly is the point of
pre-ordering a downloadable game anyway
hulu is making its way to the nintendo
3ds family of systems which also
includes the two DS that the company
released this month users will need a
hulu subscription which will set you
back eight dollars a month or you can
try the service out for free with a
one-week trial swiftkey the
ultra-popular virtual keyboard
alternative for android has just
released a beta version 4.3 which brings
with it a major update to the software
layouts for living will give users more
flexibility and where they'd like to
position the keyboard and can assign
certain locations for specific
applications the keyboard can be moved
around resized split into two and much
more now does basic math still make your
head hurt well worry no longer as a tip
calculator has been built into Google
search functionality users can simply
type in what is the tip for X amount of
dollars and Google will then adjust for
the number of people in your party and
the percentage you'd like to leave now
unfortunately it can compensate for the
guy who didn't order any
drinks only had a side salad doesn't
want to pay as much as everyone else it
won't it won't do that don't forget
we'll have seen etters live on the
ground at Tuesday's apple ipad event so

breaking news that is your tech news
