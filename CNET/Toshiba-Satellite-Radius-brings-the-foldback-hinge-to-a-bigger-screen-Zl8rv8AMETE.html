just something a little bit different
with it I'm Dan Akron and we are taking
a look at the toshiba satellite radius
now this is a 15.6 inch laptop with a
full 1080p touchscreen and it has a
hinge that you may have seen some other
systems before it's kind of a 360 degree
fold back hinge that goes like this the
difference of course those others
examples that we've seen of this are all
sort of smaller systems so the first
time we're seeing this in a big 15-inch
laptop which makes sense because you'd
want to use a system like this in its
laptop mode most of the time and then
maybe you want some flexibility let's
say set it up in what I call kind of a
kiosk mode like this or you could flip
it around and use it as sort of a really
big table tent and of course you can
fold it down and then you've got you
know it's a big tablet it's not it's not
a tablet you throw in your bag and take
on a plane with you but at least you can
carry it around like in this form
interestingly there's actually a little
extra magnet right here in the back that
holds the screen a little tighter when
you have it folded over in that tablet
mode and of course they've got a little
rubber Ridge right here so if the
keyboard is facing down against your
table it's not going to rub up against
your table service typical core i5 of
course 7 configurations starts at a
little bit under $1000 and of course you
can trade up to a core i7 CPU I've been
