that's a mix between a home console and
a portable console it's called the
nintendo switch the company released a
promotional video showing how it will
work there's a little bit of old and new
here with two we shaped remotes that
detach from the main controller and snap
into a tablet so you can start a game
from the living room and take it with
you on the go but these are not Wii
remotes Nintendo calls them joy Khan
controllers the tablet also has a
kickstand to prop it up so you can play
with these stick controllers wirelessly
and if you do not like these skinny joy
cons Nintendo is also making a more
traditional looking controller call the
switch pro controller when you want to
play back at home just put the tablet
back into the docking station Nintendo
says it's possible for several intendo
switch systems to come together for face
to face competition it seems Nintendo is
selling the concept of having people
play together in person instead of
online mmm what a concept this is the
first look we're getting at the switch
system formerly only referred to as
codenamed Nintendo NX it's coming out
March of next year but no details have
been released yet on pricing or battery
life or games well there were some hints
in the preview video with glimpses at
titles including Skyrim mario kart NBA
2k 17 and splatoon and the video also
showed that it will take cartridge games
although this hybrid model is new to
Nintendo it is not a new concept to us
back in 2013 cnet reviewed the razor
edge it's a Windows 8 gaming tablet with
two controllers sticks as handles on the
side it also had a TV docking station
essentially turning high-end PC games
into portable games but it was costly at
around 1700 dollars for the tablet and
accessories I'm Bridget Carey stay up to
