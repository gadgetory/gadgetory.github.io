have a screen I'm Jessica's all-court
Christina at Mobile World Congress 2013
in Barcelona this is the spare one plus
this is an emergency phone kind of cool
has a lot of interesting features on
here basically meant for seniors kids
anybody working outdoors going on a hike
or anything like that and store it in
your car students glove box battery can
last you up to 15 years there's an
energizer ultimate lithium battery in
here that comes with the phone so the
idea is that if you ever need to make an
emergency call you press the big red
button in the center it calls 9-1-1 or
other emergency services but you can
also slip in a SIM card could be a SIM
card from your own phone and for phone
set and you really need to make a call
or it could be a prepaid SIM card that
you keep inside the phone just for
emergencies and you can dial numbers you
can also save up to nine contacts on
speed dials here's another kind of cool
thing you can actually program an
emergency contact so if you hit that big
red button there you'll receive a text
message or an email that says where you
are and the fact that you pressed your
distress signal another kind of cool
thing is that the phone will read out
the numbers that you press and also any
action if you lock the phone if you
unlock the phone there's a flashlight on
it the flashlight battery will last up
to 24 hours inside there's a tool so if
your phone is an iPhone and you want to
switch the sim part we can unlock the
iPhone pop the SIM card out and then
actually use an adapter inside the phone
to make it compatible and if you're
wondering it is a GSM phone I should
also mention that talktime lasts up to
10 hours so you can really use this
phone a lot coming soon is going to be
an app for iPhone and iOS that will help
you geo locate where the phone is so you
can check in on other people now the
spare oneplus isn't available in retail
shops yet but you can buy it online like
amazon.com across $100 I'm just a good
all court for seeing
this is the spare one plus and you can
check out all of the Mobile World
