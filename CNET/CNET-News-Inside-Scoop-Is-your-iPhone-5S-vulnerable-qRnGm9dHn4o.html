Sumi das joining me is senior writer for
cnet Seth Rosenblatt Seth thanks for
being with us I assuming okay so less
than 48 hours after the iphone 5s went
on sale on Friday it's already been
hacked or at least a feature of it a new
touch ID feature which is where you put
your thumb on the home button it scans
it accesses it gives you access to your
phone so yes somebody has hacked this
some Germans what happened yes so a
group before the phone was even released
to the public on Friday a couple of
security researchers announced that they
were going to run a contest to see if
they could if anybody could hack the
touch ID sensor which will work with any
of your fingerprints okay and they
started to start it off almost in a
joking way on Twitter and then it became
very serious when they decided that they
were going to put up a website and
actually start collecting the funds one
law firm offered to put the funds into
escrow and so things got serious pretty
quickly and then everything escalated
when one person offered ten thousand
dollars as part of the reward they've
since backed down but before the end of
it the reward topped eleven thousand
dollars in various currencies US dollars
euros bitcoins now the whole thrown in
there people were offering bottles of
expensive alcohol and cheap alcohol
right and there was a book of erotica
being thrown in there was also a patent
from the same law firm that was covering
the funds in escrow I patent application
so the person who came up with a
successful hack would get an opportunity
to patent it okay so erotica and bottles
of alcohol aside i mean the money gives
us this impression that people were
taking it seriously and i'm sure so how
did they do this yes so they wound up
transferring a fingerprint and it's not
clear from what they transferred it from
so it's not sure we're not sure yet if
it was from the iphone glass itself or
from a beer stein or something but
somehow they were they were able to
transfer the fingerprint to a piece of
latex okay and then put the latex over a
second persons fingertip and then rub it
against the home sensor the home button
sensor and and that unlocked the phone
and there's several videos demonstrating
this
we're still waiting for complete full
instructions on how they did it how they
did the fingerprint transfer but clearly
it does work is this surprising that it
happened so quickly you know the
researchers say that they were surprised
which is interesting they thought that
it was going to take longer than it did
to to hack the sensor and it didn't but
to take away from that they said is is
that you know there are always going to
be ways to hack a security protocol no
matter what what it is whether it's a
pincode fingerprint sensor other
biometrics but that there are also ways
that you can things that you can do to
take precautions to protect yourself
this is I mean something that they did
we don't know exactly how they got the
original fingerprint to the copy of it
so it seems like it's not that easy of a
hack it seems like you have to go
through some effort to get a picture of
somebody's fingerprinting might be
difficult it seems it can be again
unfortunate we don't know precisely how
the German hacker who pulled off the
hack I was able to do this but even from
his vague instructions other people were
able to replicate it and then
demonstrate that in videos on youtube so
any response from Apple not yet Apple's
not even responded alright will be
interesting to see what they say and
what should people do I have an iphone
5s should I be concerned because I
actually really am enjoying the touch ID
faster its feature it's so much faster
mhm absolutely there's a couple things
you could do one suggestion from the
researchers is that you use a finger
other than your index finger or your
thumb so if you use your pinky or your
ring finger to unlock the phone those
fingerprints are very hard to lift from
other surfaces there they're harder to
get complete fingerprints of so if you
if you wanted to continue using you
wanted to be a little bit safer that's
one thing you could do alright so good
information Seth thanks so much thank
you for inside scoop I'm Sumi das thanks
