used to mean investing in bulky
expensive equipment but a range of new
compact consumer drones let you send
great quality cameras into the sky
without emptying your bank balance but
how do these entry-level flying cameras
fare if you're heading out on a
professional shoot to find out I headed
to Castle Combe racetrack we've seen its
collection video crew and sent the new
pocket-sized DJI maverick into the air
before the shoot even began I was struck
with how small the drone is while DVRs
popular phantom for needs its own flight
case the Maverick thanks to its falling
arms is small enough to easily pop into
any backpack or even a big coat pocket
the controller too is tiny but folds out
to make easier to hold use your phone as
the displays have as no bulky screen to
pack away either I was able to take the
drone in the same backpack as my DSLR
and I didn't notice the extra weight at
all the small size does have some
drawbacks though while DGI reckons you
can get 27 minutes of flight time from
it in my experience it was much less I
put this down to the wind the Maverick
automatically adjusts for windy
conditions to make sure it doesn't get
blown out of the air but as it's so
small it has to fight much harder
against the breeze and of course the
heart of the motors have to work the
faster the power drains away for me this
meant a quick burst of flying followed
by an hour of sitting in the car while
it charged from the cars power outlet
then repeat and repeat and repeat
multiple spare batteries are a must if
you want to use this thing
professionally it's incredibly easy to
fly letting you focus on getting
creative shots not just stopping it
hurtling into a tree and those shots do
look good the three axis gimbal for the
camera keeps footage extremely smooth
with none of the jerky shaky bits that
would ruin your footage it exposes for
the scene well to keeping the bright sky
under control and 4k resolution makes
details nice and crisp so what's the
result well if you're really serious
about regular using aerial footage in
your professional work then you'll
still want to look toward bigger drones
like the DJI inspire that offers greater
flexibility in how you shoot however if
you're keen to take the first tentative
steps into the pro drone world the
Maverick is seriously worth considering
while the inspires bulky flight case
means you'll always need a car to haul
it around the Mavericks tiny size
doesn't require any special effort to
get it on location simply fold it up and
pop it in your kit bag next to your
lenses and sandwiches you can always
have it with you ready to go if you
decide that an aerial shot is needed
making it a superb just-in-case addition
to your gear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
