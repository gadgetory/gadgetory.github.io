moon it created some of the most iconic
and beloved gadgets of the last century
and it's made its fair share of costly
mistakes today we look back at the
history of Motorola the company that
built the mobile phone as we know it
today today Motorola is known for phones
but back in the day its ambitions were a
lot more broad and the company cooked up
loads of different types of tech
Motorola made TVs at a time when
television was only just becoming
popular
it made pagers for hospitals and it was
Motorola's radio technology that relate
Neil Armstrong's first words from the
moon landing that was 1969 but the good
times didn't stop rolling in 1973
Motorola debuted its DynaTAC system for
portable phones capable of beaming
voices over the air and then into the
regular telephone network and vice versa
all managed by a central Motorola
computer the company was keen to get its
mobile phone up and running but it
wasn't until a decade later that the
first commercial handheld mobile went on
sale it was the Motorola DynaTAC 8000x
an iconic product that established a
decades-long tradition of giving mobile
phones confusing names with lots of
numbers and letters
the 8000x way two and a half pounds was
roughly 11 inches high and cost nearly
$4,000 which is closer to 10,000 in
today's money oh and you've got 20
minutes of talk time before the battery
died
the DynaTAC 8000x was nicknamed the
brick for its unwieldy size and Motorola
used it to build a stronghold of mobile
dominance mobiles like the Micro tack
and then later the StarTAC which
popularized the flip phone and could
vibrate instead of ring insured motorola
remained the biggest phone maker in the
world
Finnish firm Nokia stall that crown in
1998 but Motorola stayed in the game
keeping competitive until in 2004 it
revealed its masterpiece the razor v3
hello more
the v3 was the thinnest phone around and
it practically used cool from its ultra
slim frame motorola sold 50 million in
under two years but enjoyed other big
launches - such as the rocket II won in
2005 a partnership with Apple that put
iTunes into a mobile phone trouble was
the rocker wasn't very good it was slow
you could only store a hundred songs and
it didn't look that nice Apple still
wanted to make an iPod that was also a
phone but after the rocker it decided to
take matters into its own hands the
iPhone was a seismic shift catching out
even high flyers like Nokia and
Blackberry but its arrival highlighted a
problem at Motorola namely that the firm
had been riding the success of the razor
too long facing intense competition
Motorola went years without a hit and
lost billions of dollars
despite eventually getting its act
together and producing some of the
coolest early Android phones and making
some neat advancements in battery
technology 2011 saw the company split in
two with the phone making parts soon
purchased by Google then sold again in
2014 this time to Chinese tech company
Lenovo Motorola's current standing is a
far cry from the company that beamed
down the moon landings but there are
reasons to be hopeful in the last few
years Motorola has built some of our
favourite smartphones as well as some
fantastic Mobile's at a low price it
also managed to make a fairly decent
SmartWatch using Google's Android wear
these are the generation defining
landmark products that made Motorola a
household name it is today but it's a
step in the right direction
what do you think Motorola should do
next let me know and stay tuned to seen
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
