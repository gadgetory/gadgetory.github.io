gallon that'd be pretty great if it get
200 miles per gallon that'd be insane oh
this car gets 261 miles per gallon this
is the Volkswagen xl1 and how did books
wagon do it partly through aerodynamics
partly through lightweight and partly
through a very advanced plug-in hybrid
powertrain this car has a two cylinder
turbo diesel engine which makes 47
horsepower it also has a 27 horsepower
electric motor attached to that and
there's a 5.5 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion
battery pack in this car okay we've got
a diesel plug-in hybrid powertrain and
that helps this car achieve really
excellent fuel economy it can actually
travel under electric power for about 30
miles and with those power figures the
Volkswagen xl1 obviously isn't a fast
car it actually takes 12 point seven
seconds to get to 62 miles an hour but
it does have a top speed of a hundred
miles an hour
now that's electronically limited but
you probably don't want to go any faster
in a car like this then as far as
aerodynamics go this body style actually
looks a lot like the Honda Insight
there's no real developmental
cooperation there it's all comes down to
aerodynamics the shape of the Volkswagen
xl1
and the original Honda Insight were both
dictated by a need for the best
aerodynamics possible this thing
achieves 0.198 coefficient of drag and
that's substantially less than the
Toyota Prius it's also incredibly
lightweight Volkswagen uses carbon fiber
reinforced panels all over the car and
for the chassis there's also aluminum
parts in here and a little bit of
high-strength steel but mostly it comes
down to very lightweight materials the
overall weight of this car is around
1,800 pounds now the engine and the
electric motor and the battery pack are
about 500 pounds of that the body is
another 500 pounds none of the running
gear and things add more weight to the
whole mix but it still achieves
incredible fuel economy with all that
instead of side view mirrors it uses
cameras mounted in the doors and the
driver can actually look at the side
view through the
panels in the doors the interior is
actually they fit two seats in here
although the passenger seat is staggered
back a little bit so the hip room can be
a little narrower and finally we have a
7-speed dual-clutch automated manual
transmission this will get really good
efficiency for that diesel hybrid
powertrain now this car is not actually
a constant Volkswagen is gonna burn you
sit it's been working on this concept of
a 1 liter car for a long time now that
means 1 litre 400 kilometers they've
achieved even better than that in this
production xl1 at 0.9 liters per 100
kilometers and that equals 261 miles per
gallon
