problem
those Firestone tires on a bunch of Ford
SUVs are coming apart in speed one
hundred people are already dead and a
massive recall almost 20 million tires
is mounted at a cost of some two billion
dollars it's the dawn of the big recall
era Toyota had its own headache a few
years ago around claims of unintended
acceleration that were attributed to
everything from peddle design to faulty
electronics to misplaced carpet mats it
did massive damage to the company's
reputation flash-forwards of today GM's
are calling 2.6 million cars with bad
ignition switches that can pop back to
the off position leaving the car a
coasting dead weight with the airbags
turned off I am deeply sorry we think
the situation is tragic
we're deeply sorry we apologize for what
has happened as GM CEO Mary Barra was
being grilled on Capitol Hill the
refrain was familiar
what did GM know and when did they know
it but more importantly when did they
let car owners know now recalls are a
business that car makers don't want to
be in in the US alone it amounts to some
12 billion dollars globally it's more
like 40 billion that's three to five
percent of automakers worldwide profits
now know that recalls are not uncommon
one quick glance at MIT says recall
update page and you'll see there like a
weekly occurrence and generally recalls
have been on the rise for years you're
not imagining things part of the reason
that recalls are also on the rise is
because cars are put to market sooner
design more quickly source from vendors
all over the globe who are kind of off
doing their own thing and full of
electronics where it's just harder to
spot and find every bug for every use
case more than 3/4 of all recalls are
issued by the manufacturer without the
feds having to apply pressure the big
headline grabbing recalls however
usually do involve it says little-known
office some defect investigation it goes
into action when a
complaints are filed by owners like you
and me since this authority was granted
in 1966 Nitsa has ordered recalls on
over 390 million vehicles 46 million
tires 66 million pieces of other car
equipment and 42 million child safety
seats a recent battle between Chrysler
and Mitsu over the fuel tanks and two
point 1 million jeeps suggests recalls
will get more common NHTSA says the gas
tanks for those vehicles are susceptible
to rupture in a rear-end crash and that
could result in a gasoline spill and
fire that case solidified the concept
the car makers aren't necessarily off
the hook just because they made a car
that was safe in the year of manufacture
they may have to bring it up to evolving
safety standards years later but for the
most part car makers are only required
to do a free repair under recall on cars
that are 10 years old or less you may
still get a recall notice outside that
window if they can still find you but
the cost of the repair is probably on
your nickel it still makes sense to tend
to it though so then future liability if
you sell that car isn't on your head if
you did repair a problem covered by a
recall out of your own pocket you may be
entitled to reimbursement the
eligibility is typically when you paid
for the repair a year before the car
maker told the feds about the problem
all the way to 10 days after the last
recall notices were mailed you can
search for your car's recall status at
mitzvahs safercar.gov site or download
an iOS or Android app that will keep you
up to date on the actions regarding your
car or let you report the problems
related to recalls RTS PS or technical
service bulletins tf's bees are sent by
the car maker to the dealer when they've
learned that something's not quite right
in a range of cars it could be through
complaints or their own engineering
research these are things that do not
however rise to the level of safety or
emissions compliance think about a bulky
transmission a quirky climate control or
failing paint
the feds don't get involved in TS B's
they leave it between you and your
dealer and the dealer may not bring it
up until and unless you bring in a car
with a related complaint that's why it's
important that you be a little proactive
on these you can find the data about
tsps on your car at sites like all
datacom now it may also help to focus
your attention on something in your car
that hasn't been working right but you
just sort of took for granted bring this
to the attention of the dealer before
your car's warranty is up because that's
typically when a free repair under a tsp
ends as well but always start with
documentation that the issue is
happening on your car don't just march
in there with the TSB and say fix it as
you can see in terms of both safety and
your bank account it pays to double
check your car's recalls and tsps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
