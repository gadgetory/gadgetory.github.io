first laptop ever built by Microsoft and
everybody finds everything it redefines
everything of what you expect in a
laptop start with the screen 13 and a
half inch diagonal straight across it
delivers six million pixels to your eye
six million there is nothing close to it
nothing 267 DPI and the depth of this
screen is remarkable the typing
experience on this product is perfect my
favorite thing is the dish and the keys
just slide your fingers in it feels
unreal the trackpad optimized by the
windows 10 engineering team to bring you
precision perfect tracking it is made of
glass when you put your finger on it it
glides it feels so lovely it's got the
latest generation of intel core
processors in it they are phenomenal
pounds per ounce pound for pound this is
the fastest 13-inch laptop ever made
anywhere on any planet we give you a
full 12 hours of battery life to use
this product for 12 hours i'ma tell you
what 12 hours means to me use it for a
week I don't have to charge it we
compared surface pro 2 the macbook air I
think that was fair working in a compare
surface book and how it compares to a
macbook pro by adding the discrete GPU
to extra processors it fundamentally
make surface book two times faster than
the macbook pro two times faster
it just gives you a sense of the
performance of the product but to give
you a better sense let me walk over here
remember that surface dock we talked
about earlier right here it works with
your surface book so works for pro 3 pro
4 and the surface book and we enable
that with one cord plugging in nothing
else and that's the surface connector
see if I'm up there I am great so I'm
just going to plug in this USB port and
you're going to see the PCIe SSD
performance in the product which is
basically two times faster than status
if you're paying attention and you
understand that kind of details in it
this is just a super fast drive I'm
going to grab what we have here is 3
gigabytes of gameplay and I'm just going
to pull it on to my screen and copy it
to my desktop you guys see how fast it
copies I just want you to see that
transfer so this is three gigs
transferring full speed and just coming
through and just like that it's on my
desktop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
