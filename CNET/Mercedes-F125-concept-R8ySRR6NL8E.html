this is one of the bells of the ball
here at Frankfort 2011 the mirsini is f1
25 concept by the way the end of the
name has an exclamation mark on it and
for pretty good reason there's an awful
lot of tech going on here first of all
the power train is an electric motor out
at each wheel one on each corner that's
not too exotic totals have 313
horsepower but the torque of course
would be right now but it's a hydrogen
fuel cell car so you can go a thousand
kilometers looked at 600 and something
miles on a belly of hydrogen except it
wouldn't be a belly of hydrogen it would
be a body of hydrogen you see they're
going to store the hydrogen compressed
in cavities around the body and I think
I've heard of that before in any of the
various hydrogen concepts that are out
there now let's talk about some of the
technology that's more consumer
electronics you see these doors as they
go up and down those are gesture control
so you walk up to the door and just go
huh the door goes up and then the door
goes down you've also got gesture
control on that nice big display for the
passenger if they want to go to the next
track on a DVD or a CD they just do this
kind of thing menu all this sort of
thing is very much like Kinect for
example the display to the right of the
driver in the central tunnel it's a
curved display totally unfocused done by
some interesting new rear projection
with a sort of an arc algorithm to make
sure that it all stays in focus from one
projector beam that's amazing and then
look at that display important the
driver that's actually 3d you can't see
that in our 2d stream of course now
what's behind all those systems one of
the most interesting things to me is a
hundred percent Internet streamed
infotainment so anything from the media
to the weather to the news all these
sources coming in they're thinking 100%
streaming at this point let me show you
an interesting way to configure it so
what Mercedes says is as cars get so
complex and so rich with their
infotainment and settings and
configurability you need a way to do all
that when you're not just sitting in the
car that's one place but other times
you've got more time to sit down and
think how do I want to set my car up not
sitting here in the driveway like some
dork so
give you this very rich app that they've
envisioned for the F 125 let's just go
to one part of this the entertainment
block here I have a whole variety of
sources information and entertainment
news weather music the music for example
I can take and drag down to this
timeline which roughly maps to my route
in navigation so these things are going
to happen in order of the trip what's in
the music this is all Napster powered
right now they can have any number of
partners though and this is again part
of that all streaming entertainment
system here are playlists if I go over
here here are Napster channels and again
you can imagine anybody being in here
this could be also Pandora it could be
Spotify anyone the his software is
software this stuff gets really
interesting as you start to go to that
level I can bring a weather report down
here whatever I want along my route or
directly access it in here and of course
there are many other settings and
configurability options in here to set
up a car that now has arguably maybe a
thousand different configurations no two
cars would be the same it's as they say
it's like a smartphone you can sit in
and no two smartphones are the same so
you start to see how we connect the dots
here and need a different interface oh
one more thing I want to show you if
it's the smartphone you can sit in I do
want to sit in it check out the rear
seat lounge that's like a corner group
I'm gonna see anything that cool since
like a 68 Eldorado I'm in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
