Computex 2015 in Taipei Taiwan and we
are at the asus stand currently looking
at their new Xen watch - this is the
watch the main part of the update really
seems to be a lot of new styling that
they've added to this device so
basically new faces a lot of new band
options really nice set of swappable
bands we've got the metallic link
bracelet option here and there's also
leather straps in the mix as well
they've also made two sizes a little bit
like Apple in that sense of having both
45 mil and a 49 millimeter option and
one of them key features we picked up on
yesterday when they first made the
announcement was this thing that looks a
lot like the digital crown that you
might see on the Apple watch it turns
out now that we're actually hands on
today it isn't a dial of any kind it is
just a good useful button that's on the
side but it's essentially an on/off or
back type option that will be able to
move in and out of apps but look overall
this is expected to launch in the third
quarter of the year there's no pricing
announced as yet but it's only six
months since the first Zen watch was
announced by Asus so it's interesting to
see a very fast update here to this new
more stylish design so that's awesome
Computex and you can see a lot more
about Computex up on CNET com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
