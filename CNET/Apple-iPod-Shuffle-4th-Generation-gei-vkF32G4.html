a first look at the fourth-generation
Apple iPod shuffle
this is Apple's smallest most basic iPod
offered with two gigabytes of storage
and priced at $49 it comes in five
colors and includes a pair of basic
earbuds and a USB headphone jack adapter
for syncing and charging with your
computer this is a return to form for
the shuffle made a detour last year with
this buttonless design but now it looks
very similar to the popular
second-generation model aside from the
obvious play pause skip and volume
controls on the front all the other
controls are located on the top of the
player
there's the power switch that also works
to set the mode between shuffled and
sequential song playback there's a
headphone jack which is also used for
charging and syncing music there's a
teeny-tiny battery indicator light and
finally there's a new button which
triggered as a voiceover feature now
voiceover is a very cool feature and
it's a carryover from last year shuffle
it gives you the ability to figure out
what song is currently playing and more
importantly it allows you to navigate
between playlists genius mixes podcasts
and audiobooks you just press the button
wants to hear the artisan song info'
neighborhood number 1 tunnels the Arcade
Fire or hold it down to access the menu
and use the buttons on the front to
navigate through the playlist all songs
all pop mix electronica mix hip hop rap
mix this feature is a big advantage over
the first and second generation shuffles
which were basically only good for
playing a random selection of songs you
can now have separate mixes for your
workouts or your morning commute or use
this to play audiobooks without worrying
that all the chapters are going to get
mixed up the voiceover feature is also
improved from the third-generation model
since the button is now right on the
player instead of the special headphone
cable so you can use any pair of
headphones you want finally let's talk
about the clip the clip on the back
feels sturdy
and is made out of the same anodized
aluminum as the rest of the player one
complaint we have is that the smaller
square design no longer leaves room on
the front for where the clip gets pin
as a result when you clip this on you're
probably going to wind up squeezing the
back button by accident
overall it's a surprisingly decent
little audio player with better sound
quality than the second-generation model
it resembles battery life is rated at
fifteen hours which for something the
size of a coke button is pretty amazing
so that's it that's the
fourth-generation Apple iPod shuffle an
incredibly tiny affordable audio player
perfect for anyone who goes to the gym
or electric travel light for cnet.com
