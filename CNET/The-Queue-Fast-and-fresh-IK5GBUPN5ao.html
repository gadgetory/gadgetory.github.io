high-speed hand dryer checked out
facebook pages and a washable mouse
ready set Q glad you can join us on rich
tomorrow with CNN TV and this is the Q
lots to tell you about today so let's
get right to our must click moment the
gadget you won't be buying but hope to
find everywhere Dyson launched the air
blade hand dryer in the United States
and it works I got to try it out the
company also releasing a survey with
lots of dirty details like the fact that
ninety percent of us avoid making any
skin contact in a public restroom my
only issue sure the dryer works great
but with no paper towel what do you use
to open the door t-mobile launching a
new plan that lets you use Wi-Fi to make
your cell phone calls in your house the
hot spot at home plan is an extra 10
bucks a month you need a phone that has
built in Wi-Fi and when you're in range
of your home Wi-Fi network your calls
are routed through the internet the
company also holding a contest the first
100 people to show up to selected
t-mobile stores on July third get a free
phone router and a year of service and
if all that sounds really complicated
that's because it is continuing through
the queue while the debate is still out
over whether you can safely put your
keyboard in the dishwasher for the tech
aholic it's the washable Mouse make no
mistake this bad boy from belkin will
take a wash in and keep on clicking the
washable mouse can survive spills and
you can can wash it under the faucet to
keep it clean but no cleaning your mouse
won't do anything to rid you of the
guilt associated with some of those
websites you use that mouse to visit
sprint taking off the gloves and getting
downright nasty about the iphone or as
they're dubbing it the why phone they've
published a list of 10 reasons why
customers won't be interested including
its price inferior network no wireless
downloads learning a new keyboard no gps
expensive PDA no corporate email and no
color choice bottom line they say sprint
offers more value variety and speed
jealousy is really ugly around seeing
that now a year ago when i started here
applause thank you I had visions of a
widget that would let you show off the
tech you want and the tech you got on a
blogger profile pages well I don't think
anyone heard me but I'm happy to report
it's here the cnet my tech is a facebook
platform app that's super simple to use
and lets you share your love of gadgets
with everyone in your network just
search for a product then click on an
icon letting people know if you want it
got it love it or hate it we're talking
about the gadgets here not your friends
you can even comment on your choices
combine that good taste with our editors
expert opinions and ratings and you're
helping friends and family make
excellent text choices they don't pay me
to say this stuff well I guess
technically they do but it's awesome I
promise check it out and I'm rich
tomorrow with CNN TV in New York City
see you in line at the apple store
