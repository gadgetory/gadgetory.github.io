the overwhelming response to the
character of Captain phasma
but I really felt that what Kathleen and
JJ and everyone who created at Star Wars
was I think JJ's were open about the
fact that he wanted to respect the
origins of the films and celebrate them
but to to bring them into the modern day
and confirmation of that seemed to be to
me in this amazing character of Captain
phasma who is Star Wars first on-screen
female villain and more than that this
is a character who so far we have
related to do to her choices
due to her character and not due to the
way she has been made in flesh and
conventionally that is how we have
related to female characters so this to
me felt very progressive and the the
response from the audience and the fans
has been so celebratory it makes me me
think that this is what the kind of
thing people want to see people want to
see a more diverse reflection of society
and I feel incredibly privileged to play
that part if anyone else wants to offer
me any work then I am very grateful and
willing to listen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
