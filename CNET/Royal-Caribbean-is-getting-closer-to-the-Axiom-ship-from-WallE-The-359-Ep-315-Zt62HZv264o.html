episode 3 15 of the 359 podcast my name
is BBG and your host today include Ben
Fox Ruben and maybe Roger Chow maybe
we're not all here
it's Monday wiki saying I had a long
weekend at a waterpark it just doesn't
sound it's not as fun as you think
pretty much all the time yeah alright
but we're speaking of water sports we'll
be talking about cruise ship the future
of cruising I actually got a chance to
check out Royal Caribbean's a text
showcase last week so we're gonna run
down what it looks like to be on the
cruise ship of the future to be
discussing VR roller coasters on
Malaysia there is a VR a weird show Lego
I know that this roller coaster that
basically matches up singles day
shopping holiday right it's arguably the
biggest shopping day of the year
globally completely and like puts black
fire to shame right completely
overshadowing Black Friday's China does
not have a lock so they're do right now
get to it
do you have any questions leave in the
comments section I will try to answer
them and here we go for the recording of
the podcast feedback in the chat and
three minutes and 59 seconds from 3 to
welcome to the 359 dr. chan I'm Ben Fox
ribbon are you fed up cruise ships I got
a chance to check out Royal Caribbean's
showcase for its upcoming technology and
most of it is designed to let you be
lazier than ever there's this concept
stateroom with LEDs everywhere that sort
of simulated the time of day you can so
you can stay there all you wanted if you
play our games there there's a new
facial recognition system to speed
through your check-in process but the
best feature I saw was the ability to
order a drink no matter where you were
on your app on an applet or phone and
have a service show up with the pool if
your stateroom wherever you are it knows
this is amazing right this is the
technology we've been waiting this is
real practical tech Radin get jet packs
but we got this how does it work and
when you were actually at this demo they
did it and it worked at the demo right
yeah yeah yeah so they were actually
doing sort of a dry run er beta test in
this warehouse in Brooklyn that they
took over and kind of converted as a
pseudo demo tech cruise ship experience
uh yeah there's on the phone it used a
combination of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
beacons I figured out the server's will
all have their own phones on the tray
best would pop up with your face you had
to send them self ahead of time with
your face and then a little bit of like
a little map underneath they gave those
servers a bit of approximately like a
than 9 feet radius of where you might be
and then they'd figured out the last
couple feet ok they'd show up to drink
it wasn't a hundred percent like my
cameraman mark was here uh who is a
beard you were to drink and we stock boy
I saw the server like go and like that's
other beard guy like hey are you are you
mark and you know obviously you could
get right the first time but it worked
pretty well there apparently even if you
order the drink and you move around the
waiter will still be able to track you
because it's which is pretty cool which
means more like you could order a drink
on the go and then it will show up yep
when you get to the craps tables the
other cool experience was the virtual
dining which isn't their new and
brocro bid had a cool little spin on it
was more like it wasn't like a
full-course meal or anything like that
it was sort of three little appetizers
that she ate it was time to experience
so it was kind of telling the story you
were in this like Japanese teahouse the
teahouse sort of exploded and opened up
into a Japanese garden each bite you
took kind of triggered a new event these
kind of change but it was kind of cool I
would do that like once but it's I think
as you mentioned in the story it's a
little isolating yeah it's kind of like
going out to a restaurant by yourself
it's totally gimmicky let's begin a VR
our own Zoey Chung get to check out this
roller coaster out of Malaysia that
through it mashes up surf those
old-school thrills and actual roller
coaster but you're wearing a VR headset
and I add the whole lego experience it's
like a racing game in VR while you're
doing a roller coaster yeah exactly
this is like the easiest way to vomit
why would you do that to yourself
look it's not the first one there was
out there was a VR road closed around
London from last year so this stuff is
actually happening I I'm kind of
skeptical about it for God's sakes it's
a roller coaster
enjoy your roller coaster why do you
have to put a VR headset on top of it
but hey if people want to try it out why
not and last we want to talk about a
single stay this is Ali Baba's made-up
holiday they obviously broke their
records because big break records every
single year calculating twenty five
billion dollars in sales generated from
1.5 billion shoppers in one day Wow way
to go singles thing well what singles
day is a made-up holiday that Alibaba
created I think back in 2009 and it's
similar to prime day that you get in the
US and a couple of other countries idea
that if you're single you should see
yourself yeah and if they're hoping to
bring it I think to more countries in
the future but it's right before the
like the big holiday shopping season so
I don't know that people would really go
for it in the US but we'll see we've
already got Black Friday and prime Day
and Cyber Monday and I don't know
giving Tuesday there's there's a lot of
ways for you to spend your money there
you go for those stories and more
chickens on CNET I'm Robert Chang I'm
Ben Fox ribbon thanks for sitting
treat yourself couldn't I help myself I
was actually just binge binge rewatching
part indirectly time last night which is
a worthy thing to do yeah oh yeah so
we'll have plenty of chat and comments
to get to let's start right off the bat
Matthew batch or the - in the chat - why
would I want to vacation on a ship that
holds as many people as the towel when I
grew up in I prefer the ship's about 300
passengers or less I got it I kind of
agree with that because I too came from
very small town right and I hate people
you know if you hate people cruise ships
or not they're not for you I mean we I
just did it I was not a big fan of
cruise ships but now that I've got a kid
and parents who were willing to watch my
kid on this cruise ship it was I had an
amazing time it's a little more
encapsulated exactly it's like it's all
kind of favor but your place to place
the idea is that you know you can go
from town to town and you don't have to
unpack and pack constantly you know
you've got one place that kind of moves
you around for and to me it makes sense
for those types of contained experiences
yeah to just cram as much tech into them
as possible and there are always new
cruise ships coming on line so why not
just add more tech into them it's the
same thing that they're doing with cars
you know like Tesla is getting so much
attention by just putting tablets all
over cruise ships
they there's not bid the most
cutting-edge it's not the most
cutting-edge industry at all about it
will give Royal Caribbean's some credit
I mean the newer ships they rolled out
do have more technical like this robotic
bartender
they've got fast Wi-Fi still expensive
but most cruise ships have terrible
Wi-Fi that's really expensive so and
it's this kind of pervasive Wi-Fi
network they spit up on these boats to
allow for things like being able to eat
your drink wherever you are that's so
it's to their credit date they've got a
critical you need your drink wherever
you whatever and wherever you are
there's one other element that I'm
looking at from your story that we
didn't get to which was self-driving
shuttles yes
so I went to cram every detail but they
it's hilarious because there they were
testing out these and these are so a
trial they're not rolling there's not
officially yet it's Navy oh is the the
company that is basically supplying
these self-driving shuttles but they're
hoping to get into port they'll take you
from a ports like the main city usually
around it's not lazy they don't own a
pot on the ship but like you previously
would have to walk from the ship to
whatever main town horrible I know right
but then these shuttles they'd they
estimate they could get like six
shuttles going round round trips and
that pretty much could service the
entire and it's funny things that happen
despite that happened was they just Las
Vegas had just rolled out these shuttles
in the city that day and one of them got
into an accident yeah yeah and it was
because of the shuttle itself an error
it was ultimately human error like it
was another truck that kind of backed
into it you know problem was the shuttle
didn't know to backup it just stopped
didn't know what to do and then it got
big it was a very minor accident turned
the headlights the hydrogen yeah
obviously there still needs to be a lot
of research and work done all these
things I believe the University of
Michigan also has these shuttles for use
for their students I want to see the
wall-e pods on the sheriff airships
we're getting there that's what I'm
saying it the axiom yeah cruise the
Starliner actually just cut up that
egg-shaped vehicle into smaller pieces
and then we'll be able to ride around
just like we did in wall-e I'd say that
was cut blown away by the stateroom as
well because they covered the entire
ceiling with an LED yeah this a kind of
stream an LED stream on the floor and it
all kind of integrated to work like it
could be morning could be something
could be like a rain forest with rain
falling like basically if you never
wanted to leave your stateroom like
that's like the because that's exactly
why people go on a cruise right you
block to me people go on cruise to
basically be stationary so I think it
makes sense from from what they're drink
from a revenue perspective I think some
of those rooms don't
any windows yes that was very helpful I
think that was probably one of the best
practical benefits if you have no
windows this simulates the idea that
being outside that it's like not so
claustrophobia and you're saying
fair enough we've got a collective
mindset going on here in the chat that I
love it the one in yellow just says
super lazy awesome tech that's kind of
the summation of it that's been Slater
also says it is freaking awesome and
like from a technological standpoint it
is awesome but I want to go back to the
one of my god they actually like it's a
cool gimmick to expand on that the one
in yellow brings up if you're gonna go
on holiday why would you be using VR for
example it's not like the bus drivers
holiday wants to go driving all over the
place like why would you want to live on
a virtual situation that just mimics
your real situation or the example that
is why are you leading at all I think
the example that I came out was you know
they were offering you an experience
that you couldn't get on the ship was
frankly you probably couldn't get
anywhere else you went to Japan right
this idea of like being this tranquil
Japanese teahouse the screen doors
actually kind of shatter and all the
paper folds this isn't gonna work for a
full meal this isn't gonna be sitting
there for an hour this is like this the
demo that we had was maybe 5 minutes
long 7 is long and I kind of see it like
that it's more of an attraction it's
they suggested that like this could be a
cool like candy type sampler like it
wouldn't be for a full meal again you
just have like little little dessert
bites or whatever and I give them credit
over the last piece the last bit of food
that I had was this chocolate truffle
with pop rocks and so I had it almost
look kind of like you know popped around
my mouth to kind of tingle run my mouth
and like spray and VR my caterpillars
curl out your mouth yeah pretty much
like it was kind of cool and I also said
I have to say this is the first time I
tried they used HD
see five headsets paired with leap
motion is the first time I've tried it
it's actually pretty amazing like
regularly there were no cables or
anything they recognized my hands and my
fingers and I was actually those very
responsive very little lag that was a
was 69 69 does point out it would be
good for people with disabilities and
that's yes an excellent point as always
yeah yeah for those who can get to the
ship but night might not be able to get
around the ship as easily give them
experiences so that they can at least
have the fresh ocean air and yeah expand
on that
technology helps both people with
disabilities and the incredibly lazy
that's super important right my thought
though is I it's it's it's is this sad
it's kind of sad in my eyes think about
it oh let me go on this first of all
it's only a ticking time bomb until the
ship gets an autonomous driver like in
Walia
it goes on rampage who Danny Green
points out this is basically west water
on the open sea that's actually kind of
unfortunate slip but think about if you
go out I'm gonna use like whale watching
is an example where you go out in the
boat and the weather sucks and like
you're gonna go see whales I pay a lot
of money they'll see whales and the
whales never showed up cuz they got
better stuff to do right and then you
put on VR goggles like okay here's some
sake they are whales is that sad that's
kinda sad to me when if you're not gonna
have the experiences faking it really a
good substitute I would argue yes if you
were trying to replicate something that
you're trying to get on the ship but in
this particular case like that was that
VR experience was not something you were
gonna get on the ship unless you're on
or something but if you were really kind
of a cruise at the Bahamas and you're
doing some sort of like Japanese
teahouse theme for your experience
that's kind of cool because it's
different it's it's looking a little
gimmicky I think if I compare to folks
who visit the ice bar and a cruise ship
or Vegas right that's like a weird thing
you know yeah yeah but they so
experience in itself yes it's literally
a bar there's one in the Hilton
in New York yes yeah there is there's
one in Vegas I bet that will be their
idea is that this is it's a unique
experience it's it's not something you
would do every day but it's kind of
something cool you would try on a
vacation Chris gamer brings up that he's
nervous about ever being on a ship
that's self driven you know self-driving
ship doing an emergency now let's think
about this for a second Ophir ships have
been virtually self driven for a long
time yeah I mean you're not fully
autonomous but I mean pun intended there
on cruise control they are and you know
what they're they're operating on
sensors that can detect things that that
humans can write we couldn't have so
much work out exactly right like water
like object detection like yeah it's
like the computers can actually handle
things a lot better yeah so I don't know
if I love this idea of course I'm not
really big on cruises to begin with I
don't know about anybody I'm not I like
I kind of like have converted but mostly
because it's easy it is easier yeah when
I was like what definitely when I was
single and attached we're married it
makes sense to me that you're spending a
lot of money you're gonna spend a lot of
time on this ship
you're gonna cram it with as much
technology as possible the VR
rollercoaster concept though I'm not on
board with like I would definitely try
it once just to see what but it's one of
those things where I think what are the
commenters mentioned like you're already
on a roller coaster live that experience
be in the moment instead of flying it
that's the thing though in those 4d
rides like the Back to the Future right
Universal I used to love those things
yeah of course that without years ago
fine they were new man they're getting a
little stale now how do you expand on
that well maybe this is the case we
actually get extra sensation the actual
feeling of weightlessness relative
weightlessness you get on a roller
coaster that kind of thing where they
can't replicate that in a 40 theater
that's just a little box hopping around
both situations the one in London
or the UK and the one Zoey tried
Malaysia these are old roller coasters
that basically rather than like go to
the expense of building a roller coaster
or nine folds on the custom exactly it's
a way cheaper way to it's a cheaper way
to offer a new experience or fresh
probably doesn't have well that's pretty
entrepreneurial right there's a good job
back to a would they say I'm sure places
would charge for a remote ride via VR
for people who can't travel or travel
that far visit a theme park you know
it's in another country yeah late that
sensation though and how far can we take
sensation simulation before it becomes
old hat chairs that moved around right
at the screen right
imagine Julian via I think it's the same
principle I don't think it's that
difficult to create some sort of room or
pairs I think in Japan there was one of
those Campari Oh card experience pair to
a seat that moved in conjunction with
the way you mm-hmm that would be awesome
right that's been the promise in VR for
a long time I don't think that we're
quite there yet most of the time when
you're talking about like VR experiences
it's mostly in the video game world yeah
it's really interesting how we've come
so far in filmmaking and they can do so
much to create middle-earth up on the
big screen and yet pretty much buy it
wholesale and now we're doing that to
our lives but it's much harder to do in
a VR experience and the computational
power behind creating middle-earth as
something completely immersive and fully
believable in a VR headset I don't think
that we're quite there yet it still
looks it's it's we're still well within
the uncanny valley like that why would
you want to live in the star wars for
why wouldn't you of course all right all
right before we go let's talk about
stupid fake holidays yes coming up I
mean Black Friday's are not real
they're not entirely it's true Black
Friday has been around for a long enough
time that people tend to forget that
Black Friday my wife like a list of
heroes from Black Friday items I have
the hardest time calling it a holiday
called black right it's a big sale it's
a big sale I know but if I remember it
sounds so evil the shop a terrible
marketing decision well the reason if I
correct me if I'm wrong the reason it's
called Black Friday's because that's the
day that all the retailers go into the
black light that's they go from the red
to the black and that's when they said
it's national rhetoric that applies
anymore though not only that but like
it's actually that's how boldface
they're being with the sale where
they're like you know what is a bit of a
negative connotation these days I don't
know cyber monday it's it's also they're
trying to climb onto that one too and
that one also like that's not a negative
connotation yeah there's small business
something there's also another one on
Saturday yeah they just basically want
you to keep spending isn't it Small
Business Saturday Saturday so Wow which
is a nice one in my up in my personal
opinion I said a they try to you know do
that one for the mom and pops even
though that's also made up I mean
Valentine's Day started it all back in
the day actually no my wife is like
she's like this totally made-up do not
buy flowers on Valentine's Day bright
wiggly jack up the prices
yes so between that and singles day and
I love somebody in the chat pointed out
love day from The Simpsons
oh yeah that's brilliant love day will
educate you after the show
what's what's going to be with it's the
same thing it's just like I made up it's
like Simpsons version yeah but what's
gonna be the next stupid made-up holiday
that we come up with it's gonna be like
a VR day as long as people keep buying
stuff during I mean you can argue
already like iPhone launch day was its
own thing
yeah hello I know ceremony and some pop
and circumstance just sort of like yeah
III buy exactly what you're saying
everybody like gets in line and pretends
like it's a sale and everyone everyone
talks about sale it's just like here's
the first day you could buy this product
this really expensive price yeah I have
these ideas brewed in my head but I'm
afraid to say I'm out loud because if
they actually come true because it would
be easy enough to pull these off I'm
gonna feel like a monster
like for example if we rallied Alfred to
get the Millennials together for a snap
day they just have or avocado toast day
like you're giving birth to these things
as we speak like there's a second scream
like Goku event that goes on and look at
the raw day we can make anything as
stupid holiday anymore what are we done
to be fair like a dozen people showed up
to the door was it really I would say
you the consumer have the power to kill
off these made-up holidays if you one
literally stopped shopping on those days
they'll stop talking they can media they
can let's make a life day from Star Wars
a real thing from Josh Boylan yeah I
don't know that one really it's the
notorious Star Wars Christmas special
life day okay yeah right well I don't
think it's it's the only wookies I think
it's supposed to be like oh the
Christmas Christ
so galaxy far far away it's just life
day that make sense it does gonna make
sense and in the meantime there's
Festivus for the rest of us and i'm that
note it's time to wrap it up all right
good Monday it was a good week yeah all
right you like anything you saw her hurt
here take us on CNET our podcast is
