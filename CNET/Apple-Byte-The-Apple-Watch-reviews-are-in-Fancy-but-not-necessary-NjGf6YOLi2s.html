to the Apple by for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple now before
we get to the Apple watch reviews we are
always accountable here at the Apple by
so I just wanted to address an error in
last week's show at the 438 mark where I
said i watch are ready for the Apple
watch with updates to their iOS apps
that include i watch support i watch
support oyoshi dude yes I'm sorry and
there were no other errors last week I
am in fact 23 years old plus working all
right let's get to the show and the
Apple watch reviews are in the verdict
it's the most ambitious smart watch
right now it's the best-looking one but
it's not essential and it tells you
something when every reviewer says it's
not really for everyone now see that
Scott sign says it's more like a
fashionable toy than a necessary tool
Rico's Lauren good says smart watches
are still unproven but Apple has made a
pretty strong case for them and Brian
tongs mom says why are you wasting your
money on that thanks mom now i'm waiting
until the 24th like some of you to
purchase one for myself but i'm pretty
sure their reviews would be a little
different if they were the ones putting
down their own cold hard cash for that
stainless steel one thousand dollar set
up with multiple bands at Apple provided
them I'm just saying now the good news
for the most part its battery gets
through an entire day but different
issues range from the watch's interface
being slow and sluggish at times the
heart rate tracking not working unless
you have a sports BAM that fits tight to
the wrist and the most important thing
being the ability to tell time like a
subtle twist of the wrist won't always
do it and a deliberate shake of the
wrist is needed for the screen to turn
on fancy but not necessary is really the
overall theme and I honestly think a lot
of you hardcore Apple fans we're hoping
for more but we'll have plenty more to
follow up in the coming weeks all right
Apple is publicly released the official
update for OS 10 point 10.3 with the new
Photos app bug fixes and new emojis
we've talked about iOS 8.3 also receive
their own update as well so you can
finally get your diverse emojis on it
works for some butt
not all you just hold down on an emoji
and choose the skin tone color you want
but sadly you can't change the color of
the poopoo all right Apple is officially
confirm the pricing of the bill to order
new macbook 12 inch that starts at
twelve ninety nine for the 1.1 gigahertz
intel core m processor now if you want
the processor bump to one point three
gigahertz that will cost an extra two
hundred and fifty dollars and you might
want to strongly consider that after the
recent geekbench test compared it
performance wise to the top-tier macbook
air from 2011 so like I've said before a
great design but wait until more power
comes to this machine now French website
has revealed a video and images of
what's believed to be the rear shell of
the fourth-generation iPad Mini they
aren't official but it takes design cues
from the current ipad air and also uses
the similar single row of holes for the
speaker grill as well apple has released
new iPads in the late October time frame
the past years and we can probably
expect the same now LG might be getting
a little ahead of itself but in a recent
explainer on the future of 8k resolution
screens and calling it the future of
display technology they also claim that
apple will announce the imac 8k with a
super high resolution display later this
year yes now it could be a mistake of
course they are probably testing them
but this is another wait and see in the
meantime Apple should probably focus on
4k or at least get up to speed there
first before jumping into 8k that's
because a follow-up report from
buzzfeed's John pets Kowski claims up
the fourth generation Apple TV that is
rumored to come this year will not
support 4k video initially with the
source saying that 4k is great but it's
still in its infancy now Netflix and
Amazon are offering 4k content right now
but it's extremely limited and the
current eight chip in the iPhone 6 and 6
plus has been shown to be 4k capable but
really it's apples mo to wait until new
standards have widespread adoption
before jumping in and before we go just
wanted to send a shot out to two
specific Apple biters all the way from
Colombia Pablo and Felipe thanks for
watching and I know you guys are
probably running around in circles right
now alright that's going to do for this
we show you
always email us at the apple byte at
cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong and
i'll answer if i'm awake thanks so much
for watching we'll catch you all next
time for another bite of the Apple I'll
just no no no I'll just be like this
Charlie I'll to be like this stick my
head out yeah why are you wasting your
money on that that's Oh what time is
right now yeah that's fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
