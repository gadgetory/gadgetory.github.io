translate into a great video camera and
our pixel iPhone shootout proved to be
the perfect example this entire video
was shot using these two phones
side-by-side on this makeshift rig both
1080p at 60 frames per second so let's
find out which one paints a better
picture of a day in the San Francisco
Bay we'll start with the front-facing
camera in theory the pixels 8 megapixel
sensor should look sharper than the 7
megapixels on the iPhone but in reality
the iPhone did a better job at balancing
the exposure as the lighting changed
back on the main camera both seem pretty
stable despite the movement of the
trolley but the iPhone is a little bit
smoother both use different mechanisms
to stabilize the iPhone uses a more
traditional optical image stabilization
while the pixel does electronic digital
stabilization which uses the
accelerometer and built-in gyroscope to
keep the shot steady but the pixels
still seems to be working out a few
kinks in its mechanism and the movement
in the next shot looks unnatural and
jerky the iPhone though far from perfect
seems slightly smoother despite some
focus issues the same holds true for the
running shot the movement on the iPhone
seems more natural and consistent but it
had some issues keeping focus on the dog
which brings us to the next category and
here's where the iPhone starts to show
its weakness when relying on its
autofocus the iPhone had a much harder
time keeping the subject in focus even
in direct sunlight at a much closer
distance the pixel is able to capture
more detail in the foreground and create
a sharper outline on the subjects but
with scenery you'll notice the complete
opposite the iPhone is much sharper with
richer colors and contrast while the
pixel seems flat in comparison and blurs
out details in the background that
appears sharp on the iPhone unless
you're backlit and in this case it's
reversed despite an occasional lens
flare the pixel expose a shot better
against the Sun while the iPhone washed
it out there's that lens flare again on
the pixel but I'd still choose it over
the iPhone in the slow motion clip both
were shot at 240 frames per second 720p
but the water droplets look crisper on
the pixel with better color contrast
overall and when it comes to zoom
there's really no competition the dual
then set up on the iPhone allows for a
sharper 2 X optical zoom and up to 10x
digital zoom thereafter that still gets
the subject in focus
the pixel relies on digital zoom meaning
it can't get as close and well the
results speak for themselves but once
the Sun started to set the pixel
basically dropped out of the race the
low-light of the clouds looks washed out
while the iPhones look sharp and vibrant
and this next shot of the Sun setting on
the bridge looks pixelated on the pixel
and the iPhones may be darker but much
sharper with less noise same goes with
the night shot sure the pixels may be
brighter but there's so much noise
around it it's barely usable the iPhones
is dark but crisp so you can at least
distinguish landmarks the pixel may have
been our winner in our still photography
test but it's a different story when it
comes to video and here the iPhone 7
plus was consistently better than the
pixel unless you're shooting subjects in
which case the pixel does excel but
overall the iPhone 7 takes this round</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
