how to use lasers to make a metal
surface water repellent oculus is
opening up a studio to make virtual
reality movies and there's there's like
a lot of information I'm going to look
like this and and a really cool piece of
software transforms any kind of building
block like a lego into a digital
modeling kit oh yeah that's exciting
tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the nerd universe I like
that you were like are you playing a
piano know that keyboard cat goes
alright good I'm girl Ashley skeletron
amis always kill anonymous the keyboard
cat of your dreams I am excited about
this oculus news is like what do you
with the challah went when the hololens
came out everyone's like do yours dude
suckers sober they are and now virtual
realities like uh hey guys what up we
haven't even the conversation that
happened the bit of room they're both
crushing beer cans on their head it was
like anyway it was like that fight in
West Side Story when they just like snap
their fingers that he sure and yeah
sharks vs jets that's what this um so
let's not waste any more time let's hit
the headlines okay so water repellent
stuff we've seen it it's out there a
non-stick pan ducks ducks knots okay so
I water repellent stuff is generally
made with a coating like Teflon so you
see that with like non-stick pans and
stuff but the problem with that is that
over time you need to either reapply
that Teflon it's a coating so it wears
off or you can damage it so that's why
they say like we have nonstick pans
you're not supposed to use metal
utensils well this is awesome so check
this out this is from the University of
Rochester this is a surface a metal
surface that they were able to make
hydrophobic without coatings using
lasers as you say it'll never come off a
that basically it would take a very very
very very very long time for this to
wear down because it's metal so the
point of this is so this is a one by one
it's one inch by one inch but looking
it's bouncing off like literally going
off of the metal it's just like point
one point boom I like see look at that
that's amazing so the laser etches a
pattern of micro and nano scale
structures on the surface of the metal
and then it can also absorb light so it
can repel water and absorb light as well
because it's really really really dark
so the neat thing about this is is that
in most things that are made of like
they have a Teflon coating or some sort
of hydrophobic coating you actually if
it tilt it so if you have a pan and you
put water and you have to tilt it not
with this so
it literally put water and it slides
right off like it you don't have to tilt
it or otherwise manipulate it just
slides right off we just kind of me yeah
that was kind of like porn just watching
them bounce off your psyche oh yeah for
anybody who's really into hydrophobic
video this is us so that's what it looks
like when you do use like a Teflon pan
okay so this is totally different what
else are they hoping to use it on
besides pans okay so the whole point of
this is is that they're saying there
could be sanitation applications so yeah
here they are like tilting it on it
barely goes and then there's still some
water left overs residue completely not
the case with this you just slides right
off it's crazy so sanitation
applications they're saying that you
could do things like making latrines out
of this material and then that way
they're easier to clean what about a
glass water walls would that so they the
really important thing about this is
that it's kind of self cleaning because
of the surface being so um so waterproof
that if they took a vacuum bag full of
dust and like poured it on to that
surface and then put water in and they
said it took I think it was like 12
drops of water to clean up all of the
dust wow just like slid it right off so
they were saying that for cleanliness or
for any kind of sanitation application
this would be great efficiency in
developing regions we're collecting rain
water is vital survival so we're rain
rain water is kind of one of the main
sources of water this could be really
good and then also solar thermal
collectors because it can absorb energy
and or it can absorb light and then
these guys are going to be millionaires
it's pretty cool so but the problem is
is that they're going to be millionaires
but I don't know when because they're
only it took a long time for them to
make that one inch by one inch metal
plates are like etch the laser pattern
in there so they're saying that
basically the goal at this point now
that they've actually created the
surface is to make it so where they can
it's an make larger pieces quickly so
we'll see how that goes but nice job
University of Rochester way to go yeah
you are going to be millionaires guys
are gonna be rich okay tell me about
oculus speaking of water was now rich
who are currently rich oculus has
announced that they are going to be
making a studio to create movies for a
VR space help the by world this was
announced at Sundance they said they're
going to be up
producing VR movies with oculus headset
basically movie experience they showed
up with a four minute animated short
called lost now the cool thing is their
product commissaries oculus Dei so
they're promising that they're going to
have guessed directors come in oh I like
that and make these movies as well as
the fact that they already have 10
people on their team on their starting
teams some of them are from Pixar and
lucasarts so that's pretty cool those
are big names yeah so I mean that I
don't think we really have an idea one
that one we're gonna start seeing these
but obviously making fully interactive
oh yeah and also they're hoping to make
it so that you can actually sometimes
interact in the movie but basically to
sum it up their goal there's always the
goal always well we like it all so the
goal is to produce movies that allow
first-person experience movies and even
possible ability to interact in the
future so we've already seen an app
where you can sit in a movie theater and
watch a movie yeah like a virgin cinema
right yeah you sit in a movie theater
like change seats and it's but you're
like alone by the way throw pots really
invisible people that's really like
frustrating is you're an alone in the
theater um but yeah now they're hoping
that you're just in the movie I bet you
know in a theater is the best it's like
your own Mystery Science Theater so you
can go oh no you did um but I've
actually already been inside a simulated
movie there I forgot the name of the
movie i forgot the director but this guy
was nominated for an Oscar I don't think
he won but he was nominated for an Oscar
and then he made this one and basically
you're in it was like Fallujah or
something like that it was these Marines
rating so you're like going with them
sava and and I actually I actually did
it though um and then you're like
dicking around and yeah it was loud like
you hear gunfire over on the corner
right stuff like that that freaked me
out it was pretty cool we also if you
didn't know we also did the interstellar
experience yeah so we went through the
ship from interstellar and that was
pretty cool so yeah I'm looking forward
to this seeing what we get out of this
and that was the thing with AR it adds
to your life but VR you're stepping into
a completely different worlds we cannot
say which one is better surely one is
better at some things one is better
there's I'm looking forward to seeing
what kind of stories that unravel and
what people want to do I don't you think
I should ask other people what they
would think I think we should so I think
we should make the hashtag of the day oh
you think about you DVR film and we
should ask people to pitch their idea
for a movie for virtual reality can I do
one yeah okay here's my pitch all right
kiddo run lola run but with VR or if you
want to work with an intellectual
property that already exists let's go
mirrors edge oh I like so you but I mean
again it cuz I could just be a game but
mirrors edge but you do like a
live-action Mirror's Edge all of my cuz
all mine exist in your embodying the
person obviously that one the one that I
tried you weren't necessarily embodying
someone you were following people yeah
um but yeah embodying you embody someone
who's doing like parkour and stuff like
that I'd like to see I'd like to see a
short film based on 2001 a Space Odyssey
and like visiting the obelisk whoo okay
just short dumb some kind of narrative
somebody come up with a narrative like
I'm sure they're smarter people out
there than I but some kind of narratives
from a cool narrative that takes us back
to the obelisk that sounds like like
five or ten minutes yeah of course you
pick something space something cool yeah
wow this is cool I think the virtual
reality for me like the most exciting
thing for me is going to a place that
I'm not going to be able to go like at
least until I'm very old and rich and
I'm like Oprah but space like I mean
it's you can go anywhere in the world
and it won't cost you nearly as much as
it will cost to go to space so for me
it's that's like the exciting thing for
me is that someday I might be able to
put on a hollow lens or put on an oculus
rift and go to Mars and be able to see
it right in front of me as if it were
there from the comfort of my living room
I like that yeah that's what that's what
you know VR is supposed to represent
yeah don't know so pitches your movie
ideas shortfilms long long movies
whatever and will I don't know we should
we pick a favorite or something tomorrow
I guess we'll pick a favorite yeah well
each pick a few pick a favorite I'll
pick a favorite so let's talk about
digital Legos because this is awesome
everybody loves Legos unless you step on
them which in which case I run hates
them yeah but this London studio called
gravity
it's I think it's like for graduate
students they designed Lego X which is a
software system that lets you build
things with blocks and then as you're
building it creates a digital render of
it like in real time on your computer or
your iPad so this is kind of incredible
like I'm super impressed with this so
you can see they're moving the block
around in the video and it's like it
knows exactly with where and how you're
moving them around it uses location
mapping and gyroscopic sensors to plot
the position and orientation of the
blocks they're using duplo blocks here
by the way like I those look a little
large to be Legos yes they're duplo
blocks but gravity so it uses duplo
blocks now because it was easy but look
at this so that's what it's rendering so
it's actually running a real room oh
like it's a 3d room it doesn't look like
a lego it doesn't look like a lego bills
yeah it'll be an architect so see how
it's got like these big arrays so when
it it says oh you have a bunch of blocks
together it recognizes that it needs to
make it one piece so that's why you saw
just a simple wall going like this yeah
as opposed to a whole bunch of how is
capturing it so they they have a whole
like system set up for this and it uses
location sense like location mapping and
gyroscopic sensors that are they have it
like if we go back to the video if Logan
can like show a little bit more of this
when they're putting them down on the
there's like a plate that they're
putting their like landing everything
down on and they were saying that you'd
be able to sort of put things together
in with these blocks and then export
them to your favorite 3d printer
software as a file and then you'd be
able to 3d print whatever that was so
this could really revolutionize things
like architecture so they could build
something with legos like hypothetically
builds build a whole thing out of legos
which we've seen some amazing lego
builds and then you would be able to get
that 3d printed and like show people
exactly what your vision is as a 3d
printed like mock-up of a building Lego
just pretty right all right cool that
was kind of my dream as a kid yeah I
mean I think this is awesome and I like
they do some other cool stuff this team
gravity there they do some other stuff
with digital design and also they do
some VR development so they have some
things going on with
well I was like looking through their
web doesn't was totally stalking you
guys gravity um but yeah it was i'm just
really fascinated by this and i think
this is a really neat sort of step
towards being able to sort of use the
things that are in your house like Legos
or lincoln logs or whatever it is like
you know kids toys being able to use
those to design something that you can
then get 3d printed and sent to your
house is like that's insane it's like
yeah because I mean honestly not
everybody has the tech savviness to
build something in a virtual space and
really or model something so right
everybody knows how to use Legos so I
mean it's that seems like a really
accessible way to sort of build
something incredible and then this
software sort of takes what you're
building and smoothes it out and you can
actually use the software as well to
like smooth over edges or it recognizes
when you want an arch like and stuff and
it automatically will adjust to that
it's pretty cool so you nice build my
next house and Legos this is what I'm
learning to I think that's really I mean
that's the goal right I love that they
also combine the 3d printing element
I'll just put out that up really need to
export your 3d file and then to get a 3d
print is awesome so uh we're going to
take a quick break we're gonna be right
back we have an awesome mod this week
four Mod Squad and then we also have
your user feedback and our phone tiger
for the day so don't click wait tomorrow
daily
welcome back to the show we've returned
Killa is having all sorts of problems
are you your keyboard cat in it up today
this is just me this is who I am I'm
this guy that doesn't I just whenever
you do that I always think of the
homestar runner a song like I was here I
love homestar runner and so as always
you're like that boo boo boo boo boo boo
boo boo boo boo boo boo casio like they
played cassidy that is that one that's a
deep cut uh do you want to talk about
skull tongs yeah to say yes just say yes
look it sound excited yeah okay whoa
we're going to talk about school tongs
it's time for bomb squad we still don't
have a graphic yet but I'm gonna act
like that was it um alright so i don't
know if you guys have ever seen this
channel on youtube it's called sling
slingshot channel mm-hmm this guy runs
slingshot channel and i gotta say i love
it so this is the guy right here his
name is Jurgis prov nice and first of
all he is just delightful he's super
into slingshots like rubber propelled
rubber-based projectiles like anything
that could be launched with rubber bands
he is into it so they started off doing
things that were just like basic things
and then they made this this is called
the skull Tong so geez those are at the
end of this if you're just listening the
show you have to watch it today because
this is terrifying terrifying and
amazing so there's two iron balls those
are too heavy iron balls at the end of
this and they basically go all the way
back and then swing out 180 degrees and
meet together in the middle at the end
of this like I guess gun I'm and with
the help of and smash whatever's in the
middle so um i just i love how enthused
no guys so he so he bought this great so
he trades with this company that makes
these like zombie heads and he filled it
up with wine and then he smashed the
zombies he want to see if it would smash
a zombie skull and so he does these slow
mo cameras everything it's great so you
can see they didn't quite meet exactly
the same time but I
it's because the way the heads built but
um yeah so he built it I mean like
showed what the damage was but
apparently it's a lot because that look
like it wouldn't really hurt somebody um
so yeah he originally I guess made this
thing what to call against Cole smash
it's called us kiss the skull tongs cuz
it were it works sort of like tongs it
kills like I don't like I don't like
this thing this guy scares me sale for
sale but this guy like it's super
enthusiastic about a ring and I just
like I love his enthusiasm and he gets
so like excited and just jacked about
sling shots that destroyed people's head
it's so great and so he cool he I guess
he put up a video before showing off the
skull Tom's but they were um they didn't
have these gears underneath that kept
the the arms even and so people were
saying like oh you'll probably have
problems hitting at the same time so he
put some gears on there and then it kept
everything like really even so that it
could just like swing around and like
get some momentum in and smash
whatever's in between um it's cool that
he's thinking outside the box you know
like he's evolving his craft of
slingshot so we're good to look very
creepy lot like scary love was other
stuff on his on his channel yeah Gatling
gun sling shot where it's like hunt it
oh I highly recommend going over this
guy's side cuz it's his youtube channel
i want to know where that started like
if he started doing that in school like
he just seems like he's really into
slingshots so any and all of them are
propelled by just rubber bands so not
just the little tiny ones but the real
thick ones that you see like at the gym
and stuff they're like heavy-duty rubber
bands but they're still rubber bands and
so then he has them all rigged up and
then shoot stuff it's awesome awesome so
yeah that shadows what's the channel
slingshot channel i just called
slingshot channel okay clean channel
tell them they tell him we sent you if
yes over there go and make a comment say
totally sent me and tell him i'm scared
of him yeah kayla is terrified of him um
will definitely not have that in the
studio in in case it just so happens to
attach itself the girls have this
message we're at home yeah that's true
ish probably wear a helmet alright it's
time for your user feedback
so we asked you guys use the hashtag TV
block and tell us what you'd want Oh a
race yeah this is gonna be good by the
way I was driving over here and there
was a guy walking down the street with a
dr. pepper shirt and I got really bummed
cuz I thought to myself like oh if I had
that headset I wouldn't have seen that
never know what it's got some joy out of
that I've seen that dr. ever sure anyway
alright so Stefan roaches and said
everything except me in my computer lock
everything Oh sis yeah computer just
block out the rest of my god it's really
emo of you Stefan yikes uh and then they
love you Nick wrote to us and said i
black out justin bieber he said believe
he says believer but i'm assuming he he
mixed up beaver and bieber cuz there he
is a small beaver I'm pretty sure Justin
Bieber is a tiny beaver so like him as a
whole like his voice and everything just
permanently erase it from society i know
i will buy that the kardashian is also
an excellent choice yes i would take i
would also take in the Kardashians that
would've been a good also a good answer
and then we got an email from Rob who
wrote to us about TD class member he
wanted to make those nice helper robots
and then we the other guy who wanted to
make the evil robot yes yeah these
because Rob wrote and said this is a
follow-up to your TD class from Monday
I'm gonna I'm just gonna read this
angrily because it's it makes me laugh
in fact I want to vote killer robots i
reprogram my helping robots to real-life
visions of republic aligning themselves
with robotic versions of superheroes
such as x-men Avengers spider-man
Superman so he's like I would literally
like a lie way worse I love this okay
it's a battle it's about their already
deciding how they got one of each other
robot robot battle begins here on
tomorrow daily no survivors nope take no
prisoners taking on fighter robots
aligning the drone was just watching
aligning themselves with superhero
robots and the G how the drones are
gonna record it all of them interacting
and then we're going to watch it on an
oculus rift there we go tight at all
we've brought it all back full circle um
and then we have our very last piece of
user feedback which is always our phone
tog refer the day
we have a blackberry picture day gracie
breakdown open for a drone picture him
no no DRO tog receipt he did send
another picture and said this wasn't a
picture from a drone and we mabel use
that another time by mom okay so Eddie
wrote to us and said he took this
picture wow you see here Otis named
Ellie said continuing to enjoy the show
wanted to share another blackberry phone
to graph these 180 degree panorama were
taken in foul mouth jamaica on a
blackberry z10 but using the stock
camera app in an android smart launcher
another cool example of how you can
combine android and blackberry into a
black droid or andrew Berry to unleash
the best of both operating systems on
the blackberry z10 so your checks in the
mail from blackberry hahahahaha
blackberries written you a check for
that shining wonderful endorsement of
the blackberry z10 no it's a great
picture look at that it really it's hard
to like really nail a panoramic view it
really is sometimes it's a little bit of
a jumbled mess but this actually turned
out really and super duper kudos for
including the mirrored windows so that
it like so it actually looks like it
goes on forever that's like it just goes
and goes I love it yeah super great so
you know what I'd be you're definitely
my favourite viewer now cuz I've never
seen a panoramic like that's for that
was pretty good but I'm gonna say I've
not quite my favorite not quite no I
mean someday same old story just keep
trying guys if you want to try to have
your picture be my favorite kale is an
easy first day you can email us tomorrow
at cnet com you can also email us your
user feedback if you absolutely hate
email we got you covered we have all
kinds of social media you can find us on
tomorrow daily on Twitter Instagram
Facebook snapchat we're on snapchat now
guys what we are now on snapchat we
sending what would it be snapping I
don't know you guys should send us some
stuff and then we'll send you back some
stuff cuz i don't know what's
appropriate on snapchat or i don't know
i feel like it started out the most
inappropriate way more on snapchat III
thought what are we going what are we
even gonna all right well i might have a
staring you guys will send in your best
staring contest and I will stare back
you that's I think that's a really good
way to start things off fair enough
let's have a staring contest you versus
us we're pretty good at it yes
why I if you're watching on YouTube
don't forget to subscribe and like and
favorite and all that stuff and also if
you're listening on iTunes don't forget
to rate and review your story and then
of course you could always find us as
individuals and and weirdos on the
internet on Twitter I'm at Ashley sceva
and I am also at Ashley a scale-out
trail we share an account on Matt Cail
anonymous please join me for my wacky
adventures in my overly opinionated
thoughts yes me too um and that's it for
today's show we will be back tomorrow
with a brand new doc and weird wonderful
science tech robots face whatever we can
find that might interest you but until
then viga humans and we will see you
next time bye
