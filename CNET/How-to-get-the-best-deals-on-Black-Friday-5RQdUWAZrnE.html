better and I'm not just talking about
the deals but the fact that you never
have to leave your couch to snag heavily
discounted products just in time for the
holidays
it sounds easy enough but getting great
deals is all about being prepared and
with my advice I'll help you do just
that first make a list of the products
you definitely want to buy on Black
Friday I'm all about avoiding
overspending and making a list will help
once you have your notes jotted down
it's time to start shopping even if
Black Friday is days away there are
already leaked advertisements on
websites like slick deals and deals plus
you can also get exclusive coupons and
deals by liking retailers on Facebook
following them on Twitter and keeping
tabs on coupon sites like RetailMeNot
make note of which retailers have the
products you want especially the smaller
retailers you might gravitate to big-box
guys like Best Buy and Costco but your
best bet is that the smaller guys like
staples or Ace Hardware they tend to
attract a smaller crowd and less demand
means more supply for you alright as
Black Friday nears and you have a better
idea of which eat Ahlers you'll be
shopping with do this go on those
websites and create an account now that
means setting up a username and password
plus storing your banking data this is
crucial since KUB lock Friday you'll
want to be able to check out as fast as
possible you see even if an item is in
your shopping cart it could be gone by
the time you click pay so grab your
wallet and set up those accounts now if
you use this system and stick to your
shopping list you're already ahead of
the crowd but I also have a few
no-nonsense tips for you to keep in mind
on that fateful day some retailers might
impose rules specific to Black Friday
deals so check those policies before you
shop prioritize your purchases when
Black Friday rolls around products sell
out quickly and it's all about being
there first
watch out for scams especially on
Facebook and in your email inbox there
are a lot of losers trying to take
advantage of desperate shoppers
don't be one of them keep all of those
things in mind but if I could tell you
one thing it would be to start shopping
now even if you're away from your
computer you can use apps like deals and
steals deals plus and fatwallet to
follow Black Friday deals while you're
out and about with all the crazy deals
you'll be getting you have my permission
to get carried away this year just don't
forget to pick something up for Mom and
Dad while you're at it
