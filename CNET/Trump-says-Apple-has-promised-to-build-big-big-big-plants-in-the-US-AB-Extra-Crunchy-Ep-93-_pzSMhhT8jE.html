welcome the show ladies and gentlemen
boys and girls thank you so much for
sticking with us I had a break beat him
what did you do the two weeks that I've
been gone I cried and waited for you to
come back I'm kidding no I went I went
to Tahoe the first week oh man you went
to Hawaii the next week yeah it's been
like a 2 weeks of kind of a weird
schedule for us you know but you know
we're back in effect everyone deserves a
vacation
we don't complain when you guys go on
vacation just like you know but this is
the Apple white extra crunchy it's our
complimentary piece to our Apple bite a
video podcast that really kind of digs
deeper into the stories that we talk
about and also brings in new information
because news is always churning out so
I'm just going to let you all know you
guys and gals have always been a big
part of the show so we have our number
that you can call us to leave a voice
millets 1-866-376-8255
I won't consider my administration in
economic success he called me and he
said they're going for it it's gonna be
big so and when I say he said big big
bake three times the throw he literally
did so what this story really is about
is that look Apple if this is true
according to Donald Trump
we'll be building three manufacturing
facilities in the United States when
Trump was first elected he actually kind
of called out companies like Apple and
in a quote from during a campaign speech
at Virginia's Liberty University he
actually said we're going to get Apple
to start building their damn computers
and things in this country instead of
other countries he said this also at
that time threatened to introduce a 45
percent tax on products imported from
China really trying to focus on bringing
manufacturing jobs back here in America
and we know how they have left you know
in a mass exodus and how do you
incentivize companies to do that well
following some of that pressure
according to this report Apple actually
went to its suppliers both Foxconn and
Pegatron to look into seeing how they
could actually make iPhones in the US we
already know that they assemble some of
their products here in the US so it's
not necessarily manufactured in the US
but assembled a but the sadly the
trashcan MacPro was one of those
products that was assembled in the US I
do believe IMAX
some of them are actually assembled here
in the US but just not manufactured so
Foxconn is now according to reports in
separate reports planning to build an
actual thin transistor film LCD factory
in the United States so you got Foxconn
is moving to the United States that's
maybe there how about not moving but at
least building something here yeah yeah
I mean that's that's very interesting
that they would bring a manufacturing
company from another country here that
that's that's pretty interesting well
you know I mean Apple obviously has a
tight relationship with Foxconn they're
their number one kind of manufacturer
supplier and that supplier per se but
you know one I guess you could say yeah
it's kind of a hybrid of manufacturing
and supplying so bringing them here to
the US um the word and rumors suggest
that the company Foxconn is plant that
they'll first put here in the u.s. is
looking to be somewhere in Wisconsin in
that and they don't know exactly where
it will be built in that state but
that's one of the first targets um apple
declined to provide any clarification on
Donald Trump's statements about building
factories here and in addition to that
they're just talking about how look we
don't know exactly when or where these
three big big big plants it's gonna be
big you say that yeah I mean that's
great I mean is is Tim Cook still on his
uh on his tech you know his tech group
that he has or did he leave yeah yeah
he's still part of that board remember
he had that um he had this like
executive tech summit where they brought
a lot of kind of leaders in the tech
space to talk to Trump about you know
they also lobbied hard about net
neutrality that's been a big issue of
what is the government going to do about
throttling or controlling who gets
priority for data whether it's you know
companies that pay for it and we know
that's a big deal with you know Netflix
and video services versus Internet
services who's really gonna get that
priority if they change some of those
net neutrality rules but again the the
story here though is at least according
to President Trump that Apple will be
bringing some manufacturing plants to
the US which if this is true is a great
thing it's a great that it's an awesome
thing you know and that's that's kind of
what Trump does is is before any
announcements are made he kind of
bullies and like kind of you know hints
at things and speeches and stuff I'm
like Apple's gonna come here you know
like apples not ready they're not ready
to make a an announcement or anything
but he's already saying it you know so
it's kind of kind of interesting and
then and then it we'll see if it happens
yeah but it feels like you know he's
kind of already setting it up to where
it better happen or I'm gonna like
attack I'm gonna attack Apple because
that's any text that I'll talk to you
guys if you don't do it is my detect is
attacked Boeing he's attacked Lockheed I
think Nordstrom was attacking Amazon
right because they don't because the
hell attacks debacle and Amazon that he
calls him Amazon the Washington Post so
it's interesting that he is having a an
interview with with the Washington Post
when he hates that waffle WAFF eternal
you know sorry Wall Street Journal my
bad my bad
that's a mistake but um but yeah this is
this is something that Trump does he
likes to you know kind of hint at things
that he's trying to make happen in hopes
that maybe that company well you know
push on the gas a little faster to get
it done or something so yeah we'll see
we'll see how it shakes out will so we
will again we will see all right um
other news trend the thing and quickly
in the chat people are like saying oh if
your phone is gonna be made in America
it's gonna be so much more and then the
response time half so the response room
have to people like I'll pay whatever
for an iPhone people aren't scared about
$1,000 iPhone they really aren't and if
you break that down in monthly payments
you're never gonna remember that you
paid a thousand dollars for an iPhone
it's just the way it is this is my way
it is I could see Apple doing some
patriotic marketing too or it's like
patreon to go buy a knife and that's
from made in America you know it's
interesting what's happening the iPhone
murica edition all right let's jump into
more things about Apple um this there
are it's been kind of quiet because
there hasn't been any really major news
let's be honest everyone is kind of
waiting for the next product drop to
happen which would obviously be iPhone
also Apple watch for Wayne to see that
and maybe if we see new Apple TV stuff
before the end of the year but no major
announcements have happened as of yet so
look when people are kinda bored and
they want to stir up the Apple rumor
mill but you know what we we talk about
it because because honestly I like
seeing this stuff
forbes.com publish an article that
really featured kind of the idea of what
a new iPhone render could look like this
looks a lot like everything but I think
the biggest thing people that aren't
looking at this will remember some of
the early renders of the iPhone showed
kind of this black black bar on the top
where the cameras and sensors were kind
of jutting out but this these renders
are now showing what I've requested from
the start yeah just along the bar it
doesn't mean that this is gonna happen
but this is the idea and then when you
look at something like this an edge to
edge OLED screen with a black bar on the
top for like the cameras and
your wireless and your battery it looks
honestly like a Galaxy s8 like it really
does it totally does but you know what I
mean who cares now these days I feel
like every phone has gotten the point
where they look so similar it's starting
to really just come down to the the
operating system and functionality more
than oh your iPhone as long as the phone
doesn't look crappy I don't think people
people don't care if companies copy
companies anymore that I just think it's
so different phones that people have in
their hands it's like what's that it's
so many different models of phone now I
don't think it matters it's everyone
throws a case on them it's all about
just the operating system in the and the
ecosystem and you know the features it
has so look if it looks like a galaxy s
8 kind of ish oh well get over it but
what the story is related to is beyond
those renders Forbes is just talking
about some of the features that
according to their sources in working
with a case company who's also getting
details from overseas in China it looks
like the whole idea of touch ID
integrated on to the front of the screen
is going to happen the whole idea of
Plan B with that touch ID sensor on the
rear of the phone is not going to happen
which everyone is like really really
happy about so the other kind of tweak
here that they're talking about is and
people have mentioned this in colors of
Ewan called in about the power button
actually being larger in size and the
reason why just like one of our callers
did last week or a week or two weeks
before is that in case touch ID isn't
able to work and integrate it into the
display there is a patent that could
potentially integrate it into that power
button so it's almost like they no one
knows exactly why they've increased the
size on it is it like a fallback just in
case but you know we'll see that it
maybe in future generations will see
touch ID involved in integrated into the
actual power button I don't I think it's
kind of inconvenient cuz I don't want to
pick up my phone like that all the time
but whatever it's it's there so that's
what the Forbes has to say about it and
then in another report this one coming
from ET news as we kind of bundle up all
the iPhone 8 news
Apple is working on developing its own
OLED technology this is really in an
attempt to reduce their dependence on
Samsung if you haven't heard or you
aren't familiar with this basically with
the new iPhone 8 the OLED based screen
it's gonna be completely reliant on
Samsung as their sole supplier they
signed a contract about it basically to
provide 160 million OLED screens for
Apple over the next two years it's a
sign deal that is going to happen but
the problem with this is that Apple
doesn't like being reliant on a single
supplier because if something happens
they're screwed they'll like anyone
that's smart about this stuff in the
supply chain you've got to diversify
your sources so according to these
reports from the et news
Apple has actually purchased machines
specifically they're called chemical
vapor deposition machines they're used
to create OLED panels but Apple
themselves according to these reports
has purchased these machines to work on
developing you know basically their own
eyelids and then potentially pretty much
to lease these off to their suppliers
people like Foxconn or Pegatron to then
eventually produce more OLED screens and
really a secondary source for future
Apple products whether it's like the
iPhone or the Apple watch that's pretty
cool and they also like in a similar but
unrelated they also have their own
machine that creates the curved glass
for the Apple for the Apple headquarters
right so Apple yeah you don't know where
they get that stuff quite honestly I
don't even know I thought that they had
it like specially made for themselves so
they're like really into the whole glass
like I could see them cornering the
market and some sort of glass technology
in the future you know it feels like
they're just like really getting in the
glass stuff these days well I mean if
you talk about glass structures beyond
skyscraper buildings I think from a
standpoint of the most artistic
aesthetically pleasing glass buildings I
mean Apple that aren't models or
sculptures Apple's gonna be right up
there yeah to me they're UFO I like you
you know like you talked about the
curved glass panels on those were made
specifically for it I don't know if
Apple them
had any hand in in making them per se
other than the design I really don't
know that but they're you're right about
the fact that they they could take their
knowledge into kind of the enterprise
market if they you know but but then at
the same time they're so they're the
type of company that wants to hold on to
their secrets they'd be like oh we're
just gonna keep this for our own
buildings like you guys figure it out
it's start looking at the patent
websites for new glass technology so you
know with this meet with these CVD
machines these OLED basically producing
panel machines
this is just a way for Apple to kind of
just control our at least get backs to
more control because really do you want
to be a hundred percent reliant on your
top competitor although they own it's
for your product you don't so yeah this
is smart this is really smart move so um
we have seen right here I got a picture
of it it looks pretty it's not too big
actually I think it I think those
machines look like they could produce
like beer yeah they look like I think
it'd make a nice craft beer from a CVD
machine just the way that they look
steel pot and everything so alright just
talking about this is kind of like just
really quickly we're gonna jump around
here a little bit but if you aren't
familiar with Apple's public betas for
their operating systems they just
released basically the whole lineup iOS
11 TV OS watch OS Mac OS hi Sierra the
third public betas are available so if
you guys and gals want to jump on that
you can I I installed it on my iPad
right away when they came out because my
iPad is my baby but it's also like if
something weird happens to it it's not
the end of the world I'm just like
there's a lot of people like put it on
your phone put it in your phone I'm like
I'm not gonna put on my own phone like
they can't even get the regular releases
right all the time and they're still
buggy like I know some people this whole
public beta thing people then will write
me about how like oh this doesn't work
as well why is this crashing I don't
like this my app doesn't work I'm like
dude it's a beta like I'm it's not my
fault you put the bait on it bro they're
playing there they're shooting the mess
in German they're blaming you I'd like I
always have to do this climber I always
that's climber it's like do I really
have I've learned from you I don't do
the beta ever because I know the Brian
tongue says don't do it unless you have
a secondary device or let's say an a
phone from the previous generation that
you want to test it on and just have
that's fine but I saw a kid this young
kid he was like little I could tell he's
rocking iOS 11 on his phone and I'm like
just wait I was like just wait for it
you know you gonna be like why isn't my
phone work the same what's it worth the
same all right this is kind of like my
honestly this is my favorite story of
the week I didn't choose the lead with
it because it's kind of a little more
nitty-gritty and I think it's more for
people that are fans and have remembered
really like diehards about the past of
Apple and why not but just today Adobe
officially announced that they are
end-of-life in flash by the end of 2020
thank God so flash will be officially
dead and no longer supported by the end
of 2020 and now Adobe says it's working
with companies including Apple and
Google to prepare for the upcoming death
of flash which is kind of funny because
they've pretty much killed it off long
ago like this so this is what this is
what I really like about this story so
you know Apple is also in their part you
know they they offered a message from a
WebKit blog that is really what the
basis of their Safari browser is on
WebKit they were part of they
contributed to that
so Apple said that they're working with
Adobe industry partners and developers
to complete this transition but I want
to really remind people and rewind back
all the way to April of 2010 and for
people that are that remember this this
was a big deal back then but if you
recall flash really at the time was kind
of an integral part of obviously
computers was still on mobile devices
like at one point in time Android phones
were running flash and it was kind of
like oh we can run flash and people on
the iPhone or like I don't really care
so Steve Jobs himself penned this letter
it was an open letter that he put out
publicly
to everyone to read on apple's website
if you even want to look it up just for
fun
it's called thoughts on flash you just
type that in this this search tool i've
heard of called google
it's called thought yeah you never heard
of that yeah beach oh yeah very very
some some new emergent technology so
it's the letters called thoughts on
flash and really what it is it's
something like a 1700 word letter
specifically talking about why Apple is
moving forward away from flash I'm not
gonna read everything here because it
would just get into it too much I'd want
you to read it but here's someone kind
of the key points that that Steve Jobs
pointed out he talked about just being
able to access the full web and one of
at the time flash was saying flash is
still relevant it's still useful it's
still good and Steve Jobs like no flash
is old it's buggy
it causes crashes it's not secure so
Adobe had their kind of side of the
argument like okay look if without flash
you don't get the full web so Steve Jobs
address this saying like Apple is said
it's writing that adobe has repeatedly
said that Apple devices can't mobile
devices cannot access the full web
because 75% of the video on the web is
in flash what they don't say is that
almost all this video is also available
in a more modern format h.264 viewable
on iPhones iPods iPads YouTube so and
he's talking about all these platforms
that are using h.264 video that don't
need flash that don't need this extra
layer of software that will slow down
and bog down the performance of your
phone he talked about battery life he
said plenty do in their tests aged just
running purely playing h.264 videos they
play up for up to 10 hours on the iPhone
now when they're using a Flash Player
it's less than 5 hours so battery life
was like that's that's when they talking
about optimization like a better product
that was also another Bugaboo and then
the another point that he wrote amongst
others is that there's touch flash was
made for PCs using mice right there was
kind of like interactive animations cool
games things like that but
Apple was moving on to touch devices in
2010 so it's kind of interesting out and
at the time again I have to reiterate
that flash was still flash wasn't
irrelevant then it was kind of one of
those first slings first you know shots
fired
they didn't used to say that back then
but Steve Jobs he threw it out put out
this deep letter saying like look and it
was kind of like we're not gonna use
flash on our platforms it's an old
platform use more modern stuff support
html5 things like that and it's just
really interesting how it is completely
turned out that way of course Adobe had
to protect their interests right it's a
business it's a product of theirs they
can't say oh yeah a flash is gonna die
but that's kind of how it all shook out
you know Adobe was mad that Apple didn't
support flash cuz here Apple has this
app store they wanted to be a part of it
but Apple's App Store didn't use require
or need flash at all for developers to
come out with these awesome apps yeah I
remember well he's actually said that in
one of his keynotes I remember I think
it was I got an iPhone kheema keynote or
something and I was like whoa he's just
you just tell him you're not gonna use
it ever again you know and that's a big
deal it was a big deal it was a big deal
yeah I was like what okay so I guess I
got a plan on no flash in the future but
I did find like a two-minute little
piece of him talking about it in 2010 do
you is it cool if I play real quick yeah
let's do maybe that we weren't gonna put
the energy into getting flash on our
platform we told Adobe if you ever have
this thing running fast come back and
show us which they never did and but but
we think we're not gonna use it and that
was it and we shipped the iPhone and it
doesn't use flash and it wasn't until we
shipped the iPad and it didn't use flash
that Adobe started to raise us think
about it we didn't raise us to think
about it we never mentioned the word
Adobe or flash or anything else we we
like Adobe we have a lot of common
customers with CS you know their
Creative Suite software and things like
that so we weren't trying to have a
fight we just decided not to use one of
their
products in a platform and so you know
they started to say a lot of bad things
about us in the press and this and that
and it went on for months and that's why
I wrote thoughts on flash was because we
were trying to be real professional
about this and weren't talking to the
press about it we didn't think it was a
matter for the press and we finally just
said enough is enough
we're tired of these guys trashing us in
the press over this and so we wrote down
the reasons why technically we didn't
choose flash and and flash Wow yeah baby
when someone crosses him man
he'll come after you like straight it
was a real he keeps it real though right
Ben said the letter was not an attack on
Adobe it was just an honest breakdown of
the tech like dude when I see that the
man is talking about Flash and I'm fired
up dude yes yes all of that all of that
it's very similar the Scott Forstall
thing who was at the San Jose computer
museum you know he was like we made the
iPhone or we made the iPad because Steve
Jobs hated this dude at Microsoft you
know it's kind of it's kind of long the
same lines you know so here's another
just because this is kind of a big you
know again people that don't care fine
but this this is kind of there's fun
there's always this kind of fun behind
the scenes thanks for that clip beeps
that was awesome that was awesome um but
here we go a former software developer
manager at Apple during that time his
name is Bob burrow and he put out these
tweets basically about what had happened
and he actually said that it jobs
refusal to support flash itself had
actually less to do with their security
issues but more that Adobe as a partner
couldn't be relied on to actually
address the issue so basically they
tested flash on iPhones back in 2008 Bob
burrow even tweeted he personally tested
them you can scroll down on that article
Beach and it'll show more so he fired
off like a series of tweets to talk
about like how Jobs was thinking at the
time and basically Jobs was trying to
call the CEO of Adobe at that time
Shantanu Narayen and he wouldn't take
his phone calls and jobs basically had
no faith that adobe would be able to
Dress what jobs characterize them more
as engineering problems and not security
issues but just optimizing it making it
faster make it perform better make it
better for their platform so a lot of
times people think that Oh Steve Jobs
was ridiculed for his decision that they
didn't want to do Adobe but is really
based on both technical reasons that
Jobs pointed out in that clip you said
but also the fact that Adobe was kind of
a crappy partner to them because they
didn't return their calls they didn't
want to work with them on it an adult
and what Jobs alluded to there in that
clip was yeah Adobe was like kind of
talking smack about us behind the scenes
so let that be a lesson to all startup
guys out there someone's like making you
know certain they're giving you some
ideas or like kind of lead you in the
direction maybe go in that direction
otherwise or just be an open mind to it
yes the way your platforms gonna
disappear in another eight years or so
ten years so I thought that was that was
kind of a fun story with that so you
know what I think that let's just jump
into the phone calls man okay cool think
about that you don't want to do the rock
story oh there's the thing people can't
really see it but for those who
basically Apple and the rock put out
this video and it's like basically the
rock using my same basically so much
today I gotta stop that it's the rock
using Siri in his everyday life and it's
just fun you guys should just look it up
it's it's like dominate the day it's on
Apple's YouTube channel it's a fun like
four-minute video of the rock doing
everything that's multitasking them
being challenged like oh he isn't doing
enough and he does like everything
possible known a man his calendar has
like 25 appointments at one time slot
just crazy stupid stuff like that it's
pretty funny a future president so check
that out check that out it's fun cool
all right yeah let's get to some calls
thank you guys for calling we had a
bunch of good calls today all we and the
first
here we go hey Brian hey Beecham
it's Shahab from Murrieta California and
I just wanted to get your opinion last
time you guys talked about how Apple was
in like too many markets and they were
falling behind do you think that that
the the reason for that is because they
are getting moving into their new
headquarters and they're saving the
research and development for the new
headquarters and things like that and so
I just wanted to get your opinion love
the show thank you bye
cool I know that when I'm moving I get
behind you know yeah but you don't you
don't have 10,000 people to back you up
when you're Meru that's true I mean look
I I think that's a nice idea but that's
that is not product that's not the
reason why product XYZ and ABC just are
are lacking in quote-unquote the word
you know innovation I mean they just
it's when a company's spread too thin
you sometimes you just got to focus and
lock in and that's that's a problem that
every company I was looking at Google
Google has so many things going on that
sometimes and then they're learning to
really Zone in on their phone product
but man before when they were like they
were coming out with like 50 different
like software platforms and apps and it
was kind of like all over the place and
it's part of a learning they you know
they it's still kind of part of their
culture right but they're they're you
know they're innovating with knowing
it's like you know I've there's this
term called quick quick not perfect and
so it's like get the product out there
start working on it develop it get it
out there it doesn't have to be perfect
well apples philosophy is kind of
different
they are perfectionists which then in
turn takes longer for a product to come
out with the hope that it's Paul a
polished product but then the same time
you can also see how that may not always
work
to their advantage when you know you
feel like they're behind in features
that have been out for two three years
like or if not more like wireless
charging you know LED screens things
like that okay yeah all right let's do
the next call here we go Isaac I'm from
Virginia
she's like 400 the next distance from 50
feet very deliberate wants to make sure
that gets his point across I'm gonna say
no and I obviously the new iPhone will
have wireless charging Apple does have a
patent for long range long-distance
charging but knowing how Apple works
even though it has a patent on it that
they've developed where potentially they
might even use something like the base
of an iMac as a transmitter I think that
type of technology it's gonna take them
time to master now if they do it I'll be
floored and I'll be like this is awesome
if somehow there's a coil in your
MacBook Pro and a coil and your iMac and
a coil in your iPad that allows you to
charge these things wirelessly from 15
feet or more yeah that's pretty badass
but I just don't see it happening with
the new iPhone 8 at least not yet but it
will happen you're right about that
are there any current products that will
allow you to charge wirelessly from 15
feet away not nothing I know nothing I
mean the technology it's more about
getting a consistent signal
line-of-sight interference there's a lot
of things at him I mean look at Wi-Fi
okay how about this Wi-Fi is getting
better but you still need multiple nodes
you know like a wire a mesh network to
cover a house let alone let's talk about
charging the device yeah you know so we
some slow charging baby yeah slow roll
baby slow roll slow roll
all right next call
hi my name's Tony from Minnesota and you
guys were mentioning that the speaker
that Apple's gonna put out is too
expensive it's 350 I don't think it
matters what Apple prices any other
devices that Apple people will buy it
blindly it doesn't matter the quality it
doesn't matter the features it doesn't
matter the price none of that matters as
long as it has an Apple logo Apple users
will buy it I we said I swear we said
that like a couple weeks ago we're like
yeah I know it's 350 it's expensive
guess what people are still gonna buy it
but you can never underestimate the the
power of the Apple brand and its
ecosystem and its loyal followers yeah
it's probably not gonna sell like
gangbusters but people gonna buy it and
I want to hear what it sounds like
see I think I think it'll sell out I
think it'll sell out on its first run I
actually do okay cool I mean I don't
think they're gonna be able to make
enough I wish I wonder clap sound effect
for the Noster Tongass we'll find it but
i don't i think i actually think they'll
sell out on the first one because I
don't think they'll make enough units to
keep up with demand
okay okay which might make them look
more popular than they are right you
never know what the supply chain is like
but um I think it'll sell on the first
run and if I'm wrong you guys can refer
back to episode 93 and say no shut
honest you were wrong yes
EP 9 Trey okay and so that was a guy
saying they're gonna buy it no matter
what the price is yeah they'll buy it it
here's here's a guy saying he's outraged
by the price of something freedom from
California so I'm just calling in
regards to the iPhone 8 pricing I mean
there's been a lot of talk and people
have been saying that it's gonna cost
probably for teachers and something
around the 1200 range I mean that I mean
I just quickly wanted to kind of give my
talk
our discussion on it it just sounds
crazy and outrageous I mean seriously
even for Apple to price it almost the
price of a MacBook / MacBook Pro without
touch bar I mean that's just plain crazy
thanks bye seriously that's plane crash
real what do you think I have been
seeing a lot of reports that it's gonna
be over a thousand dollars and you know
some people are panicking I think people
are panicking cuz they realize they
haven't been paying like 800 900 dollars
for the phone already I I think the
people that are panicking like if you
total up whatever the cost of your phone
if you broke it down into like monthly
plans or whatnot you're still paying a
lot of money I mean the entry-level
phones start around like 650 bucks yeah
and when you bump it up with capacity
and then bigger screens you're getting
closer to a thousand bucks I like I said
the large screen iPhone 7 plus with
Mac's 128 gigs of storage is over or
just close to or a little over a
thousand dollars after tax so people are
already there yeah so if that
conditioned and look if that's the only
phone model that is the OLED iPhone
which it is I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna
be one of those people that buys that
phone cool and then what's the shelf
life from that phone gonna be for you if
you do spend over a thousand dollars is
it gonna be when you're gonna try to
hang on for two or three years no no
I'll get the next one after this into
play here you know does but I you know
what I just keep my stuff in like as
pristine condition as possible this is
my power tip for people that want to
resell theirs I buy Apple Caron all my
phones so then I actually if something's
wrong or there's a dent or ding I swap
it out right when the new ones come out
and then I pop it on eBay it's like
pristine still has Apple care coverage
for another year or so on top of that
and then I sell it and I get a good back
chunk of change back so nice that's a
good plan
it's a good plan not everyone copy me
because then I won't be able to sell
mine as easily
cool shirts that's all we got Brian
that's all right bro
sounds good um that's gonna do it for
this week so everyone thanks so much
again for being a part of the show
