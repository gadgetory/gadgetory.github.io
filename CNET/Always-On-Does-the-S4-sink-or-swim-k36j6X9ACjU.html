you know what though like this has been
really the best idea
maybe I'll just toss this going back to
shore yeah yeah I'm sure you can make it
to shore yeah no problem yeah here we go
oh by the way we should point out at
this juncture that this water is about
38 degrees moving at 677 cubic feet per
second what hand can't move so you have
to do it it's on bond for now hey hey
maybe we should do that again
catch then make it a shorter make it
sorry there this time you have to fish
today men work so cold
hey but who the fuck do I still work
doing stuff though once we get on the
Wi-Fi to call for help
this is like what are you doing it's
doesn't seem you have a problem no okay
you know what we're gonna put it in a
bag arise until the next test comes
around
okay time for a drop test from a rock
wall take it to the wall how appropriate
all right you guys are here to get us
suited up
so I have the phone securely tucked into
my sports bra where I feel certain

came on though
alright so I think we should see if we
couldn't hit the wall bounce it off the
wall like a little bit alright there's
no pretense at all at this point
oh that would definitely happen in real
life I hope that what you saw fly off
wasn't a piece of your wall that would
be oh yeah oh yeah something bad happens
oh yeah we have a crack on the inside
curl it against the wall you definitely
have internal crackage you can see that

continue to beat it up
