okay okay congratulations on winning yet
another award what did it feel like
standing up there let's stop here for a
while that's another award a game of the
year the game developers choice here in
the US it's it's really really very
meaningful because um it's you know
among the top developers well here and
among the votes from the development
community ah we are getting the game of
the year so this is special this is not
just another word and we are very very
honored and very humbled and actually
last night during the ceremony I'm not
like it might not be us actually for a
moment I thought yeah her story but
there were no do so yeah they didn't get
get that wrong last like it
game over it's a good only five I mean
you won you know we'll get to the sort
of game of the the GDC Awards a second
but you won Game of the Year a lot of
places during a year award was quite
hard to win game of the year I mean you
had a metal gear solid game you to fall
that game yeah you had rocket League
which a lot of people were very very
interested in that must make it feel
even better right it's great yeah it's
great I'm always at like being on that
stage is considering had you been on
that GDC stage before like not winning
anything I mean which one obviously not
and which its arm I don't remember I
think we're not even nominated hmm so
you've come a long way and definitely
that's that's actually what I said
during my speech that he in our case you
had to make three games we had to make
three games to two to get onto this dash
and I was I was thinking about the leap
between those the witcher 3 wild hunt
and specifically with the witcher witcha
to which is you what you've done
something which i don't think many
studios have managed to do which is you
had this very you know focused
role-playing game with a big fan base
around it but you were still known as
like oh they're like that cokie european
studio who kind of like makes like this
like really hardcore traditional Opie or
PG but in the space of okay that's
that's a good use point of view things
yeah but but that's actually you're very
right but look at your I mean your
market now at America's huge like you've
gone from dash it's number one market
and right for us it's for the percent or
even a little bit about forty percent of
our business but which I'm guessing that
wasn't with to write it definitely
wasn't bunt up it's also it is partly
due to the game and maybe the fact that
when released the pc version the
immersion curve what wasn't so smooth
and I still remember one of the really
saying when the editor who was a gamer
named playing games every day that he
died 50 times in the prologue so we
probably it'll be too difficult look
come on he should have played an easier
path guys better but the the the fact I
mean the sort of the main problem with
going massive in the US was the
could we r pc only right yeah so then it
is really tough it probably 15 years
earlier it would have been easier but
getting into retail getting the
appropriate budgets and i'm not talking
about gigantic marketing spending but
just just for people to notice the game
it is really tough because I mean you
guys sorry you guys might like it so you
might write about it but still then the
gamer is coming to the store yeah
predominantly on gamestop more going to
amazon or best buy and i don't see the
game it's somewhere on the shelf and
actually you know we're coming here for
years and i know it was probably one of
the most frustrating part on my job like
doing the store checks and going to
stories which are which are w okay it's
over here very bottom we should have
called it a Witcher it would have been a
bit better but some uni us especially
you need to go with with a proper budget
and then in order to have this budget
you have to go multi-platform right and
you know i mean the the pc gaming it's
it's great here but it's mostly digital
so to make the game visible and to go up
against the big guys so they don't know
but as the release is here you'll be
solved you have to be multi-platform and
I think that was the main problem with
the witch 22 in terms of visibility and
massiveness particular here are in the
US what was not really the case in
Europe I mean you went eventually got
witchetty on consoles as well yes but
then again it was a year gap so you
didn't have this sort of joint marketing
budget the factory which III was first
of all great game big game but I'm
coming at the same time all three
platforms so we could so really push it
out there and then you know you are
important game also if you look how how
the retailer's look at it there's like a
it's just a pc game yeah and then it's
automatically differently on it's a
multi-platform its is the big RPG and
then again supposed to yeah exactly
exactly people on the story tell people
about it yeah i mean now we're at the
stage where people you know presumably
before would have been like oh I want to
play a role playing game when they talk
about like Skyrim's and things like that
no you must go into a game stuff now and
people say oh have you heard of witcher
3 wild hunt yeah that's uh i think you
know the gamers do not realize it but it
really
it really takes a lot of effort to them
to to get to a situation to a position
where when you come to gamestop and say
hey can you recommend me a good RPG game
ends and they say that's the witcher
guys believe me it's it's not easy and
it's not cheap either yeah so but in
those like four or five years or however
long was you did end up turning what was
like those get like what you too is a
fantastic game and the people like I've
reviewed well and people who played a
really loved it but the Delta the gap
between that and where you are now is he
which I think I think you are you're
very right in what you're saying and and
then okay so one thing was making a
great game and that's always the first
and the utmost important thing like with
that but then getting it out there and
getting people to talk about it because
the perception for example of the retail
was hey let's look how well do which to
salt and compare it to Skyrim okay
that's a small cookie hardcore game from
from somewhere in Europe from Russia
Thank You Danny yeah that's from Russia
somewhere around Russia you're about
right by the way what is Russia I people
call me Scottish all the time okay oh
you're Scottish on st. Patrick's Day oh
I know that but that uh but seriously so
I'm sort of making sure that people
commit to it and they want to put it out
there in front of the store that that
was also that was also quite challenging
and and although we had I mean great
support from our partner year Warner
Brothers and and they have some muscle
that's also very important and again
it's probably not not the daily concern
of gamers but thanks to it we are able
to go wider and get more recognition and
visibility and then more gamers because
of that the game and power to a certain
extent because of that the game got even
more popular so it's like you know like
a domino effect yeah yeah it's it's it's
it's a domino effect so his legs were
you surprised about how successful the
was or how well-received it was yes
really yes I mean you can never plan
that you can never expect that and I
don't think you should because mmm if
you plan that something will be the best
game in the world and you will sell
all the most in the world I think you
have an ego problem and so we always try
to be humble as much as we can and
humble I I don't mean humble not talking
that our game is going to be great but
we don't want to make assumptions yes
will rule the world yeah and of course
it's great in our industry because you
show the bits and pieces so we took two
guys like you and without your critical
opinion and then we go to the to the
trade shows be read BD three games
government would not and these are the
sort of early le metrics was the hype
there did I like it I'm not sure if you
if you remember that every time I did
three we're handing you a questionnaire
and that's right your opinion we're
really analyzing all this all these
votes very careful in seeing like they
like this they don't like that maybe we
should tweak something we should change
something so it's a constant iteration
but then comes the day one and and
that's the moment of truth yeah and then
you saw was that like four million
copies in the first we saw so we sold
six million copies in the first six
weeks how much of that would do this
very particular question but do you know
how much of that was digital against
retail like it totally depends on the
territory in the US yeah and it depends
on the time of the of the I mean in
depends on on the on the precise moment
because initially especial out of the
core audience is getting digital here in
the US so outside in the US was was
probably initially sixty forty forty
percent being digital so huge yeah
digital went really well and from what
we heard from the first parties because
I mean pc mostly was digital obviously
here in the US are was that we are one
of the best cases and and I think when
when gamers planned approaches these
days they factor in a few things so if
they want to keep the game they want to
really own it and just play then trade
it back they go for digital yeah if they
think hey I'll just have some fun for a
moment I'll traded back I don't get some
money back they go for the for the
retail
so other people really wanted to honor
which I think it also shows how strong
the community is and I'm always very
grateful that yeah were you talking
about height before it definitely seemed
from at least our perspective that the
witcher 3 over the course of like a long
period like three years was kind of like
ramping wrapping wrapping wrapping and
then going up you kind of seem to have
the opposite problem with cyberpunk
right we're like you barely said
anything about it but people are like
are you suggesting a different curve
here but I people are like you've shown
what one trailer right like one really
good trailer yeah and I even feel like
when nice trailer was shown people
probably didn't register whose CD
Projekt work for is now somebody sees up
and say said that project I read and I
go I The Witcher 3 people the right now
even more right right now they see this
trailer from a tough totally different
angle just like yeah that's going to be
real so thing I you know honestly
speaking again I really want to be
humble so right now we have the success
of the witcher 3 people lava people
played it and and it's even more
responsibility and that's what we had we
had a conference last week talking about
our financial stuff and in our strategy
and other mothers key said that you know
its first of all I mean the fact that
which were performed so well allows us
to be even more ambitious with sabra
punk but right now it sits on our
shoulders to deliver here so yeah we
were the next time you will hear about
so everyone will show something and it
must be great yeah what do you
mean but like how can you say more
ambitious than which here I mean which
it was like a deca I was a hundred and
thirty hours when I finished so which of
which three was like a you know a tiny
deal see you know even your DLCs are big
it seems like know there are expansions
no oh yeah sorry sorry les the DLCs are
for free expansions would you pay for
yeah if everyone can follow suit that'll
be great I but what do you mean by
bigger like what do you mean well I'm no
no no no come on we have the staff here
we're not talking about cyber back I'm
not I'm not talking I'm not talking
bigger it's I think people really expect
something great and and that's what we
have to stand up to and and deliver so
that's so let's put a core gonna stop
here and let's continue our very
interesting conversation and last
question and it's not really okie danny
is a it's a studio excited about working
on cyberpunk yeah they definitely are
definitely big shift yes it must be
exciting it is super exciting it is
super exciting I don't forget you know
that we're working on it for quite some
time already so there's a lot of people
where you know maybe I don't know
drawing the the weapons or work in the
medieval environment for years and
suddenly you know guns and ammo yeah and
mutants and implants that's cool
excellent and you're excited about as
well I'm excited along excited a lot and
I'm just prepping my my Sarpong books
collection and and and i have i have a
solid plan of reading a lot of that like
especially my favorites are so filled k
dick right now i'm into the demand from
the high castle because of the of the
Amazon shells I I want to finish reading
it before I start watching video but
yeah then then it's the whole cyberpunk
all over again excellent and while we're
on the topic of putting corks in
conversations you also mentioned I guess
another project you might be working on
as well did we yeah apparently yeah and
then this project is a cork actually and
we have to put this cork where his place
is it are you releasing cuentas it's all
because you said it's in a new genre as
well ok the name of the project is
project cork so let's cork it here Danny
the ester things good it's really good
you're better that's to have them is
there how does it feel coming off this
like big game you worked on for four or
five years and then you're like because
you're an independent studio and you
know it's twas a 250 folks you have
working it Warsaw uh-oh on the left side
it's over 300 or in total the group is
almost 500 is there a worried when you
like say okay we've got you know
bloodwine still doesn't finish then
you've got like well bump presumably
it's I close enough and then cyberpunk
and then this other project is that is
that as big as you want to go because
like that seems like a lot I think um
as long as we feel we can we can unleash
our creativity and we have control over
it I think we're good yeah and you will
see when we've shot something so you
will be the judge have you had people
interested in like you guys have been
incredibly successful and you're almost
like very staunchly independent have you
had like people try and come in and like
yeah a queue of them yeah yeah the
lining up in front of those honestly
speaking what's that like that's normal
I mean you know it's funny I I remember
when we are in deep trouble it was
probably 2008 was to running the
distribution businesses there was a big
economical slow down we have a crisis in
European Union so we had to restructure
and at that time mmm we're talking to a
lot of possible investors really needed
some capital to to finish off which to
and then we structure our distribution
businesses and those really nobody did
want it to work with us we ultimately
ended up with some entering this the
stock exchange getting the funding and
you know maintaining our independence
but it was a hard lesson and I learned
there really well that people are
offering your money when you really do
need it all right and we really don't
need it on we don't want it we we will
never looking for for anybody from
outside to come and and enter ah the
company with with with funding because
we would have to give part of our
independence away and you know what
we're doing like for example we started
the discussion talking about going the
other key to retail and talking to them
yes so we're talking directly to
retailers of course you know we have a
distribution partners all around the
world but when we are hyping the game
we're talking about the game we want to
make sure that this is our energy this
is our message and before one on which
one when we had a publishing partner we
couldn't do that and it was so
frustrating and then what was delivered
to the market was not really truly ours
because I don't know we couldn't put
this in the box or do that with the ball
these are small things but they matter
and you remember probably the letter
yeah oh yeah yeah yes so sometimes
things like that you cannot imagine that
how hard it is to convince somebody else
out there who thinks that this later
doesn't make sense I'm not I don't want
to go into details here but we had
couple of discussions like that yeah so
on that that's also part of the
independence despite the fact that maybe
they'll think hey which are three is too
big just cut it in half and you'll make
more money yeah or like why you're
giving away 25 pieces of dlc free oh
yeah oh yeah that's perfect example come
on we can we can come up with a what a
nice axle and what do you want two
million dollars out of it I probably
because we could make it 10 in axial
problem yeah well what was caught on the
other side of that sort of transaction
now the dlc for the free DLC what was
the the onus behind it was was a good
will mostly yeah it was like respecting
your fan base and what's it like on the
other side of that transaction do you
think the people do you think it gave
more you know buying power to the
consumer to buy this game like they felt
like was a better deal or do you think
they they felt like they were taken care
of like is that something you do again
like then how do you I thought that it
was you respected me as a consumer is
what I felt and I don't feel that way a
lot thank you Dan thank you sir all
right yeah but it's you know some people
will not notice it rightfully feel like
you do some people will maybe not trade
their game back and some people don't
maybe talk to their friends and tell
them how cool it is when that that's all
it is yeah um and I think that's great I
had a I had a discussion mumph a month
ago maybe with one of the publishers I
have a good friend there and you know we
have lunch and they say wow margin it
was such a smart plan with this DLC see
I said hey but it wasn't a plan it was
only just I mean of course we had to
plan the production but we just wanted
to do this either it's a genuine move
and so
we think it's a cool standard we would
like other people to do it but a lot of
people started analyzing like also from
a more financial product if that didn't
make sense but if if they do something
like that and even the motivation is
that just like I don't know they'll put
another 2% of of additional sales in the
wreckage I'm good with that it's fine
yeah just I would like to see more more
more things like that happening I would
like to see it in other games as well
but if they do it if they do it for that
reason they're sort of missing the point
as well right because at the point
wasn't about finances but maybe don't
understand yeah one day and still gamers
will get some free DLCs and it would be
cool yeah it's kind of sad that that's
like what you did was something so
outside of what we used to write yeah
that's i remember i think it was it was
in your comment section and so release
the statement so saying that they're
free tlc's and one of the first comments
was one guy hey they must have ripped it
out from the game and right now they are
giving it for free just for the sake of
great PR and then i see some people
talking about it and then somebody said
man would why do you worry it's for free
yeah and this close the discussion but
was so beautiful so people are so
suspicious not because there are
suspicious by nature but because there
were so many different and strange and
maybe you know purely monetization
oriented tricks performed on them in the
past yeah that they are just hey
somebody's giving something for free it
smells it must be trick so no there was
no tricking I think we've proven that
way to do it you three the other thing
that I feel like a lot of big publishers
are doing at the moment as well as
trying to create big online games where
they suck people back in and again and
again and then use that as a funnel to
sell extra content I mean like destiny
is a pretty good example of that you
know but every game seems very Ubisoft
have basically put online connectivity
into every single game they make
regardless of whether or not it should
or not you guys don't deal in
haughton fire it seems like anyway is it
is that intentional is there any sort of
do you feel like you know we do not do
multiple projects we don't release very
often so yes we're definitely interested
in extending the the time gamers are
spending in in our games and what do we
do it with the online functionality or
not we'll see us right now we did it
with that and don't forget that ah is
that this is the third installment of
the series and this is the first time
you're doing expansions all right yeah
we haven't done before just because we
didn't have resources for that so we're
doing expansions our way and if one day
we'll do online will do online our way
it will be different do you think then
like looking forward into you know if
you're talking about cyberpunk and your
your other projects is this the kind of
the end for the witcher for a while and
like one spot in line is I definitely
definitely does that that's a closure
and you know I was asked about it before
they'll be with you for what not but I'm
policing yeah we are we love the world
with huge fans of sub-code skis writings
but yeah if something will happen maybe
somewhere down the line but we don't
have any anything planned obviously
speaking there is nothing we're working
on right now I think we need to rest we
spend the last word 14 years yes world
with of it but right now is the
cyberpunk time and and we have really to
put everything we've got and then some
yeah and deliver here it's a little bit
sad to say goodbye to get all to know I
was crying she's before the interview
with you just just a little but it's
like it's your it's your magnum opus
right it's like you're standing on the
GDC stage because okay okay so let's
let's bring an example hmm you're
watching your favorite TV series and so
they tell you that it will land and it's
ending and it's kaboom it's it's great
ending its really anything and you
understand that it's over and you accept
it and you have a closure and it's great
mmm so for me that's the preferred
scenario and in contrary you have the TV
series which goes on
ya know and it's like you know spaghetti
western going for 10 years and then at a
certain time you drop out and you don't
want to have anything to do with that
and I think we've seen it with some
games yes and Lee yeah yeah for I mean I
have any call of duties are we deepen or
Assassin's Creed you say the same thing
as well so you guys are like is that's
important to you too I guess have that
really good IP that the eye thing stay
strong even if you're not using it yes
of course and and so maybe maybe we'll
all come back maybe we'll tell some
different stories at some point but
right now really i think we with we've
promised cyberpunk a long time ago and
and right now is the time to do some
work here did you think which your fans
will play cyberpunk do you think Ida
fantasy so definitely I definitely hope
so yeah it's all about telling great
stories and delivering great experiences
yeah so I don't think people are like
I'm only into fantasy RPG see if there's
anything else I will never touch it
that's like wow there's the cool game I
mean a good balance yeah a good game
will get people to play like I remember
oblivion was a game that like there were
friends of mine you only play first
person shooters but because it was a
good game like they never touched like
that Toki and but like they were
also like you know people who place
currently probably don't play fallout
yeah right on that point actually last
week in your presentation you had a goal
that was that CD Projekt would be one of
the three biggest developers in the
world are you there I'm not sure how is
it how it was translated to English all
right I'll say that the one of the best
three best developers will be at all you
I don't want to use the scale because
it's meaningless what if we'll have a
head count of ten thousand and then we
sort of fulfill disco sorry yes I meant
best in quality not not in terms of size
do you think you're there I mean the
awards would say you're there at least
in 25 I I really think we have we have
something more to prove house has this
question before and we actually had
internally a discussion who would think
it's the role model for us and really
when I look what rockster right achieved
I'll out laughs asked to be there and
having the witcher franchise it's
definitely not enough to try that with
her so I think let's let's wait and see
for cyber punkin and then we'll judge I
did are you more or less stressed now
than you were like 10 years ago because
you've gone I got decent bit of success
and money in the bank and but you seem
to still be setting these high goals for
yourself like as a company hmm actually
you know the level of stress 10 years
ago which was was very different because
quite often we were fighting for
survival doing a lot of different things
and then you know like done mm-hmm
moving from the distribution business to
the game's development I think that's
where we want to be we know right now
exactly what we want to do we want to
develop amazing storytelling experiences
and great games and deliver them
directly to gamers so that's also juji
is part of it and I think the worse at
least for me it's when I struggled and I
wasn't sure what we should be doing so I
doing a lot of things and then you're
working this you know 14 hour days and
then you build something for a year or
two and then half of it falls apart and
then you restructure oh my god no no I
love the place where we are today and
well mmm well we are happy of course
there is there is a lot of I don't want
to call it stress I'll say maybe maybe
self-inflicted play pressure right now
but it but it's good that's that's what
motivates us and that's what will never
allow us to be lazy because I mean we
are reaching high since the very
beginning of the company and and and and
right now we just have proves like these
are words that you mentioned at the very
beginning of our conversation that ah
that we are on the right path mmm did
those awards me a lot to the team back
in Warsaw oh really you can't imagine
what was Lee's please factor in that we
don't we're coming from Poland is I
don't want to say i don't want to sound
it we have complexes or anything like
that but
in a way we have more to prove yeah
because we're coming from a country
where you know games development didn't
have such a history wouldn't have access
to all these tools resources so
everything we're doing had to always be
way more global and way more thought
through reality an American company and
American developer could release a game
and if it was successful in the u.s.
like yeah okay they're done and maybe
you know five years down the line on the
next game or or the third game in a row
they would do some European
localizations to this strange languages
and I want I don't want to say that's
the general thinking but I've seen a lot
of cases like that but but the size of
the market was automatically mmm making
it easier for you to success just
locally for pollen we would have never
succeeded with which are one just in
Poland so initially from the very
beginning we said okay we want our games
to be played all around the world and it
was easier for us for you in Europe and
then us came with the success in you
guys came really commercial success with
the witcher 3 so we're really happy with
that and then like this makes people
proud and yesterday so he could towards
the game of the year and the best
technical the technology and one of our
guys actually one of the key programmer
is huge he was uh picking it up and he's
he said like she I couldn't believe I
will be better than dice I don't yeah
this is the this is real yeah
people say our attack is better of
course it's it's it's an award you
cannot compare it these are different
things but but that's that's very very
personal yeah and all these awards are
very personal especially after four or
five years I'm probably I'm probably
doing that that is not needed in this
equation is I didn't know of the game
you just got to sit back and do business
relations yeah just let all that is some
jokes about her story yeah until look
confused in the back a shot at the game
awards yet I am so speaking about your
competitors are everything everyone else
is out there if there was like another
franchise that you
of to do to like to make to like take
over production on like only by somebody
else or defunct what would it be I think
and we had a lot of these discussions
but I think we have just enough nor
plate right now and so in a world that
cyberpunk doesn't exist and the Wichita
no no I'll not answer it it's what we do
requires a hundred percent or actually
two hundred percent commitment so we are
not into buying and owning I piece just
for the for the sake of buying and
owning them we actually were approached
by a lot of people with really cool I
piece that we love to make a game but we
said hey if we do something we have to
have full creative control so we have to
own the IP but again for the sake of
full creative control yeah um so
cyberpunk was was a choice from the
heart and I think also it was good karma
because we just had a great opportunity
to acquire the rights but so I think
we'll stop here for a while yeah do you
think this will be like The Witcher
another 14 years you want to build up
grandeur yes exactly and you know i'll
give you the exact these dates Oh 77 78
79 I mean I might be wrong by quarter or
two but is it is that a scary
proposition though to like take on
something and then be like okay like
you're clearly your your methodology the
mentality you guys have is like we're
going to do this properly we're
going to take it seriously yeah we're
going to do something big and it's a new
IP so this new IP you need to get at the
gate yeah and we're committed I'm going
to commit it so we'll take as much time
as needed and we want to make huge
that's so that that's that there is more
than what's on our mind and you know I I
I do business i do in international
development I talk to media I took to
gamers some hour or hour phase in many
many conversations and I represent the
company so of course
I had like hey this let's maybe acquire
this or dad and we start discussing and
and we all come to the same conclusion
that if we invest into something and I'm
talking about investing our time are we
have to focus because we cannot do it
right if will do even two or three
things at the same time it's just not
possible and and its really regardless
of how many people you have on board
it's a mentality it's a mentality a
little bit look like a drugstore white
right why there isn't a game every
single year yeah there is a reason for
that so you can have a different model
beat I don't know the FIFA motorola call
of duty assassin's creed model yeah but
I don't think it's our model yeah and
what how is it you're able to do that
whereas companies like Ubisoft or
Activision counts like what is it about
your presumably you have shareholders
that also wants to make sure you guys
are turning a profit what is it about
that that you know you guys aren't
beholden to that is it just your
mentality we're crazy yeah and we openly
tell our investors in um I'm you if you
have seen our our our mm conference hmm
we took up a lot about values about
philosophy and there is a reason for
that and end of and the fact that we are
quality obsessed and and it just we just
want to send a very clear message to our
investors that is not a short-term thing
it's not like hey expect amazing results
every single quarter and crazy growth we
think that if we concentrate and focus
and work really hard for for a longer
period of time the effects will be there
for them because they're also very
important for us ah but it's not hit and
run this is not like hey I'll making one
hundred percent upside in just two years
no you might not you might even lose
some money but if you if you believe in
what we believe in we shall if we show
the same believe in the same values you
will get a great return of your
investment we have proven that with the
witcher 3 so it is a very different
thinking to the usual I'll see stock
market thinking but I think it's right
so we know that some investors will
never invest in us and
so and some investors will leave are we
okay with that yeah and you're a pretty
strong position there presumably as well
coming off the back of that I hope so
what was your favorite part of Waltons
cuz you were kind of like I like you
said you weren't developing it you're
obviously like getting builds of it as
it was getting made but when you finally
sat down and played it what was your
nose on your favorite part I mean I I
actually I actually did all the question
marks in every one of them yeah I mean
prob I have a couple left in salyga but
I'll out say everything about valent
which is the bloody baron and bottling
yeah but but actually so maybe I'll put
it differently um what I love about rpgs
are re sup quests and and and the
freedom of exploration and one of my
favorite games is obviously fallout 1
and 2 i love them i played him a lot and
even recently I started playing fallout
1 for a moment keep a fallen for you
know going forward one I have it I have
it on my list but hmm good did this is
the one difficulty I have that it is a
gigantic time commitment and I know that
if I start I won't be able to stop and
yeah what is it about people making
games to take 200 hours to complete
nowadays asshole actually actually
actually you're you're laughing but I
have three kids and right and then I
travel like crazy doing all the stuff
for the company so I really have to play
my gaming session right and sometimes
you know if I'm able to play a couple
hours a week it's a lot so in order to
finish which 3 and finish it with all
the question marks andand all the
southwest I did it to my wife that i'll
go for summer holidays with the family
and from 7pm to whatever am time I can
play and and actually this one I
finished which I really yeah when did
you finish it during the summer ok ty
through so yeah yeah I what have you
been playing that since then ah it fits
into those little pockets of ties news i
spend some time with darkest dungeon and
I like this kind of I don't want to say
old school because it's not all school
but it's it's like a true to the bone
RPG experience I may be a little bit to
punishing for me yeah to my life yeah so
that's been playing some fire emblem I
just I just got the new one and yeah
yeah about your 50s you said yeah I was
my 50s because it's not that I burned
through them little quick but when I'm
annoyed with it um I'm a guy I'm not a
collector yeah but people are always
laughing that on my desk at work I have
nothing because I other sell things I
throw them away ah or I give them away i
don't like to have to no good
distributors yeah it's an even say so
what did the S is if it was gathering
dust because I didn't have anything to
play yeah I was asking my friend to sell
it on eBay so he solved three or four of
them and I just got the fit because your
fire emblem is up perfect yeah that so
I'm wondering but when he will be
selling this way once personally I'm
losing a lot of money on each of them
probably like eighty percent fair fight
I did you play any of the other
competitors last year them you didn't
play fallout 4 you said did you babe
metal gear solid rocket League I I'm not
into the sporty games at all and so the
last Metal Gear Solid was on the
Gamecube over when snakes you buy yeah
really yes yes that's the one I wasn't
even made by kajiminda the next one yeah
then the next one I have my lease is
definitely fallout 4 but again it's like
The Witcher factor it's it's it's a bit
spooky it's like who 100 hours yeah
margin do you have this time is Gary
yeah definitely what I'm interested in
the most in games like you know
personally as a gamer it's it's I did
RPG experience or the storytelling or I
yuly both sometimes even more
storytelling so I and the perfect model
for me in terms of timing was the
tell-tale model right okay I really
enjoyed the walking that's the wolf
among us and I'm looking forward to the
next one I still haven't played they
meet
on miniseries right the reviews are like
you know makes so wincing see ya
excellent thank you so much marcin thank

Tusk app gave President Obama copy of
witchetty the collectors edition and
actually when they called us means your
foreign affairs was trying to calling
and the reception thought it was a joke
so they actually contacted one of the
big big newspapers that we were working
with in Poland and asked him to get in
touch with us yeah and we still that is
it was a job but we gave them a version
and then you know on the TV in the
evening but but you know but it said
that that's an old story but then before
right before a 3-1 we showed the which
would be for the first time was probably
a week Obama was in Poland right so that
was his second visit after the first one

say and then so he's standing with prime
minister to scan his stunning his dog
