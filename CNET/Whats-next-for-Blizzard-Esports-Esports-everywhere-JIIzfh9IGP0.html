blizzard gates
overwatch heroes of the storm World of
Warcraft but what you might not be aware
of is Blizzcon is coming and there are
five different eSports competitions
happening there so to talk about that
and what eSports plans Blizzard has in
the future we have Adam Rosen the senior
business operations manager at Blizzard
for eSports hello hi nice to be here
with you I'm so excited to talk to you
but I have to admit I have no idea what
your job title means so you have to
explain a little bit about what a senior
business operations manager does for
eSports sure so the way that we think
about the eSports team at Blizzard is we
have the product team which is
responsible for making these awesome
leagues and really epic live events and
then we have the business side which is
everything beyond that looking cross
franchise between all of our different
games looking at incubating new projects
looking at ways to build our business
way to grow what we're doing and that
other side that business side is me as I
mentioned Blizzcon is coming up really
soon and there are some pretty big
eSports initiatives now at Blizzcon it's
not just a convention where you come to
play Blizzard games can you talk a
little bit about what exactly is going
on at Blizzcon yeah absolutely so this
year at Blizzcon we'll have five of our
eSports titles represented in some way
we have the world Warcraft arena
Championships which is the top
Wow players from around the world coming
to compete in PvP we have the overwatch
World Cup we have the hearthstone
Invitational we have the HTC Global
Finals for heroes of the storm and we
also have heroes well overwatch
Starcraft WCS global finalists
epaulettes con as well
amazing so one of the games that you
mentioned obviously overwatch huge game
lots of fan support and there is now a
blizzard arena that just opened up next
door to our building actually and I'd
love to hear a little bit more about the
plans for Blizzard arena after Blizzcon
is over because that's obviously a
continuation of your eSports plans yeah
absolutely so one of the things that we
did when looking back over the last year
is we took a look at all of this amazing
content we were creating look at all of
these leagues and said how do we create
an oz
experience for our fancy around one of
the things that we've seen that we've
done well in the past is at events like
Blizzcon where we have 30,000 people
coming together provide this opportunity
to fans to not only interact with our
leagues but also to interact with each
other and we thought there was a great
opportunity to create something where
fans didn't have to wait till Blizzcon
they could come and have that experience
year-round so we opened bliss Blizzard
arena which is over 50,000 square feet
just right next door here in Burbank and
what we'll be doing there is essentially
looking to create the next generation of
eSports content we have a facility where
we will be kicking off shows for all of
our eSports games so earlier this month
we had overwatch contenders there we the
hearthstone HCT summer championships and
just this week we have opening week for
blitz con with heroes of the storm and
with world of warcraft
so after Blizzcon what are we looking
towards we're looking towards overwatch
league we'll be launching the preseason
in December and then we will be having
the regular season starting in January
where all of those matches will be
taking place in Blizzard arena so with
overwatch League I actually am a little
bit confused about the difference
between overwatch League and overwatch
World Cup so is this going to be
something like these two different
things coexist with each other or is it
something where you feel like Blizzard
might merge them in the future
so we see overwatch League in the future
being the premier competition for
overwatch the best of the best players
from around the entire world come
together and compete and they show off
the highest level competition in the
whole world we see World Cup also being
a really interesting part of the
ecosystem where with overwatch World Cup
you get to see your favorite players but
participating in competing against each
other representing not their traditional
teams but representing countries with
other people that are from the same
country as them so we see it as a really
interesting opportunity for fans to root
for their players in the new way and
then I think in general the way that we
think about eSports is for us when we
look at eSports having that top-level
professional league is really important
but it's also really important to have
all of these other elements below that
right so when we look at country versus
country or we look at semi-professional
or we look at collegiate all of these
are really great opportunities for
players to participate but also
fans to engage with the games in
different ways so we might see say a
player from the Los Angeles valiant and
somebody else from Boston playing on the
same overwatch World Cup team at
Blizzcon one year you know one of the
most interesting things for us this
World Cup is that opportunity to see
these matchups that you maybe don't
traditionally see you could see players
who come from the same team
traditionally on opposite sides and
knowing each other strategies and
strengths and weaknesses or you could
see those two players that you always
wish could play on the same team but
never could coming together and seeing
if they dominate that's really cool I am
looking forward to watching that and
then what is something that you wish
more people knew about eSports at
Blizzard one of the most interesting
things about eSports to me especially
for new viewers who maybe you're looking
in at eSports for the first time and
don't really understand it yet is that
there's so much depth there when we look
at traditional sports we see all of
these things that make it great it's the
storytelling it's the history behind the
players it's these rivalries
it's the fierce preparation that goes
into all of these matches and we see the
exact same thing with eSports but more
we see these players who are coming
together on teams they're practicing you
know full-time practice regimes they
have team houses they have coaches
they've nutritionists they're studying
they're analyzing their opponents and
all of this culminates in this top level
competition so I think one of the
interesting things that new viewers
might think it's so cool you're just
getting gamers together and they play
but it's not that at all it's actually
the best of the best coming together and
these at Blizzcon this year we have
players who've been training all year
who are finally coming together and get
to put all of that training to the
ultimate test it's interesting that
there are some like sort of common
misconceptions about it being gamers all
kind of being toss together everybody's
kind of casually playing and now they're
gonna play at this high level but it
really is kind of a full-time job for a
lot of these a lot of these guys and
girls so one of the things that I think
is really interesting is like you were
mentioning about sort of this idea of
what eSports is one of the things that
Blizzard kind of has on lock is
appealing to gamers of all age ranges
right so you have hearthstone for
somebody who maybe is not a shooter fan
you have World of Warcraft which
kind of a legacy at this point of its
own and then you also have new things
like overwatch and heroes of the storm
so how does Blizzard as a company plan
to appeal eSports wise to both younger
gamers who maybe haven't grown up with
some of the titles that that Blizzard is
most famous for and then also older
gamers who maybe say well I don't I like
gaming but eSports isn't really my thing
yeah it's a good question and it's
something that we think about a lot it's
interesting because each of our games
for example at Blizzcon this year we
have five eSports titles and each of
them bring something a little bit
different and a little bit new right
when you sit down to watch hearthstone
it's obviously a card game where you
have players who are going head-to-head
against each other with decks they've
crafted and it's very strategic and
something like that is very different
from say heroes of the storm which is
all fast-paced it's action it's teamwork
it's communication its strategy so
depending on what a person is interested
in we think there's a game and an eSport
for everyone speaking of heroes of the
storm everybody I should mention full
disclosure my brother works on heroes of
the storm at Blizzard however getting
any information or beneficial anything
from him is like squeezing blood from a
stone it's impossible and really not
worth anybody's time so thanks Chad
great job all right so next question one
of the things that I think is really
interesting and I'd love to hear how
Blizzard sort of handling this is we're
seeing games like World of Warcraft and
Starcraft 2 sort of take a little bit
more of a backseat compared to overwatch
hearthstone heroes of the storm these
games that are sort of newer that have a
lot of groundswell in the way of fan
interest how do you balance all of these
different titles that have their own fan
bases that obviously especially with
World of Warcraft and Star have to have
been around for years at this point how
do you balance all of these things as
they sort of you know kind of come up
and then and then back down yeah it's a
good question one of the things that we
look at a lot for each of our eSports is
not necessarily creating something that
works as an East bar and
and copying and pasting that for you to
the different games each of the
different games that we we have these
leagues for we try to customize for what
works for the game what works for the
player is what works for the fanbase so
something like Starcraft like you
mentioned has been around for 20 years
right it's the original eSport in Korea
and I think something that makes it
really special is this longevity it's
the history it's stories of these
legends who've been playing sometimes
home for 10 years coming and really
trying to see if they can continue their
legacy so what we do when balancing
these is really just looking at what is
best for each league what's best for
each game and trying to be true to the
game at the end of the day so where do
you see blizzards role in eSports in
five years I know here in the States
we've kind of had a little bit more of a
slower sort of build-up to this
explosion of eSports that we're now kind
of seeing the beginnings of I know a lot
of people who are really into gaming
feel like eSports is here it's huge it's
a big deal in my life but maybe not to
everybody in the country like say South
Korea eSports is not quite at the level
of you know rock stardom that these
players in other countries might
experience so where do you guys see
Blizzard in the way of eSports in in
five years where we see Blizzard we see
eSports as a whole as being a really
fundamental part of culture so if we're
looking five years out from now what I
expect is that we should be able to look
out on the world and whenever we talk
about sports and we talk about
competition eSports is in that
conversation in the same way that soccer
and baseball and football are when we
talk about sports Starcraft and
overwatch and hearthstone should be
right there as a part of that so five
years out eSports is a fundamental part
of culture and Blizzard is driving that
forward so on on the eve of Blizzcon
2017 I have to ask the obligatory
Blizzard fan question which is can you
tell me anything secret that the
company's gonna announce simple is gone
yeah absolutely so I actually brought
the script for Opening Ceremony so
perfect well just read that right after
totally finals wrap up this video right
oh yeah we'll check it out guys that was
our interview with Adam Rosen thank you

talking about eSports and Blizzard

coverage on our social media channels

seanut and please feel free to let me
know what your favorite Blizzcon eSport
is in the comments I guess
