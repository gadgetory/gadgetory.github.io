one of the most interesting parts of the
evolving smart home bringing home
security options to people who felt
priced out before one of your newest
options is corner the off corner really
is is a system that will keep track of
motion at your doors and windows
they aren't motion sensors they're
actually accelerometers packed into
these triangular tabs you'll stick them
up on the corner of your doors and
windows when things open they'll catch
that movement and sound the alarm the
siren comes from this kind of odd shaped
base station you'll plug this into the
back of your router and plug it into
power
it'll communicate with all the tags and
when it senses motion when the system is
armed will ring out the siren you'll use
the corner app to arm and disarm your
system and also keep tabs on things I
wish they had some sort of accessory on
your keychain or a keypad on the wall
something else you could use to arm and
disarm if you come and go for now you're
forced to use your phone one problem
though these don't keep track of when
the door is open or closed like a
regular contact sensor they only track
when the door itself is moving that
means that you can't open the app to see
what's open to what's closed and also
because it's an accelerometer if you
open that door very slowly you can sneak
by even when it's armed corner costs $98
for a three tag setup and you can add
additional tags as needed it does have a
yearly fee you get the first year for
free but from then on it'll be 40 bucks
a year that's only a couple dollars a
month but still not as good a value
maybe as a totally fee free options like
eye smart alarm that kit might cost more
up front but down the line you'll save
money by not paying those fees for more
