google issues for everything google we
can pack inside of a show and we start
off with the latest samsung galaxy
rumors now on leaks and you switch have
worked together to bring us the latest
renderings of what's believed to be the
next Galaxy Note based on leaked CAD
blueprints the rendered image shows off
interesting things first of all the note
looks like it will be switching to a USB
type-c connection if this is true that
would also mean a new gear VR headset
because the current one supports micro
USB now the renders show a curved screen
like the galaxy s7 and the dimensions
are slightly narrower but thicker in
size compared to the current note 5 now
these renders have two extra sensors on
the front as well and the rumors of
Samsung bringing its iris scanning
technology to this phone could finally
be realized the note has been a phone
where new features come out first and
then they're brought to the regular
galaxy line but we'll have to wait and
see also a Korean report claims that the
note won't be called the note 6 instead
it will make a jump to the note 7 to
catch up to the rest of its phone line
and make it simpler for consumers to
understand the product line the rumored
launch date is August the 15th and we'll
make sure to note you of any updates all
right Samsung just announced two new
products in New York as well including
the gear fit too it's the successor to
the fit it still runs a vertical display
but this time with the Tizen OS there's
four gigs of storage for music with
three to four days of battery life it
has an optical heart rate sensor built
in GPS it's waterproof and will be
available June tenth for $179 but the
standout goes to the gear icon X
Samsung's first wireless earbuds
bluetooth headphones that carry four
gigs of storage for music controls rests
on the surface of the earbuds with a
battery life of three and a half hours
but only one and a half if you're
streaming music the icon X earbuds will
be available sometime in the third
quarter of the year it also might not
have the biggest market share but
Samsung's rugged galaxy s7 active will
be available from AT&amp;amp;T here in the US on
June tenth as well is basically an s7
with a super rugged body and stronger
that's water shatter and dust resistant
with a beefier battery as well Evan
blast revealed that the Lenovo fab to
pro will be that first project tango
device featuring a 6.4 inch screen and
quad HD display the official
announcement is coming out lenovo tech
world on jun 9th and google continues to
be at the forefront of artificial
intelligence and it's constantly
evolving the team at google deepmind
will continue to see how much better it
can be see deepmind created the Alpha go
program which recently beat 33 year old
professional go champion li SE taal 4
games to 1 it's next up to take on 18
year old champion Kesha who beats it all
himself and after that world go
domination but do not worry google has
assured us that a scary smart AI is
still decades and decades away so I feel
much better all right that's going to do
it for this week you can email us at
Google licious at cnet com or tweet me
