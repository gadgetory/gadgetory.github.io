good morning and welcome everybody to
the 359 podcast it's episode 4:45
my name is BVG and before we get started
with the show today we want to wish an
eternal happy birthday to the
ever-present American sci-fi and horror
author HP Lovecraft 129 years young
today forever in our hearts Cthulhu
forever and always welcome we have got
done bed bugs Rubin and Roger Chang your
hose hey I'm happy Monday we've got a
great show for you we're gonna be
talking about a couple stories from
Friday do a little bit of review
obviously we don't have our show and
then but one plus coming to t-mobile the
scoop from CNET and we've got this guy
from this guy
we've got Amazon reportedly making a PVR
we'll break down why they would want to
do this I'm still not really sure but
I'm the lastly a look at our in-depth
profile on the new Microsoft as always
if you have any questions leave them in
the comments section Brian we pick out
the best and we will get to them in
three minutes and 59 seconds stick
around y'all we'll see you back in the
chat and three - welcome to the 359 I'm
Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox Ruben one plus
fans can rejoice t-mobile will be the
first US carrier to officially sell the
one plus 60 when it comes out in October
its first reported by CNET well done me
by yob truly but this is this is a huge
deal for oneplus they you know they've
made a lot of progress selling phones
online and kind of building up an Asian
cult following but this really gives
them a chance to push themselves into
mainstream awareness have they had a
major carrier partner in the past or is
this really one of the first ones you've
had carrier partners around the world
not in the u.s. though so this is the
very first u.s. carrier partnership okay
and how significant is this phone is
this they're like big flagship of the
year
what's the one to buy if you're a one
plus one plus tends to sell two flagship
phones a year one of them in one of the
beginning and one at the end this is
sort of the second flagship you know
they had the six earlier this year this
is a 60 that's sort of the name of
convention
and yeah it's I mean it's it's their
flagship phone and the the six was very
well reviewed so I imagine the 60 will
will similarly you know have a lot of
the bells and whistles that people are
looking for nice so what does this mean
for t-mobile is this a good thing for
them is this so I've seen like carrier
kind of exclusivity partnerships in the
past like for instance like sprinted one
with essential yeah I don't know that it
was really that successful for either
one of those companies do you think that
this would be more impressive or
significant for the likes of t-mobile
yeah I would say this definitely has
more of a shot associating the essential
we came out of nowhere there was no real
you know history or track record there
Sprint obviously the fourth largest
nation carrier has been struggling so
that was a poor match I would say
oneplus has a fairly devoted following
already they've got and there you know
Android enthusiasts sort of know the
name even if it's not in stores
t-mobile's demographic slant pretty well
with one pluses fanbase and really this
is a phone that is optimized for
t-mobile's network and that's the
important thing because you could use
one plus phones for t-mobile previously
but you couldn't get access to their
fastest networks
that's a spectrum and so t-mobile is in
the middle of upgrading their network
now with new bandwidth new spectrum
that's supposed to be better and faster
coverage this new one +60 will
presumably people to tap into it and I'm
guessing if you are a big one plus fan
but not a t-mobile customer you can
still buy this online right so by the
global allowed phone it only works on 18
t if it doesn't work if you don't 101 of
those ones all right so Amazon is
reportedly making a DVR reportedly play
but well I wouldn't be surprised I
wouldn't be surprised so they Amazon has
really been focusing a lot on streaming
services they've been followed they've
been selling the fire TV streamers for a
long time and now they're really trying
to push more into live TV because it
seems surprising to a lot of folks that
are cord cutters or cord Nevers
but people still watch a lot of live TV
so it would make sense to provide a DVR
what's interesting about this report is
that apparently it's going to be like a
standalone DVR that would connect to
your fire TV so like I guess that's good
if you already own
fire TV but if you're somebody like me
that would have to buy both of them yeah
I kind of feel like why don't you just
package them together so would be my
question to wait to see it's it's still
it's still a rumor story so who knows if
this is actually going to hit the market
or not but it wouldn't it doesn't really
surprise me that they would work on this
they're really trying to like dominate
the living room and take over Home
Entertainment and we're hearing rumors
of an event later this year for new
echoes do you think it will come out
that soon or is this further right it's
possible it's definitely possible that
they would do something like that I mean
like September and October tend to be
like those like launch times Amazon's
done events in the previous two years so
maybe we'll see it fairly soon I'm not
really sure all right lastly check out
our in-depth profile on the new
Microsoft our own ensure and Connie
Guglielmo our boss got a chance to sit
down with CEO Satya Nadella to talk
about how the company is transformed
over the last few years I definitely
recommend it it's a good read it's a
great video that goes with it for more
of those stories check us out and see it
I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox ribbon
thanks for listening thanks for joining
us for the recording of the audio
podcast everybody now I'm gonna jump
into the chat and pull out all of your
great questions and comments
I'm definitely myself interested in this
new DVR program that Amazon is
developing I'd like to see what kind of
hardware they can implement onto that we
have no hints on that already do we guys
you're talking about how it's likely
gonna be workable if you already have a
device maybe but there's nothing
confirmed
I like that in the article they have
already nicknamed it and it's called
Frank that's right that's a weird name I
don't know I don't know where they come
up with their names like sometimes it's
like somebody's dog or whatever they
just come up with like goofy goofy name
so but yeah it's I don't know it I had
to remind Roger that TiVo still existed
or not I don't really
I do have live access to live TV via a
directory week now subscription like I
barely even watched that like most the
time I'm watching Netflix a prime video
so yeah like the idea of a DVR I'm like
yeah that thing I watch live TV when
it's football season so it would be a
very specific use case for me where I'm
sorry for using the word use case but it
would like I would use it if I'm like
away at something on Sunday and I have
to like catch the game later and
anything I may do that I can't have I
can't record it like I can't ignore the
outside world likewise if I know the
score yes if I know how it ends I don't
want to watch anymore
I agree by its if you look at the broad
portfolio of what Amazon's been
providing also like the fire TV cube for
instance does a lot more with live TV
where you can tell Alexa to like change
the channel via voice so they're they're
kind of like moving into that space
already because it's an area that they
hadn't really been providing a lot of
features for right and in that in that
regard that's why it doesn't really
surprise me that they would be working
on something like this it doesn't seem
like it's out of left field or anything
right it is a little curious that they
would opt to do this as a standalone
device like it just yeah does it I feel
like it's a feature for a you know a
set-top box not like its own thing I
agree which is why I would say like wait
and see and well you know this was still
like the initial story and as we get
closer to perhaps something and perhaps
Frank launching then maybe we'll get
some more indications about what exactly
this they keep the codename that would
be my friend Frank
oh that's like Frank Costanza just lost
his job like that's really novel about
in a chat let's get it going hashtag
fire Frank on Twitter all right so let's
take questions and comments now first up
from Shawn Vega Velez very excited for
t-mobile and oneplus news now we can see
in per more than one person making big
decisions in general the comments
section is excited that oneplus and
t-mobile have been partnering up to give
the big carriers and the big boys the
the
and the iPhones a run for the money
sudeer also says it's time for oneplus
to replace the big ones step by step I
mean yes to a certain extent but oneplus
is an Android phone so like Google's
still benefit so in many ways from
oneplus is I would say it's time to the
pixel phone that's that successful I
would say it's Samsung if you're talking
on Android phones like Samsung's really
the one that you know I guess
potentially could stand to lose
something I mean they they make the
super premium phones with all the
high-end specs oneplus phones have a lot
of those same specs they don't have all
the bells and whistles like that they're
not water-resistant but they use the
same high end processor usually packin
with lots of RAM a gorgeous display
there are a lot of features there that
are fairly comparable for a price as I
reported right now it's tentatively set
at $550 and you know that that still
could change given the you know
negotiations are still going on with
t-mobile but do they realize that all
the phones are selling for $1000 now
what's the matter with them that's the
thing like if you're offering a phone
with like a lot of the same high-end
specs but it's $550 as opposed to $1,000
that's that's gonna turn some heads yeah
right yeah and oneplus obviously as you
said has you know kind of like a
background and in phones unlike
essential so people are gonna trust
those phones if they've been regular
cost yeah they've built up their
reputation over the last several years
he started with the idea these flash
sales then those initial phones were
like they're only sold online for like I
don't know like a few minutes and you
had to get an invite like it was really
hard to get I was early I remember
that's what made those phones kind of
like interesting and sexy like our
colleague Juan had it yeah years ago
when I bumped into him in Barcelona I
was like oh you have a 1 plus where did
you get it that's amazing so I guess now
you can get it at any old t-mobile store
but really be able to so but but like
kind of like that thread I think
continues where they've been able to
keep people following so yeah yeah yeah
so the essential struggle because it it
did have the backing of any room it was
a huge name
and in google is a father of android but
like there wasn't really a track working
with his phone it was also fairly pricey
at the time relative to now it's not
that wasn't $1000 but it was like $700
or something so it was expensive for a
brand that we weren't really familiar
with it comfortable with oneplus stuff
we has a track record at least yeah that
goes to show you how hard it can be to
really break into phones so yeah you
know one place managed to do it so let's
talk more about t-mobile from Joseph
Gauss do either of you guys have
t-mobile or do we know anybody here who
does have t-mobile at the office I know
somebody does I just can't I have a team
you have t-mobile phone okay so Joseph
GAO's question for you Roger
do you experience longer range on the
LTE band 12 on t-mobile and experience
better in the building penetration in
buildings here in New York on the LTE
brand thank you hey that's nice no one
ever says thank you enough well it's
it's hard to tell what one is working
well or not and which you know obviously
which spectrum that we're getting I
would say over the last two years or so
since I've been on t-mobile the the in
building coverage has been better but it
does vary market by market and
dramatically and so I know they spent a
lot of time focusing on improving
coverage in New York and that's why
you've seen more in building coverage
and just generally the speeds are a lot
higher now but they're still areas are
struggling I I commute in from Long
Island my trip through on the Long
Island Rail Road coverage is pretty
spotty but that's also in the case for
Verizon phone as well yeah spot as it
covers they are spotty so there are
still places where struggles obviously
the the 600 the 600 megahertz spectrum
that they're deploying now my phone
doesn't have access to it if you have an
iPhone you don't have access to it but I
know if you've got a gs-9 if you got an
LG g7 those phones are compatible and
you do see a lot of coverage benefits in
building and just a better capacity
great answer coming up next from Jacob
Lombardo do you think there may be some
intervention from the government from
one plus actually can
cleaning the deal with t-mobile this
administration hasn't really allowed for
a lot of overseas companies to go into
the u.s. that's a good point to be
brought up that's a very very good
question I would say well there'd be
interest well no I think there are there
are less issues because oneplus is owned
by a company bkk that also owns these
other phone brands pop own vevo I've
never seen any red flags come up from
that company Huawei and ZTE have had
sort of a long-standing reputation for
concern in the u.s. in regards to like
how closely associated they are with the
Chinese government to the point where
some of the leaders were former military
and so that there was a lot of concern
about those companies I've never heard
of anything with bkk or with these
specific divisions and really oneplus is
a fairly small brand it's it's you if
there were no no Huawei is at this point
I believe now they the number one number
two phone brand in the world so it's
massive oneplus is still relatively
small it gets most of its business out
in China and so I can't imagine that US
government's gonna waste too much time I
feel like it's gonna fly under the radar
in terms of regulatory scrutiny at least
for now
maybe even becomes this huge behemoth in
the market folks will start looking at
them a little more closely but one pulse
is still really small next up from our
old buddy Michael Brown is it safe to
say that oneplus has sold more phones
than the Google pixel ooh
that's a good question great question
all of those numbers sitting in front of
you at all times guys I am disappointed
I've seen some third-party information
that it's like in the US it seems that
and correct me if I'm wrong here the
iPhone and and you know Samsung Android
phones tend to split the market in the
US and then Google pixel gets a small
you know kind of band of that like a
very a very small sliver of it's super
hard to say I would say you know the
fact that the pixel is sold through
Verizon probably gives it the advantage
if you're talking about like lifetime
sales and I would say maybe one plus
might have an edge just because it sold
more phones there are there this is the
whatever fifth or sixth generation of
oneplus phones where we've only had two
generations of pixel phones but if
you're talking about just like from a
unit to unit basis I would say probably
the pixel does look better just by
virtue of the fact that it is sold
through Verizon and having the nation's
largest carrier backing your phone
definitely gives you a leg up right I
think it's safe to say though that
they're both relatively small compared
to I phone samsung yeah yeah just kind
of the fact of the matter yeah
from Danny Green I don't know if we can
really answer this one yet since we
don't have it in our pockets but this
would be a good request for a good
compare/contrast episode coming up how
does a 1 plus 60 compare to the Samsung
Note 9 we should put those side-by-side
well when we actually see them they're
not out yet know that I know only one of
them has a stylus right where is it
those nine is the one with the stylus
the oneplus 60 it's it's sort of I feel
like it's probably more comparable to a
galaxy s 9 like the note 9 is like sort
of like way up there in terms of like
specs in terms of battery it's got sort
of the latest and greatest although all
the bells and whistles you'd expect from
a smartphone so it may not be a fair
comparison but I generally like the
oneplus ones because they're experiences
up a cleaner a little bit less bloatware
involved we'll see if there's bloatware
once there's like a t-mobile version all
right so I'll find a way they'll find a
way yeah it's too early to really answer
this still from Andre but do we have any
of the specs for the 60 and do we have
any launch date now it's still too early
I just I was told October there are some
details of her the phone but I haven't
been able to confirm them all so I don't
really want to share them right now but
I mean I think there's gonna be a notch
just like the six I'm not there this
will definitely have a notch
alright I'm no longer a fan this is I'm
out I've gotten used to my my iPhone 10
notch okay
I think this notch is smaller so there's
that I
so let's kick these questions in the
back of our heads when we finally do get
the oneplus 60
what's the specs on the camera have they
made significant improvements since the
one plus six and will they finally get
wireless charging es wants to know if
they're gonna do Cheeta
is a chi or ki I keep forgetting it's
Chi Chi is there gonna be cheap charging
so let's be on the lookout for those
when they come through yeah from Josh
boy doesn't the oneplus only produce a
limited amount of phones and will this
change when they're bundled up with
t-mobile I imagine it will change you're
right they typically do sort of limited
run of these phones it's not that
limited I mean that imagines over a
million and that's totally a gas I'm not
too sure what the numbers are but
imagine for t-mobile they'll have
obviously a dedicated stock remember
they're building they have to build a
phone specifically tuned to t-mobile's
network so they'll have a good stretch
there a good sort of inventory of phones
specifically for t-mobile customers at
t-mobile stores from oh go ahead sorry
are those phones gonna be different than
the ones you buy online then yes like
you're gonna okay I got so there's a
global unlocked phone that kind of runs
across all networks and there's gonna be
one that's specifically tuned to
t-mobile's network gotcha
next up from Michael Brown again why are
smart phones expected to be cheaper than
computers aren't smartphones technically
more capable I think it's really just
our brains our lizard brains are kind of
locked into it's smaller it should cost
less although although you know nowadays
it's like you don't you pay for premium
for things to be smaller yeah that's a
good point so I would say like that's
going away right the idea of that we're
paying a thousand to twelve hundred
dollars for a phone that's the same
price as a laptop now more than most
laptops we're kind of getting past that
point where we're expecting phones to be
cheaper right like there are folks who
spend a ton of money on phones almost
every year so yeah my problem with that
you're you're right but I think that
there's a bit of a disconnect that the
phone makers have been able to
successfully trick us into thinking that
because usually people end up replacing
their phones a lot faster than they
replace their laptops yeah granted they
do get all
more where you're with them all day all
of that but like I have a MacBook Pro at
home from like 10 years ago right
I spent $1300 on it then and that still
feels like a lot of money right so I
don't know I I kind of feel like those
are those prices and we've talked about
this on the podcast before those prices
do feel pretty steep and it's
unfortunate the Mac prices are the phone
price and it's almost as if like if
they've already broken through this
level if like $1200 like okay yeah did
that I don't know so that's that's hard
for me to deal with but whatever I just
look at it sort of a logical perspective
like how much time do I spend on my
phone which is my computer and it's kind
of a toss-up but I mean I like pretty
much live on like my phone right so yeah
so in that in that regard maybe it's
justified it just feels like a lot of
money it's painful yeah I mean it's
something we all have to think about and
that we all have to continue to
additionally pay extra period premiums
to expand on that lovely notch there we
go
that's a shout out for you Sony iPod I'm
not a fan of the notch either did not
remain to see your turn the mining art
yeah yeah I guess so yeah I mean it's
something I like the notch I just got
Rogers just complacent he's just that
did the notch is an instability just
apathetic it's the same thing with ear
pods ear pods are everywhere in New York
City yeah there's just like and people
are very used to them and we made fun of
them we do call them cute God was a meme
for a while Scott our own Scott Stein
became a meme because no longer how
ridiculous now he looks like he was that
he's on the band guard of the the new
trend yes a notch equals premium phone
now
yeah you can't make a good phone without
it having a knotch I don't sir Samsung
yeah let's take a question from faoud
from how is the note 9 so much better
when taking into consideration the price
difference when the improvements are and
he's using air quotes negligible I don't
think what you were talking about
earlier said it's necessarily better
it's just that it's solely gonna sell
more because of its business well I mean
it is better Lloyd I guess it depends on
the perspective you're looking at it
from like if it depends on what phone
you own right now
you're upgrading from like a note 5 or
whatever then that is a huge upgrade for
you if you're if your phone is 2 or 3
years older or 3 years old that note 9
is gonna be a huge upgrade but yeah
there are other there definitely other
more cost-effective alternatives out
there it may not get you everything you
know four thousand milliamp hour battery
or stylus but it will look at the job
done it won't have to cost a thousand
bucks so that's why that's why it's
important we see phones like the oneplus
gonna come out there and and be a viable
option so you don't have to spend a
thousand dollars on the phone yeah and
we'll see what the consumer demand is
gonna be for the note 9 so it's a
thousand bucks
starting right right and the Galaxy S 9
kind of had like lackluster sales
whereas the iPhone 10 seemed to be doing
reasonably well
so we'll see it's still very early and
we'll see how the note 9 actually sells
if it doesn't sell well after the Galaxy
S 9 you might expect next year it's
Samsung might start lowering its prices
either those other prices or at least
offering more kind of breakthrough
innovations because to your point I will
say like yeah that the upgrades of this
phone from the previous year or the s9
are fairly moderate and a little
disappointing it's perfectly frank so
yeah but you're the I guess they're
trying to target folks who aren't
necessarily upgrading every year you
think that's maybe the better strategy
these days I know a lot of people are
just kind of married into this context
like newer better all the time I myself
like I I'm never in a rush but then
again I'm not you guys I'm not the tech
team I'm not the tech culture
necessarily I'm the button pusher you're
getting you're getting to different
types of customers so I I'm speaking for
you for a second here but I feel like
Roger does you you buy a new phone
almost every year yeah yeah whereas I
had an iPhone 6 for like three three and
a half years I kept that thing chugging
a quarter I am probably closer to you
than they are to me because that's not
really sustainable have yeah but like so
I have an iPhone 8 for work and
admittedly I don't really see a market
friends between that and my iPhone 6
maybe it's a little bit faster but
that's the problem is is that the trip
makers claim that they're like this this
is the fastest processor we've ever made
it's got more dude engine probably true
but you just don't feel it it's that's
an official term right in the keynote
look at all the due date exactly so
there's a graph chart there's a doodad
count it's caught up to like 10,000 now
yeah but even even then I I phone sales
continue to do really well so like I can
complain all I want but like people are
still buying the iPhone 8 even though it
looks it looks the same as the iPhones I
think people are starting to veer
towards iPhone 10 though because they
are looking to buy something different
which is exactly why in September in a
couple weeks we're gonna see basically
all of them are gonna look like I phone
tons we're gonna see three phones
they're gonna look like I front at least
it'll all be named iPhone 10 is super
good I hope one of them is named Frank
let's hope one of them's named Frank
it's a heartbreaking day because there's
so many great questions still flowing in
from Shaun from Caesar but we got him
move on because we're just about out of
time and I need an excuse to do this so
we're gonna talk about the Amazon Frank
danger is if the Amazon DVR does come to
life ahead and it has over-the-air
tuners will they make the tuners
upgradeable to the new ATSC 3.0 is super
specific question that I do I can tell
you that I understood one of the words
in that question so well look it I mean
this is so rumored so we have no idea
what the details on yeah and the feature
sets to the in that regard the feature
sites are still very up in the air so
that's that is a very hard question it's
a great question though yeah I love
seeing bench struggle with it
kudos to you one more from Philip Vaughn
does the Amazon DVR work offline to
watch your saved shows I'm trying to
remember from the report apparently you
are able to watch on your phone so you
can do like your watch on the go you use
the diva that's streaming though right
that's not you would stream it well you
would put it in the DVR it would have
storage and then you would be able to
loud is that what you're talking about I
think so I believe there could be a DVR
cloud feature to it we allow the live TV
server
have that built in now right so is it is
it gonna be that much better I don't
know it's it's they're gonna have to
find something to make it more useful
for people especially if it's gonna be a
standalone thing and you know trying to
convince people that our TiVo customers
like oh yeah you should use this instead
now is this truly a step forward cuz
Huey AG points out isn't the DVR a life
limited product as everything is
trending towards on-demand even for
traditional programs like sports and
news and et cetera
yeah that's why some people might find
it surprising that they would work on
something like this that being said I
think Amazon is just trying to have a
comprehensive portfolio where they're
trying to do living room entertainment
however you do it and there is going to
be a segment of the population that is
going to stay with cable they're gonna
stay with live TV for the foreseeable
future so there's no reason why Amazon
shouldn't try to find ways to capture
those customers get them into their
ecosystem and then once you do that you
sell them more echo devices get them to
be prime customers it's all those
monkeys shopping exactly so if this is a
way to get you to buy that first Amazon
device then they that is exactly what
they're gonna do so everybody out there
once again in the chat get that hashtag
running hashtag fire Frank apologies to
anybody out there named Frank whose job
