iPad I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update Apple isn't the only company
showing off new gadgets this week Nokia
unveiled new lumia windows phones and a
tablet the same day as apple's
announcement so tough break for nokia
but the company's first tablet will be
the Lumia 2520 and it's a colorful
10-inch tablet that runs the later
version of Windows 8 it's called Windows
RT it just means you can only download
programs from the Windows Store now
that'll be out sometime later in the
year and it looks like it'll be a strong
competitor to the microsoft surface
tablet especially when you factor in the
extra keyboard accessory it costs 150
dollars and includes a touch trackpad
mouse and it serves as a backup battery
with an extra five hours of juice Nokia
also has a new line of extra-large 6
inch smartphones starting with the Nokia
Lumia 1520 that will be coming to AT&amp;amp;T
and it's the first Windows Phone with a
quad-core CPU and it's got a 1080p HD
display along with a 20 megapixel camera
Nokia also has a scaled-back version
that will be a little cheaper it's the
Lumia 1320 you tend to find that these
extra large phones are more popular in
other countries outside the US Nokia
says is for someone who may not want
both a tablet and a smartphone and
instead just invest in one big foam but
I have a feeling you'll want to get a
bluetooth headset instead of holding
this up to your ear after weeks of
delays the blackberry messenger app has
finally arrived on iOS and Android only
to keep you waiting more than 10 million
people have downloaded bbm on the first
day but when you open it you have to
enter in your email to be put on a
waiting list to use it messaging apps
are popular these days and blackberry
could see a big user base if they ever
get around to letting people use their
app right before the holiday shopping
season begins amazon has increased the
minimum spending amount to get free
shipping from $25 now to $35 of course
it's just another reason to get people
to
sign up for the eighty dollar a year
amazon prime subscription which provides
free two-day shipping on most items and
it also throws in free movieson prime
instant video which is like their
netflix and several other perks are also
available for kindle owners it's also
worth noting that t-mobile is selling
ipads for the first time this year and
it's charging no money down for the 16
gig model of the iPad air a customer can
pay about twenty six dollars a month for
two years to pay it off t-mobile also is
offering 200 megabytes of data for free
every month that's your tech news update
