too eurogamer.net is reporting details
about Nintendo's next major game console
the Nintendo NX the site says the NX
will actually be a portable handheld
console with its own display the
handheld portion would dock into another
device to connect it to your television
the report says the NX will have two
detachable controller sections those
controller parts would be on the left
and right side of the screen the NX will
be powered by an nvidia tegra processor
which in layman's terms is pretty dang
powerful the report says nintendo will
not opt use Google's Android operating
system as rumors have said instead
Nintendo will create its own operating
system to run the thing Eurogamer says
the NX will have a simple marketing
message you can take your games on the
go this would remedy a big problem
Nintendo had with its last console the
Wii U some people did not understand
that the wii u was a different console
from the original we also the NX would
use game cartridges and not discs if
you're expecting backwards compatibility
as in running your wii u games on the NX
the report has some bad news for you
there are no plans for backwards
compatibility cue the sad trombone is
any of this true I can't vouch for the
track record of eurogamer.net however
this old man remembers Nintendo creating
something similar in the past anybody
else remember the micro vs system it was
a clamshell portable gaming device with
two wired controllers and it was pretty
awesome anyway Nintendo officially said
that the NX is coming in March 2017 we
should know everything by then amaya's
akhtar and you can keep up with the
hottest tech news at cnet com / update</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
