we're taking a look at the bun velocity
brew VT now this coffee maker may look
basic but it is anything but it costs
one hundred and seventy nine dollars
which is pretty expensive but what it
does do is brew an incredibly tasty pot
of coffee in just three and a half
minutes it also keeps the coffee hot for
a very long time if it's thermal carafe
and what I really like about it is that
when you pour it really pours very
accurately almost like a little like
laser pointer directly into your coffee
cups pretty slick so how does the Bunn
velocity brew actually brew coffee so
quickly first of all it pre heats the
water it's kind of like a inverse
backwards coffee machine it pre heats
the water to 200 degrees Fahrenheit in
this water tray here and another way
that it delivers coffee to the coffee
grounds really quickly is it uses a
special spout that shoots the water at
high velocity to ensure proper mixing
and an even coffee extraction there are
some things that aren't so hot about
this coffee machine first off it uses
its own Bunn special filters which you
have to go look for specifically and you
may not be able to find them at your
local grocer another thing that's not so
great is it has a very plasticky look up
top it feels kind of flimsy and it's not
exactly high-end for this price point
and if you're looking for some really
high-tech sophisticated controls or
displays you're not going to get it with
this thing it is so bare-bones it
essentially just has one switch on here
that keeps it on all the time as a
matter of fact the way you actually brew
this thing is by opening up the lid and
putting it back down again and that
initiates the brew cycle so in a
nutshell the Bunn velocity brew is a
very good coffee machine it brews fast
it brews very good coffee and it keeps
it hot for a very long time the only
thing is if you want something really
fancy that grinds its own beans or has
very nice aesthetics this is not the
machine
want you're probably gonna have to go
with something from techno forum or
Bonavita but essentially this is a very
reliable very dependable machine and we
love it pretty much across the board
