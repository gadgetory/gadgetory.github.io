yet and the company even thinks that you
could use this thing instead of a laptop
but it's not true with me is my
colleague Andy hello Andy hello and Andy
has been using the iPad pro as his main
computer for a week and he's going to
share his thoughts so this is a twelve
point nine inch tablet it's absolutely
massive firstly tell me Andy having used
it how does the size impact productivity
it just makes everything a lot easier
you've got so much more screen real
estate to see web pages look much better
and they're big working on text
documents just writing word processing
such a basic task but it's made much
better by having a big screen and of
course when you can now use two apps
side by side having that bigger screen
makes that so much easier to do so let's
talk about the keyboard and the stylus
or as Apple calls it the pencil now
something I think everyone is going to
be keen to know is are these two
accessories actually useful or are they
just a gimmick they are really useful I
mean we've had third-party keyboards to
work with Apple's iPad air before now
but because it's smaller they're not
full size keyboards this one is and it's
super comfortable to type on so actually
you can really work on long emails and
long documents I've written 2,000 word
articles on this thing perfectly
comfortably I couldn't do that before
of course the pencil is really accurate
so if you're working on photo editing
for example or sketching you can do that
really easily with this are there any
times where it's really let you down and
you've had to put aside the iPad pro and
go back to a different computer yes so
it doesn't support RAW files so for my
photography that's an issue switch back
to my MacBook Pro and it doesn't play
that well with some Google accounts when
you're using them on corporate networks
which we do all the time so syncing
calendars and emails can be a bit tricky
and of course much of the screen size
helps some things when you're doing a
lot of heavy multitasking if you're
doing a lot of work you need a lot of
windows open at once different tabs in
finder for example which you can get on
the MacBook it's still not quite as easy
so if I'm doing heavy work I will still
switch back big question is could you
buy this instead of a laptop yes I would
tell you absolutely can but you should
actually think carefully about what it
is you actually
want to do from it if you need USB pods
people give you files here's the new
document work on this please you're
going to have to use Dropbox or things
like that but of course no USB port but
you can work well on this thing the
keyboard is great it's got so much power
and that big screen does make most
office ass you would ever want to do
super easy and of course the end of the
day you still haven't got a tablet for
entertainment and that's great it does
of both things you want so that's what
Andy thinks about the iPad pro but what
are your thoughts on Apple's gigantic
tablet let us know what you think and
stay tuned to see Netcom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
