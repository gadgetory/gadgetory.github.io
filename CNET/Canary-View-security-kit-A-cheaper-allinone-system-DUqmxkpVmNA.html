2018 taking a look at an all new product
by startup Canary this is the $99 canary
view the reason why this is so exciting
is because canary introduced an
all-in-one home security system
previously that looks just like this one
it was a lot more expensive but now
you're getting basically the same thing
for a lot less money just 99 bucks which
is much much less than I've ever seen
for any other all-in-one home security
system basically you get 1080p HD live
streaming night-vision 2-way talk a 147
degrees diagonal field of view and also
upcoming integration with both the
Amazon echo spot and the Amazon echo
show so you can actually just pull up
the live feed of whatever this puppy is
looking at on your phone so it's
integrated app also has all of the same
stuff you can do the live feed you can
get alerts to motion or whatever else is
happening in and around different parts
of your house canary also ditched the
ethernet cable with this model just
making it Wi-Fi only and this one will
also have free person alerts which means
if it sees a person it won't tell you
who it sees but it will say that it sees
a person versus just generic motion the
canary view is available now for
purchase on Canaries online store and
will be making its way to major
retailers both here and overseas in the
future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
