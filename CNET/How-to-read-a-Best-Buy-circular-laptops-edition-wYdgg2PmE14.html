these guys that's right just a retail
sales circular from your favorite
electronics store it's really one of the
main reasons you might want to go pick
up a Sunday newspaper these days instead
it's just reading it online I would like
to get these and see what's new what's
on sale at different stores best minds
one of the more common ones are going to
find it i like that they have a lot of
desktops and laptops and not just that
but TVs and digital cameras and all
kinds of other technology when i'm
looking through the flyer I sometimes
find it hard to figure out exactly what
they're advertising or what the actual
product is they're trying to sell
because i always like to comparison shop
and see where you have the best price on
things so let's take a laptop as an
example here and i'm going to show you
how to read a best buy ad I'll take this
one right here it's a dell laptop it's
see a nice picture of it that's okay I
see the price but I can't really tell
what the exact laptop is there's simply
not going out of their way to tell me
about that I'll give you a little hint
here even though they don't list the
model number very prominently if you
look down here at the very bottom of the
fine print there's a string of letters
and numbers in parentheses that's
actually the model number you see here
it says I 15 RN and some numbers now you
can either Google that little string
there and maybe get a hit and maybe you
won't sometimes stores like best buy get
their own specific model numbers even
though it's basically the same laptop
you can get anywhere else or you can
know that the i-15 r is actually the
down inspiron 15r laptop that we
reviewed and you can go look that up and
see if you can get similar specs for the
same price or less either direct from
dell or from somewhere else now it tells
me what the processor is intel core i5
but it doesn't tell me the actual four
digit extension on that processor so i
can't really do an exact comparison shop
unless i guess i go into the store and
try to find out in person there's some
other odd stuff here in the description
says for we processing that sounds
really fancy that's really just a
dual-core hypothetic processor that's
nothing special there they must have
just needed to fill some space here in
the description there's also a bunch of
little boxes down here that purport to
tell you details about this
tells just got a 15.6 inch screen okay I
can see that it says up to seven hours
and 26 minutes of battery life that
definitely sounds impressive of course
if you follow the little footnote on
here tells you how they tested it the
test that we run here is actually quite
different and on the left inspiron 15r
that we tested the battery life we got
was much much shorter so always take
these numbers with a grain of salt now
it also says right here that it's a
little blue boxes WI di and it not
really asks any explanation there but
that means intel widi or wireless
display that means this laptop can
hypothetically send its signal to your
TV wirelessly which is very cool but
they don't mention that you're going to
need sold separately a netgear box
that's using around ninety nine dollars
in order to do that so that's just some
of the stuff we found in one of these
laptop ads if you go through all of them
you'll find similar things like hidden
model numbers nonspecific CPUs but if
you read carefully and you understand
what to look for you can usually figure
out enough to at least decide if you
want to go to the store and see this
laptop in person I'm Danny Eckerman and
that's some tips for how to read a best
buy ad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
