occasionally frustrating we've all had a
language barrier when we travel and when
it's not easily overcome you could be in
trouble but a company called Waverly
labs may have an answer with its pilot
translation earpiece here's how it works
first fit these two earpieces in your
ears
download the company's app on your phone
and have your friend do the same then
when you speak into your phone
Waverly software will translate it into
text on your friend's phone and read out
what you said into the other earpieces
when again get that ego with us when the
Lord no no no when you have arrived in
Barcelona yes that one look them up I
get up until when you stay in Barcelona
all you need is Bluetooth in a data
connection all I can say so far is Wow
for basic conversation and getting the
context of what someone else is saying
it worked well when I tried it it's a
promising product and I could see a lot
of use cases for it though the pilot is
still in a prototype phase the company
will start shipping devices this summer
after an initial shipment to people that
supported Waverly's in a go-go campaign
the earpieces will sell for $299 they'll
still support five languages to start
English French Spanish Italian and
Portuguese
with more coming soon
