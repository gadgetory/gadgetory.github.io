samsung 840 Evo sociate drive now I
assume evo is for evolution so let's see
what this dry evolves from Sam to have
made a few songs to drive in the past
and of course I have all of them here
this one right here is the samsung for
70 series it came out three years ago so
it's kind of old next up we have the
samsung 830 series this one came out in
2011 and is very fast in fact still want
the fast dry on the market but it's very
expensive to make things a little bit
cheaper samsung released the samsung 840
series here last year now this drive
here is very affordable but it's a
little bit slow in fact samsung also
release the 840 pro at the same time
that is faster but there again very
expensive that brings us to the 0 new
samsung evo here now this drive come by
fast performance and low pricing and
there's one more thing it's a very first
on a market that offer up to one
terabyte of storage space and that means
from now on you cannot say that solicit
drive are limited in capacity anymore
now this drive here is a standard 2.5
inch internal drive and it support the
latest sata3 cyclic a bit per second the
dry is very thin only seven millimeter
thick it basically decided to work in Oh
application where standard hard drive
and solid-state drive are being used
right now and that means it makes a
great replacement drive and you do want
to use it to replace whatever dry it
using right now for three reasons the
first being the performance in my
testing this is the fast drive ever seen
offering some 250 megabytes per second
in sustained speed both writing and
reading at the same time that's very
impressive but it can be even faster
that's because it comes with a software
called Samsung rejection the software
now offer a rapid mode when turd on this
mode would use the
purus system memory as cash to further
boost the drives performance and it
really did work in my testing the drive
now offer some 378 megabyte per second
in the same test it's amazing really now
the second reason why you should use it
to replace the drive you have because it
comes with a very advanced cloning
software called Samsung data migration
to this software allows you to replace
the existing drive with this one without
having to reinstall anything also solar
capacity of the drive comes with a
desktop or laptop kids these two kids
collectively offer a few more
accessories including this drive
converter bay right here and I used to
be tripping out to SATA connector and a
spacer to add more thickness to the
drive a SATA cable and enough screw for
you to play with and finally the last
reason why should get this ebow here
because well you can that's right the
dry is also the most affordable on the
market costing well less than one dollar
per gigabyte for example the one
terabyte version cultures six hundred
and fifty dollars or 65 cents per
gigabyte the drives also available in
four other capacity including 750
gigabyte 500 gigabyte 250 and 120
gigabyte card less accordingly for more
on the EVO here check out my full review
SF calm and by the way when i said that
these are all the SSDs samsung has ever
made well i meant it that's because if
there are others i don't know though and
that's mean they don't exist so if you
happen to be wondering if you exist
right now make sure that you do by
following me on twitter facebook or
google+ that's a bonus I'll make your
life more interesting that's because I'm
don't go and this has been the first
look at the 840 evo SSD from Samsung
