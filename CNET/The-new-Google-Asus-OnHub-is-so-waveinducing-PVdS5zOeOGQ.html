made by a soos now this one here is all
exactly the same as a previous unhoppy
made by tp-link which I have right here
well almost because while they're
different if you take the first on top
put it upside down we kind of have the
second one now Carter because the new
one here has one new feature that
doesn't exist in the first one it's
called life control basically it has the
proximity sensor right here so you can
wave like this and direct the Wi-Fi
signal let's try it here we go is your
Wi-Fi better there now no this handing a
both hand better no well maybe because
it doesn't really work in my testing
there's no indication that wave control
work in terms of performance as well as
there any feedback at all but let's say
that if it did work what you actually
stand off of your couch
what with the router over there and wave
at it you know we have a remote control
now and we also have a control with this
router which is the mobile apps on the
phone you can eat that apps to customize
the router setup and also make one or
two of the connected client the priority
so why wait now other than that this new
router here has almost nothing new
compared with the previous one you still
have just one LAN port on the back here
you supposedly have a few cool features
such as support for Bluetooth and some
other wireless standard but they are not
yet activated for now now on the back
here there is that USB port that doesn't
do anything for now and when you say it
up you also make this cool sound the
router always and I mean always connect
to a Google account wait to work now in
testing it did indeed offer a bit of bad
performance compared with the previous
onhub but not in that really to justify
the extra cost of $20 and at $220 this
is the most expensive AC 1900 on the
market you can get a different router
from Asus or other companies that offer
a lot more
and cost a lot less from on this one
here check out my full review a cnet.com
basically by the previous our hub this
new unhappier is a good but very
expensive brand that is only fun for
like five minutes after that you likely
couldn't get more satisfaction from
waving at stranger on the street they
always way back at me and that's because
I don't know this has been the first
look at the Google Asus hub router</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
