but there's more going on here than that
let's drive the 2014 Lexus ct200h
with the F Sport package quite different
than a Prius and check the tech ok what
is a CT it is definitely a sporty er
cousin of the Prius there's no getting
around that but it's a very different
car as you can see both outside and in
if you're having a hard time wrapping
your head around exactly where the CT
fits don't feel bad it was originally
aimed at the European market still is
that's where a hatchback of these
proportions makes more sense to people
on the outside spot the current one
pretty easily by the fact that they now
have the family spindle grill they used
to have this more suburban face on these
things didn't do it any favors and
because we have an F Sport it also has a
mesh panel on that grille also look for
a blackout roof it's a dead giveaway
hotter Seventeen's on all four corners
and more aggressive chin and rump bumper
it's a pretty good-looking car to be
honest they finally got it dialed in I
think now inside this Lexus CT cabin you
get some of the best ergonomics out
there everything Falls to your hand
exactly as it should this is the first
car I ever talked about that had every
angle on the dash and console actually
naturally matching the way your wrist
wants to move what a thoughtful idea if
you head into navigation you're going to
see that things haven't changed much for
Lexus that's pretty standard traffic
though is via HD radio so you'll get
your traffic whether you have an active
satellite radio account or not which is
nice under your Lexus app suite you've
got inform which is like Toyota Entune
what does that include if you're new to
this it's Bing for search but the search
results are oriented toward locations
I heart radios Clear Channel stations
here's your movie tickets calm open
table Yelp Facebook Places you're never
going to use that and Pandora you're
going to use that perhaps the most
useful thing in this Lexus enform app
suite is Bing because it's a Swiss Army
knife you can search for just about
anything let's try it with voice CBS
Interactive and then once I get my
result I can either say or click on what
I want and I can either call or then say
take me there
connectivity in this car is through your
phone and it's data plan not a dedicated
onboard internet radio but do you see
how many clicks I had to go through I
had to do a list refine a list say take
me there say take me there again ah now
right about now after we've been playing
with this interface a bit hopefully
you've noticed the thing that
distinguishes it and also drives me nuts
that little floating marshmallow icon
and this controller that drives it the
Lexus remote touch controller I've been
kind of on the fence on this one for a
while and I've now decided I simply
don't like it
it's a haptic touch kind of a sliding
Mouse apparatus the problem is this
doesn't make any sense while you're
driving it's too touchy you overshoot
and undershoot all the time so you're
constantly fiddling with it it's not a
touchscreen so you can't default that
way you do have voice we'll look into in
a minute the other big failing on this
thing is that they used to have a back
button right over here under your right
thumb in the early editions of this and
they got rid of it why I want back to be
quick simple and easy to use instead
I've got to always go up here and
navigate to the back arrow and start
that if I should have to play a video
game every time I want to go back now in
terms of your audio choices radio still
holds primarily radio choices although
it's odd because all you have to do is
go up here to source and you'll see all
of your media choices why isn't that
your main menu why still break it up
into radio and media it just makes no
sense am an FM with HD radio XM Sirius
by the way if you're an HD radio fan
know that it's only available when you
get the navigation package CD player we
still have optical discs in this guy
here's my ipod interface it's a well
laid out iPod interface as it is for
most media but again this damn
controller gets in the way note that for
each of your media sources you've got a
separate set of tone settings I like
that so you can buy us one different
than another because most sources have a
very different baseline tone this is
good now I've got an iPod Touch hooked
up which we use for our demo purposes
but if you hook up your iPhone 4s and
above you'll get Siri eyes free which
will also respond to this voice button
but take you into Siri and operate those
functions on your phone instead go into
reverse and you've got your backup
camera which is pretty good it's got
trajectory and distance markings there
nothing fancy beyond that no particular
different views and there are no other
cams on this car if you don't option nav
or at least what they call display on
the back-up camera gets relegated to a
small part of the rear view mirror not
great it's also got a curious lack of
most driver assistance we'll talk about
that when we get on the road
your shifters this odd-looking
upside-down golf putter looking thing
and alongside that is a separate button
for Park this is a little bit of
nonsense I don't think it's necessary
but it distinguishes the car but I don't
need to have park a separate interface
from the gear changes that to me is just
not worthwhile this controller over here
is your drive mode controller dead on as
normal or push to go back to normal go
counterclockwise you go into an eco mode
it dials back throttle response crank it
to the right you get to a sport mode now
you're going to hold shifts longer and
also tighten up the ratio on the
electric power steering or hit the e V
mode button right here and that's going
to encourage the car to run on pure
electric with no combustion as often as
possible
which isn't that often as well find out
up front we have Toyota hybrid synergy
drive rebranded Lexus hybrid drive at
the same basic technology a 1.8 liter
atkinson cycle that's a lean burn inline
4 sitting sidesaddle driving front
wheels only in this car it accounts for
98 horsepower there's an electric motor
a 60 kilowatt electric motor bonded to
it that has another 80 horsepower but
you can't just add those up in hybrid
math doesn't work that way instead total
horses 134 hmm kind of tepid so you
might say uh electric motor plenty of
torque well Twitter does not quote a
total torque number on this vehicle so I
can't really tell you I can't tell you
this 0 to 64 this mere 3,100 pound car
is a pokey 9.8 seconds so clearly the
numbers are not very healthy here's
where it is healthy mpg EPA rated at 43
city 40 highway and as we're gonna find
in my experience that ain't no lie
let's get this out of the way right off
the bat this cars got less zero to 60 in
nearly ten seconds is not a typo there's
just nothing under the pedal partly
because I believe it's been tuned to be
obviously efficient we'll talk about
that in a minute but partly because this
CVT is rubber band II real elastic and
seems to have no bite need some grit
thrown inside the thing so it makes for
a very non responsive driving experience
unfortunately the payoff of course is
the mpg I drove this car for three days
primarily on twisty up-and-down mountain
roads and I couldn't get it below thirty
eight miles per gallon it really
delivers but just like I told you I'm
craving a back button on this controller
I'm also craving some way to shift it
there is really no way no paddles no
shifter of any gear ratio type about all
you can do is pop this little lever here
into the B mode the brake mode which
does additional regenerative braking
that gives you kind of a sort of a layer
of permanent downshift but it's not the
same as having shift ability or fake
shift points once you build that into
your expectations driving the C T is
actually quite pleasant there's good
room in here even though I'm six-two
that doesn't feel cramped at all and
we've also got just a great layout of
this cabin not just the ergonomics I
showed you before but just the whole
quality of it and complete difference
from a Prius this car has got a very
different feel part of that of course is
our F sport suspension which tightens
things up underneath I wouldn't say it's
harsh that's a good thing because Alexis
can't be what is harsh is that constant
meandering wandering engine note of a
lean burn for which isn't pretty and
meandering all the time because hooked
up to that rubbery slippery CVT as I
mentioned driver assistance is kind of
sparse you have adaptive cruise control
and a forward collision warning and pre
collision technology but nothing in the
area of blind spot tech Lane Departure
or self parking it's not what you have
here is a hybrid with far more sporty
pretensions and to some degree execution
than a Prius but which
be nice to have a powertrain
responsiveness that remotely matches the
suspension upgrades and the pretty hot
look inside and out okay let's do a CT
seen that style start off about thirty
three grand for this car delivered and
then just go all the way and spend sixty
four hundred dollars for the full
package of f-sport
technology and premium trim another
thousand dollars on sporty-er sway bars
and lowering springs why not that's the
cars mission is to be a sporty or Prius
and now you're just about forty thousand
dollars all in some are going to swallow
hard at that price for a car that does
zero to sixty in nearly ten seconds but
the CT turns out to be more than the sum
of its parts
undeniably enjoyable as compact upscale
urban transportation that delivers
serious MPG in the real world and calf
and tech that is better than most but
also more frustrating than many</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
