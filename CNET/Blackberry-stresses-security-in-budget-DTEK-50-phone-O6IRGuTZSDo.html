is that you've got a very nice gauge
it's a very visual indicator of your
your present device security okay
as a user I might not know what that
means or how to improve it as you can
tell I'm in the yellow here mm-hm which
shame on you
shame on me I should be in the green I'm
a little happy in the green won't see
I'm a little competitive and so now I
need to know how do i how do i you know
match you well luckily detect gives me
suggestions for how I can improve my
security so for example it says hey you
don't have a screen lock on which shame
on me of course I should have a screen
lock that's for the purpose of the demo
but as soon as I change that that gauge
will will indicate that I have a higher
level of security what this also does is
it looks deep down into the OS it makes
sure that it hasn't been rooted it looks
into the hardware if I click into apps
there's a list of all my applications
and what they do with the information on
my phone so for example I've got
AccuWeather
and it indicates that it accesses my
location hmm I'm cool with that because
that's what I download the weather app
does yes that's right
but perhaps I want to set a notification
for when an application accesses my
camera or my microphone and there are
apps out there that do that very in my
opinion unnecessarily but my opinion is
is different than what another users
opinion might be so it's a five point
two inch full HD screen and it's really
beautiful it's got great color
reproduction as you can see this comes
in at under seven and a half millimeters
fixed so it's the thinnest blackberry
that we've ever produced this device
comes with a great 13 megapixel rear
facing camera with a dual tone flash the
software with it that comes with this
camera is great it works well in low
light it has live filters when you look
through the viewfinder up front we have
an 8 megapixel front-facing camera with
that with that flash that Alex mentioned
and so that's great for video
conferencing it's great for that selfie
so we've with detect 50 you get 3
gigabytes of RAM you also get expandable
memory in addition to the internal
memory of the device at 16 gigabytes we
also have annex
memory card slot and that's addressable
up to two terabytes so you're never
going to run out of storage space on
this device so this is all running on a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 microprocessor
that's an octa-core processor just a
fantastic overall set of specs and what
we attempted to do here was to select
components so that we had the right
balance with detect 50 you get a great
performing device you don't have to
worry about lags and delays and things
like that so it performs really well but
you also get BlackBerry security and
it's at a price that's that's perfect
for not just consumers but also for
enterprise fleet deployments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
