tricky here are some tips to keep in
mind before taking to the sky you can
practice on the ground with a simulator
app like parrots AR drone sim or the
flight simulator from 3dr when you're
ready for the real world
choose a wide-open area away from power
lines trees and people do a pre-flight
check making sure the battery is secured
and propellers are attached if it's your
first flight consider using the easy
flight mode if your drain has it all
you're going to do is just push up on
the throttle that's going to take off
practice hovering the drone and slowly
increase elevation as you get the hang
of it then try basic movements with the
controller like altering pitch and yaw
you always want to keep your eyes on on
the aircraft so that way you're making
sure you're not going to find anything
and just take it slow it's a good idea
to position the camera facing away from
you and so at this point when you push
forward on the stick it's going to go
forward when you push back on the stick
is going to go back left is going to be
left right it's going to be right some
drones have a built-in GPS feature that
lets it hover in one position and then
return to the same location it took off
from but it's a good idea to keep the
drone within sight because sometimes GPS
can lose signal when it's time to land
bring the throttle down gently and hold
remember drones can crash so if it
happens and it probably will release the
throttle immediately</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
