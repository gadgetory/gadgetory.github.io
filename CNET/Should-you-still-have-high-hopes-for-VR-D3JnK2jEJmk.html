years ago and I thought it's about the
craziest thing I'd ever seen
I had a feeling that vo bliss was just
around the corner and I envisioned the
world where I'd never have to take my
headset off VR was going to become part
of my daily routine my VI headset wasn't
gonna leave my face not when I was
walking to work waiting at the bus stop
casually hanging out in the kitchen in
the office evidently that world hasn't
come to fruition so tail end of 2017 and
I've what exactly zero headsets not the
psvr
not HTC vive not oculus rift and not
even mobile platforms like Google
daydream why there's no real reason to
buy in my first time with VR was a
horror experience called the kitchen
it was truly terrifying that's mostly
what via has to offer too much
experiences not enough games but my
faith in VR has slightly been restored I
talked to a few industry bigwigs over
the last month and then I'm concerned
that all the VR hasn't lit the world on
fire one pointer to color TV saying that
- who wants to take off - look what
happened there so which is it is VR a
flop or could it be that I was wrong you
wanna hear more of my ramblings you can
check them out at brim with a room with
