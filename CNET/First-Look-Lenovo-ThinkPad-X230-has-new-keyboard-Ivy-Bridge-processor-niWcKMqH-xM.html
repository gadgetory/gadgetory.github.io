when you look at the ThinkPad X - 30 e
this is Lenovo's latest ultra portable
business laptop and we've seen this
before we reviewed the ThinkPad x2 20
last year and we love to do was at the
time when Sandy Bridge Intel Core i
processors debuted and so you saw some
nice performance there better integrated
graphics and an expensive package over
$1000 but considering that this packs in
everything that a full-fledged laptop
would at the time it sounded really
exciting now in 2012 this is a 1200 $49
configuration that's pricey and it has a
320 gave 4 gigs of ram and a new third
generation Core i5 processor that's Ivy
Bridge although that won't show up on
the sticker on your box the performance
is really not that huge leap from Sandy
Bridge last year it's a nice bump up but
it's nothing that's gonna rock your
socks off and the graphics on it while
they've been touted as being very
improved in use on this laptop they're
not a surprising leap they're they're
okay but they're nothing that you would
use for gaming not that you would game
on a think pad or would you I don't know
it depends on the type of person you are
but this is a 12.5 inch or as I said and
this is no Ultrabook this is thick and
it's kind of heavy not super heavy but I
carried it home in my backpack and it
weighed me down I felt like it was a
little frustrating and it's not like a
MacBook Air it's not even like many
business ultra books like the HP folio
13 and those cost as low as $800 so here
you are at $1200 with a yes faster
performing laptop but how fast is fast I
mean a lot of last year's ultrabook
processors were pretty fast for most
uses and this generations which we're
just starting to see will be another
step up from there and when you have
those prices at around that level of
$800 and a lot of businesses are asking
for MacBook Airs and things like the
Dell XPS 13 you got to ask what's the
point of a business ultra portable well
ThinkPad aficionados will be happy to
know that the bulky but sturdy design
has been left largely intact even down
to an Express card slot
if you want to use that and of course
the red rubber nub in TrackPoint that's
always around on ThinkPads
whether you're like it or not the
keyboard is new though that's a fancy
new island style keyboard that is on all
think pads this year you may have seen
it on think pad edges and laptops like
the ThinkPad x1 well now you get to get
used to this don't worry those who are
change averse it's a really great
keyboard it just has a slightly
different look what it all adds up to
it's a really good laptop but it's not
really a revolutionary laptop and with
the sort of laptops that we've been
seeing coming down the line ultrabooks
and maybe stuff that'll be time for
windows 8 launch this may not be the
future of what you want to buy for a
small business machine I'm Scott Stein
and this is a look at the Lenovo
ThinkPad X 230</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
