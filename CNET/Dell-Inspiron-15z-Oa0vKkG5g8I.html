a look at the Dell Inspiron 15 C with
touch this is exactly the kind of laptop
we need more of it's a Windows 8 midsize
mid-price laptop that has a touchscreen
and we have not seen nearly as many
touchscreens on bigger 15-inch screens
as we have on smaller 13 and 14 and even
10 and 11 inch screens now Inspiron is
Dells you know fairly budget price line
although the latest generation of them
actually look much nicer than you would
think a lot of metal accents and of
course the Z in the Inspiron 15 Z's name
means that it's an offshoot of the
Inspiron line that's a little bit
thinner on the z-axis so it actually has
a very slim profile a fits if it's kind
of the Ultrabook mode even though it is
a bigger 15-inch laptop now this
particular version is $8.99 for that you
get a Core i5 processor you get the
touchscreen very important standard hard
drive and this actually has something a
lot of other really thin laptops even
big 15-inch ones are lacking right now
that's an optical drive and they managed
to fit it into this fairly thin chassis
and if you're one of those people who
still needs an optical drive and they
are out there this is one of the few
options that's inexpensive thin has a
touchscreen and has an optical drive all
at the same time I always like the Dell
keyboard the touchpad still has these
separate left and right mouse buttons we
usually only find that on lower priced
laptops now anything sort of premium and
above has moved to that one button click
pad and the only other thing that makes
us feel like a little bit more of a
budget product than it should is the
fact that the screen resolution is 1366
by 768 that's fine for a 13-inch laptop
maybe a 14 once you get up to 15-inch it
looks a little it looks a little
cartoonish on the Windows 8 UI it
actually a resolves that very nicely but
if you go back to the traditional
desktop it's not the best look for a
15-inch still for $8.99 super thin with
an optical drive and a touchscreen this
is one of the only mid-size mid-price
laptops out there right now the
beginning of the Windows 8 era I'm Dan
Ackerman and that is the Dell Inspiron
15z
with touch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
