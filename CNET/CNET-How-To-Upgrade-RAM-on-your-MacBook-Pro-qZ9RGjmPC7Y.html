easiest way to give your system a little
boost especially if you want it to be
able to handle a lot of tasks at once
the first thing you want to do is find
out how much RAM you can fit in your
macbook and what the requirements are so
you can do this by visiting Apple's
website or you can head on over to a ram
manufacturer like crucial and use their
tool to find out what your computer
needs in my case I have a mid 2009
MacBook Pro with two gigs of RAM but I
can fit up to four gigs in each of the
two slots giving me a grand total of
eight gigabytes that's going to help a
lot when I'm running heavy programs like
Photoshop or I have like 20 tabs open in
my browser okay to get started all you
need is a screwdriver that fits the
screws on the back of your Mac plus your
RAM so the first thing you want to do is
make sure your macbook is powered off
then flip it over and on the back there
are ten screws that need to be removed
for that I have my Phillips screwdriver
and you'll notice that three of the
screws are longer than the others
so just remember exactly where those go
once they're out the back cover should
lift off really easily and at this point
you might notice that the inside of your
computer is really dusty you can use it
as an opportunity to clean it and if
your harddrive looks different that's
because I replaced mine with an SSD so
the RAM goes right here and it's held
down by two levers that you need to pull
apart once you do the old RAM should pop
out really easily so there's one and
we'll do the same thing for the second
one
so now we're ready to install the new
Ram there is a short side and alongside
so make sure it's aligned properly and
go ahead and make sure that the gold
strip is completely in the slot now push
down and you should hear a click we'll
do the same thing with the second one
put it in the slot make sure the gold
strip is completely covered and then
push down and there's that click our ram
is installed now we're going to put the
computer back together and start it up
we'll put all the screws back in the
three long ones go up here by the hinge
and we're set now let's turn it on and
see what happens I don't expect to see a
serious improvement when I'm booting up
or when I'm performing regular tasks
when the new RAM kicks in is when I'm
running a lot of heavy tasks at once I'm
also hoping for fewer slowdowns and less
of that spinning beach ball which
usually happens when the system is
trying to manage memory all right if you
have any questions or tips of your own
