with anyone named Worf I'm Bridget Carey
this is your scene that update Apple is
facing a hefty fine and it could pay as
much as 862 million dollars after losing
a patent lawsuit over its processors on
Tuesday a u.s. jury found that the
iphone maker infringed on six patent
claims with technology that was invented
by the university of wisconsin-madison
it involves a way to improve the
performance and power efficiency of
processors which is used in the iphone
5s 6 and 6 plus the university suit in
2014 claiming that apple purposefully
took the technology instead of licensing
it and Apple was arguing that the
patents were invalid now the jury is
deciding how much Apple is going to pay
and the university is asking for 862
million dollars but here's a sign that
Apple didn't stand a chance in the
battle the school's licensing arm is the
wisconsin alumni research foundation
known for short as Worf sure it's
spelled differently than the
enterprise's chief tactical officer but
it's still a good idea to just not mess
with anything named Worf meanwhile
Facebook has its own battle is raging
against YouTube Facebook is creating a
hub just to watch video clips upload it
to Facebook they can be videos you save
to watch later or videos from people or
pages you follow it's just rolling out
to a small number of users first and
Facebook is also testing out a feature
that lets videos float in a window in
the corner following you as you keep
scrolling down Facebook has talked about
its video ambitions for some time now
the network is even talking about
sharing revenue with video creators just
like YouTube does you may not be able to
escape videos but you can escape
reminders of your ex on facebook the
network likes to remind you of past
posts you made on this day in previous
years but now there's a filter in
settings so you can be sure not to be
reminded of any photos or posts tagged
with certain people or posts made on a
certain day go to facebook.com slash on
this day click on preferences to the
right to change settings because it
could be painful to get a surprise
reminder about certain things and over
at the other big social network
winner just appointed a new executive
chairman but he doesn't tweet much Oh
mid-core destani the former chief
business officer of Google now holds the
Twitter chairman role that Jack Dorsey
held but since Dorsey came back a CEO
someone else needed to fill the seat
couristan e launched a twitter account
in 2010 but before getting the job he
only tweeted eight times the news comes
a day after twitter laid off more than
300 employees that's it for this tech
news update there's always more at cnet
com from our studios in New York I'm
