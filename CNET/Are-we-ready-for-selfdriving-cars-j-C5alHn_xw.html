of Volvo where the company is testing a
self-driving car on the streets around
the city by 2017 of all the West minutes
they'll have 100 these cars in the
streets around here and then from there
they'll be expanding to the rest of the
world there's a lot of excitement around
this program but we wanted to see
whether the people here in Gothenburg
actually trust these cars so we thought
we'd ask them are you aware that Volvo's
have been testing an autonomous car
around the streets from Gothenburg here
no you didn't know that so they have a
car that drives itself how do you feel
about that would you trust a car with no
driver if it were driving itself but do
you think that you could teach a car to
be a better driver than any human being
yeah what do you think that you're a
better driver than a computerised car
that you're honest that's good are you
wear that Volvo's been testing
autonomous cars in the area around
Guttenberg yes I've seen it what do you
think about that like to have control
over a weed steering wheel do you think
that a car could be trained to be a
better driver than a human though maybe
I don't have a driving licence so better
than me so if you were buying car then
you'd probably want a car that could
drive itself so you could be driven
around right do you trust a self-driving
car do you think they could be a better
driver than a human yeah absolutely I
think so once everybody every car is a
self-driving car I think it would be
safe for them depends I think that the
computer driver is already better than a
human but it feels more safe so if you
were buying a car today would you want a
car that had an autonomous driving
function yes I would I don't know think
about terminators and stuff like that I
know so worried they're gonna just run
us down the roads we run us down you
know that Volvo is testing autonomous
cars and the streets around Gothenburg
yes what do you think about that I think
that is wonderful and you trust them I
do
and would you trust other people in the
town of us cars perhaps is better with
an autonomous car than if somebody's
talking in the mobile phone or something
like that do you do quite a bit of
driving then you know my wife head and
takes care of the driving not so you
already had a ton of this car then no
yeah we can see that like that so there
you have it overwhelmingly the people
here in Gothenburg are in support of
self-driving cars but the question
remains what do you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
