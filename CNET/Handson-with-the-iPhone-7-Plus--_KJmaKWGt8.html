coming out in September September 16 so
what's new in these phones we've been
expecting some iterations maybe water
resistance well that's here ip67 and
it's also got new color this is black
there's also jet black which is glossy
this is just black black and there are
dual cameras that's what makes the plus
a step up from the 7 this year the dual
cameras are both 12 megapixel and they
can enable depth of field to do
something that's in camera is called
bokeh that allows like a soft focus
effect and there's also zoom you can
actually take photos on this and snap
from 1 X 2 to X and then go all the way
up to 10x with software and even though
that software zoom Apple says that the
quality of that is going to be a lot
better than you got on previous iPhones
so that's a big difference there's also
some other tweaks across the iPhone line
that home button is no longer a
clickable one in solid state so it feels
like those force touch trackpad on the
MacBook you press and hold to control it
there's also no headphone jack as we
knew this has stereo speakers now and if
you want to connect that phones you can
use included lightning adapter in the
box or use lightly connected ear pods or
use air pods which are coming out in
October these are wireless they
automatically pair with the iPhone and
you can pop these out put them on
connect them instantly and enjoy higher
fidelity audio according to Apple with 5
hours of use so maybe you switch to
Wireless maybe you use an adapter that's
what the iPhone has in a nutshell
did I mention battery life the new
processors on both of these are not only
faster and more graphically capable but
they mean more power efficient your
down and allow more hours of use so both
of these should expect at least several
hours in were battery life which is
exciting to me that plus water is this
since I could drop it in the pool and
still be able to use it for a longer
period of time more to come as we test
these I'm Scott Stein here in San
Francisco with the iPhone 7 plus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
