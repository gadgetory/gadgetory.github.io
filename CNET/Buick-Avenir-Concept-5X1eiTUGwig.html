around the Detroit show hero had a whole
list of cars to hit this wasn't on my
list until about three people I know and
trust said you got to see that a venir
that can be the best-looking car at the
show and it might be this is a pure
concept Buick this a venir but take a
look at the styling this really matched
to their TV commercials where no one
expects of you to look like that you
give the valet your keys you say it's a
Buick and they look all around anywhere
but the Buick what they're doing here is
long hood short deck that's kind of the
refuge you go to as a designer when you
want to look good it's almost hardly a
colony earth it doesn't look good in
those proportions but they've also got
what's called the Buick sweeps peer down
the sides that sort of signature line
that kicks up along the hips their dates
right back to the first three
generations of the Riviera it's pure
Buick stuff let's get this protruding
UWE Crump that I've never been really
fond of and they really accentuated here
but aside from that this is one pretty
ride the downside is of course it's pure
concept styling exercise so I'm not
going to get you with a lot of specifics
on powertrain or tech however two
interesting things that they do envision
one is it would have podcast
synchronization so whatever media you're
listening to outside the vehicle is
immediately going to be handed off to
the vehicle when you get in at the exact
same playback point and also they're
talking about integrated dashboard
connectivity to any kind of connected
home device but I suspect by the time a
car like this ever does come out a lot
of cars will be doing that sure is
pretty
