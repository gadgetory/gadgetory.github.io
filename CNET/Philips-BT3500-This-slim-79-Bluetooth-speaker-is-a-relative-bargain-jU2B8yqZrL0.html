wireless Bluetooth speaker that retails
for $79.99 and has a built-in
speakerphone hi I'm David Carr noise and
the BT 3500 is one among many
inexpensive mini Bluetooth speakers to
hit the market in the last couple of
years a lot of these types of speakers
have more of a canister design to them
but what helps set this one apart is its
relatively flat design which makes it
easy to slip into a bag without taking
up too much space you can stand the
speaker up vertically it's really meant
to be laid down flat and propped up at a
slight angle using the integrated flip
out kickstand it does play louder than
its size would indicate and I like the
analog volume knob which gives the
speaker a slight retro look and more
importantly makes it easy to raise and
lower the volume that same volume knob
can be found in the step-down BT 2500
which costs around $30 less and is about
half the size the 3500 you see here adds
NFC tap to pair technology for devices
that support it but otherwise the two
speakers have identical feature sets
it's hard to say which speaker I like
better I thought they both sounded
pretty good for their size though as
you'd expect the larger BT 3500 does
sound slightly fuller and plays louder
however I like the form factor of the
smaller BT 2500 these small bluetooth
speakers do have their sound limitations
so you shouldn't expect the world from
them particularly in the bass department
but I thought both these Philips
speakers managed to avoid sounding harsh
we're relatively distortion-free that
they clearly perform better at more
modest volume levels and are really
designed for a casual not critical
listening they also perform fairly well
as a speakerphone so long as you don't
wander too far away from the speaker's
microphone while talking the speaker
charged via microUSB and the battery
life for both the BT 2500 and 3500 is
rated at five hours you died ely like to
see a speaker rated at least eight hours
if you don't crank the volume too much
you may be able to do better than that 5
hour rating summing up these Phill
speakers may not blow anybody away with
their performance but I think they do
sound pretty decent for what they are
and they're slim form factor is
appealing from a portability standpoint
they're also reasonably priced and helps
you can find them for view bucks less
online I'm David Connelly and that's the
phillips ET 3500 portable bluetooth
speaker thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
