new te w 8 1 8 d ru router from trainer
it is the latest AC 1900 dual band Wi-Fi
router so what is AC 1900 well it's not
the button in your car is stand for 802
point you have an AC Wi-Fi standard that
offer the top speed of up to 1300
megabit per second now AC only works on
the foggy frequency band but this router
he also worked on the older 2.4 band and
on that band it gives you up to 600
megabit per second so basically an AC
1900 router is the one that gives you
the come by Wi-Fi bandwidth of up to
1900 megabit per second and it had now
that of course is a ceiling theory speed
in really the actual speed is always
much slower but still AC 1900 is a
designation for the fastest Wi-Fi router
on the market for now so that's that
actually very cool just like and
listening it makes your life quite
comfortable while being our line so how
fast is he trying that right here well
in my testing it was actually very fast
offering up to 465 megabit per second up
sustained will will speed on the faggio
hurt frequency band and on the 2.4
gigahertz band it offers up to 156
megabit per second now that put it to be
one of the three fastest router I've
ever seen and I've seen a lot of them so
this is very significant it also has
very long range and very stable Wi-Fi
signal it also wanted the most
straightforward router now on the front
here there it has a array of LED lights
so the status of the router I love this
line because just by glancing at them I
know exactly what is going on on the
back here it has four Gigabit LAN port
and one gigabit WAN port and that means
you can use this router here with even
the fastest internet broadband service
without having to worry not getting what
you pay for you can also use up to
or white client with this before having
to use a switch now up here has two USB
port one of them is HP 3.0 and the other
one is USB 2.0 you can use this port to
host an external hard drive and a
printer but that prints up my biggest
complaint about this router here in my
testing it couldn't recognize any of the
purple dry I tried with maybe the poor
here do not provide enough juice to
power the drive
maybe there are other reason it's not a
big deal really because when it comes to
network storage if you were to get
serious Barrett you need to get a
dedicated Nath server anyway
now this router he is also very easy to
set up on the side here you can see that
the label with all the default settings
of the rarer including the two Wi-Fi
networks one for each band and also how
to access is web interface right here
you can also fight it on the bottom I
guess now I can remove this plastic here
it's a brand new router you know now
this router here actually come with a
very easy to you well organized web
interface and it offer a standard common
set of features and settings such as
guest networking dynamic DNS quality of
service ipv6 and so on now you know I
fired a very fast workhorse router I can
give you a very robust home network and
for more this one here check out my full
review at comm you know is a great deal
at hundred and eighty dollars which is a
lot less than many others of the same
spec and I say that this is a great
router even with the USB problem I
mentioned earlier that's not because I'm
nice because I'm kind of smart you see
you need to look past the imperfection
in the feature you don't really need to
get the best deal for what you actually
do and go ahead and apply that to many
other things in life too as long as you
remember one important thing that is I'm
don't know and this has been the first
look as the AC 1900 dual Benoit's
railroad intranet
