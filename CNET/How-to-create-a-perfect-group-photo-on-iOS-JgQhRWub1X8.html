how to contributor and today we're going
to take a look at how to create the best
group shot possible using iOS more
specifically using an app called group
shot on your iPad or your iPhone now you
can import photos from any device that
you've taken the pictures on as well as
you can use the photos you've taken
straight from your iPhone or your iPad
so we'll get the app from the App Store
it's called group shots 99 cents and
then once you have the photos on your
device or if you're getting ready to
take some group photos you can actually
take them within the app go ahead and
launch the app and then we've already
imported some photos so we're going to
pick choose from library and then we're
actually use the demo album so now what
this does is we have two different sets
of photos here and we've all been in
this situation where you've taken group
photos one kids looking at the camera
the other one's looking at a squirrel
the other ones not smiling or crying and
you know you you have to kind of pick
and choose which one is the best what
group shot allows you to do is actually
combine all the photos into one and make
one perfect photo so what we'll do is
we'll go ahead and select for photos
from the first group here and hit done
takes a few seconds to load all the
photos and get all the information in
and then once it does you're going to
actually see one main photo and you
could swap it out if you prefer another
one to be the main photo and then you're
also going to see the rest of the photos
in the group so as you can see here mom
and daughter aren't looking all that
happy they're not even looking at the
camera so what I what you do is actually
use your finger color to color the area
that you want to replace in and once you
let go as you can see it kind of zooms
in over here and picks the same area of
the photo and you can decide what you
want to replace that with and this one
mom looks happy and we'll go ahead and
select that it'll take a few seconds for
it to transfer that information over
into this main photo but once it does as
you can see it's as good as it gets so
you have the mom now looking at the
camera and smiling you have the daughter
over here who's not really looking at
the camera she looks kind of sad in this
photo so we'll go ahead and select her
and in this one she kind of looks happy
so we'll go ahead and select that one
again a few seconds to transfer the
information over and there you go really
seamless you can't get into areas where
you have lines and other stuff but
that's a real quick look at group shot
this is a great way to take and create a
perfect group photo on iOS again it's in
the app store for 99 cents this is Jason
