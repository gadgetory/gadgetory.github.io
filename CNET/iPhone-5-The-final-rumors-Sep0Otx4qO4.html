welcome to the Alpha vibe for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
now anticipation and hype is at an
all-time high and we're giving you the
last view Apple buy some info before the
big a is announcement now the Cupertino
kids announced the official
invitation-only event will be held at
company headquarters on October 4th
that's Tuesday at 10:00 a.m. and it's
perfect timing since that's right after
my Bikram yoga class that's right I'm
flexible and the special event is titled
let's talk I phone now everyone's been
waiting because there's still a lot of
mystery surrounding what Apple will
actually release at this event
according to nine-to-five Mac knew part
numbers for a new iPhone updated iPhone
4s and iPod Touch ease have already
appeared in Apple's inventory system the
next-gen iPhone known as n 94 and
Apple's iOS SDK kit has appeared in
Apple's inventory system and according
to them packs an a5 dual-core processor
a Qualcomm Gobi baseband chip for GSM
and CDMA compatibility with an 8
megapixel camera and 1 gig of ram now
they also report to products with the n9
t a part number that have appeared and
are believed to be black and white
models for a modified 8 gig iPhone 4
that might be the new low-end budget
iPhone the current iPhone 4 is part
number is known as a 90 now three iPod
Touch models with part numbers n 81 a
have appeared and they're believed to be
the rumored white iPod Touches since n
81 represents the current black iPod
Touch and that could point to just a
cosmetic change with the same 8 32 and
64 gig options alongside the current
black ones so when should we expect the
official launch so we can gather our
lawn chairs and blankies and wait in
long lines for over 10 hours without a
bathroom break well according to a boy
genus report AT&amp;amp;T employees have been
blocked from taking any vacations during
the first two weeks of October earlier
this month it was reported sprint was
doing the same at the time of the show
the launch date is still up in the air
and none of my retail contacts have been
notified of any official blackout period
now as we get closer what other features
might we expect in the next iPhone
according to Mac o Takara a China Unicom
rep told onlookers during
keynote at Macworld Asia 2011 that the
iPhone 5 will have HSPA+ capabilities
for faster high speed data now he also
included this slide just to make sure
people were paying attention China
Unicom was the first carrier to have the
iPhone 4 so you've got to be wondering
what that guy was smoking to publicly
announce that probably the same thing
that AT&amp;amp;T in the US has been smoking
since they've been marketing HSPA+ as 4G
all this time now other revelations from
9 to 5 mac point to the biggest new
feature in the next-gen iPhone called
assistant it's the next evolution of
voice control and based on their
acquisition of the Sirius system now
it's all voice controlled and it will
allow you to make appointment that are
instantly added to your calendar compose
voice to text messages and create
reminders for buying that rash ointment
you forgot about still itchy now the
assistant will also be able to ask you
questions for more details just like a
conversation and if this is true I won't
need friends anymore now we'll find out
about the real facts on October 4th but
let's just tease you a little bit with
what it might look like the team at Ben
m80 decided to do what no one else would
and build a prototype iPhone 5 based on
the CAD designs case leaks and mock-ups
of the rumored and let me remind you
non-existent iPhone 5 now look at how
dramatically he reveals it dude stop
staring at me like that and I'm still
impressed but awkwardly blown away by
watching an Asian guy really fluent in
German unfunny mais one-china Ben M
Basquiat D now the prototype was a
machine from a solid block of aluminum
and treated with glass pearls it even
features the teardrop design and
honestly that looks real nice but I
might as well have made a Loch Ness
monster out of a sandwich
and if you're wondering do people really
care about this phone all this hype are
people really going to make the switch
well 41 percent of mobile consumers plan
to purchase the iPhone 5 and that's
according to a study by in Moby that
covered users in the US Mexico and
Canada in addition to that 52 percent of
BlackBerry users plan to switch to
iPhone 51 percent of current iPhone
users plan to upgrade to the five for
their next purchase and 20
percent of Android users would join this
side of the computer food company now
also 50% of all those people surveyed
are planning to upgrade within the next
six months and those numbers are scary
but it's Apple that might be a little
scared after Amazon rocked the tech
world with their Kindle Fire
announcement that's sure to change the
tablet game the Kindle Fire is a seven
inch LCD screen tablet that's based on
the rim playbooks design it will run
Amazon's own custom UI on top of Android
there's no web camera microphone or 3G
but you know what it doesn't matter
because it's $1.99 Amazon is one of the
few companies that has the content
library with movies music books and
magazines to support a content
consumption device like the tablet
and although it's not directly competing
with the iPad it instantly elevated
itself to the best Android tablet and
what's the general consumer going to do
this holiday season when they look at an
iPad for $4.99 or a Kindle Fire for
$1.99 it will be a very interesting
holiday to see how it plays out but
kudos to Kindle and only get more
interesting when they release future
hardware and a larger tablet all right
that's going to do it for this week's
show but we'll find out all the new
goodies Apple is dropping on us on next
week's show email us at the Apple bite
at cnet.com with your reactions to
Apple's announcements i'm brian tong
we'll catch you guys next time for
another bite of the Apple
