home theater set you will have heard the
word Atmos bandied around a few times
while it's not really ready for
primetime as they say they have produced
the first set of Atmos ready speakers
we've seen in the CNET offices and
they're damn good and not because of
Atmos the pioneer SPE BS 73 LR our stand
mounted speakers that can be used as
surrounds or as fronts and they do
really well in both instances these
andrew jones design speakers are seven
hundred and forty nine dollars us and
challenged my favorite B&amp;amp;W 685 s two
speakers for sound quality as well as
build quality the Pioneers featured two
concentric mid tweeter arrays with one
designed to fire at the ceiling for
Atmos hide effects
given that the app must mature at the
moment is pretty dreadful we were
relieved to find they work great with
normal soundtracks and music - these are
excellent performers very detailed but
without the bass response compromises
that usually means bass is supple and
expressive these are not bright but
there is a slight treble bump which
means they sound best with orchestral
music or vocals but less good with
harder edged material if you're looking
at a set of speakers that scream oh but
don't want to mortgage your house then
the Pioneer SP EBS 73 are very highly
recommended this is ty Pendlebury for
