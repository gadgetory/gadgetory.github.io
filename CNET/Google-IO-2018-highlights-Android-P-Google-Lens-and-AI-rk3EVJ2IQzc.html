technology is it's constantly evolving
in fact we can even apply machine
learning to a 200 year old technology
Morse code and make an impact in
someone's quality of life let's take a
look hi I am Tanya this is my voice I
use Morse code by putting dots and
dashes with switches mounted near my
head as a very young child I used to
communication word board
I used a head stick to point to the
words it was very attractive to say the
least
once Morse code was incorporated into my
life it was a feeling of pure liberation
and freedom I think that is why I like
skydiving so much it is the same kind of
feeling through skydiving I met Ken the
love of my life and partner in crime
it's always been very very difficult
just to find Morris code devices to try
Morris code this is why I had to create
my own with the help from Ken I have a
voice and more independence in my daily
life but most people don't have Ken
it is our hope that we can collaborate
with the G board team to help people who
want to tap into the freedom of using
Morse code G board is the Google
keyboard what we have discovered working
on G board is that there are entire
pockets of population in the world and
when I say pockets it's like tens of
millions of people who have never had
access to a keyboard that works in their
own language
with Tonya we've built support in G
board for Morse code so it's an input
modality that allows you to type in
Morse code and get text out with
predictions suggestions I think it's a
beautiful example of where machine
learning can really assist someone in a
way that normal keyboard without
artificial intelligence wouldn't be able
to I am very excited to continue on this
journey many many people will benefit
from this and that thrills me to no end
it's a very inspiring story we are very
very excited to have Tanya and can join
us today
so we are bringing a new feature called
suggested actions essentially suggesting
smart actions right in context for you
to act on say for example you went to a
wedding and you're looking through those
pictures we understand your friend Lisa
is in the picture and we offer to share
the three photos with Lisa and with one
click those photos can be sent to her so
the anxiety where everyone is trying to
get the picture on their phone I think
we can make that better say for example
if the photo in the same wedding if the
photos are underexposed or AI systems
offer a suggestion to fix the brightness
right there one tap and we can fix the
brightness for you or if you took a
picture of a document which you want to
save for later we can recognize convert
the document to PDF and make it
make it much easier for you to use later
you know we want to make all these
simple cases delightful by the way I can
also deliver unexpected moments so for
example if you have this picture cute
picture of your kid we can make it
better we can drop the background color
pop the color and make the kid even
cuter or if you happen to have a very
special memory something in black and
white maybe of your mother and
grandmother we can recreate that moment
in color and make that moment even more
real and special all these features are
going to be rolling out to Google Photos
users in the next couple of months
our current voice is codenamed Holly she
was a real person
she spent months in our studio and then
we stitched those recordings together to
create voice but 18 months ago we
announced a breakthrough from our
deepmind team called wavenet unlike the
current systems
wavenet actually models the underlying
raw audio to create a more natural voice
it's closer to how humans speed the
pitch the pace even all the pauses that
convey meaning we want to get all of
that right so we've worked hard at
wavenet and we are adding as of today
six new voices to the Google assistant
let's have them say hello good morning
everyone I'm your Google assistant
welcome to Shoreline Amphitheatre we
hope you'll enjoy Google i/o back to you
sundar
you know our goal is one day to get the
right accents languages and dialects
right globally you know wavenet can make
this much easier with this technology we
started wondering who we could get into
the studio with an amazing voice take a
look
couscous a type of North African
semolina in granules made from crushed
durum wheat I want a puppy with sweet
eyes and a fluffy tail who likes my
haikus don't we all happy birthday to
the person whose birthday it is happy
birthday to you John Legend he would
probably tell you he don't want to brag
but he'll be the best assistant you ever
had can you tell me where you live you
can find me on all kinds of devices
phones Google homes and if I'm lucky in
your heart
that's right John Legend's voice is
coming to the assistant clearly he
didn't spend all the time in the studio
answering every possible question that
you could ask but wavenet allowed us to
shorten the studio time and the model
can actually capture the richness of his
voice his voice will be coming later
this year in certain contexts so that
you can get responses like this right
now in Mountain View it's sixty five
with clear skies today it's predicted to
be 75 degrees and sunny at 10 a.m. you
have an event called Google i/o keynote
then at 1:00 p.m. you have margaritas
have a wonderful day I'm looking forward
to 1 p.m. now this is one of the lenovo
smart displays the ambient screen
integrates with Google photos and greets
me with pictures of my kids Bella and
Hudson those are really my kids and best
way to start my day every morning now
because the device is controlled by
voice I can watch videos or live TV with
just a simple command this makes it so
easy to enjoy my favorite shows while
multitasking around the house hey Google
let's watch Jimmy Kimmel Live
ok playing Jimmy Kimmel Live on YouTube
TV here's something from my life I'm
driving my daughter to school this
morning so that's right on YouTube TV
you will be able to watch all of these
amazing shows from local news live
sports and much more and they will be
available on smart displays now cooking
is another instance where the blend of
voice and visuals is incredibly useful
Nick and I are always looking for simple
family-friendly recipes hey Google show
me recipes for pizza bombs sure here are
some recipes so we can choose the first
one from tasty that one looks good you
see all the recipe details come right up
and we can just tap to start cooking
sure here's tasty so seeing a video
demonstration along with the spoken
instructions is a total GameChanger for
cooking especially when you have your
hands full so we showed you a couple of
ways
that smartest place can make life at
home easier but there are so many more
from staying in touch with family with
broadcasts and do a video calling to
keeping an eye on your home with all of
our other smart home partners to seeing
in advance what the morning commutes
like with Google Maps
we're thoughtfully integrating the best
of Google and working with developers
and partners all around the world to
bring voice and visuals together in a
completely new way for the home now
inspired by the smart display
experiences we've also been working to
reimagine the assistant experience on
the screen that's with us all the time
our mobile phones hey Google order my
usual from Starbucks hello welcome back
to Starbucks
that's one tall nonfat latte with
caramel drizzle anything else so no
thanks and are you picking that up at
the usual place
I'm gonna tap yes okay your orders in
see you soon
yeah so we're excited to share that we
were working with Starbucks Dunkin
Donuts story - Domino's and many other
partners on a new food pickup and
delivery experience for the Google
assistant we have already started
rolling some of these out with many more
partners coming soon so let's start with
how make it easy for you to keep up with
the news you care about as soon as I
open Google News right at the top I get
a briefing with the top five stories I
need to know right now as I move past my
briefing there are more story selected
just for me our a I constantly reads the
firehose of the web for you the millions
of articles videos podcasts and comments
being published every minute and
assembles the key things you need to
know Google News also pulls in local
voices and news about events in my area
it's this kind of information that makes
me feel connected to my community we're
also excited to introduce a new visual
format we call newscasts you are not
going to see these in any other news app
newscasts are kind of like a preview of
the story and they make it easier if you
get a feel for what's going on check out
this one on this
movie here we're using the latest
developments in natural language
understanding to bring together
everything from the solo movie trailer -
news articles to quotes and from the
cast and more in a fresh presentation
that looks absolutely great on your
phone
newscast gives me an easy way to get the
basics and decide where I want to dive
in more deeply full coverage is an
invitation to learn more it gives a
complete picture of a story in terms of
how it's being reported from a variety
of sources and in a variety of formats
we assemble full coverage using a
technique we call temporal Coll ocala T
this technique enables us to map
relationships between entities and
understand the people places and things
in a story right as it evolves we apply
this to the deluge of information
publish to the web at any given moment
and then organize it around storylines
all in real time what Android P we
partnered with deepmind to work on a new
feature we call adaptive battery it's
designed to give you a more consistent
battery experience adaptive battery uses
on device machine learning to figure out
which apps you'll use in the next few
hours and which you won't use until
later if at all today and then with this
understanding the operating system
adapts to your usage patterns so that it
spends battery only on the absent
services that you care about and the
results are really promising we're
seeing a 30% reduction in CPU wake-ups
for apps in general and this combined
with other performance improvements
including running background processes
on the small CPU cores is resulting in
an increase in batteries for many users
wood Android P we've introducing a new
on device machine learning feature we
call adaptive brightness a dr.
brightness learns how you like to set
the brightness slider given the ambient
lighting and then does it for you in a
power efficient way so you'll literally
see the brightness slide or move as the
phone adapts to your preferences and
it's extremely effective in fact we're
seeing almost half of our test users now
make fewer manual brightness adjustments
compared to any previous
of Android we're also making the UI more
intelligent last year we introduced the
concept of predictive apps a feature
that places the next apps the OS
anticipates you need on the path you'd
normally follow to launch that app would
Android P we're going to beyond simply
predicting the next act to launch to
predicting the next action you want to
take we call this feature at the actions
so let's take a look at how it works at
the top of the launcher you can see two
actions one to call my sister Fiona and
another to start a work add-on Strava
for my evening run so what's happening
here is that the actions are being
predicted based on my usage patterns the
phone is adapting to me and trying to
help me get to my next task more quickly
one of the first things we focused on
was helping you understand your habits
Android P will show you a dashboard of
how you're spending time on your device
as you saw earlier you can see how many
how much time you spent in apps how many
times you've unlocked your device today
and how many notifications you've
received and you can drill down on any
of these things for example here's my
Gmail data from Saturday and when I saw
this it did make me wonder whether I
should have been on my email all weekend
but that's kind of the point of the
dashboard now when you're engaging is
one part of understanding but what
you're engaging with in apps is equally
important for example YouTube will be
adding a deep link where you can see
total watch time across mobile and
desktop and access many of the helpful
tools that shouldn't sundar shared
earlier now understanding is a good
start but Android P also gives you
controls to help you manage how and when
you spend time on your phone maybe you
have an app that you love but you're
spending more time in it than you
realized
Android Piet lets you set time limits on
apps and will nudge you when you're
close to your limit that it's time to do
something else and for the rest of the
day that app icon is greyed out to
remind you of your goal - do not disturb
mode - silence not just the phone calls
and texts
also the visual interruptions that pop
up on your screen to make do not disturb
even easier to use we've created a new
gesture that we've affectionately
codenamed shush if you turn your phone
over on the table it automatically
enters do not disturb so you can focus
on being present
no pings vibrations or other
distractions our teams have been working
really hard to combine the power of the
camera the computer vision with Street
View and maps to reimagine walking
navigation so here's how it could look
like in Google Maps let's take a look
you open the camera
you instantly you instantly know where
you are
no futzing with the phone you all the
information on the map the street names
the directions right there in front of
you notice that you also see the map so
that way you stay oriented you can start
to see nearby places so you see what's
around you and just for fun our team's
been playing with an idea of adding a
helpful guide like that there so that it
can show you the way oh there she goes
pretty cool
now enabling these kinds of experiences
though GPS alone doesn't cut it so
that's why we've been working on what we
call VPS visual positioning system that
can estimate precise positioning and
orientation one one way to think about
the key insight here is just like you
and I when we are in an unfamiliar place
you're looking for visual landmarks
looking for the storefront and the
building facades etc and it's the same
idea
VPS uses the visual features in the
environment to do the same so that way
we help you figure out exactly where you
are
and get you exactly where you need to go
with smart text selection you can now
connect the words you see with the
answers and actions you need so you can
do things like copy and paste from the
real world directly into your phone just
like that
or let's say you're looking at or you
can paint on a page of words into a page
of answers so for example you're looking
at a restaurant menu you can quickly tap
around figure out every dish what it
looks like what are all the ingredients
etcetera the next feature I want to talk
about is called style match and the idea
is this
sometimes your question is not what's
that exact thing instead your question
is what are things like it you're at
your friend's place you check out this
trendy looking lamp and you want to know
things that match that style and now
lens can help you or if you see an
outfit that catches your eye you can
simply open the camera tap on any item
and find out of course specific
information like reviews etcetera of any
specific item but you can also see all
the things and browse around that match
that style so the last thing I want to
tell you about today is how we're making
lens work in real time so as you saw in
the style match example you start to see
you open the camera and you start to see
lens surface proactively all the
information instantly and it even
anchors that information to the things
that you see now this kind of thing
where it's sifting through billions of
words phrases places things just in real
time to give you what you need not
possible without machine learning so we
are using both on device intelligence
but also tapping into the power of cloud
TP use which we announced last year at
i/o to get this done really excited and
in over time what we want to do is
actually overlay the live results
directly on top of things like
storefronts street signs or a concert
poster so you can simply point your
phone at a concert poster of Charlie
puth and the music video just starts to
play just like that this is an example
of how the camera is not just answering
questions but it is putting the answers
right where the questions are and it's
very exciting we've been working hard on
an updated version of Google Maps
that keeps you in the know on what's new
and trending in the areas you care about
and helps you find the best place for
you based on your context and interests
here I'm being told about a cafe that
just opened in my area if we scroll down
I see a list of the restaurants that are
trending this week this is super useful
because with zero work maps is giving me
ideas to kick me out of my rut and
inspire me to try something new but how
do I know if a place is really right for
me have you ever had the experience at
looking at lots of places all with 4
star ratings and you're pretty sure
there's some you're gonna like a lot and
others that maybe aren't quite so great
but you're not sure how to tell which
ones we've created a score called your
match to help you find more places that
you'll love your match uses machine
learning to combine what Google knows
about hundreds of millions of places
with the information that I've added
restaurants I've rated cuisines I've
liked and places that I've been to
if you cook into the match number you'll
see reasons explaining why it's
recommended just for you it's your
personal score four places and our early
testers are telling us that they love it
now you can confidently pick the places
that are best for you whether you're
planning ahead or are on the go and need
to make a quick decision right now
another example of a one of our core
products which we are redesigning with
AI is Gmail we just had a new fresher
look for Gmail a recent redesign hope
you're all enjoying using it we are
bringing out of the feature to Gmail we
call it smart compose so it's the name
suggest we use machine learning to start
suggesting phrases for you as you type
all you need to do is to hit tab and
keep order completing
in this case it understands the subject
is Taco Tuesday it suggests chips salsa
guacamole it it takes care of mundane
things like addresses so that you don't
need to worry about it you can actually
focus on what you want to type I've been
loving using it I've been sending a lot
more emails to the company not sure what
the company thinks of it but it's been
great we are rolling out smart composed
to all our users this month and hope you
enjoy using it as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
