249 of the 359 podcast and where the
hell did all of you people come from
yeah have you ever done this before of
it nine party big ones I cannot breathe
Scott I can't breathe I've got to
hotshot Thanks he's double-parked with
his copy there's so much fumes of hot
drinks no one's gonna get that lesson
from it's the same thing as
double-fisting I just not as dirty I
found out on a recent trip to Europe
that you should not tell a Brit that
they are double-fisting with drinks with
drinks and carry a double-parked we're
off to a we're off to a fantastic any
drinking comments in England anymore all
right Brian is he cool with those yeah I
don't have any more all right all the
time that's true I only got a packed
house we've got special guests shared
back then it's Scott's time sure Wow I
got married three years ago well I guess
you know what your iPhone you'd know
that because it sorry about that
cher prophetess you're right I don't
know all right off to a great start
right as always as always so we're gonna
be talking about obviously it's the
tenth anniversary of the launch of the
original iPhone we've heard about that a
few times right sweetie I know I know we
did we talked about it earlier this week
we talked a little bit about sort of our
history with Pete they were truthful
I don't think eyes knew I had guys
for those people did how I was a
reporter at Dow Jones law said one I had
one what I didn't do review because Walt
Mossberg had the phone and actually I
was one of the first to see it after
after was showed off at Macworld I think
the week after I was in a room Steve
Jobs or that was like 20 other Wall
Street firm reporters
Boresha real OG I was like yeah we're
right around when Macworld happened and
I was like between job the best story
from that event though seriously we
asked we asked them we asked him you
know how durable is this thing it's all
touchscreen and he threw the phone
that's what I do does he know we
actually how fragile that phone really
want maybe that being wagon that was a
pretty calculated risk the man just
carpeted there so like I guess he was
assuming it would be okay but imagine
looking back I might if that's a broke
story
oh yeah it's not anyway that was
technically all off the record what I
just talked about but it was ten years a
polygamy laughter all right first always
like talking a lot that's true there's a
lot there's a lot of good stuff coming
out actually you're okay I think so I
think we'll see ya know like sorry like
when it was at the Apple Store Fifth
Avenue like when it was available late
at night one night Oh cuz he kept
selling them at like weird hours my
friend really like found it in a parking
lot like three weeks after I feel like
somebody from Apple just like left it
there on the floor or something like the
roots after it came out like was in
stores like it was just in a parking lot
I guess somebody dropped there or
something my friend just picked it off
all right why don't we get the actual
podcast started Oh in just a minute this
is the pre-show this is already oh wow
yeah so we'll do a four minute podcast
and we'll we'll stick around for the the
questions afterwards where are our
viewers are gonna be bringing in
questions what viewers of yours Danny
used viewers on periscope
say something that changed every iPhone
Wow
if you're viewing this problem and this
one or two I always y'all see why I try
to keep this trim down to the minimum
all right let's get this podcast started
we can we can ramble afterwards yes yes
what's the post shows for let's give
these sorry guys
3 minutes and 59 seconds of relatively
coherent thoughts so good I'm just gonna
say Sharon get it started here we go in
3 2
welcome to the 359 I'm dr. K I'm Alfred
Inge and with us is Scott sign and share
profits yes hi
we're all gonna be talking about iPhone
obviously it's a tenth anniversary of
the original launch so instead of we've
talked a lot about the iPhone and its
impact on the industry and the world and
everything we just wanted to take a
little bit more personal and I want to
ask everyone and really discuss how the
iPhone has changed your life personally
Wow like iPhone therapy right I know
we're gonna get real deep here you get
dark he could get scary it could be I
don't know
well Scott's been watching a lot of
black mirrors so I'm curious to hear
what you think yeah what is what is the
Scott's I know who the man who's
basically reviewed what was the last
four or five iPhones at this point yeah
since 2012 yeah 5 so last last 5 years
of iPhones half of the iPhones existence
uh it is it's always with me and so
you've sort of always on you're always
connected and I know that's not just the
iPhone that did it used phones before
that that had done that but that was one
we're really the more and more you could
do with it as my son once said to me you
care about that thing a lot maybe said
you care about it more than you care
about me that's a joke I hope it was a
joke but there's a little truth of that
yes I mean everyone trying to disconnect
now is because you can do a lot of
things you take it with you whether it's
games whether it's email whether it's
video photos and the need to share the
need to interact and then having work on
your leash yeah um or you're on work
solution that is all increasingly a part
of it and making that the first thing
you check is one step towards us
becoming like a node in some network
Wow that's a that's a really maitre died
what is exactly what I was hoping you'd
say okay good that was very black nurse
totally and what about you please tell
me you've got something more chipper all
right I would say that i and i i can't
necessarily you know tie to the iphone
specifically however the iphone i okay
let's just say the iphone has kind of
encouraged me to disconnect more oh
there you know it does force you into
and always-on life and there are so many
apps you can track everything from sleep
to what you're you know like there are
so many reasons to use it now that i had
like an epiphany that you know what I
need a disconnect more so I will
literally leave I will leave my phone at
home sometime whoa and just go to the
store do you have one there's no phones
you know those I want I want a simple
phone I do know the no phone is actually
just a piece of plastic there's no I'm
not there I'm not there yet but I should
be so I so even though the iPhone has
overwhelmed me with technology and
reasons to look down and ruin my neck
it's I think even more so encouraged me
to connect with people IRL I mean I
would just say for me I mean element of
thumb oh I think everyone kind of deals
with that fear of missing out and I had
it before
but I feel like the iPhone I'm taking a
dark again like yeah reinforce that
element like I'm always checking because
I'm always fearful that I'm missing
something whether it's a work email
whether it's some news update whether
it's something that's trending that's
why I feel like I always have to be on
so that yeah as dark as man it's a bit
of a drag yeah everyone has had really
insightful takes on how the iPhone has
changed their lives and I'm about to
take it into the dumps so basically to
me the iPhone has changed the way that I
use the bathroom forever I don't need to
like bring a book or a magazine in the
restroom it has changed my life I just
go in I all I needed my phone I can talk
to my friends there i watch shows on
Netflix they're all on reddit how will
you stay the bats
you got a watch I'll give you my medical
opinion that's how it's chat or do you
watch like half hours okay there's so
much worse as a bathroom sometimes I
walk to the bathroom I don't have my
phone and I'll turn back and grab it and
go back yeah okay unfortunately that's
all the time we have outs oh we're on
all the iPhone anniversary coverage
check us out seen it I'm Roger Chang I'm
Alfred Inge I'm Scott Stein and I'm
Sharon Profis thanks for listening take
it away I remind you though Matthew - or
did point out that I'm the man with a
button so I'll cut you off in a
heartbeat all right I thought you're
gonna cut out frog after a while after
the look everyone had like I said I'm
going to take this into the dump yeah no
no what nobody did warn us that was
right no one went in the porn direction
so at least that's true maybe you got
your full powers can that happen it's
definitely changed the world of porn so
yeah Matthew Thatcher says iPhones
killing the magazines and bathroom
industry was that an industry you got to
get comfortable about toilet hey Steph
joke books that you could straight up
just put like next to light yeah yeah
this is boring adulting but I was at
Home Depot looking for a new toilet roll
dispenser and there is one that includes
a shelf for an iPhone that's a minute
I really wanted to but I thought you
know trying to disconnect a charge that
would be the iPhone 8 is wireless
charging they'll develop those at all
business yeah for theaters just gonna
come up as a wireless charging TP
dispenser I like it although you know a
new charging flash charging flush
searching some flash charging
yes yikes on bikes do we have any
questions or thoughts from our viewers
there's a lot of great debate going on
back and forth between the 4 inch screen
versus those who prefer the bigger
screens and basically showcasing that
Apple if nothing else it's run the
entire gamut of how much pocket space
real estate they can occupy yeah and
found an audience to latch on to in
every place can you your chatter he's
one of your more dot has he recently
well not recently but a few months ago
reviewed original iPhone which has a 3.5
inch screen like well what did it feel
like going back to that that's green so
it's great
well the whole phone is small and you
realize that was kind of bulky right go
back to the design probably was bulky
but it was kind of awesome because I
remember taking that on well this sounds
sad now to say that took it on my
honeymoon but the thing is at the time
it wasn't bless it wasn't nice to have
it so well yeah do your work with you it
was taking a little iPod on a trip yes
and every once in a while if we needed
to check email we were able to look in a
Wi-Fi and do that right that was it or
web browsing so it wasn't like that
wasn't so not romantic but it was great
because there's a little pocket device
that could go places like a phone like a
 but but so you can actually use
with one hand it was small like it was
like a little super ice of the Gameboy
micro so that thing was awesome I think
was like a belt buckle size micro it was
a super small game I don't remember
I have a rare the like it wasn't like
that available yeah but was like I just
I always loved like super pocketable
gadgets and so yeah even though it was
bulky the iPhone did feel super portable
I feel that since then the iPhone
obviously got a bigger screen but it's
also more of a surf board where it's
very thin yeah wide and more cumbersome
whereas the original felt like a bulky
cases on their phones I think there's
jerks no they help you I know people
that have the cases that's like it's
like a giant french fry like huge and
I'm like I hate all of you why do you do
it I just use like a basic case and then
have my clear case yeah my Li del are
past that I
flash to the conductor I once dropped my
worst phone drop stories it's like my
never knock on wood or plastic cracked
but one time I got stiff wind blew by
and like my phone blew out of my hands
under a car and threw some dog poo
that's a very powerful way oh it was on
the West Side Highway the poop save it
no it just got old cry it was awful did
we did like pick it up like forensics
and how did you wipe it down over a long
period of time what's down with another
phone was there alcohol wipes I don't
know I don't know it was really
upsetting which froze it was winter is
this like frozen no back to the original
sign though like I wish they went back
to that like small screen size every
time we do podcast when our new phones
about to come on a smaller screen I just
want a smaller screen just give me a
smaller phone all these giant screens
around already and just let me like
airdrop stuff onto that and like watch
it from there I don't want just just put
more screens around everywhere else and
let me have a small thing in my pocket
like so perfect yeah it's there honestly
with that I hope that there's always
talk about whether they'll just continue
out there continue it but I think that
that should be continued to be explored
like the little yeah the little it's no
coincidence that now you have at least
what three or four newbie phone makers
making these super simple phones that
are supposed to be secondary phone yeah
and your weekend phones we released the
original iPhone was the iPhone whoa
upgrade all the specs on the screen to
keep that design honestly I would buy I
would see how it like crazy no as if
iPhones don't sell but what a productive
show we have to business idea would it
by the way would it run apps though yeah
no I mean like it's it's like the NES
classic yeah they're like a phone Oh got
it
the original iPhone was so slow because
it also ran edge it was like everything
else
a lot of that premium phones had 3G so
you actually were compromising speed oh
yeah to get the new iPhone and you'd
have to wait to hop on a low E you're
still doing that now like those radios
are slower than Android phones right
pretty much all the time
Apple is I was talking about this the
other
like Apple has always introduced a lot
of major steps in tech later than
everyone else course that's a roll in
with their roll in with an innovation
three years later they make it useful
for everyone we're like polishing in the
shop and they're like here's art here's
our variation on it right I mean they
weren't the first smartphone maker by
far right they there was years already a
mature market employed it's not for the
iPhone is not for early adopters maybe
the first one was if you were an early
adopter well yeah that one was cause
like it was super expensive right that
was earlier yeah but generally today
it's not really it's perhaps it's for
grandma and and you and I yes I'm part
of that mass of consumers yes I'm
curious what the rumors are like the
more advanced camera in the iPhone eight
whether it's gonna be like they are
ready or have some sort of lasers or
glazes you know I want to be able to
scan something like google tango there's
been it's not it's not actual users that
can kill you able to do better already
yes with that optional part which would
help with the portrait mode do you know
what I really wanted to do is something
like Blade Runner where I could take a
3d photo where you could kind of move
and edit it and do some sort of crazy
like enhance thing you can do that like
going back to dewers anything yeah
before we let the show get too far off
the rails no wait this lets farm out a
little bit from the chat Andi Cruz
hashtag courage OB says awesome dab
Sharon props to you
great mr. lizard is giving props out to
Scott's beer today since it's totally on
point I like it I don't even do anything
with it today now I'm gonna have all
sorts of mind games playing in my head
he's like what do i do how do i
replicate this let's keep going let's
move on before we get consumed
furthermore from great mr. lizard he
says the best part about the iPhone is
video watching people taking pictures of
the
phones with real cameras easiest
expanding on the concept of the what we
talked about yesterday would like this
whole fad of the bouquet effect yeah you
know everyone is also photographer now
and there's something to be said about
that but between the camera performance
and screen size that seems to be two of
the biggest arguing factors in the chat
right now about Wi-Fi in terms between
favorite model within the iPhone family
got it so I remember there's a lot of se
loyalists is a great fault
yes he is a internally fantastic I just
wish Android like OMS would take a hint
and give me smaller phones because I
want to be nice Android device do that
but the only line somewhere along the
line small phone equated cheap phone and
so they don't I have no problem with a
cheap phone they do they want to suck
they want to build big phones for you to
buy and spend more money on your big boy
that wants a small boy with cameras
we're like I hear my cameras pop I
remember the iPhone 5s was maybe the one
that at CES one year we'd be yelled at
for doing it now but like I took most of
my photos for things that I posted and
phonetics on the 5s and used them and
they were generally fine at the time and
it simply because there was always a
debate we have fantastic camera
equipment here in photographers they can
always take better photos you should do
that but it is still advancing to the
point where it on a professional level
in a pinch the top end phones can can do
some good stuff definitely and I still
wouldn't leave a main camera behind I
would say I would take the optimistic
view and say that this is only going to
push the professional photography
photography industry further like
professionals will have to be more
creative and actually you know they you
can't just get away with carrying around
a big heavy camera you have to utilize
it to the max which I mean for any
photographer worth their salt right they
probably already know this right
definitely it's a craft that they've
developed it's not just us pointing a
camera a thing
definitely greatness and in the post
editing I'm the editing as well the
post-production is even more written out
and honestly I think it makes it more
fun and creative and yeah I you even
though yes everyone can have
great camera because they have a phone
if you're flipping through Instagram you
can still see who's yeah everyone has a
great camera not everybody's taking
great photos now stop using flash to
take food photos but I eat in a cave
because he's a millennial that's
apparently what these closer to them oh
boy
so let's eat your old gen Z or what is
he doesn't have a champion TV do you
like weight today is Jen what someone
asking let's just talk about a couple of
practicalities Bataille besides cameras
and such because it's always kind of in
the power of the holder imagine soggy
says can we get a durable phone
I would love a phone where I don't need
a screen protector there you go yeah
there's a durable like do you guys do
screen protector yes ma'am I don't my
case is like super like finish I just I
the only reason why I even have this
case is because like rats grip yeah it's
like it's exactly like holding a fish
all the rabbit they don't want to make
durable phones or Sharon said things
yeah that's terrible business right
there I wish these things are supposed
to years right around when you're ready
for an upgrade it would be so expensive
I feel like water resistance this
movement with water since is one step
towards that in the sense well yeah
because at least the the major phones
now have pretty decent its you should
don't take it swimming yeah they're not
losing much by waterproofing it yeah not
falling in a lake you hit a fresh water
like okay you're spilling coffee on it
you're you know what the waterproofing
really does help with though like
selfies when you're rafting honestly
that's like
it's okay guys all right I went kayaking
last summer and I left my phone like
we're like in the car and my friend was
like I need a ziploc bag for my phone
cuz I don't want it to like get wet or
anything because I want to take photos
while we're on this like just kayak dude
yeah you don't have to like take photos
of every yes and we're getting put back
on track here question from great mr.
lizard this seems appropriate how many
times if all of you lost your phone into
the toilet zero zero what what my wife
died well when you have it in your back
pocket yep dead right did you not didn't
recover that phone did you it it was out
that almost happened to me with galaxy
s7 but that's because it's huge and it
wasn't my back and it's my back pocket
what it is water-resistant
yes but yeah it was like folding over
and almost fell in but thanks to my
quick reflexes
I broke the screen instead the toilet so
dedication how many toilets have you
lost because of your iPhones oh my god
well great mr. lizards asking where's
Ben where has been today he's out of
town oh you had to get rid of it he will
be back for our podcast next week yeah
which by the way as we're getting to the
end of the show here today yeah we just
want some important well we should
