the brookdale in an abandoned lodge with
an eerie past venture inside brush aside
the cobwebs and you'll find a doll and
teddy bear tea party carefully arranged
for a child but this child hasn't lived
here for a hundred years in the late
1800s a young girl named Sarah died here
after falling into the creek that runs
through the main dining room it said
that her ghost still haunts the lodge
the tea set and toys are so-called
trigger objects used by professional
ghost hunters like Gloria young to try
and attract spirits have you ever spoken
to sarah no I've heard her laugh though
but young also relies on off-the-shelf
technology to conduct her paranormal
research because we don't know how to
detect those or how things work and
that's why we have such a vast array of
stuff that is regular everyday stuff you
can buy on a shelf at the local
electronics radio shack we asked young
to show us her best ghost tracking tech
first up a spirit box a modified radio
which is supposed to give ghosts a voice
it will do an am/fm sweep I have the
radio frequencies in the area and if
you're patient enough and ask the right
question it will answer you Young says
she once heard her name through the
spirit box but that's why I like this
because you know you can use it you can
believe it you cannot but when I heard
my name I'm going okay there's something
to this Geiger counters measure
radiation they normally click at regular
intervals but irregular or frequent
clicks could be interpreted as a ghost
responding to your questions is anybody
there is anybody here
investigators also consider
electromagnetic field to be a sign of
ghostly presence and measure it with REM
pods k2 and try field meters so what
range would this be in for a paranormal
activity 3 and above to try to capture
visual evidence young sets up
specialized video cameras like this
full-spectrum camera and what this does
is pick up every single color so if you
see somebody say out of the corner of
your eye and you point it towards it
will pick up whatever that entity or
anomaly is but Young's prized possession
is her thermal imaging camera see how
it's still vaguely kind of red reddish
yellow yeah that's at those tables right
over there right and it shouldn't be
that way it should be cold cold cold in
here well most of the gadgets range from
20 to 200 dollars this is the priciest
at 5,000 which made me wonder could a
low-tech Ouija board do the job nobody
should use those oh really really why
cuz Ouija boards are things that you can
play with and they're fun yeah if you
open a door that you don't know how to
close sometimes it brings through things
you shouldn't be playing with I wish
ten-year-old me had known that okay
exactly ten-year-old me believed in
ghosts adult me is more of a skeptic
just don't invite me to any spooky tea
parties in Brookdale California I'm SI
me das cnet for CBS News</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
