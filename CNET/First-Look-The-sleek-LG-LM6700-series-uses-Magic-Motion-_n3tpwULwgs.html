and I'm sitting with the LG LM 6700 this
is a 55 inch LCD TV there's also a 47
inch member of the series this review
will apply to both this is a mid-range
TV in LG's 2012 lineup it's actually the
least expensive to include it's LED plus
local dimming which should improve black
levels but we'll get to that in a little
bit the other nice thing about this TV
is it's also the least expensive with
it's really thin bezel so if you look at
the edge of this TV it's about five
millimeters from the edge of the picture
to the edge of the frame the frame
itself is wrapped in this sort of silver
ribbon and along the bottom the silver
gets quite a bit wider where you can see
the LG logo here another unique part of
this TV design is the silver ribbons
stand along the bottom here this
actually keeps the TV suspended sort of
floating above the surface that it's on
the stand also swivels so all told this
is one of the sleeker looking and more
unique looking TVs we've seen in a long
time
another feature unique to LG is this
magic motion remote sort of like a
Nintendo Wiimote
LG doesn't include a standard remote you
only get the magic motion but it does
work very well I kind of summons the
cursor as soon as you pick it up and you
can go to the home menu very quickly and
as you can see the menu system takes
full advantage of the magic motion to
actually found really precise and easy
to navigate this new menu system so the
response time is really good again we
were pretty impressed by this remote on
the downside this remote doesn't control
all the devices like cable boxes so
you're gonna have to make a decision if
you're used to using a single universal
remote LG Smart TV system has pretty
solid content for audio and video
although it lacks Amazon Instant as well
as Pandora we appreciated there's a 3d
world app that includes a few of pieces
of demo content nothing you've heard of
however there's also an app store
generally that's pretty bad the
selection of apps is a little bit less
than quality we've seen on Panasonic and
Samsung for example there's also a web
browser which actually worked better
than any other TV but based web browsers
we've seen although it's of course worse
than the one in your tablet or
smartphone so we doubt most people will
use it on the connectivity front this
set does include built-in Wi-Fi which is
a nice touch around back you'll find
four HDMI as well as a PC input for VGA
sources there's also a single analog
input that can accept either component
or composite video via breakout cable on
the picture quality front it was a
little bit
pointing with the performance of this LG
compared to last year's model it's black
levels are relatively light and it's
shadow detail not quite as good it also
has a relatively reflective screen so
again unlike last year's models that
were matte it does tend to reflect in
room lighting relatively brightly on the
plus side it does have a pretty accurate
color there's plenty of controls oh they
didn't work quite as well as they did
last year so all told the 2d performance
of this TV isn't quite we expected for
the price level there's also a 3d
capability on this TV that actually
performed very well in terms of
crosstalk we did see some artifacts
caused by that passive 3d but you have
to look pretty close and or sit pretty
close to see most of them the set also
includes six pairs of 3d glasses which
is one of the benefits of having a
passive 3d system of course your whole
family can enjoy 3d whereas with active
sets you got to spend a lot of money on
3d glasses that's a quick look at LG's
LM 6700 series I'm Dave cafmeyer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
