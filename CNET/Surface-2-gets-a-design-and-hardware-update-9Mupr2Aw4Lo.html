a look at the brand new microsoft
surface to this is the second generation
of Microsoft Windows RT tablet and there
are some pretty significant differences
compared to the original surface tablet
of this new version it's a little bit
thinner it's a little bit lighter
physically it's got this kickstand on
the back you remember from the first
time but now it opens up to a second
angle which makes a little bit easier to
use on your lap or if you're looking
from from a little bit higher up and of
course you can click it back to the
original angle like that as well inside
its got the next generation of nvidia
tegra processors and the screen has been
updated this is now a 1920 x 1080 screen
and it's got it's a more color accurate
screen than the original surface in fact
both the new surface 2 and the surface
pro 2 have the same upgraded screen now
one of my favorite parts of the entire
surface line is back and that's the
keyboard covers there's a touch cover
and a type cover this is the new touch
cover right here and it's actually
thinner than the original and it's
backlit the type cover is also backlit
it comes in a variety of colors still
snaps on just like this and then when
you close it you've got a very compact
package you can take with you there's
still webcams on the front and back
those have been improved as well and
you're going to be able to get the new
surface 2 at the end of October starting
at 449 i'm dan ackerman and that is the
microsoft surface 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
