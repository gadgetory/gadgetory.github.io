collection of rare apps I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your CNET update just
a week after the strange flappy bird app
soared to popularity it's now been
removed from the App Store's by its
creator the game hit the top of the
charts for iTunes in Google Play
but the Vietnamese developer took it
down after tweeting that he's
uncomfortable with the attention that
he's received for this game and he just
can't take it anymore
or so he says in a previous interview he
said that he was making good money from
the game with ad revenue making as much
as fifty thousand dollars a day the
point of the game is to tap the screen
to make your bird fly between green
pipes that look just like the pipes from
a Mario game the Creator says that he
did not pull it off the iTunes and
Google Play Store because of legal
issues as some have suspected Nintendo
may have come after him for copying the
look of the elements in the game it's
not clear how flappy bird got so popular
this was a free poorly designed game
that was addictive and tricky in the
same fashion as a carnival game you know
it seems like it should be easy but then
when you fail quickly you get really
annoyed and you want to try again and
again and again thinking of course you
can get better some also speculate that
he may have used fake reviews and bots
to increase his download numbers to get
media attention it all seems a little
fishy maybe he couldn't take the guilt
of faking his way to the top or perhaps
pulling the app was just another stunt
to give him more attention for his next
game on eBay you can now find people
selling iPhones and iPads with flappy
bird installed as if it makes the device
more valuable because it's a collector's
item you have to wonder if this starts a
trend of people collecting deleted apps
but this game was so simple to make
there are dozens of games that you can
download for free that are a clone of
flappy bird
there's flappy pig in the Google Play
Store there's flappy fish on Windows and
flappy beat on the iPhone there's even a
mock one that you can play on the
desktop it's called flappy Doge
themed after the internet meme many
pipes such difficulty so pointless Wow
in other news Samsung just unveiled a
new design for the current Galaxy s4 and
s4 mini it's a new black edition with a
fake leather textured back cover and
bezel and all the accessories are black
but don't rush to buy it just yet
because in only a few weeks
Samsung is expected to show off the next
model the Galaxy s5 that takes place on
February 24th during the Mobile World
Congress Expo taking place in Barcelona
