she's so lucky
you
be
what's good brian Tong here and welcome
to the apple byte it's the end of the
year and it's the perfect time to talk
about 2016 and really the highs and lows
for Apple this year now we're not trying
to pile on but we're gonna look at this
objectively so follow along if you can
take it now 2016 was the year where
Apple truly lost its shine if you've
been an apple fan during their heyday or
if you've been a fan of tech who admired
them from a distance or if you just
started loving apple with your first
iphone you gotta admit 2016 was the year
where Apple lost its mojo now they might
get it back but there is no dispute that
this is a different company moving
forward so if you watched our 2016
predictions show from last year
everything I predicted pretty much
happened in unfortunately that's not a
good thing 2016 was the year of
iterations and very little exciting
innovation maybe that's what's really
missing Apple isn't an exciting company
anymore but maybe they can change that
in 2017 so let's break it down first up
the Apple watch series 2 in this year
unless you really need a GPS on your
watch I wanted to swim with it you can
just keep your first gen with the same
battery life form factor while also
running the same OS in fact watch os3
was the best thing about the Apple watch
this year and it was more of an
admission that they did it all wrong the
first time around now reports say Apple
watch sales fell 71 percent in the third
quarter of 2016 compared to that same
quarter last year and Apple still won't
give us sales numbers ouch all right now
the iphone 7 the crown jewel and money
maker for Apple is still its bread and
butter they took out the headphone jack
to promote a wireless future it's still
a great phone but what hurts even more
declining iphone sales for three
straight quarters this year ouch that's
another low and that wireless future was
directly linked to the Apple earpods
honestly it was their most innovative
product of the year purely because of
the w1 chip and how it makes sinking
unlike anything we've seen before but
just because its innovative didn't mean
it looked good with the design that was
really brutally mocked by many beauty is
in the eye of the beholder but the
promise of a wireless future was delayed
by two months and by the time it got
here you still have to use your phone
for most of the controls sea air pods
are good
just not great and that's the best new
product you released the entire year and
you continue to brag and tell the
industry you're the best at what you do
you know what you start looking a little
cuckoo now this could have been a high
point but it was an example of how
things have changed Apple was the king
of execution and I know this is a tough
business but I can't call them the King
anymore all right let's go on to the new
macbook pro with apples touch bar that
took away ports added hard disk speed
but stuck you with normal processing
power and was sold at yes a premium
price touch bar reaction was mixed it's
been done before by other companies but
not in Apple's way will still wait to
see if any apps can really make it as
special as they say but the one thing
you're not hearing is people still
raving about it see reviewing it for a
week is a lot different than owning it
for a month or more okay the ipad pro
gave us a true tone display arguably
apples second best new innovation of the
year taking ambient light sensors and
adapting the display to match the light
in your environment but the ipad feels
really behind especially compared to
what microsoft is doing with the service
pro like the lack of any type of hybrid
OS with a mac OS and iOS we'll just keep
holding it back from doing more than it
can and a pencil alone is not going to
change that okay opportunities missed in
2016 Apple couldn't make a TV
subscription service happen and instead
brought us their TV app that would be
amazing if every TV network and cable
provider and service like Netflix and
Amazon made a deal with them to work
with it except they don't want to see
sling TV PlayStation view and DirecTV
now are doing it and making real money
from it but Apple isn't and did you see
what Microsoft did with the surface
studio they threw down now that's a
truly inspired design and a real
innovative concept it's just a start for
them and that's the type of stuff Apple
used to do instead Mac Pro users are
wondering why their pro machine hasn't
seen a single update in over three years
three years people and now onto the home
assistant amazon was the one that came
up with the next platform and product
for consumers with the echo a year and a
half ago Google home is now in the mix
and these AI speakers are awesome and
where is Apple with this well you can do
some home automation from the phone but
I'm already
using an echo apple also scrapped their
initial smart car plans they don't have
anything in the virtual reality space
but they have publicly committed to
augmented reality and we might just see
it as a software feature add on to the
iphone so what do we know Apple will
still sell millions of units of things
it's what they do but don't forget Apple
is exciting and innovative before they
sold millions of things now 2016 was the
year you really felt like they were
behind competitors and it's going to
take more than an amazing new iphone to
change that but you know what it can
help now I know what the glory days of
Apple felt like and they are nowhere
close to that right now and for the sake
of competition and innovation all of us
should hope that changes in 2017 all
right that's going to do it for this
week's show you can email us at the
apple byte at cnet com or to me at Brian
Tom let me know if you thought 2016 was
a good or bad year for Apple thanks so
much for watching we'll catch y'all next
time for another bite of the Apple
