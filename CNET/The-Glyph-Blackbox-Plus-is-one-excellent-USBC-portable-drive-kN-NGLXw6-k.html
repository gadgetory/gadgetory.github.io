peugeot drive from cliff now it's black
and it's a box so there's not much to
elaborate on there but this right in
this has a lot of pluses for example is
made of full metal casing here very
solid and it comes with this rubber case
too to keep it safe from drops obviously
you soon drop it but if you accidentally
do chances that the data will be ok now
the draw has a USB C port here and
support USB point gen 2 which has the
top speed of 10 gigabit per second it
includes 2 cables so one regular USB C
for use with a computer that has a USB C
port and the other one us PC to SPI
cable that works with all existing
computer now no matter what cable you
use the dry is fast in my testing with
USB 3.1 it has the sustain will will
copy a speed of almost 150 megabyte per
second for writing and almost hundred
sixty megabyte per second for waiting
now those are the faster that was seen
for a regular purple Drive that houses a
regular hard drive on the inside but the
drive here is also available with SSD or
solicited option which will be a lot
faster but of course at higher cost and
speaking of cost the driver is not too
expensive for example this one terabyte
capacity here of hard drive can be held
for $120 is also available in 500
gigabyte and to tear by for hard drive
or 512 gigabyte and one tear by for some
estate options now if you computer they
have USB see this drive here is not a
must buy but if you're looking for a
fast rocket compact purple hard drive
that works well now and also future
proof you cannot go wrong with this
black box plus here again though do not
cow on the drop resistant feature I have
a lot of rugged portable drives for the
last time I draw well a lady had a hard
nice stretch but maybe that because I'm
Domo and this is the black box plus
purple drive Punk Lee</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
