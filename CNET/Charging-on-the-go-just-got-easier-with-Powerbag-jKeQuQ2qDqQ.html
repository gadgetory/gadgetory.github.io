unveil we're looking at the power bag if
you've got too many gadgets and they're
all running out of juice this product
charges them on the go this is this is a
must-have product yes run run for every
resident the president this company's
called RFA we got power back in my
charge so we're talking about power back
today and what power bag is is basically
a bag that has a battery system built
into it already the premise over here is
you basically open the side over here
you have an outlet over here you plug
your this is just a regular outlet that
comes with the back power supply you
plug the bag in it charges so the lights
flash when it's charging when it's fully
charged bottom line was what happens
over here is you going to you open your
bag you have pockets over here so you
have a pocket for your for your charger
but you have these individual pockets
for your Apple device for your micro
your micro devices you also have a
female USB that you can hook something
else that you may have like a tablet
it'll charge your your tablet's your
iPad's it'll charge pretty much any
handheld device but not a laptop it
won't charge a laptop because laptop
battery is too expensive and it would
add the way to the laptop battery to
what is the battery way in this thing I
mean this one happens to be a 3000 the
battery that comes with this device is a
little bit bigger than this so as you
can see you can feel the weight it's not
very very happy to look the miin
technology I'm sorry lithium polymer
technology I'm on the camera so I so
bottom line with this what's really
really cool about this bag was that's
for the back the fact that it will keep
you like charged all the time you have
an option on this bag to have tone for
voice what does it mean tone of voice if
you plug the bag in to charge you plug
in the device it will make a sound but
if you pick the voice that will speak to
you in 12 languages everything from
Hindi Mandarin wait wait wait wait wait
this bag talks innovative charge exactly
if you press the button to see what your
charges on your bag in your bag is a
50-percent it'll tell you that's are
using the fifty percent a critical
feature if you're plugging in an Apple
device no it's cool
it's critical that squid cool it's good
if you plug in your Apple device and
they'll tell you charging your
applicable I so it tells you what it's
doing and then if you want to shut up
you can turn it on okay how much is it
and where do you get it 139 this bag is
going to be launched in June but today
our existing line up our bags which are
super cool our ad you got can get them
at best buy you can get them over at
state I'm sorry it's officemax and some
other retailers as well fries it's
called the power back power back right
