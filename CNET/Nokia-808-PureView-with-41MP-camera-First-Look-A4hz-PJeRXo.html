at the Nokia 808 PureView phone this is
an unlocked phone but it is available
from Amazon in the US it will cost you
about $700 now why would anybody want to
spend $700 on this phone well the big
draw is the camera it can technically
take photos up to 41 megapixels but most
of the time you're really going to
resolve your pictures in 5 megapixels or
8 megapixels and then use the fancy
zooming and that's how you get your 41
megapixels of information so suffice it
to say that the pictures on here are
pretty amazing and this is a very unique
phone with a very unique camera there
are also some more creative modes on
here for the more serious photographer
so you can do a lot with this phone in
terms of the camera now what about
beyond the camera well there is the body
of the phone of course the design the
camera does take up a lot of space
mostly because the lens on here is
actually physically much larger than you
would find on your regular 5 megapixel
or 8 megapixel camera and that's what
gives the camera its edge however it
does also add a really big bump so the
phone feels pretty balanced in the hand
it is a little bit heavier but this is
definitely not slipping into pocket it's
very easily the phone comes in this
white color which I pretty much like
it's got a four inch screen on it not
too small by most standards however I
did find the typing on the virtual
keyboard very cramped and that could
just be styled the keyboard it runs
Symbian Belle as its operating system
and if you are familiar with Symbian
then you'll find that this will be a
little bit of a bump up from the
previous version if you're not familiar
with Symbian OS it's going to offer you
a little bit of a learning curve I
didn't think it's very hard but if
you're coming from another smartphone
operating system and you're using this
it will definitely take some time to
relearn what goes where and how
everything operates there are two
external features I'm going to call out
the first is this dedicated HDMI out
port which makes it really easy to plug
into your TV the second is that the
camera does turn into a very bright
flashlight when you pull and hold down
on the screen unlock button on this
nokia has always been ahead of the curve
with NFC there is NFC on the 808
PureView so you can do anything from yes
mobile payments but you can also tap to
pair two Bluetooth devices and various
other things there are sixteen gigabytes
of storage here on this phone so that's
pretty good there's also an expandable
memory slot so that you can add more
most people I think will be interested
in a peer view because of the camera and
it is quite unique but unless you're a
Symbian diehard and unless you have $700
laying around for an unlocked phone on
an operating system that you're not
familiar with then I would skip this one
it is pricey but very fascinating
experiment I'm Jessica's all courtesy
net this is the Nokia 808 PureView</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
