probably didn't know about the Power
Rangers this is a packed video so let's
get right to it at number five Lord Zedd
has no Japanese analogue you're probably
aware that the Power Ranger shows were
essentially re-edited Japanese programs
but did you know that Lord Zedd was an
American creation and has no counterpart
in Japan two stories at number four
Tommy Oliver has been six different
Rangers Tommy Oliver played by Jason
David Frank has been in a lot of
different power ranger series and has
worn a lot of different costumes he was
the Green Power Ranger the White Power
Ranger the white ninja Ranger the red
Zeo Ranger the red turbo Ranger and the
black Dino Ranger also at some point he
gets his doctorate and is referred to as
dr. Tommy Oliver and Dino Thunder I'm
not making that up at number three the
dispute that kicked out three Rangers
remember in season two have Jason Trini
and Zach just go off to a peace
conference in Switzerland and
transferred their powers to three new
Rangers the real-world reason for this
was a three actors playing Jason Tree
and Zach wanted to be part of a union
and earn more money so they were fired
and replaced for eight episodes the show
used recycled footage and body doubles
to cover for the actors disappearance
and number two the White Ranger was nine
years old in the original series from
Japan Gosai sin ti Rangers the White
Ranger is known as the Kiba Ranger he's
actually a nine-year-old boy who pulls a
talking sword out of the stone which
made him to Kiba Ranger his Kiba changer
gives him an adult form and get this for
the first few episodes the other Rangers
don't know who the Kiba Ranger is and
his sword would speak for him
the sword also helped the nine-year-old
fight monsters before we get to number
one let's rank the top five Power
Rangers television series for this I
asked an expert my six-year-old son at
number five is Power Rangers rpm or is
dino thunder three is Dino charge two is
mystic force and a number one of course
is Mighty Morphin Power Rangers back to
the trivia and the number one thing you
probably didn't know about the Power
Rangers is the Bryan Cranston connection
in the original Mighty Morphin Power
Rangers
Cranston did voiceover work as some of
the villains this isn't the case of two
actors having the same name this is the
same Bryan Cranston known for Breaking
Bad and Malcolm in the Middle
on Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Cranston
also claims that the original Blue
Ranger was named after him so that's why
his name is Billy Cranston more top five
to go go to top five cnet.com Amaya's
act higher and I'm sorry I said that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
