and there are a lot of you out there
that have access to Apple's OS 10
Yosemite beta program but you should not
be installing it as your primary OS that
would be dumb so I'm going to show you
how to partition your hard drive in it's
pretty easy all you have to do first is
let's just jump into your Applications
folder then find the utilities folder
open that and the app you want to launch
is Disk Utility now on the left hand
column you'll see your listed hard
drives and select the one you want to
add a partition to we're basically
separating the hard drive some people do
this to load multiple operating systems
and other people do this to organize
their hard drive for a media file
management now once you have selected
the hard drive of your choice you'll see
a few options on the right-hand side and
you want to click on partition and we'll
show you the current capacity of your
hard drive and if you look at the bottom
corner you'll see a plus button to add a
partition click on that and you'll now
see two partitions and you can slide
this bar up and down to create the size
of the partition you want based on how
much hard drive space you still have
available OS 10 Yosemite takes about 15
to 20 gigs so you want more than that
you'll also be able to name this new
partition as well when you're good to go
hit apply and voila your hard drive will
now be partitioned then all you have to
do is when you run the OS 10 Yosemite
beta installer is select a new partition
you created as the destination and
booyah you can now run the OS 10 beta
side by side with Mavericks on your
other partition
I'm Brian Tong for cnet.com and there's
your how-to far partitioning your hard
drive on a Mac use it wisely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
