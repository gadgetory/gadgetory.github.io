brand new segment that we'd like to
debut on open tab okay yeah it's called
oh you want to introduce you know
exactly we get to see so many things is
not always time to cover it yeah but
maybe if we can kind of slip it in at
the tail end I thought it was a good
idea and and and Brian helped me slip it
in okay anyway don't read too much into
that here's a segment we're gonna call
Joe and tell it's like it says oh good
Joe what do you have for us today it
looks like some weird steampunk lizard
what is this this is called this is what
this isn't kindergarten what this is
called the gecko ba it's up just under
200 pieces okay and I built this lupus
with my man Brian Van Gelder and how
much time in the day Brian probably
doesn't sleep for god sakes Brian
doesn't go home popular drinks and and
and making little check it out here's a
here's a time lapse of youth for people
viewing this when did they make me this
video this is amazing these guys are so
much more productive oh and I've ever
been so basically I look at it go oh
that's a good video and look at that you
know an eagerness or I guess our
exuberance we started cutting tubes a
little prematurely so I'm thinking maybe
that some of them may be a little short
and it's not getting quite all the
oxygen it needs to the feet so basically
what this can do it has it has a motor
okay so it can not only walk on a flat
surface
oh it not only walk on a flat surface
much steps but when built properly yeah
it's supposed to be able to scale oh
whoa yeah well yeah you can see it's a
gecko like you're like that like so I
think so engineering issues on mine and
Brian's Park which is why I'm pretty bad
very loud he's kind of like a gimp
Godzilla you're the loudest forever he's
my friend but what is made out of
Connect so it's like small plastic
pieces and the joints are held together
by these little orange pushpins so the
tubes really have so this air there yeah
there there's air being pumped to the
suctions and it keeps foot I see
Wow you can make seven different
creations from the one set you can make
like really you can make like a phone
holder a suction phone holder like a
suction gun in our inchworm and a couple
other things what is the set it's it's
Lego it's called gecko bot it's not
available yet
it will be available later this month at
Michael's Amazon really cold and Toys R
Us sort of hobby an old object well I
thought it'd be cool a kid my initial
goal was to probably you and we could
probably would have worked yes I was
gonna build it with my son but I had
that little stretch where I was sick and
it just didn't happen so Brian and I had
to kind of get it built second son my
Robin Hood very cool all right and what
is this gonna go forward you say I'm
49.95 it should be available it should
be available later this month it's I
mean I've I've stuck it on glass it's
stuck I've pulled it I've dropped it the
only thing that I'm a little concerned
about is once you make this particular
configuration because if the hose comes
in one piece right I'm not certain if
you can make all the others once you cut
down the piece of not see because I'm
not sure yeah I'm not sure the length of
hose you need for each individual bill
that's the one thing I didn't find out
but I'm very cool man
when the stickers you could with two
choices of eyes that both these eyes are
a little friendlier so yeah oh please
so and I mean if you look can we get a
gonna will to the camera like if you
look there's little like um see the
little air pockets right here so with
you so basically this one sucks air from
this one when it releases from there
it's actually pretty genius I think it's
something cool for like a father son or
father daughter a mother daughter mother
son to do it of course anybody
Aaron and kids yeah even it's great or
just kids or just parents well it says
for eight you eight year olds eight and
up um I think maybe I was a little too
far up yeah that's why we're all in that
up category Oh walk right I don't use
the hoses at all it just means the
suctions won't exactly okay alright I
got it it looks pretty nice how long did
this take Rob you're like I've made me
maybe like an hours oh wow it may have
been longer because you know when you're
just sitting there around like I
said we got a little premature with
cutting the hose so like I noticed that
like you know there may not be there may
be some air restriction going to a
couple it's okay a couple of the feet so
hey if anyone anyone who get to just the
measure out the hose also we had that
you know we translated from centimeters
doing to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
