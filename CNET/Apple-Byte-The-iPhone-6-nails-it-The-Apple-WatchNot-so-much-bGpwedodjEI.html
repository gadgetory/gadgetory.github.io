the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple after
Apple's iPhone and I watch event Oh
I mean Apple watch Apple watch and
they'll tell me you haven't done that
since the keynote now every time i watch
an apple announcer you sued again what
no I I didn't I was actually saying I
and watch as two separate words all
right so let's get to it and there
weren't too many surprises with the new
iPhone 6 and the highly questionable
naming of the iPhone 6 plus seriously
why not something like the iPhone big 6
e yeah yeah Apple call me okay now it's
super slim six point nine millimeters
slim for the iPhone six there's a second
generation a eight processor a new m8
processor and the whole new camera it's
still at 8 megapixels we're surprised we
didn't get more megapixels but there's a
new image sensor and video enhancements
and finally a 128 gig option but the
real debate for most of you comes down
to getting the 6 are going large with a
6 plus really outside of the larger and
we mean a larger 5.5 inch screen the two
main things you'll be getting with the
plus is optical image stabilization for
the camera and roughly two to three
hours more battery juice when you're
using LTE or watching videos and if
you're wondering where is that rumored
sapphire screen not here
the only sapphire you'll find on the
iPhone 6 is the camera lens
well that's until the iPhone 6s SS comes
out which stands for sessi sapphire
screen and the award for the guy with
the biggest rocks goes to Tommy from
super evil Megacorp who rocked a purple
scarf during a demo friends don't let
friends wear purple scarves during Apple
demos unless your Tommy now pre-orders
for the iPhone 6 and 6 plus are on
Friday September the 12th and the
phone's go on sale September the 19th
and iOS 8 Apple's next mobile OS will be
released on September the 17th two days
before the new phones go on sale now the
biggest news from the keynote that I
cared about wasn't the Apple watch which
we'll get to it
was Apple pay finally Apple delivered on
making the deals to build a real working
digital wallet for the US market now
it's going to take some time for people
to get comfortable with it but the big a
has plenty of partners ranging from
Macy's to Whole Foods a healthiest
grocery store and leading provider of
organic food and only in California at
an Apple Keynote will Whole Foods get an
applause like that I mean what about
Subway subway home of the five dollar
footlong where were there tears and
McDonald's you know everything good and
oily in this world comes from Mickey D's
they should have been the ones people
were cheering for now Apple pay is going
to be integrated into apps for payments
as long as it works like Apple is
showing us it will and it will be part
of an iOS 8 Update in October I'm
excited about this and really 2005 in
Japan will finally be 2014 in the US and
the Apple watch don't call it the iWatch
because an extra syllable makes a
difference look at how happy Tim Cook
and company were they were so happy now
when I first saw it I thought it's not
round but it looks good better than I
thought it would the numerous wrist
straps sizes and styles really give a
unique personal feel that other
smartwatches really haven't captured yet
and it actually looks pretty nice but
then it also kind of looks like the
Samsung Galaxy gear just fine-tuned
polished and made with more precision
and care I'm sorry guys someone had to
tell you now the best thing about this
gadget by far is its unique user
interface using the digital crown the
worst part of the UI calling it a
digital crown Apple you're not tricking
us it's ok you can call it a dial now
they're focusing on the fact that it's
an accurate timepiece and it's going to
be great for fitness so you can do this
thing like this guy the calories you've
burned that gives you the best overview
of how active you
and then there's this because you wear
it we invented new intimate ways to
connect and communicate directly from
your wrist excuse me Tim is there
something that you know that I don't
know with digital touch we've developed
an entirely new way for you to connect
intimately with others you can get
someone's attention with a gentle tap
you can send a quick sketch or you can
even share something as personal as your
own heartbeat okay so it's a minimum
$700 to share my heartbeat with my lady
or my buddies I'm totally in no I'm
messing with you all but I went into the
keynote wondering if Apple could
convince me that I really need a
SmartWatch in they still have it now
there's a lot of people that will always
want Apple's newest shiny toy and I'm
one of them as long as I actually have a
reason to use that toy now the Apple
watch starts at 349 I repeat starts and
that's with a smaller woman's size so if
you're a guy you probably want the
full-sized watch that will cost more and
then if you're going to get that 18
karat gold Apple watch Edition for your
boo that's gonna be at least $500 but at
least the jewelry box it comes with
doubles as a charger now I know you can
use it to control your Apple TV it's
water-resistant but not waterproof you
can send walkie talkie like messages and
there's a lot more to learn until it's
released in 2015
oh and this it's a new innovative
intimate way to communicate directly
from your wrist yeah that's but here's
how I look at the Apple watch here
either thinking this is Apple's newest
tech masterpiece and I have to have it
while ignoring that this watch still
requires an iPhone and there was no
mention of battery life but early
reports are saying about a day I will
buy it to try it out and dig into it but
I still don't see myself using this
every day if I'm wrong I'll let you know
but I'll wait until the next generation
and before we go just like we've done in
the past we'd like to have a moment of
silence for the dear friend that we lost
at this most recent Kino
you will be missed iPod Classic with
your soft edges and one-of-a-kind click
wheel alright that's gonna do it for
this week's show
now I want to know what you thought
about the Apple watch send me your
emails to the Apple bite at cnet.com or
tweet me at brian tong and we'll post
some of them in next week's show thanks
so much for watching and we'll catch you
all next time for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
