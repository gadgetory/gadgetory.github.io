this sound you've got a oh well these
days you've got too much mail and a o L
is back with a plan to help sort through
the mess with an app called Alto here's
the concept
Alto pulls in your emails from multiple
accounts
it can be a o L Yahoo Gmail even your
work exchange and it's gonna scan your
emails for keywords to automatically
filter them into categories that way you
could just see emails with a photo or
just see emails with a file attachment
there are also filters for shopping
travel finance and social media the
dream of an empty inbox is dead
so AOL sees the next solution for email
as being able to organize it all without
you needing to do anything the concept
sounds great but an early demo I tried
had some hiccups anything with the word
ticket or reservation went into travel
even a yoga class I reserved but it did
not pick up on the hotel reservation
email my husband forwarded me and for
some reason some sort of crock-pot
recipe spam was showing up and travel a
CNET colleague noticed similar issues
with his test anything with the word
subscribe or shipment was going into his
shopping filter including a news alert
for a crime story but there's a second
part to the app that also has some cool
potential it's called dashboard it
highlights important incoming alerts for
things like flights hotels car rentals
and package shipments into a deck of
cards it's just like Google now except
you don't need Gmail the apps creator
said in an interview that this could
also highlight coupons or sales that may
be expiring soon if also sounds familiar
that's because it should Al originally
launched alto mail com three years ago
as a way to manage multiple emails from
a single website but with an invite-only
launch and no mobile app it flopped and
went nowhere this is a reboot that
focuses more on highlighting those
emails that may be important to you that
is if it can be smart enough to fish out
the right emails that's it for this tech
news update I'm Bridget Carey you can
stay on top the biggest stories
