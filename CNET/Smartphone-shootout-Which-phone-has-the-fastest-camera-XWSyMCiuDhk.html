they're more camera than a phone they
boast about their megapixels or slap
some filters on the screen so your
selfie doesn't look so scotchy but let's
get real sometimes it matters most is
how fast you can open that camera
because baby's first steps aren't going
to wait for you to enter in a lock
screen password a few of the latest
smartphones brag about camera shortcuts
take the Moto X for example which says
it's motion trick is so quick you'll
never miss a shot but is it really that
much faster than other phone cameras
there's only one way to settle the
matter we need to have ourselves a smart
phone shutter showdown a test to see how
quick each phone can aim and shoot from
sleep mode the first showdown is between
two smart phones that are more like
cameras with an identity crisis there's
the Nokia Lumia 1020 a Windows Phone
with a whopping 41 megapixel camera
nokia lers in the photo enthusiasts with
an optional $80 camera case it's got a
dedicated shutter button but guess what
you still need to enter in your password
before taking a photo and the case
itself needs to be charged or it won't
work
so just avoid it because we don't need
no stinking cases the Lumia has a
built-in shutter button that also pulls
up Nokia's pro camera but you still need
to enter in that password which will
slow you down going up against the Lumia
is the Samsung Galaxy s4 zoom it's
unique from other galaxy models and that
it has an actual 10x zoom lens for its
16 megapixel camera you might think
waiting for the lens to extend would
slow you down but actually it's the
galaxy software that is the biggest pain
the galaxy s4 models offer no shortcut
to skip the password to take a photo
when you're in a rush after averaging
multiple time tests the Lumia came in
faster than the galaxy s4 zoom and it
was even faster than the standard galaxy
s4 without the zoom lens slow Samsung is
not the phone to capture that fleeting
moment the Lumia costs $100 more than
most smartphones so it's next showdown
is with a much cheaper underdog the
BlackBerry z10 unfair fight you say well
sure blackberry isn't known for
cameras and this one has a modest eight
megapixel shooter but blackberry ended
up beat just slightly faster but
blackberry still finds a way to slow you
down skipping the password involves the
annoying process of holding down a
camera shortcut key the blackberry z10
moves on to showdown with another phone
that doesn't get much attention the HTC
One this Android powerhouse is a fancy
pants with its metal design and
quad-core processor it thinks it's above
normal megapixels and instead has ultra
pixels but when it comes to speed this
fella is fast just wake it up drag the
camera icon to skip the password and tap
that shutter button it clocked in at
roughly two seconds faster than the
BlackBerry so no more horsing around
it's time to put the HTC one against the
crowd favorite iPhone 5 it's eight
megapixel iSight camera is also known
for being fast the iPhone has a similar
method to the HTC One just wake it up
slide the camera icon and tap that
on-screen shutter button this was real
close the iPhone 5 ended up being just
slightly faster coming in at just under
four seconds that brings us to the Moto
X Google's darling this builds in
America phone has the No Touch trick of
activating the 10 megapixel camera by
twisting your wrist twice like you're
opening a jar and you can also take a
photo by touching anywhere on the screen
there's no finding power buttons or
dragging icons if you can master the
twist and tap combo then you would be no
faster than the iPhone 5 because these
phones clocked in at a virtual tie we
even added a focus test to try and break
the tie the Moto X has the advantage of
focusing the same time that you touch to
take the photo and the iPhone 5 needs
you to top the screen first then hit
another icon but yet again the iPhone
and Moto X were the same when it comes
to capturing that lightning fast toddler
are grabbing that spontaneous
once-in-a-lifetime moment twisting isn't
any faster than sliding an icon to
unlock the iPhone 5 and Moto X are the
quickest cameras of the bunch for CNET
