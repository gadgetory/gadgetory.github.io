Cheng good morning guys how are we

you're out there and YouTube and you can
see us but let bless your heart yeah see
her heart let us know can't wait Wow oh
you're right the common comment section
they we can't guess what I'm trying to
cue up right now without without the
livestream dashboard where I'm just
getting errors on our account I can't
tell you all right well you may not be
like yeah thank you for joining us
thanks for listening either way right
this is thrilling this is this is like
that cat in the box that you don't know
if it's rode it for strangers cat right
we didn't know the ice is alive or dead
ha ha ha ha we may be talking to a
summoner he's full of dead bodies ha
that's really dark I know we took a dark
so early the week luckily we know
there's league on lives though yeah sure
I can more horrible or there could be a
100 blister right now going why are they
talking about shredders cat alright so
for those of you who are listening just
in case your listing we will be talking
about Samsung yeah the galaxy note 7
because it's the story that won't die
even if stencil wants to die it is
blowing up hey actually we are live all
right hey horrible joke may we have I
want to send out just a big apology and
thank you to everyone who has tuned in
under the incorrect moniker it not I
know it says he apple byte crunchy
podcast there is some know there's some
error there's some error going on in the
back end of YouTube and luckily I'm able
to patch in from a back back end so the
stream is live we apologize to you who
we have tricked into Oh watching us we
are not that of a surprise talk and more
strongly we apologize to brian Tong this
was our x afterwards but we are today
talking about apple and a son and lastly
a little shout-out to our road trip
package that's right the interview I had
with a UN
secretary-general so so we are still
cnet we are still talking tech we're
still taking your questions we are not
brian Tong we are not the apple byte the
metadata I cannot control at my current
time and I apologize for that so thanks
for sticking around otherwise go ahead
and take off we understand no hard
feelings and have a good day yes our
star Bryan yeah let's go let's move
quickly on this one so we don't squat
the apple byte for too long yes so long
all right let's go ahead and record our
podcast yep and in three two welcome to
the 359 when we talk about the top tech
news of the day and all the other crap
we want to throw in I'm Roger Cheng i'm
ben fox or even so sometimes being the
fastest doesn't mean being best and it's
haste to get the galaxy note 7 out
before the iphone 7 samsung may have
rushed the processed and pressure to
suppliers to meet ever tighter deadlines
as a result causing this this berry
debacle that we're seeing now yeah I
mean Ben is this a surprise to you no it
makes perfect sense and its really
really unfortunate I mean the other
problem is is this is an unforced error
on Samsung's part because if they didn't
rush it and they could have
strategically taken the tact of letting
the iphone come out first threat and
then surprising and delighting people
with a much better phone afterwards but
their strategy wise let's let's try to
steal apples thunder before they even
come out with the iphone 7 and that was
part of the problem right obviously like
looking back that seems to be a pretty
bad strategy but do you think the idea
of sort of jumping the gun and kind of
beating Apple to the punch was a good
strategy to begin with I think that if
it were to work it could have been
really really effective everybody it's
like the reviews across the board seem
to be really really good for the note
7pb I'm really excited about it it came
off of the s7's the galaxy s7 so things
seem to be really clicking for samsung
so this seemed like it should have been
a really good move but instead of blew
up in their faces right I mean quite
literally and yeah like they I mean they
had you know cutting edge tech dad and I
were scanner yeah glass glass while it
doesn't
literally packed sup way to do time eh a
little too tightly uh but they did they
pack in a lot it was actually barring
the whole explosive part was it was a
good phone right it was a its alpha
would be I mean like maybe they bounce
back from this I'm not really sure I
mean how do you think you know I think
they're going to take a hit for a while
a big perception hit more so than even
the financial impact I think there's
they're gonna be the butt of jokes for a
while right but yeah I mean they're
gonna bounce back i think by the time
you know galaxy note or sorry galaxy s
eight rolls around next year it's not
gonna be as big of an issue i think
people are gonna forget about it at that
point yeah so the iphone isn't without
its own problems as well the iphone 7
there's something called his skate or
hissing gaithersburg I don't think we're
work with quite at his gate levels yes
Ghazi so what's happened with surfaced
on social media reports that certain
iphone 7 units will make a hissing noise
yeah which I heard the YouTube video
before we went on and it sounds really
really annoying yeah so you would think
smartphone letting out air yeah I mean
maybe it was able to expel that air a
little bit more easily with the
headphone jack and now everything is
ruined just to be clear though we don't
know how wide a problem this is the
there's a youtube video and some people
on Twitter we've talked about it but you
know I I don't personally know of anyone
who has an iphone 7 who's complaining
about this Scott Stein who's had the
review units hasn't mentioned anything
about hissing sound so it may or may not
be an issue as opposed to the exploding
samsung phones which was a huge issue
legit issue yeah this might you know
lose some samaire really quickly it
might not be that significant all right
lastly I had a chance to talk with the
un under-secretary-general in charge
humanitarian aid Stevens Ryan Alta phone
that's a mouthful I know it's this is
definitely this is the continuation of
our roadtrip package we were talking
about been talking about all summer and
this is basically same day as the UN is
convening to talk about the refugee
crisis president obama's in town he's
going to be addressing the UN tomorrow
but yeah it just uh it's just an
interesting at summary because it kind
of looked at tech and said you know
it's not the magic bullet rights episode
early because it's just such a big
problem right right I mean that was what
I'd seen to was that tech definitely
helps alleviate certain things but at
the same time it doesn't make people's
lives any easier in a lot of other ways
yep so for more about that check us out
on cnet I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox
Rubin thanks for listening and again we
want to apologize we know we're not the
apple byte there is an error going on in
the back end of the YouTube live
Nashville for brightly we are you know
and and we're sorry Brian we're not
trying to steal your fame we know there
are nowhere near your level but yes this
is a goal either also regardless again
if you guys want to go ahead and cut and
run no hard feelings we're still here
taking your questions comments about the
idea ok state by the way I like that you
said it was going to run out of air what
was that guy ass I got everyone as many
puns I was trying to rush it through we
were kind of running in time but I
wanted to applaud that life myself on
thank you very much I do it sounds like
white sometimes sound of you re it
sounds like the next deflategate to fly
yes oh yeah Hannah gate about
deflategate is completely other sphere
of influence er yeah it's it's all kind
of related it could be deflated could be
the phone deflating oh my gosh really
good news though so the samsung phones
explode and the Apple phones implode yes
maybe we we really like it roger was
being fair to Apple in that I don't know
how significant the problem is quite yet
but you know but yeah if you have a
chance check out our story on cnet
there's also a YouTube video there but
showing off we're not showing off
basically it's just the sound right yeah
you can hear the sound that it makes my
samsung TV emitted a high-pitched noise
for years when it was on or that noise
like my samsung phones or no that would
know it was just this very high pitch it
was like you know okay Barry and I would
have to watch when it was off yeah it
was uh was a flat screen and I would
have to unplug the television to get it
to stop doing it it was super super
annoying so anybody with a hissing phone
I really feel for you because I
eventually just got rid of the towel
yeah I was like to hell with this thing
so yeah do you guys have access to that
that sound can we bring that up and play
it back yeah I might have it there is a
video embedded on the the cnet article
so you can actually get a better example
of what we're talking about here but if
we can get a sample of it to playback it
doesn't literally just sounds like lends
a balloon do you get people it up coming
down and I mean there it is who knows
really what that means if anything but
it is it's annoying yeah lets you know I
ate it for me but what is you know if
you have an iphone 7 or 7 plus and
you're hearing this hissing noise gonna
play my ear are you catching any of that
yeah just sounded like white noise or
something yeah it's hard to convey over
microphone but check out the article if
you want to get it and we do want to
know if you guys are experiencing the
same issue anyone else out there and if
it's led to anything else more
significant because like a phone hissing
not the end of the world but it does
suck oh it's super it it's also worth
noting in context that this whole
concept of Bend gate which was for the
iphone 6 that a bunch of folks that were
doing unboxings and youtube were able to
break their phone because it was bigger
they were just able to like bend them
and so that was also but that ended up
being a non-issue it was really like
yeah you can break your phone if you try
really hard right it doesn't mean that
the phone is defective so we comment it
did lead to subsequent generation phones
using harder hmm so I don't know
more durable now as a result of that
interesting okay some are saying that
more important than this hissune which
by the way Apple equals snake I like
that comment is scratchy Oh scratch it
will let me just like the jet black
that's yeah july of course yeah i mean
look but we knew that going in though
they like they were very or everyone
which is stupid and kind of messed up am
I Rory but you know what you're buying
yeah I mean yeah it's kind of like a
piece of jewy but yeah that's a good way
to look at it
someone compared it to like a limited
edition sneaker that's that's that's why
that's it's like that you know the the
rare Jordans you line up for at the end
and just keep them in the box yeah just
hear them away well you put in the case
right you put it like an otter box or
something so yeah and then not I've
never generous I see the jet black just
know that you have it the props to
Dustin colwell who is comparing the
snake and Apple to the Bible story I can
kind of get on board of that okay wow we
have some very smart ation we have some
very smart atomisation like the shiny
Apple yeah oh yes yes yeah shiny jet
black apple we could run with that yeah
that's like jet black apple yeah alright
Adam and Eve ate that that's their own
problem yeah definitely what else we got
going on guys anybody else want to ask
any questions about Apple Samsung or or
the UN the UN a fascinating story and I
got you a truck company you for part of
that yeah yes it was uh definitely kind
of a different experience right as a as
a senior reporter I don't often get to
go to the UN and interview high-level
officials to talk about things like
humanitarian crisis I'm usually talking
about samsung or apple so it was kind of
a trip i mean it's it's just it's sort
of an interesting take you had none sort
of the role of tech right it's it's cuz
we're surrounded by people who are who
believe tech is changing the world that
is the solution for thee and this guy is
definitely has a more objective view
it's or like yeah it's it's one tool in
our toolbox but it's not it's not the
solution it's not the easy fix it's
great for getting the word out more so
and it's gay it's great for connecting
people but it's not it's not the adult
yeah yeah yeah in Greece it's like
people were able to get information but
I didn't change the fact that it was so
it didn't change the fact that they were
stuck outside in like really bad
environments like your your android
phone is not going to be a house right
you know and or or food or shelter and
what the discussion I had like I you
know getting the UN perspective we've
been spending the last couple of weeks
talking to refugees and getting
their perspective the UN his steak was
tech doesn't just encompass you know
things we think about like mobile phones
but like you know water purification
tech or technology involved with
building bridges it was like that like
much in rodders much broader than then I
was expecting to have a conversation
about so it was interesting yeah
definitely in the comments some are
saying that the hiss only occurs at the
power up thereby they don't really care
that much ah when you're charging it I
don't know what he's a when you're when
you're turning on the phone yeah oh I'd
be interested to hear more about that we
have none of us here of experience at
real time yet this is we're obviously
just like oh and ear to the ground on
the story goddess pet the most God sign
or okay your editor spent the most time
with the iphone 7 he has a scene any
problem but if you are experiencing a
hissing phone get in touch with us yes
yeah we want to know just like yeah
throw into the comments or something you
can email me or Roger mine is ben rubin
are you bi n at CBS com so that was a
foolish move yeah I don't know why I did
that I mean it's on better already you
know all right you can find my email
pretty easily I think I'd make it very
difficult okay i'll send you spam later
cuz I you up for so much stuff right now
and I say did I say that it was it's
actually Roger Tsien David in the chat
says he's experiencing a hissing phone
Davis David tell us more about how this
occurs yeah I power up when does it ran
is it everlasting please email us you
know then email me of course I would
love to yeah it's like I'm cnet com it's
no I don't have a cnet com however I
have CBS com or CBS I com huh okay
everybody send been terrible spam that's
fine uh we've asked the trolls to do
more we were like yeah just to just
attack us in the comments please name on
you do david says it happens under a
heavy load so Oh assumes running lots of
apps right at the same time oh that
she's gonna happen well that that could
be the processor running and then do
whatever is there a facial phantom
there's no there's no fan absolutely not
there's no room for a processor or are
being taxed
I don't know it seems unlikely does seem
unlikely it's weird but that is that's
great that we actually have a guy that
has a hissing phone I would like that I
would assume it's not great from his
proof but personnel no like that
provides certain like because like we
only have this like YouTube thing and
then like just a couple Twitter
complaints so it provides at least some
level yeah the fact that its broad
enough that one of our random viewers he
actually has the same issue maybe the
thing maybe his gate is a thing yeah
well sink we just blew the thing up
right now yeah way ahead of the curve
yeah forget Samsung here's the new
controversy definitely all right
probably about time to wrap it up yeah
definitely okay thanks again John yeah
sorry again to brian Tong sorry again
for actually much though oh yeah
fantastic they have you all along for
the ride and again sorry we're not
trying to fool you with the title that's
another again I'd like to start laying
the from my hair working out a little
bit more I don't know yeah well most is
that gonna work it's not gonna work yeah
which it was not an intentional
clickbait this was not an intentional
like try so nice songs under a very nice
guy well brian Tong has a hell of a show
when he does have a healthy we're proud
of our show too but we're not trying to
pretend like we're his show there was
some air on the back end I can't change
the metadata i'll change it afterwards
and again thank you for sticking around
