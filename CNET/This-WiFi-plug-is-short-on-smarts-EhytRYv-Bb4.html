appliances and this is the d-link Wi-Fi
smart plug so this $50 plug is designed
to give you remote control of your small
appliances that means that whether
you're home or away you should be able
to use your Android or iOS phone or
tablet to turn an appliance like a lamp
on or off remotely in theory it should
be as simple as plugging this into the
wall downloading the app and then being
able to control whatever you want
remotely we found it to be that simple
with the Belkin Wemo switch and the
Belkin Wemo insight switch we tested but
it wasn't quite as simple with this
d-link smart plug the usability problem
started with actually finding the app
itself I searched my d-link
smart plug my d-link Wi-Fi smart plug
every combination that I thought would
make sense and had a really hard time
finding it both for iOS and Android
ultimately I had the most success just
by searching smart plug setup went
pretty well I was able to access it on a
Droid Maxx phone and an iPhone 5 but
when it came time to testing on our
Nexus 7 first generation tablet it
wouldn't work also on the iOS app I was
unable to enable the alert notifications
for scheduling I could do it perfectly
with the Android app but the iOS app
just didn't work
one big inconsistency I noticed with
this plug is that when you remove it
from an outlet and then plug it back in
it doesn't always remember that you set
it up so you have to go back through the
setup process again and again and again
now sometimes it will remember that you
have a lamp that was plugged into it and
just start right back up other times it
won't this plug is probably the most
similar to the Belkin Wemo insight
switch it provides all sorts of energy
usage statistics you can schedule it and
you can just simply turn something on or
off with it when you're using the Belkin
Wemo insight switch you can actually
look at the dollar amount that you're
using or saving on the Wemo app you
can't do that with this plug it does
show the kilowatt hours and the wattage
and all sorts of useful information but
that's not as accessible as having a
dollar amount now the conversion is
pretty easy to do but I think a dollar
would improve this app a lot my biggest
complaint though is that this doesn't
come with IFFT compatibility that's the
if this then that service that lets you
make custom home automation rules and
recipes for your gadgets if you don't
care about its compatibility this is a
good option it's also ten dollars less
than the Belkin Wemo insight switch so
while this is a really good option for
controlling the basics the Belkin Wemo
switches and apps are a bit more
comprehensive and thoughtfully designed
