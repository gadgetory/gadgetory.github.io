smartphone when it's also a 41 megapixel
camera I'm Jessica developer with cnet
and this is the nokia lumia 1020 sold
exclusively with AT&amp;amp;T the 1020 packed on
an enormous 41 megapixel camera a
larger-than-average sensor size a xenon
flash and an app that lets shutter bugs
adjust everything from white balance to
exposure with convenience slider
controls Nokia's default pro cam app
actually saves two images the 5
megapixel photo that you can easily
upload and share and another 34 or
thirty eight megapixel shot that lets
you crop or zoom in to see more detail
without losing much resolution for
creative types the pro cam app has the
slider controls that let you adjust
everything from white balance to shutter
speed to iso and brightness you can
achieve some pretty cool effects this
way and the built-in tutorial goes a
long way to helping out novices if you
don't want to use the default app
there's also the native camera lens and
other apps that you can easily load to
capture panoramic shots and other
creative scenes image quality is really
good if you know what you're doing and
pretty good if you're just playing
around I'm not even close to being an
expert but I still manage to tease out
some fun shots from the advanced
settings other shots were just average
since the phone is saving two images
instead of one it takes about six
seconds until the camera is ready for
another shot that means unfortunately
that you could be missing some really
great photo ops when you're using the
pro cam app the video camera takes
advantage of the 1020's lossless zoom
during filming in addition it boosts
audio during 1080p HD recording so that
subject sound louder than usual and that
is a very good thing although the 1020's
camera module does stick out a good half
inch above the phone's face the phone is
a lot slimmer than it could be and it
didn't feel too bulbous or bulky in my
pocket or in my hand in fact it's about
the same shape as a lot of other Nokia
Lumia phones
running Windows Phone 8 as its operating
system this Lumia has 4g LTE and NFC in
addition to the usual smartphone
capabilities the enormous honking camera
is what really makes it stand out now
nokia lumia 1020 isn't for everyone avid
mobile photographers really like the
opportunity to try to in one device but
i think that more casual shooters will
probably be happy with other high-end
smartphones that sell for about one
hundred dollars less than eighteen t
selling this one for it's going to cost
three hundred dollars on contract at the
full retail price so there you have it
the nokia lumia 1020 and it's very large
41 megapixel camera i'm jessica Valcourt
