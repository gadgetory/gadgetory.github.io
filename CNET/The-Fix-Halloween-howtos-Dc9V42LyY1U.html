show about do-it-yourself tech and how
to's i'm eric franklin and I'm Donnell
bell I'm super excited about Halloween
and we have a lot of great ideas to
share with you that's right I'm not
really into the whole dressing up thing
but I love the trick-or-treat ass back
you know giving out candy that kind of
thing and we got a do-it-yourself
project that every trick or treater your
neighborhood will totally be into if
you're not around on Halloween the hand
out candy first of all you're a horrible
human being but the least you can do is
keep a bowl of candy out for the local
monsters as an extra Flair I'm going to
show you how to make an inexpensive
interactive Halloween decoration that
will light up your candy bowl as people
approach your house so here's what
you're gonna need you're gonna need a
motion-activated flood light some
colored bulbs to put in it they socket
adapter this is just like 23 bucks a box
to mount it all on this is a deluxe $14
craft tissue box it works perfect for
this project but you could probably go a
lot cheaper you're gonna need a whole
big candy bowl to put the whole thing in
an extension cord couple screws
hopefully just have these around the
house and of course lots of candy so the
first thing we're going to want to do is
to wire up our flood lights so that we
can plug it into our extension cord
right now we're just dealing with bare
wires so we're going to use the socket
adapter we're going to pop out the
little blades and then wire up each
blade to the bare wire and have this all
ready to plug right in so I'm going to
thread the wire to the back of the
adapter pull it through clamp it down
do the same thing with the other wire
good enough not to get electrocuted
place the blades back in the adapter
finally use this little wedge here to
keep the wire separated no one gets hurt
alright so now this $8 floodlight is a
motion-activated lamp test it out we're
gonna have to plug in our light bulbs I
use these color-changing LED bulbs
because one they don't get hot like
incandescent bulbs will and also they
came with a little handy color-changing
remote control so I can dial in exactly
what spooky color I want to use all
right now it's time to mount the
floodlight on to the box we're going to
do this for two reasons one we want the
extra stability the box is going to give
a little platform to raise it up above
the candy we're also going to do this to
conceal all the cables that are inside
the box if we don't exactly want prying
fingers to find
alright so there we go got our nice
light fixture here got the cables inside
concealed now we're really doing this
properly we'd probably paint the box up
a nice black or orange color to make it
thematically appropriate but for the
sake of this demo this is what you're
getting so here we go i got my bowl i
got my light fixture in here first step
is I'm gonna plug it in to the extension
cord set it up get it nice and centered
all right now for the fun part horn in
the candy all right come and get a kid's
get the name-brand candy got the good
stuff all right and then for the last
part let's adjust these lights down so
that they give the candy a good spooky
glow we're all set
okay let's give this thing a shot see if
it works it works all right so there you
go that's how to make your own monster
detecting candy illuminator a fun simple
project and one that's affordable enough
you're not gonna mind if it gets stolen
by vampires that's was actually pretty
cool thank you I'm pretty proud of that
one you shall I in with it you can go
low in and cheap out or you could like
put on top of a mummy head or something
like that why didn't you do that next
exercise yes sir okay time for a quick
break and when we come back we're gonna
show you how to create a one-of-a-kind
party atmosphere using the tech you
already own
welcome back you know I really love
entertaining people at my house usually
that involves forcing them to watch
episodes of the wire but right now we're
gonna show you how to take an ordinary
room throw in some tech and then make
that room extraordinary that's right
we've got a how-to that uses cool lights
cool music and your smartphone to create
the perfect party atmosphere if you want
to have a killer Halloween party and you
already have philips hue bulbs there are
a couple of ways to turn them into a fun
and spooky centerpiece for your
halloween party so i have for philips
hue bulbs already set up and i can of
course control them from the official
app but i also have a couple of other
apps that let me sync the bulbs with any
music or spooky sounds that i'm playing
the first option is called Hugh
Halloween and it's available for iOS and
Android I love it because it's really
simple to get things started launch the
app and then hit the button on your hue
bridge to get things synced then hit the
light bulb button to choose which lights
you'll use with the app so i'll set the
mood in this case piano music creepy
already but let's throw in some sound
effects
and you'll see that as I change the
effects the light sync with whatever is
playing like this that one's really
creepy they also have other moods that
you can choose from for background music
I can put some raindrops in the
background hit it with a zombies sound
this app is great because of all the
built-in options but it does require you
to man it now if you want more control
over the music and how the lights react
to it check out Hugh disco it's
available for iOS and Android to get
started you'll launch the app and then
sync it with your hue just like Hugh
Halloween then go ahead and choose which
light bulbs you want to work with the
app again the more the merrier or
scarier in this case once you do that
head over to the disco tab and here you
can really fine-tune the controls so the
most important one is really microphone
sensitivity because if you're having a
really rowdy party you want to make sure
that the app can still pick up on the
music that you're playing so if you have
a lot of people over crank up the
sensitivity the other thing to check out
is the transition control so you can
choose between smooth for a smoother
transition or snap which gives you more
of a strobe effect kind of like a club
feel
and if you can't decide just choose mix
and then go ahead and queue up your
music and hit start
so those are just a couple of fun ways
to use your smartphone to add a little
more flair to your halloween party but
you can also use these same tips
year-round during any other events
you're hosting I think we may have saved
the best segments for last oh yeah yes
can I get a drumroll please show you
gotta call a pumpkin of course that's
right dan graziano took this task on
he's gonna show us how using templates
online can help you perfect this holiday
tradition this Halloween I'm going to
teach you how to add some extra flair to
your pumpkin without breaking the bank
some of us like myself for example
aren't very good at drawing luckily
there are a lot of websites out there
with free templates that can help you
carve the perfect pumpkin slight like
Martha Stewart and thinkgeek off some
good template for beginners if you want
to design that's a little more crazy I
would definitely try googling a specific
idea to get the job done you'll need a
nice big pumpkin and a template from the
internet I chose this one of Philip J
fry and my favorite character from the
show futurama you will also need a pair
of scissors to cut up a design a big
spoon or ice cream scooper to clean up a
pumpkin a sharp knife for carving some
pushpins a marker tape and either a
candle or an LED light to bring it to
life we are going to start by cutting
out the top of the pumpkin near the stem
make sure to place the knife at a
45-degree angle so the lid will have a
place to rest when you replace it if you
cut straight down the lid will simply
fall through the pumpkin once that's
done use the spoon to remove the seeds
and the innards of the pumpkin I
recommend saving the seeds and posting
them later for a tasty treat the pumpkin
maybe a little dirty you may have to
wipe it down with paper towel or a
napkin print out the template you found
online and use a pair of scissors to cut
out the areas you will be carving into
the pumpkin tape the template onto the
pumpkin and use a marker to trace the
carving lines for the spots you can't
get with the marker use the pushpins
next we're going to remove the template
and begin carving along the pattern
and there you have it all you have to do
now is place the candle or LED light
inside of the pumpkin the possibilities
really are endless with this you could
use a drill to make some quick holes in
the pumpkin cookie cutters for cool
designs a potato peeler for extra
surface details or even for your next
holiday party throw Bluetooth speaker
inside just have fun with it hmm not too
bad not too bad at all
little known fact Donald can I have
never carved a pumpkin before that's sad
I know you haven't lived I haven't
Lumpkin carvings the best collar you've
seen the video now you're an expert on
it I expect more from you that is a
really good point and I'm gonna try it
out okay good all right that's it for
this week's show you can reach out to us
i'm at Donald on Twitter and I'm at me
