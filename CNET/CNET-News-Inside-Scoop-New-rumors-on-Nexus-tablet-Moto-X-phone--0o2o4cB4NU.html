das joining me at Seth Rosenblatt senior
writer for cnet's f thanks for being
with us thank you sir me so you have an
appointment with Google tomorrow mm-hmm
um ask you have a few other people I
hope so yeah what do you expect to see
what's the rumor so the right now rumors
are thin we know that the event is going
to be hosted by sundar pichai who is in
charge of not just chrome anymore not
just apps but also android following
Andy Rubin okay so it gives us some
clues as to absolutely absolutely
devices yeah we know it's not going to
be a car but we're we think it's going
to be something related to Chrome OS
could be a new Chromebook they launched
a new Chromebook for two hundred fifty
dollar one last year at this time right
so we could get a new Chromebook it
could be a chrome OS tablet we know that
they've been working on getting touch
features into Chrome OS so that's
something we're probably going to see
Android 4.3 and we don't think we're
going to see any Android phones they're
doing the big Moto X revealed next week
on august first so a new phone would
seem to be a little odd in terms of
timing okay so next week you mentioned
there is this big announcement there are
the motorola phones what is that going
to be do what do we know about that so
far because it seems like people are
usually more interested in phones than
they are in other devices yeah well with
the Moto X its motorola motorola
mobility's big new push they've been
sort of off the vine for quite a while
Dan we have not heard from Motorola
formal for a while no they really seated
see today the Android lead to Samsung
and Google's purchase of the company you
know 12 billion dollars hasn't really
produced much so this is their big
chance to show that they are still in
the game we know that the phone is going
to be customizable a little bit in the
hardware as well as in the operating
system it's going to be a pure version
of Android hardware too mm-hmm so what
do we think that might look like for now
we think it's going to be customizable
backs we've seen a couple of those
mocked up beyond that we don't really
know do we know anything else about the
Moto X any clues about what we might see
you next week
the rumor mill has a going that it's
going to have a dual core Qualcomm s4
processor 16 gigs of on-board storage
4.5 inch screen but these are all rumors
we don't actually have any facts at this
point okay and as far as the event
tomorrow there are some rumblings about
chrome and Android greater integration
in that so you know because of Sooners
role in charge of both divisions we
could see the beginnings of chrome and
Android integration tomorrow it's a
possibility don't know how likely it is
another thing that we could see as well
is the launch of the second Nexus 7
tablet it see very almost it's been over
a year since the last yes yes Apple the
first the first nexus 7 launched at
google google io 2012 and again with
this you know it was the first sort of
super successful android tablet it sort
of created the 7-inch form factor space
for tablets i've been using it i think
it's a great tablet so i think a lot of
people going to be curious to see if it
comes what kind of hardware it has what
form it takes all right Seth thanks so
much now you are going to be keeping a
close eye on this first right yes
absolutely tomorrow morning 830 a.m.
pacific I'll be live-blogging with my
cnet colleagues and I will be tuning in
for inside scoop im sue me does thanks
