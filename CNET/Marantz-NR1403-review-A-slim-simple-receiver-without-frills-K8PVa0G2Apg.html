we're gonna take a look at the marantz
and our 1403 this is a 5.1 AV receiver
that was actually released last year but
it's staying in the line for 2013 and
it's currently selling for $400 the real
appeal of this receiver is its slim line
design
it's just 4.1 inches tall which makes it
significantly thinner than most AV
receivers on the market the front panel
just looks good too with the nicely
curved edges that don't have the harsh
boxy look that most receivers have the
receiver is relatively wide and deep
though over 17 inches wide and nearly
fourteen and a half inches deep so it's
a good idea to double check the
dimensions on your TV cabinet before
making a purchase the remote is pretty
decent
it doesn't include too many buttons and
important stuff like the volume rocker
is prominently featured the remote on
the step up and our 1604 is even better
so it's a little disappointing that you
don't get that clicker with this model
but it's good enough especially if
you're planning on replacing it with the
universal remote in terms of features
the big thing is the NR 1403 is missing
any kind of networking functionality
there's no built-in Wi-Fi or Ethernet
which means you're going to miss out on
newer features like smart phone control
integrated streaming services and
airplay however the truth is a lot of
those networking features don't work
that well on AV receivers and while
airplay is nice you can always add it
later with an Apple TV so while the
marantz is missing a lot of checkboxes
on a feature comparison chart in
practice it doesn't feel like you're
missing that much with the NR 1403 does
have is a lot of HDMI connectivity
including six total ports including one
on the front that's the most you'll find
on a receiver at this price and it gives
you plenty of room to expand down the
road there aren't many legacy ports on
the back including no component video
inputs at all but that's not a big deal
since most devices use HDMI these days
now a lot of people get worried about
sound quality when they see a smaller
design like this but the marantz sounded
excellent in our tests we had resident
audio file steve guttenberg give it a
listen and he was really impressed with
how close it was to the
much larger Sony STR DN 1040 both music
and movie sounded really dynamic and
detailed so even though it's a smaller
overall package you're not giving up any
performance but what the marantz really
comes down to is its unique form factor
the real reason you're buying this
receiver is because it's got a great
look and it's a lot less bulky than
traditional AV receivers you're giving
up networking features but that's a fair
compromise if you're gonna use other
devices to stream anyways so overall if
you're into the design it's an excellent
value that sounds great and has plenty
of HDMI ports for your gear I'm Matthew
