the sublime in the ridiculous
the sublime it delivers great photos and
performance for a cheap DSLR well suited
to a family photographer budget traveler
it can sustain a continuous shooting
speed of about five frames per second
that's fast enough for typical kids and
pets types of photos though that's what
just autofocus no auto exposure that
means photos of someone running in and
out of Sun and shadow will not expose
properly all the time and the new AFP
kit lens with its stepper motor is
faster and quieter for shooting video
and stills via the LCD in live view the
nikon standard lenses it's pretty light
on features but that's not unusual for a
cheap DSLR that means fixed LCD no
manual aperture and video and overall
not a lot of options unfortunately I
hate the viewfinder displays tiny
autofocus points that don't tell you if
the shots in focus and that you really
can't see you have to pre focus just to
see the AF points in order to get them
on the subject but the ridiculousness is
the wireless it doesn't have Wi-Fi just
low bandwidth Bluetooth and it's limited
to downloading 2 megapixel JPEGs to your
phone that's lower resolution than the
typical selfie and also geotags them in
sets the clock you can't even use it as
a dumb remote shutter because that
requires Wi-Fi and on Android the app
sucks up memory and CPU cycles until you
have to manually force it to quit
I had to uninstall it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
