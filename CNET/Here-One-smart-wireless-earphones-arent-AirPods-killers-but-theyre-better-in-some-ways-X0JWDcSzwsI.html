calls its new $250 here one totally
wireless headphones the question is are
they really smart or too smart for their
own good
they're not the first totally wireless
earphones to lay claim to the smart
mantle raggies the - which got off to a
somewhat rocky start has been on the
market for several months and shares
some of the same features as the ear one
touch controls a noise isolating in your
design multiple microphones the
pass-through mode that lets you hear the
outside world so so battery life and a
companion app that lets you control the
headphones smart features oh and like
the brog II the here one comes with a
charging case that has a built-in
battery that delivers over three full
charges out of the gate the here one is
the more polished product and a step
ahead of the biragi in terms of sound
quality delivering a reliable wireless
connection with only the occasional
bluetooth hiccup using one of the
included different sized ear tips you
should be able to get a fairly
comfortable secure fit that will keep
these guys in your ears even during a
gym workout and yes they are sweat
resistant so long as you get a tight
seal here one clearly sounds fuller than
apples air pods with meteor bass and
decent clarity for a bluetooth headphone
the air pods are significantly more
comfortable to wear but they have an
open design and Lenon a lot of ambient
noise aside from the good sound quality
the ear ones differentiating factor is
its noise filters earphones are equipped
with six microphones and you can choose
to tune out the outside world with a
noise canceling filter or tune it in
with a pass-through filter some of the
preset filters work well for instance
walking around New York City using the
city filter really cut down on the noise
making this a much better totally
wireless headphone to use in noisy
environments than the air pods the only
issue was that caller said that they
heard a fair amount of background noise
when I was making calls from the street
you think a smart an earphone like this
could filter that noise out better down
the road it might Doppler is also
touting the restaurant filter which
allows you to tune out the din of a
background restaurant noise and amplify
the voices the people you're talking to
at your table
it works but I personally wouldn't want
to wear these headphones while I was
eating a meal I never forgot they were
in my ears because they're noise
isolating and I could hear myself
chewing these earphones are also
designed to work as a headset for making
cell phone calls and they mostly work
well you can access Siri or Google now
voice assistance with a couple of quick
taps on one of the buds that's the
weather despite a few quirks and
drawbacks which include some strange ear
piercing audio feedback noises when
cupping the earphones in your hand
mediocre battery life of two hours and
somewhat slow charging via the included
battery case the here one is one of the
best totally wireless earphones we've
tested to date it's an ambitious product
that will presumably improve over time
with software upgrades in the meantime
it will capture some people's hearts and
leave others longing for something more
straightforward and simple to use I'm
