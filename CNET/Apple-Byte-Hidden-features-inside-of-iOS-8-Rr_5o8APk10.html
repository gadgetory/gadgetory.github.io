to the Apple buy for all the good and
bad inside the world of Apple iOS 8 has
been released to the public and some of
you watching this right now are waiting
in line in front of an Apple Store which
might not be so bad after that train
wreck of a pre-order now let's start off
with iOS 8 it's here and brings a
boatload of improvements my favorite one
is easily the ability to answer a text
message within the notification window
something that has been a jailbreak
feature for years now there's a long
list of improvements the message app
with its predictive text the ability to
use touch ID instead of typing your
password into specific apps and
extensibility which allows me to share
something like a picture to other apps
outside a Facebook and Twitter
which is nice and if you have an iPhone
4s I can't really recommend you do this
even though it technically works so stay
away from iOS 8 if you're a 4s user and
just trust me on this all right two
things still missing until the release
of OS 10 Yosemite is continuity and
handoff so we'll wait for that and
issues on Apple site has forced them to
remove healthkit compatible apps from
the App Store for the time being so
clearly it's not the smoothest launch
ever but what about some of the hidden
features in iOS 8 that you didn't know
about well guess what we've got a really
good looking really good looking
correspondent to tell you all about them
all right
thanks Brian and they're not too bad
yourself hey guys and gals Brian Chong
here with cnet.com and many of you have
iOS 8 in your hands by now and you've
messed around with it but I'm here to
show you some of the hidden features
that you may have not found and if you
have then I'm completely worthless to
you so first up the number one thing we
care about on our phone other than it
making calls is battery life so check
this out go to your settings then
general then usage and then battery
usage to see what apps using most of
your juice and then quit the apps that
are the battery hogs
also you can double click your home
button now and it gives you quick access
to the friends you've recently
interacted with so it's a lot easier to
check in on my BFF Groot
and also if you want to use your phone
hands-free with Siri go to general then
Siri and turn on the option to allow
haste
for this feature to work your phone also
has to be plugged into a power source
but check this out
it works hey Siri how do I look alright
Apple's dictation is a lot better now
when you're speaking you'll actually see
the words appear as you talk instead of
waiting for a spinning ball that may or
may not put out results the weather app
also looks similar but brings a lot more
accurate data from the Weather Channel
and tells you things like sunrise and
sunset if you also want to hide a photo
from your library for no apparent reason
since none of us take inappropriate
pictures and keep them on our phones tap
and hold onto the picture and select
hide where did it go well go to your
albums and then find the hidden album
and there they are and Safari has the
ability to do a credit card scan so now
when you make purchases in Safari
there's an option to take a picture of
your card and Safari will fill in the
information for you that is pretty slick
so those are some of the hidden gems
inside of iOS 8 we know there are plenty
of others but this is just a way to get
you started
i'm brian tong for cnet.com use them
wisely I still don't know why he says
that like does he think that you're
gonna be dumb about it really it's never
made any sense now a few other iOS 8
tidbits developers are warning users to
not upgrade to iCloud Drive before the
release of OS 10 Yosemite because
upgrading now will cause syncing issues
for other apps that previously used
other methods first Enki between Mac and
iOS devices so just choose not now when
given the option and you can always turn
it on later also if you like custom
keyboards iOS 8 supports them you'll
have to download the app first and then
you'll be able to add the keyboard by
going to general keyboard and add new
keyboard the popular Android swiped in
swift key keyboards are two of the top
ones worth checking out and it's not
just iOS devices getting a facelift your
Apple TV is getting a refreshed design
that aligns better with iOS and the
update also includes the newly added
beats music channel and don't believe
for a second that Apple is done for the
year just yet we've told you over and
over to an expect an iPad refresh
announcement sometime in October and
according to The Daily Dot they claim
October the 21st will be Apple's next
event for new iPads with an expected
upgraded a a chip an anti-reflective
display coating and touch ID fingerprint
scanner
now we're also expecting the official
release of OS 10 Yosemite during that
time and we might see slight speed bumps
to IMAX MacBook Pros or Mac Pro's but
we're still not expecting any of them
with the new Broadwell chipset just yet
now Bloomberg is also saying mid-october
while Apple Insider Jimdo imple is
saying no to the October 21st date all
right now you might be thinking wow
Apple is having a great week there's the
launch of iOS 8 and the iPhone 6 and the
6 plus is coming out this week but I
don't this is arguably the worst week
ever if you like Apple just a little bit
and especially if you like Apple a lot
so you can't wait to get your new iPhone
6 maybe you're going to wait in line now
because of that disaster of a pre-order
that made getting a pair of Jordans on a
Saturday look like a cakewalk and people
that's no easy task website down Apple
Store down orders crashing in your car
billing info issues oh that was just the
start of a bad apple so now you're gonna
wait in line in you're so excited that
Apple is finally bringing NFC to the
iPhone except they're locking down the
NFC to only be used for Apple pay now
the big a actually confirmed it them so
saying it would be locked down to Apple
mobile payments for at least a year
developers won't be able to do cool new
things with it but is this a surprise no
you know what it is a bad apple now
let's keep going should we talk about
you - yes let's talk about you - one of
the greatest bands of all time don't
worry I know that their record-setting
album release was instantly added to
your music collection thanks to Apple
right alongside similar genres like your
boys - man and trey songz albums you
know why it was a record because they
forced it into our music collection
without us having to say in it it was so
ridiculous and people were so angry that
a few days later Apple created a removal
to delete the album you can actually go
to the link right here I did it and now
you too can delete you too and that was
just another bad apple but the icing on
the cake for me this week goes to a TMT
i pre-ordered the iPhone but there was a
problem with my billing after I placed
the order on the 12th I tried calling
but the AT&amp;amp;T department that deals with
the billing issues closes on the weekend
conveniently so I was surprised to get
an email telling me my order was
cancelled on Sunday cancelled now after
repeated calling and customer support
chats nada so now I'm getting one maybe
two to three weeks after all of you it's
okay there's a whole lot more to life
than making sure you get your iPhone 6
on launch day I know this but at
everything we talked about in this past
week the entire week and entire
everything deserves a big booty bad
apple that's big and I'm done all right
guys let's end things with some happy
thoughts my friends at decals for
MacBooks comm are doing a killer 50% off
everything there's sort of 50% off with
the code Apple byte that's good until
October the 4th these are killer decals
for your Mac books and iPads and guess
what we also have giveaways for you the
Apple biters right here on our show so
all you have to do is send me an email
to the Apple by to see Netcom or tweet
me at Brian tongs using the hashtag what
I did for iOS 8 because I know you had
to delete something special or do
something ridiculous for iOS 8 and I'll
pick my five favorites now what did I do
well I deleted a video of my
two-year-old nephew Tyler saying I am
Groot and yes I am a horrible uncle
alright that's it for this week's show
thank you so much for watching and
everybody enjoy your new iPhone 6 or 6
plus if you're lucky and we'll catch you
guys all next time for another bite of
the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
