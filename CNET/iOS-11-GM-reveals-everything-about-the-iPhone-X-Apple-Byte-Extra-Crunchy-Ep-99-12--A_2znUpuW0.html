name is Steven Beach I mean you were
watching the hottest Apple podcast on
the web that's true the Apple byte extra
crunchy pod guess with your host mr.
Brian Tom what's up everybody welcome to
the show I went to the Skype channel cuz
I'm so used to that
these are brian dong I'm here people
that are listening have no idea what's
going on welcome to the show everybody
look this is less than 24 hours before
the Apple Keynote drops but there's so
much stuff that happened over the
weekend we decided to give you episode
99 and a half $9.99 and a half we're
gonna jump through everything that we
have learned over the weekend for those
of you who weren't we're like actually
enjoying your weekend I think around
like 8 or 9 o'clock at night on Saturday
in the in the u.s. I would just happen
to look at my phone and all of a sudden
9 to 5 Mac dropped a bomb because they
exclusively were able to get their hands
on
they released gold master so this is the
final basically for public consumption
version of iOS 11 it was leaked
specifically to them from all
indications it's not anywhere else and
they broke down so many things that
we're gonna talk about we're giving them
all the credit for all these findings
and at the same time kind of made me sad
because we know I'm still excited for
the keynote but now we know more than
ever and some of these things would have
been really cool surprises
it's like potatoes right yeah it's like
learning about Han Solo before you see
Star Wars 2 in the last Star Wars movie
right which was like about what about
Empire Strikes Back yeah like I'm sorry
I don't want to spoil anything but
something happens with Luke and Darth
Vader so let's jump into this oh we're
not gonna take any calls we're just
gonna get into it and this was this is a
bomb okay so basically the iOS 11 gold
master leaked out for people that are
saying oh the developers betas have been
out before we talked about the home pod
firmware leak that happened about maybe
two weeks ago and this is the iOS 11
gold master okay so first of all the
biggest news that dropped from it is
that
the iPhone the OLED iPhone is expected
based on code and direct references to
be called Beecham what did we call it
literally like eight nine months ago
almost right after the orig the iPhone 7
came out what did we call it the iPhone
and the iPhone X do we do we see that we
firm did we do that we joked saying it
would be either the iPhone the iPhone
future was our affectionate name yeah
but we actually outright called out they
should make it the iPhone exude we
totally did and we because not only and
people now will be like Oh duh is the
10th anniversary but we we called it out
because look the the letter X is the
most identifiable letter when you comes
down to branding the X there's no other
letter that that stands out more like an
X it's a 10th anniversary it sounds cool
but at the same time you wouldn't think
is Apple gonna really do that because
they're always stuck to their iPhone 3G
3GS 4 or 4s they're calling it they'll
at least the OLED phone the iPhone X and
they're planning to skip the iPhone
they're not gonna call the other two
iPhone 7 &amp;amp; 7 7 s and 7s plus they're
gonna call it eight and eight plus that
has been that was like kind of the first
big drop confirmed by this leak the
other part about it is when I heard that
I was like dude Apple byte extra crunchy
dude we does that we roll man I'm
shocked I'm really surprised I didn't
know that till right now I was seeing a
lot of people talking about the iPhone X
on Twitter and like on the internet over
the weekend and stuff just you know just
glancing here and there but I had no
idea that like we had that right it's
been confirmed all right so we have that
news that dropped about the iPhone X um
I even wanted to I did this fun Twitter
poll because remember when Apple had OS
10 it was an OS X and they always called
it OS 10 they didn't pronounce the X
like an X they pronounce it like a 10 so
I I pulled the Twittersphere on my
account at Brian Tong cheap plug
we asked real important how do you think
Apple will pronounce iPhone X 15% of
respond
it's out of to over 2,500 votes
so this illegitimate sample size 15
percent said iPhone 10 44 percent said
they would respond iPhone X 41 percent
responded who cares I had to throw that
in because sometimes people get mad at
my polls they're like I don't care so
I'm like I'm gonna throw it out who
cares yeah and the answer was so clearly
everyone thinks they're gonna pronounce
it iPhone X but we will have to wait and
see how how that all comes together
here's some other things direct specs
about the actual iPhone X this is some
this is just crazy that we know these
details digging deep into again the gold
master of iOS 11 it suggests that the
new iPhone X will have an a 11 fusion
chip but this chip is a 6 core processor
it'll pack for high performance
processors or what their code naming
mistral cores and to battery life
efficient cores nicknamed monsoon or
Monsen hmm so it's gonna be a 6 core
processor if you want to compare that to
what was in the 810 fusion processor in
the iPhone 7 and 7 plus that packed to
high performance cores and to high
efficiency cores so it was a 4 core
processor if you want to compare it to
the a 10x which was in the iPad pro
name-drop iPad pro that had a 6 core
setup three high performance and three
high efficiency so this when you compare
all this stuff it means that the new
iPhones the 8 the 8 plus and the X will
clearly have apples most powerful
processors to date which is not a
surprise but I don't think it's gonna be
by a little based on that spec setup
it's gonna be by a lot we're talking
about this 6 core processor in the
iPhone
I remembered is he gonna be a beast I
remember seeing you like demo your your
iPad Pro and it was like the fastest
thing I've ever seen I've never seen an
iPad or any iOS software move that
so you're saying that we're gonna have
this in the iPhone in the next iPhone X
yes you like you that fast does this
sound cool say iPhone X yeah man they
better Tim cool give it to you no that
would be awesome but they have like this
DMX they got update if they know what's
going on they have got to give us a
flashy dope high energy quickly edited
music video that starts dogs so that's
some of the specs inside also the iPhone
8 is expected again all this is pulled
from the code so I'm not gonna keep on
saying that just know this moving
forward but I like to give credit again
this is all 9 to 5 Mac iPhone 8 will
feature 2 gigs of RAM the iPhone 8 plus
and the iPhone X are expected to pack 3
gigs a ram so you're gonna get a little
performance boost there as well this is
just a beast of the phone I'm gonna go
back Beach so maybe you can follow along
from the very first article because
we're kind of jumping around but we want
to talk about a lot of different
features this phone is expecting to get
one of the new features is portrait
lighting so essentially there's gonna be
some special mode or adjustment
specifically through the camera when you
take photos in portrait mode that will
optimize the lighting for those pictures
in this phone nice also it's expected to
be getting a true tone display for the
iPhone X the same true tone display in
my iPad pro ok so that's where it
basically based on the lighting it has
ambient light sensors that change the
color temperature of your screen to
match your environment so it's not like
you have this super crazy it just look
white looks like white based on the
environment that you're in so now I have
to turn off there's not gonna be like a
sleep mode or what is that called uh you
know I'm talking about when you change
the color of the night the night nights
are still gonna there's it's just that
in regular daylight on the fly it's
going to be able to adjust
I see it's me I made it sound like it
was gonna be an automatic thing
it is automatic okay and then night
shift you can schedule that which I do
and it's helped me actually has helped
me a lot before I would be reading
comics that like 1 a.m. at night yeah
and I couldn't go to sleep and now if
I'm tired I'm like because it has kind
of the warmer tones with your you know
your biorhythm it sets it up so it's
gonna have it's gonna have that as well
as we scroll down there's been images
and animations inside the gold master
just kind of showing off that silhouette
of the iPhone X and then we'll we're
gonna talk about these things called ant
emojis in a second but not not just yet
you haven't heard about these an emoji
I have heard about okay fine not really
excited about find you you read you read
it you read it you read too much I
forgot to tell people to begin the show
if you don't want to hear about this and
you want to be surprised tomorrow you
probably should stop stop listening
don't listen this yeah okay here's more
information about the iPhone 8 and
iPhone X stat I'm sorry about the iPhone
X status bar and how it's going to
really accommodate this notch at the top
that everyone has been talking about a
little I don't want to say controversial
but some people like it some people
don't I just like the idea of it just
being a smooth line across but we know
the knotch
will exist they put out kind of a little
quick video animation and like the
rumors have said the time on the
top-left corner will be there but on the
right hand side you'll have things like
your Wi-Fi signal as well as your
battery power and it'll actually do
these kind of cool animations that
switch between some of the information
that it shows just kind of these cool
smooth slick animations on those ears
remember Apple is internally calling
those two little bigger spots around the
notches the ear so that they've showed
off kind of some animations there as
well and then really the biggest feature
that I want to see in action presented
by Apple is the face ID that that is
officially what it's going to be called
Martin gurmann called it out his face ID
I feel like maybe a month and a half ago
he was the first person that said
Apple's gonna call it face ID and so
what happens in this face ID is the
ability and I think Beach it'll be the
next is it the next one the next one the
next article yeah so in the face ID they
have revealed literally the entire
set up like what it looks like on the
phone where you hold up your face to it
and it has if you remember kind of what
that that that finder face looks like on
on Apple way back and they it looks
similar to that but it's just kind of
like a flat image and when you set up
your phone for the first time with face
ID it says oh move your face around or
kind of rotate it around so can see all
the different edges or angles of your
face it'll be able to detect that and
then once it saves that or stores that
to memory it'll kind of create your
first face ID scan and then moving
forward that is how you use it we don't
know every application of how this face
ID recognition is going to be used but
we do know at least what the initial
setup looks like again the this is the
biggest leak in Apple history yeah there
is no doubt about it and they were
totally talking you know just a few
months ago how they're gonna lock
everything down they're gonna be highly
secretive and and then this happens this
is this is a huge problem for Apple yeah
you know a lot of people aren't happy
like I'm even reading the periscope
comments going by really fast like face
ID is not good for privacy this is
really bad
again Apple is gonna have to tell us a
story of how good it is why is it better
why is it faster indications also for
people that are curious we've talked
about how the power button or the lock
button on this new iPhone is going to be
longer in size one of the reasons was to
be able to hold it with one hand and be
able to turn on the power on and off
easily in the code it also indicates
that that power button with a quick
DoubleTap will allow you to invoke Apple
pay and then if you hold it down it'll
be able to bring up Siri so that that
physical home button that's longer
that's gonna take over some of the
functionality that the home button used
to have so I think people that were
worried about it I do trust me I like it
at the bottom but people are going to be
able to use the power button for that
functionality that has been confirmed
again in this firmware drop and you know
what before we go on I want to kind of
bounce it back to this whole firmware
drop and I really feel like this was
some one people have been just started
talking about but when I saw this I
this was intentional this was not you
know it was given over to nine-to-five
Mack whether or not they paid for it or
it was just handily given over I don't
know this for a fact so I'm not gonna
say but for someone to put out a leak
like this knowing that this was a real
big moment for Apple it's their 10th
anniversary phone you know Apple is
completely pissed off at headquarters
they aren't happy about this but this
comes off to me as someone internally
that felt spite adore mad and decided to
leak it out to the public yeah I just
don't think in previous generations of
how Apple's culture was that they would
that their employees would be okay with
doing this and maybe part of that is a
company getting bigger and larger in
size and maybe it's part of how the
company has changed where I feel that
there was a fear associated with how
Steve Jobs made everything wanted
everything to be a secret and the reward
of that and I don't think that's the
case as much anymore like we benefit
from it we get a cover it but at the
same time there's a lot of surprises
that have been lost because of this yeah
I mean you know we did that Scott Scott
Forstall thing and a lot of things Apple
did was based on like how they don't
like somebody or you know anything like
there's all this like bad blood between
companies and that might even extend
into their culture inside there inside
their building or something
so someone clearly it was like I'm gonna
show that that's what I'm saying I feel
like it was someone that that was pissed
off and wanted to get back at Apple
internally yeah and it wasn't like an
Android mole it was someone that
consciously decided to do this this was
not a strategic leak by Apple for all
those people that liked to be like oh
they're trying to build the hype machine
the home we're home pod firmware was not
a a marketing ploy and this was not a
marketing ploy no so I think you guys
and gals to just squash that idea in her
mind now talking about some of these
cool bells and whistles that were
revealed from the gold master we talked
about a lot of stuff but I thought this
one would have been kind of a fun cute
quirky one I use the word cute I did
should she are you gonna take my man
card away because I said no no I say
cute all the time when you have kids
so another feature that will be part a
software feature that will be part of
this face recognition face ID platform
is the iPhone will feature and emojis a
and I M Oh J I basically you will be
able to send 3d animated emojis based
off your facial expression they have
some examples here in the article
there's like a monkey there's a robot so
if you scrunch your face one way it'll
actually reflect that in the an emojis
like I'm not saying this a game-changer
but I'm gonna be sending an emojis like
holla I don't know about you are you
gonna be sending it I'm gonna take work
to do so I have to like put the phone up
to my face you'll probably have to hold
your face and then do some like
expression then it'll take a little
it'll calm me I might try it like once
or twice and I don't know it really
depends on how easy it is to do so check
this out
just in case inquiring minds want to
know the poo poo emoji is one of those
okay emoji will be able to be used as an
an emoji I can see my kids using that oh
I wish they did have an eggplant emoji
you know what I mean oh yeah oh yeah I
can get x-rated real quick oh yeah the
squirt squirt yeah little combo there so
there's also separate assets and you can
scroll down lower in that article Beach
for people that want to see this there's
separate assets that highlight the
variety of expressions that this will be
able to support in the an emoji
functionality things like left and right
eyebrow movements cheeks raising the
chin opening or squinting eyes moving
the jaw lips as well as mouth movements
like frowning and smiling these are all
things that will be able to be
incorporated into this an emoji cool I
mean but see that's the thing that you
would have been like if you first heard
it I probably would have made fun of it
at first but then I'd be like oh my gosh
I would totally do that yeah I mean
there's like these weird animation apps
that you can use or you know it's like
the face filters really but then you
have like a whole cartoon character that
you can move with your face and like
talk and like talk through it or
whatever my kids love to play with that
stuff so they're gonna play with this
all this they're gonna be Adam
animo animo disease yeah all right we're
gonna talk about also it wasn't just the
iPhone that was leaked out of this what
about the Apple watch the new iOS 11
gold master that was leaked to and again
for people that are just listening in it
is the final version of the operating
system that is sent out that you and I
will publicly be able to get our hands
on in the Apple watch setup they decided
to run the Apple watch app and this is
video and this is video that nine mi5
Mac posted but they're able to post okay
let's go on the Apple watch app and just
see like hey what what does it look like
did they show anything and revealed what
the new LTE series three Apple watch
will look like now it looks very similar
but what they also showed is there's an
indication where there's like a red dot
on the digital crown and that may or may
not that may or may not exist in the
final iPhone they might just be trying
to point that out but also in in the
images you can see there's a there's a
cellular site there's a like a you know
the cell signal not a cell signal sorry
like a call signal like that signals the
top top left is one of the complications
on the watch which most likely will jump
you into the cellular functionality of
the actual Apple watch yeah a long time
ago Tim Cook was actually even what was
spotted wearing an Apple watch with a
red dot on the crown and everyone
thought oh it might be just a limited
version for him we don't know if the
final final physical Hardware will have
a red dot I honestly hope it does not
like I don't care about I don't want a
red dot on my on an Apple doesn't light
up though no no it just looks like it's
well we don't know actually I shouldn't
say that
I doubt it lights up I highly doubt it
lights up but it's there so you know
we've talked about the LTE watch the
expectation again revealed is that the
LTE Apple watch will use the same phone
number as your iPhone and some carriers
are working on offering at free or
cheaper trial plans to pair your Apple
watch Series 3 with your phone and again
we'll see how much of this data it'll
actually be able to use how in
the pendant it will really be because
earlier rumors had said we won't be able
to use the Apple watches like a direct
to call at least not initially at that
time and it would be oh you could maybe
use FaceTime audio or VoIP apps like
Skype but maybe they've got it resolved
by the time this keynote happens we'll
wait and see but it's another kind of
really that's one of the things I want
to say it would it would be super cool
if it just was a part of your plan that
you already have you know and you know
they gotta make you pay more for a bro I
hope not if they just add the Apple
watch to your current plan where it's
pulling from your data it's pulling from
your minutes the same that would be the
bomb I would go buy one seriously you
know I'm dreaming but if they're gonna
make it like another LTE $20 a month or
whatever $10 a month come on I'm gonna I
you know what it won't be either of
those it's gonna be 15 so we have that
also the firmware points to new Apple
watch finishes blush Gold is one of them
that was also a rumored cult one of the
color options for the new iPhone as well
as a gray ceramic right remember the
first gen one was a sir was a gray was a
ceramic and white so it looks like
they'll be bringing a gray ceramic to
the Apple watch this time around again
all types of crazy stuff just thrown out
Beechum I'm sorry I totally was jumping
around but I did forget that new ohlet's
OLED specific and I think you're on that
page OLED specific wallpapers we're also
found in the firmware for the iPhones as
well okay so let's don't worry you don't
have to worry about it um we're gonna go
on and talk about the Apple TV
the official name looks like it will be
the Apple TV 4k according again to the
revelations from this massive leak the
other kind of cool nuggets about this is
yes it'll support HDR Dolby vision will
be part of the support these have been
confirmed in the firmware the other
thing that may be a part of this is a
new Siri remote it's been noted with a
separate new part number but the Siri
remote could feature some sort of a
haptic feedback or even 3d touch
functionality and there's an indication
that there will be in
additional button on this Siri remote
that's a part of this new Apple TV 4k
haptic feedback yeah a haptic feedback
hmm we will see the other thing that I
find interesting about this Apple TV 4k
is that for the very first time our own
David Katz Meyer who is our TV reviewer
and like set-top box reviewer he was
invited to the Apple Keynote which means
they plan on doing something big like
just don't think about it
they've how many Apple TVs have they
released announced they haven't invited
him ever before this year they're
inviting him I saw him I saw him
lingering around he had like a group of
people following around was sold I think
that's a big deal and also I've got to
imagine they need to tie this in whether
it's with the remote they've got to tie
this to the home pod somehow yeah yeah
has to have some sort of interaction you
know they have they talked about the
surround sound and all that stuff it has
to yeah so that that'll be part of it
the other thing is in the details of the
firmware the a 4k Apple TV appears to
feature an a 10x fusion chip with
systems on the tip with three gigs of
ram so remember the previous Apple TV
was at a nine chip this one appears to
have an a-10 the a9 was not able to
stream or power 4k video at least that's
what Apple had kind of pushed and
claimed and we all knew that the a-10
could because that was in the iPhone 7
so an a-10 chip and three gigs of ram
are expected to be in here and also
there were reports of kind of the
different codecs a video or sorry
different video formats that it would be
supporting that will also include 4k so
the Apple TV will get a boost as well
and then this one was kind of I wanted
you guys to show that if you can show
people that are watching this Beach
there's actually a video clip revealed
of a default Apple TV 4k screensaver we
know how Apple kinda has these cool nice
picturesque screen savers and I into
five Mac pulled this one out from the
firmware again this is a one over there
4k it's a for those listening it's a
snowy landscape with a great like kind
of Scott you can see the sky all the way
down with the Blues
oranges and and these nice clouds it's
it's really pretty and it's just kind of
panning across it nice and slowly yeah
it's cool
and you're watching it right now in 720p
if you're watching yes I'm the last bomb
from this whole drop again we just
wanted to kind of jump in there's just
so much stuff going on is this is the
last piece of the puzzle this is loose
but according to Benjamin Gaskin who has
also been digging into the gold master
there were references in the firmware of
a potential 7th gen iPod touch with face
ID nice so he says in most likely it's
referencing them kind of future proofing
the iPod touch line and that and he
doesn't expect an actual iPod touch to
come out with face ID but it exists in
the code so that that reference is the
fact that we may or may not see
something like this
we'll see cool I'll probably be my kids
first phone it might be iPod touch um
I'm sorry because there's so much stuff
and I've been jumping around I also
forgot to mention and if you can pull up
the revised to air pods gifts that I
have jiff gif whatever you want to call
it again in the firmware we don't we
don't know if this is actually an
entirely brand new air pods but in the
code there's a animation of new air pods
the reason why we call them new if you
look really carefully where the power
right now the current air pods in the
carrying case the power dot the status
of it is inside the cover there's
actually a dot on the outside of the
cover now we indicate at least this is
some type of revised air pods we can't
tell if the stems are shorter or not
they look the same to me but ultimately
we might actually see at the very least
a revised version of air pods at this
keynote or a revised air pod case that
comes with the current air pods nice
this is crazy this is I've never seen so
much official this is official stuff
leaked ever before an Apple Keynote
it's
yeah so uh Beach Omar you know why we
had to come out here I'm a little
overwhelmed that like I feel like the
party's been spoiled for tomorrow but we
had to come out here you know Brian he
texted me really early this morning he's
like so much stuff dropped over the
weekend like we have to get in front of
it you know what I mean because we can't
like look like we don't know what's
going on tomorrow so yeah it's stupid
it's stupid you know yeah so that's
that's why we're here and we're we're
trying to get out in front of the story
and tomorrow we'll see if it all is true
but it's it's looking like it's this is
where we're gonna see people in the Chad
that's there that are saying Apple
leaked them Apple did not leak this
stuff there is no reason there is no
good reason for Apple to leak this stuff
it makes no sense whatsoever so I'm
curious like are you guys and gals less
excited or still hyped about the event I
got to tell you because so much is
dropping and there's still a lot to see
I'm excited about it we want you to call
our show because we're waiting to hear
your impressions about we're gonna do a
podcast right after the keynote like
later in the day to get our hot take raw
