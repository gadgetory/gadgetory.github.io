the FCC over free data services the FCC
issued a report stating that Verizon's
freebie data 360 offer and a TNT's
DirecTV now service both violate net
neutrality rules the plans both fall
under what are called zero rating
services which means an Internet service
provider doesn't count a particular
application or data use against
customers monthly caps the reason the
FCC frowns upon that is because it could
give Wireless and broadband providers an
unfair advantage over competition here's
an example a company like AT&amp;amp;T offering
free data services for DirecTV which is
an HTT subsidiary could harm other
streaming services competing for
customer subscriptions on 18 G's network
both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon insists their
programs are open to any video companies
who want to pay for customer data the
FCC on the other hand says since both
companies owned their networks provide
the streaming services and employ
aggressive pricing for those services it
would be a cost advantage over other
companies that couldn't compete whether
or not there will be any action beyond
the FCC's report is unlikely though
since Chairman Tom Wheeler will be
stepping down once president-elect
Donald Trump is sworn in and wheelers
likely successor doesn't appear to agree
much with the FCC's more recent rulings
and reports oh and one more thing if
you're one of those people clinging to a
legacy unlimited data subscription on
either AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon both companies
recently announced plans to crack down
on their heaviest data users for more
