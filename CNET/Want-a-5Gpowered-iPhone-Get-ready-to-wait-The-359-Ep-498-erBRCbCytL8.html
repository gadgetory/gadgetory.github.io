thanks for joining us for the recording
of the 359 podcast seen its daily live
news podcast right here on YouTube
livestream and periscope as always it's
episode 498 on Tuesday December 4th and
before we get into the show I have a pop
quiz for Ben and Raj or Ben and Roger do
you know what Sin City is yes yeah okay
do you know what dense city is dense
city yep like density of mass over
volume yeah
yeah I know what density is oh oh god
yes yeah mass over volume
you killed my joke no that was the joke
sorry
all right sorry once again we fail good
job good job yeah okay all right it's
time for me to introduce what we're
gonna be talking about on the show more
5g because what what there's even more
5g to talk about this one related to the
iPhone I hope right about that
he's very psyched also I got a chance to
write about rings neighbor's app which
definitely like put a bit of a scare in
me over all the alleged crime crimes
that are going on in my neighborhood
anyway I'm happy to be living in an
apartment yeah but well get to all of
that in the podcast send in your
questions and comments about 5g home
security tools we'll talk all about that
stuff after 3 minutes and 59 seconds so
let's get to the podcast from 3 to
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
Roger Tsien apple plans to wait until
2020 to start selling a 5g powered
iPhone that's according to a story from
bloomberg yesterday which supports
previous reports and apples typical
strategy when a new network gets
deployed so Roger the first question I
have is why would Apple wanna wait until
2020 if you know what is it Samsung's
already making noise about
yep creating 5g phones for I think it's
Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T next year what's what's
the benefit for them the benefit is I
mean this is the standard Apple playbook
right they don't like to jump in and
need new technology quickly they did
this with wireless charging with Apple
mobile payments they basically wait for
the technology to mature until more
people have it or comfortable with the
idea
make sure although the wrinkles have
been ironed out and then they jump in
they did this with 3G they did a 4G they
were always about a year behind year and
a half behind I'd argue this time around
with 5g being as given to the excitement
level 5g is so high there's a lot of
interest in it you know it may not be
the best move for Apple to to wait this
long but you know you've got to wake the
cycles right like late 2019 if they're
missing out that then you've got to wait
till like 2024 5g iPhone
you know it's again Apple you know Apple
is Apple right do you think so do you
think that competitors would actually be
able to steal customers away from them
because of this like because I'm
wondering if 5g is really gonna be much
of a thing next year anyway no that is a
fantastic question I think 29 29 teen is
one 5g kicks-off but it won't be broadly
available you're right it'll be in you
know a handful of cities a dozen cities
here and there and even within those
cities just a few neighborhoods it's
gonna take a while for 5u to ramp up so
Apple can make the argument that you
know it's still not around it's not
broadly available why are we gonna you
know invest in it now the character that
is there's this whole 5g ecosystem
moving towards upgrading everything
networks devices and Apple does risk
falling behind given that all these
other companies are gonna be a year or
two more experienced in dealing with the
issues with 5g we talked yesterday about
how 5g wasn't gonna be perfect from the
get-go but in order to make it in order
to improve the service you've got
actually get it out there and so Apple
is gonna be starting a little bit and we
started late but they're also gonna be
starting kind of fresh whereas everyone
else will have a bunch of years of 5g
work under their dome yeah unfortunately
I think Apple continues to benefit from
the fact that they control their own iOS
ecosystem so you'd have to get somebody
that's really excited about 5g to
actually jump ship and unfortunately I
think you know Samsung and all the other
competitors know that so we'll see if
they actually really yeah the the
geekiest of geeks who are into 5g might
make the move but for most people you're
right they're probably gonna stick to
their iOS ecosystem yeah so next I wrote
about neighbors the neighbors app from
ring which is Amazon smart home company
the app is part of a new crop of social
network like neighborhood watch apps
what was interesting to me about this
was I got a chance to like see some of
the alleged crimes that were going on in
my neighborhood yeah there was like a
some some folks that were apparently
trying to like break into a car somebody
was vandalizing and outside street light
I mean like I live in a quiet
neighborhood in New Jersey and what's
what's obvious
me is the benefits for companies like
ring for having something like this
because it could convince more people to
buy and their products basically like
free advertising right like check out
all the crimes of your neighborhood you
really upgrade to a ring system so I
talked to an analyst about this and he
said that you have to draw a very
careful line if your ring for this kind
of thing yeah you want to create a
neighborhood watch app that actually has
benefits for the neighborhood and you
don't want it just make it look like an
advertisement because then it's just
cynical and people aren't gonna buy into
it but so far that's confessing this is
sort of like it's almost like a social
feed yes and it's pretty entertaining I
mean like that's the thing is that you
know if you get sick of like Facebook or
like checking out like your other feeds
you go on like the neighbor's feed and
you're like oh my god I can't believe
that's happening so that's sure and all
that stuff I mean people love watching
these kinds of videos they you've got
direct feed to them I got I got a little
obsessed with it but either way if you
want to read more about these stories
check them out on CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben
I'm dr. Jenn thanks for listening thanks
for joining us and sitting around while
we ramble off about 5g which is the
least visually interesting thing you can
put to screen I mean I can show some
spectrum ways or something or I could I
could do the wave yeah do the wave
that's five G it's gonna be a meme soon
oh yeah that's exactly what I'm gonna do
though cuz I'm tired of you guys talking
about five g's having nothing to show
for the sake of b-roll so as like a
producer it's the lamest thing so I'm
consumer it's the coolest thing as a
producer it's the lamest thing so I'm
gonna hire an interpretive dance trip
yes to tell them it's true I mean it's
cool to talk about until it gets rolled
out and then people are so clearly gonna
complain right about the spotty coverage
and I yeah if they can seamlessly
transition you from 5g to 4G within
whatever city you are would have been
whatever neighbor
you know that'll make it a little bit
easier but at the same time it's it's a
lot of big promises quick plug for Shara
and chart tip Ken and Jessica dual core
they're out in Maui tough job they're
out in Maui right now Qualcomm in a few
hours is about to kick off the the first
keynote of their Snapdragon text summit
where eventually either today or
tomorrow they will actually have test
devices that will run on mock flat nut
mock but sort of specialized like
sandbox 5g networks so they'll actually
get to try out what that connection
speeds like what the experience is like
you know I've had a chance to try it
like I was in Brussels headquarters few
years back I wrote around on a van in a
very creepy looking dark van that showed
what the network speeds were like and so
yes Brian to your point this is not the
most visually exciting technology but
seeing the speed seeing the the
throughput there I mean that is pretty
exciting
going back to Qualcomm by the way yeah
one of the elements of this Apple iPhone
storyline relates to Qualcomm right that
they're having this I think Apple sued
them right yeah well they're they're
basically suing each other at this point
Apple I think refused to pay Qualcomm
for all the patents involved arguing
that allow the technology Apple has
developed and Qualcomm didn't and they
didn't want to pay for all the
technology that is part of the the
royalty agreement Qualcomm is sued there
they're I think they're kind of in this
whole lawsuit counter lawsuit situation
now but as a result Apple is kind of
pulled away from Qualcomm as a supplier
of modems yeah using instead Intel and
Intel has traditionally been a little
bit behind when it comes to modem
technology that's why you're seeing all
these companies kind of jump forward now
with 5g next year an Apple while Apple
traditionally waited before embracing
what else acknowledges it definitely is
a factor that they don't have Qualcomm
to to lean on anymore they've got they
basically have just Intel and Intel has
generally been a little bit behind
yeah it's actually been impressive to me
I used to cover chips and it's been
impressive to me
how much Intel has been able to catch up
yeah they were so far behind Qualcomm
for what when I was covering Intel and
Qualcomm like three years ago that the
idea of them getting the iPhone account
was almost laughable yeah and they've
they've definitely stepped up
considerably but this is Qualcomm's
bread-and-butter Qualcomm is a wireless
chip company so it's it goes back to
what I said during the podcast it's
really obvious that Apple is at a slight
disadvantage here because they're only
using Intel however it just doesn't seem
likely that they would actually pay the
price for that like as far as losing
consumers it's still from a consumer
perspective folks aren't really gonna
notice or they're not gonna care as much
especially like in 2019 when 5g is
really just getting yeah I would say
like with I remember with LTE there was
a lot of attention a lot of marketing
hype when it launched and you know right
at the time the iPhone base it didn't
have 4G and it's fine with that
I don't know I feel like the excitement
level for 5 G's a lot higher maybe I'm
just close to it or too close it's
definitely notable because that that's
what they're promising they're like this
is gonna be like 4G on Mars on steroids
or something I don't know like they're
really like playing it up a lot so we'll
see mm-hmm what do we got Brian all
right let's jump into the chat take some
questions let's go ahead and talk about
well let's keep talking about 5g I guess
Darrius says I feel like the consumer
market is not ready for 5g technology
especially on mobile phones as a
follow-up to that our wallop asks what
exactly is the difference on phones
between 4G and 5g so let's break it down
Commission consumer style fantastic
question well the difference largely in
your phone will be speed and what's
known as latency or the the lag time
between you know when you enter search
and when the response gets back
speeds are supposed to be I mean
depending on
how what kind of five you network and
there are multiple versions not to
overcomplicate things but if you're on
one of those millimeter wave spectrum
networks that is speeds that are like a
hundred times faster than what you're
gonna get right now you know very
similar actually even faster than you
know Google Fiber was back in the day so
like 10 to 20 gig connection which was a
physical connection yeah and Google
Fiber was you know one gigabyte
connection and that was a physical fiber
line that that brought it in yeah I can
see why people get excited yeah like
latency like that that's important for
things like if you're playing for
tonight you know being able to like hit
the being able to fire your gun and have
that responsiveness have that gonna
actually fire in real time there's
always a lag right now with mobile
networks but with with live G that lag
gets diminished significantly so those
are some of the main benefits so as far
as 5g on and iPhone goes daddy says only
if it's under 500 bucks ah sorry man
that ain't happened that's not a thing I
don't even think Samsung is gonna do
that if they've got like some of the
earliest 5g Saint stat just being
sarcastic
I know I know it's the idea here is is
that they're gonna charge you a lot of
money for those earliest faulty phones
yeah I would say the early 4G LTE phones
weren't super expensive you know they
were pretty moderate price a lot of them
though we're like purpose-built for LTE
like the HTC Thunderbolt was the one I
always remember cuz I had that one it
wasn't a great phone you know battery
was terrible dropped off the network
really quickly it was not a good
experience great next up let's talk to
you day who's asking can we see the
iPhone equipped at 5g as early as next
year now definitely not we were just
covering that as the primary story
I think Intel is feeling the pressure
from Qualcomm and AMD which is a good
thing and that's from conga locks as a
follow up Timothy says will AMD compete
with Intel in the cellular modem Justin
oh sure I'm guessing no I don't think
they do any modem to
this goes back to again I know AMD has
definitely been pressuring intel on the
processor side has had some really good
advancements with their chips and I
think Intel stuffing feeling the heat
but that's on the processor side I'm not
aware of AMD doing any cellular radio
technology though you're talking about
mobile processors I didn't even know any
PC process oh I gotcha yeah I'm just
saying like from a modem perspective I
don't think they do a lot of work in
that area yeah I don't think so either
I don't cover AMD regularly so I
apologize if I'm wrong but I'm not aware
of like any cellular technology that
they've been working on so what exactly
is the 5g spectrum frequency there
depends on who you ask there's a there's
a ton initially there was known as
millimeter wave spectrum basically if
we're basically running on our current
networks are on things like 700
megahertz 800 megahertz millimeter wave
is more like 20 gigahertz so that that
higher frequency means a fatter pipe for
more capacity
it means lower shorter range to when
you've got that kind of high frequency
you need to build more cell towers
because the range isn't that long but
they basically have pushed it all the
way pushed down the definition of 5g so
that basically any spectrum can use 5g
and it comes down to responsiveness and
and a more moderate speed boost so if
you're using 700 megahertz spectrum for
5g it's not going to be as fast as that
28 gigahertz but it will be faster than
4G just not that much faster which one
is better for punching through walls is
it the lower frequencies so 700 600 that
the Lord is the better it is to get
through walls and across great distances
mmm yeah 28 32 gigahertz that kind of
super high millimeter wave spectrum is
really finicky even like a leaf would
disturb it yeah like yeah your
connection gets distorted mmm so yeah
here's one from Storm King how much more
with a 5g phone cost than a current
flagship that's still to be determined I
think
and have to keep on par with current
prices whether they yeah like a thousand
dollar phone probably since that's where
where we are now that's where we are now
I'm not sure if it's gonna be more like
significantly more expensive but maybe a
slight premium I I mean look how much
more expensive could the iPhone guide I
granted those are my famous last words I
suppose but like in 2020 a 5g they've
gotten more expensive right but like
they're not gonna sell it for two grand
right not yet I can't wait for this
video to get played two years from now
there you go yeah so but the market is
there there is a ceiling to that market
I agree with you that it's gonna be at
least a thousand dollars because these
are all gonna be flagship phones yeah 5g
isn't really gonna trickle down until
like the lower tiers until I would think
later years 2020 at least yeah yeah so
yeah you're gonna be paying at least a
thousand bucks I would say yeah I mean I
can imagine like an lg phone coming out
for like 800 bucks 700 bucks yeah so I
mean it's not gonna be all really priced
but they're definitely on the higher end
of the spectrum would you recommend to
anybody that you know to like not wait
like you would probably say wait until
2020 anyway for four or five do a 5g
phone yeah um it depends on where he
lives like if you happen to be in one of
those 5g markets it might be worth
checking out and especially if you were
already gonna buy a Samsung phone or buy
a I don't know like an lg phone or
oneplus zone I take that back one plus I
think they're only 5g phone there 5g
phone will be in in Europe not in the US
so just Samsung I guess okay who do we
think is going to be the first one to
the budget 5g front line that's okay
that's that's from you that's a good
question my guess would be LG or Samsung
not Motorola maybe I just think that
Samsung's you have more resources to
play with I think it'd be a smart move
for Motorola to get aggressive on that
cuz we're not doing so hot
well yeah but you've already tempered in
that play
around there they're busy makin phones
that we had in the 90s early 2000 making
mods
yeah mods so that's how they're getting
the 5g almost first I think because
they've got a mod to their existing
motor phones that you can plug in and it
gets loved gee that sounds like cheating
but okay okay good
sure all right so let's go ahead and
talk about the dangers and power now
we've brushed on this before as we've
covered this topic a thousand times
Mario's concerned if 5g might be too
powerful tell truth vision TV says will
5g in fact powerful enough to penetrate
buildings Raz is asking if it could be
deadly and references these cited events
in the Netherlands and in California
where allegedly 5g was killing wildlife
which was debunked which was debunked
and we actually covered this on
yesterday's episode about that because I
was almost like oh my god yeah in terms
of the the power question that goes back
to what we're talking about with with
spectrum and what kind of spectrum is
being used
you know these carriers are looking to
combine different bands of spectrums so
you have the lower frequency stuff go
through the walls
the higher frequency stuff will probably
be more useful outdoors particularly in
packed metro areas where they can you
know they don't have as much problem
stringing together a bunch of small
cells and cell towers to broadcast all
that they're gonna have some issues out
in suburbs like I live in suburbs where
people are a little bit more adverse to
having so many small cells all around
them so I think that's gonna be one of
the big hooks of big hang-ups between
that and in rural areas that's still
gonna be a problem I mean I know
t-mobile and Sprint have talked about
the benefits of 5g for rural America I'm
still pretty skeptical about whether or
not they'll actually get some of that
coverage out there given the expense of
stringing together this network but yeah
again in terms of power the health
question I know we've fielded that
pretty much every time we've talked
about 5g we don't have any conclusive
evidence either way so like
I don't really want to comment too much
about it big response yeah oh I am I do
acknowledge that there's definitely
concern out there but we just there
there isn't any evidence right now one
way or the other my two cents on that is
they've taken such sweet time going over
this delving and testing it that there's
no way in hell that that's going to seep
through the cracks like safety tests
have to be at the top of the list at
least I would certainly hope so yes I
can't they do validate or qualify that
in any way shape or form but after how
long it's taken for them to develop this
network they must have spent significant
amount of time testing that right I'm
sure safety is a factor I don't know if
it's the factor I you know I would hope
that the FCC other organizations are
testing this as well and it's not just
on the the carriers good response I
never thought I would be the cautious
optimist in this group all right one
more quick one on 5g from our buddy
Carlos are we still going to get traffic
connections online with 5g when it's not
in rush-hour traffic can actually what
I'm not really sure what he's referring
to to be honest
traffic connections no everything will
be perfect with 5g Oh God except it'll
kill wildlife I think he's concerned
with maybe the bandwidth getting
restricted with the smart cars utilizing
so much of the of the files
got it so yeah there's that's a great
question five to one of the good things
about five g's sort of the ability to
partition off connections like it'll
know you're a smartphone user and you
don't necessarily need like the full ten
gigs of connection
particularly if you're just browsing the
internet if you want video they'll
probably kick up the the bandwidth a bit
but it'll also be smart enough to know
that like the the low-power sensors in
office buildings will require a buncha
slower connection or a self-driving car
will need a more persistent connection
doesn't necessarily fast it has to be
consistent it has to be extremely
responsive and so 5g can actually
customize connections to different
devices based on their
their needs and so again that's one of
the benefits that is some more a lot
more customizable than networks in the
past fascinating all right I said there
were last five G question but here's a
really really good one from Timothy will
current plans be grandfathered in when
five G rolls out question attest a
question I would say early on yes I
don't think I think it'll be I don't
think there'll be a 5g premium plan I
know Sprint's former CEO Marcelo Clara
hinted that that would be a premium
service but everyone else I've talked to
is said that no this is just gonna be
kind of pushed into your existing plan I
don't think you're gonna pay a 5g
premium at least up front you know we
didn't see that with LTE and with LT you
just sort of jumped on and that was
great you did see later on once like
more people jumped on and they started
hitting capacity issues they started
changing the business model and that
might happen 5g down the line but right
now I imagine early days it's gonna be
kind of experimental they're gonna want
people on anyway so they're not gonna
put up too many barriers for that right
but it does it does beg the question
about unlimited plans which have gotten
really really popular on 4G networks yes
I do wonder 5g it's like the limited
amount of 5g would be able to handle an
unlimited plan but from what you're
telling us about 5g it's able to manage
a ton of capacity yeah yeah I mean
especially the higher frequency spectrum
can handle that that extra actually
those extra demands from consumers and
given that it's it's a small coverage
not gonna be a lot of people on it for
like the first year it should be great
it's like an open highway wherever you
can get it nice we're out of time but
shout out to Matthew Dasher says ring
neighborhoods posted a picture of the
kid that stole a package from his porch
we'll keep our fingers crossed for you
that law enforcement does intervene and
catch that punk Michael Brown is asking
where can you find this ring social
network I want to check it out I'll post
the link as always in the description
when the show posts for on-demand so you
can find that you got a like build into
that ecosystem before we go serene joy
says Ben Fox Ruben make yourself useful
and come up with the craziest 5g iPhone
name ooh oh wow I well look I wasn't
installed before so I I think it's it's
tiny
my Wow okay all right here we go
brain juices flowing the iPhone 5 g q x
11 super smash ultra good I like that
okay that was a nice touch I was trying
that class stood up all right take a
sign out of here okay all right I'll do
it
3:59 is available in iTunes tune ins
that your Feedburner google play music
google podcasts the amazon echo and of
course cnet.com thanks everybody for
watching and sending in your questions
and we'll be talking more about 5g for
the rest of our lives
all right see y'all tomorrow
