suburban and that's what this vehicles
attuned to not something you want to
pilot through small city streets but if
you've got a big family with big amounts
of stuff and maybe your big people on
top of that this is America's SUV now
spotting the new suburban is really easy
the look is quite dramatically different
the face is much more crisp and bold
you've got this really strong feature
line right here around the Beltline
that's causing the vehicle to look a
little lower and longer and the same
thing goes for the way they've
recontoured that third quarter rear side
glass all of it says a long stretch the
15 also has a new way of integrating
doors into body instead of clam shelling
over they now fit inside everything's
big in the cabin it fits the vehicles
overall dimensions of course it also
makes it very tactless satisfying lots
of storage everywhere of course cup
holders and bins for phones and look at
this this bin is so large it actually
qualifies as a seat for a child don't do
that now your eyes first drawn to this
chevy mylink head unit which in chevy
general motors fashion has this little
peekaboo Smuggler's box back behind it
you've also got a USB port there one of
like seven in the vehicle now this
MyLink rig with navigation is actually
optional you won't get the nav package
unless you do take the right box which
we'll talk about later I find the
process things a little slow of course
it is doing 3d building rendering which
I don't find terribly useful but the way
it lays out streets and labels is some
of the best in the business
navigation what kind of destination
street address it's a little slow on the
uptake but it does let you give
addresses in one straight blurb not
piece by piece that's good
do I have any text messages Chevy was an
early adopter of Siri eyes free which
lets you connect a paired iPhone from
message composition without looking at
the screen otherwise app support on this
vehicle is basically Pandora predictive
music stitcher podcast streaming and
tune in live radio station streaming
beyond that your media sources are
pretty much everything you want
you've got CD iPod USB Jack SD card slot
which plays video by the way though a
little bulky in this case bluetooth
streaming obviously and in this car we
have a rear seat entertainment system as
well we'll look at that in a second meta
tag layout is really good and I like the
fact that all the touchscreen buttons
like everything in this car are big and
easy to access
I just keep getting bedeviled by the
slow processing of everything
now through OnStar this is gonna be one
of the first vehicles out that has an
integrated 4G connection our vehicle
doesn't have it yet we're shooting in
mid-2014 later in the year that should
be coming online though if you're gonna
order one of these by the way this is
one of the first cars out there that has
a front center airbag this is between
the two front passengers so there's an
impact you don't get injured by hitting
each other or if it's just you in the
front seat it reduces your injury from
flopping over the console now drive
controls in this vehicle are very
traditional you've got a classic
American stock mounted lever up here if
you want to do your own shifting it's on
this rocker switch here on that lever
over here you've got your four wheel
drive control most folks will leave it
in Auto but you've got your two four
high and four low all located over here
they make it very simple no levers to
pull no clunky stuff it's all nicely
sanitized
there are no drive modes of sorts in
this car unless you want to count towing
and trailer mode you've got buttons for
that and controls or for breaking over
here but otherwise there's no sport or
nonsense of that type it's not that kind
of vehicle now gia has been doing
something that gives you an alert in the
bottom of the seat with a vibration if
there's one on the left and one on the
right right down here in the bolsters if
you've got a sonar indication on the
left you'll feel it there on the right
you'll feel it there front and back
you'll get both of them vibrating at
once I gotta say it gets your attention
very well more than beeps and lights and
all sound alike on the other hand though
it's not very specific information you
have to say what what does that mean
every time blind spot detection cross
traffic alert back their lane departure
warning those are all passive front
collision warning can also be set to
active braking however and of course the
optional adaptive cruise control will
actively maintain both speed and
distance now here in the engine Bay's
interesting story you know a lot of
Ford's are going to turbo v6 is not this
guy 5.3 liter v8 modernized with direct
injection but decidedly old-school in
two other ways its overhead valve not
overhead cam and just two valves per
cylinder where almost every other engine
in the world is four and the power it
makes is three hundred and fifty-five
horse we hundred eighty three
foot-pounds of torque
probably good numbers of course but this
is a big vehicle active cylinder
management is here it Cleaves this v8
into a v4 when you're cruising or
coasting and you'll pick up one mile per
gallon if you choose the rear-wheel
drive configuration driving this new
Suburban tells me everything I need to
know about General Motors market
research and here's why this vehicle
screams big heavy isolated and safe
clearly attributes they've heard over
and over from suburban owners that they
want to stay in this vehicle it's got a
fair amount of power as we notice but
it's not responsive to the throttle
steering is isolated as well I'm not
that impressed with this magnetic ride
control suspension is doing I know it's
very technologically advanced but I'm
just feeling too much of the little
details in the road printing through the
bottom of my seat
but this is your classic original SUV
big high riding in command and lots of
space and early now our 2015 suburban
LTZ top of the line starts off about 62
7 with destination 3,000 more if you
wanted four-wheel drive like ours key
package to go CNET style is dorkly
called sun entertainment and
destinations for little over 3,300 you
get the MyLink with navigation the dual
9-inch blu-ray rear seat entertainment
rig and the power sunroof adaptive
cruise is 1700 more and under five
hundred bucks to get you a hotspot
though right now it's still a 3G hot
spot wait till later in 2014 to get the
4G powered one through the OnStar
services package a little over 71 grand
the way we see it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
