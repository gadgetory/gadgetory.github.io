privacy we will not but what we will do
today is talk about the iPad Pro there
is obviously more fallout if you can't
see this I am shaking my pencil at the
camera it's a good scolding stick but
it's actually also really cool pencil
note we're gonna hear if you got ready
here we go catch this pretty cool it's
it's like it feels like ceramic e it's
really nice so while Stephen is playing
with the iPad pro pencil and just like
checking it out we want to talk about
display mate every time a new tablet
comes out display mate puts them through
the test display mate is known for
basically their benchmarking of the
quality and what these LCD tablets their
screens and displays how they perform
how they compare to others
now they consider the iPad pro a
top-tier display for tablets which is a
good thing overall I got an a-minus
based on their scoring but if you if you
had to guess beat them I don't know if
you know this what product bested the
iPad pro what do you think it would be
in terms of tablets yeah an across we're
timeout multiple brands what do you
think might be in that running that's a
really tough one
maybe the pixel okay keep on I need any
other any other shots in the dark you'd
like to go more the Microsoft yeah
what's this one I will give you major
kudos okay
the surface pro is one of those displays
that bested the iPad pro but even better
they call it unequivocally the best
tablet display in
entire market the iPad Mini 4 oh wow Oh
based on color gamut color accuracy
representation reflectance across the
level across all these different
benchmarks they measured the iPad Mini 4
was the best in class if not they called
a record-breaking based on all previous
displays before it Wow
so the iPad pro maybe they should called
the iPad kind of pro yeah iPad semi-pro
you guys see the Will Ferrell movie
semi-pro yeah iPad kind of pro iPad
semi-pro I still I still love it well
we'll talk more about it I actually
tried using it as a lab like literally
tried to use it as my dedicated computer
yeah how long did that last
I see it's funny you say that literally
I'm not even kidding I forced myself 15
minutes oh my god okay because you
already rent you run into a problem
right away right then quite honest
because look I do not only to I do
emails I do spreadsheets I do Show
rundowns I do reading links copying
links pulling video Photoshop editing
videos I do all that in a day the iPad
pro can't do that efficiently it's it
just can't yeah now when I then I took
out the surface pro 4 and I was I didn't
do Photoshop on it because I just didn't
want to mm-hmm
because I didn't have a mouse setup with
it yet but 80% of what I just told you I
was able to do on the surface Pro
without feeling like I've gotta like
open up a new app oh I've got to do this
it's it really comes down to how you use
it but why do I have an iPad pro because
I'm a media consumption junkie when I
travel yeah so for work purposes it's
not it's not even close it's not even
close
yeah and anyone who picks it up and
tries you know when Tim Cook says oh I
could do it replace my work computer
it's only because he's on phone calls
and he's doing email and reading reports
yeah there's just no way he's not doing
all the dirty work that we have to do
anyone creating any type of work content
it's just the surface pro has a trackpad
on its keyboard case
okay that's all you need to know that's
cool you can also plug in stuff to a
write like USB plug in accessories and
things like that but uh do I love the
iPad pro for what it is yes but I does
it have the power to be more yes but it
has a long ways to go we have some calls
related to that that we'll get to later
in the show an iPad pro Bugaboo Apple is
now investigating iPad pros being
unresponsive after charging it over a
long period of time the iPad pro pretty
much goes to sleep you might think it's
broken and your only hope is to press
the hard restart that's a bad apple that
guess who's that happen who that has
happened to multiple times oh really
this guy oh my god Scott I freaked out
right I bought the first time I charged
it I'm like whoa what's going on right
like you're like touching stuff why do I
really have to hard I didn't know this
until this story came out right I'm like
do I really have to hard restart this
hard restart worth I'm like okay cool
the next night plug it in again a winner
when is once it hit around like eighty
seven percent or something
shut down again and I had a hard restart
and then I'm like huh this is weird so I
didn't really think anything of it and
then I saw these articles and reports
and people talking about it and then I'm
like it's a thing so is that a software
bug or yeah because when I first did my
iOS update the latest one that my phone
was doing the same thing you know I mean
not not with charging but it was
crashing and I have to do hard reboots
I think it's an iOS 9 issue more than
anything else it's some bug in the
system it like you said that's exactly
what's gonna get to you like leave my
mind right because we're like some potty
we're like into we are into me we're in
sync
bye-bye this is like the musical edition
of the show or something but um yeah it
happens to people that updated their
phones it's happening the iPad pro Apple
is investigating hmm what should we call
this one what you know should call this
power gate restart people get all pissed
off when we start calling things gate
now charge your iPad gate power cane all
right more Apple stores beginning to
receive the very limited stocks of the
Apple pencil the one that Stephen
Beecham has in his hand
we're gonna we're gonna do the white one
it's pretty cool you know what I think
for next week's show even though people
can't see it I think we should have a
trying contest I think you and I should
pick a picture the same picture but then
each do our best renditions possible of
it okay and then show the result and see
who does better and really maybe we'll
have a limited time like you have to
replicate this picture in like 20
minutes okay right right and I'm not
gonna practice on it and I don't want
you to practice on it but we should at
least come to agreement on my picture
and then whoever see who rapid maybe we
should just do a live on the show and
give each other like 30 seconds or
something oh my god the iPad Pro could
be awesome for pictionary oh yes I
didn't even think about Wow I found
another use case for it yeah I have no
artistic I have not won artistic bone in
my body so I'm gonna draw stick figures
I've got a little bit also we just want
to show you guys a video for those of
you watching surface pro vs. iPad pro a
lot of people have finally been able to
start putting it through the paces I
tend to rely on people that are actual
artists to show me how well it is
because you know sometimes you have no
offense anybody but you have people like
AI look at what I drew on the iPad like
you're not gonna use it every day like a
digital artist is no so I want to see
what these artists have to say they both
agree that the pencil and the Microsoft
Surface pro pen is very responsive it
does change its responsiveness based on
apps they did to the Apple pencil does
respond to pressure better and when you
write really small finer print the Apple
pencil tends to be a little better at
that as well so a little more detailed
again other people don't also say they
love the eraser on the surface pro pen
like really Apple should have put an
eraser on that thing oh really it
doesn't have an eraser it doesn't so
when you flip when you flip the surface
pro pen on its a backside it can be
served as an eraser wow that's cool
which is super cool yeah I mean that's
what a pencil that does Apple not an
Apple pencil and Apple pencil could do
whatever it wants watch they'll be like
a thirty dollar like add-on piece that
you can like stick on the top of it
it'll be like yeah connect to the
Lightning port and then have another
lightning port it'll be like a yeah
maybe $50 $29.99
that's actually a really good point if
you predict that we need to record we
need to save this clip right now what's
the date let me say 15 yeah all right
also on the stress tests it's the
Internet age people like put everything
possible under some kind of torture test
Zach Straley my man on YouTube decided
to like put the pen in an iPad pro and
like bend it and like put weight on it
and wiggle it side to side and we found
some very revealing conclusions from
this if you bend something enough and
try to break it enough it will break who
break it will break that's incredible so
right now he's just showing you can just
fast forward in the video a little bit
like just keep on going at I'm like wait
waiter he's so he's right now he's like
wiggling and stuff oh that's yeah that's
the only way to charge it in so that's
why I said you can use it like a protest
sign yeah you could like you pop it in
the port but it's mostly pretty sturdy
so all right people listen like whatever
we're totally over listen this guy all
right that looks like every all bent up
and I'll torn up and everything man
also this one's kind of cool if you
believe in unicorns in the tech space a
rare of manufacturing error leaves the
iPad pro with a gold like a silver iPad
pro with a gold touch ID ring so a user
on nine to five Mac submitted it and
said look guys I have this he called
Apple Apple said it was a manufacturing
error that is extremely rare it's a
silver iPad with a gold touch ID ring
what did the guy do put on eBay put it
on eBay
that's what man I think they were still
stuck on the pen right now on the video
oh sorry sorry
it's okay here we go yeah so there you
can kind of see it in the picture here
for people that are listening you can't
see this it's a gold ring around a
silver iPad pro
put on eBay I don't know if he actually
sold it though because it looks like he
took down the auction early but um and I
wonder if Apple contacted
well they said that if he wanted a one
that was colored properly he would have
to return it and get it swapped out I
would keep that yeah keep it that's
super cool cool super cool
all right um you know what we like to
keep the lights on here at CNET and we

Apple bite okay other things we want
to kind of follow up with last week's
show we asked people Oh someone asked um
can I use the Apple new Apple remote
with the old Apple TV and then I said
well do they even sell the new remote
separately yes the answer is yes Apple
sells the Siri remote with a touchpad
separately they sell it for $79
but then they got me thinking and I'm
like wait 79 bucks for the remote isn't
the Apple TV the new Apple TV the entire
package 149 do the remote is more than
the freaking Apple TV that's like the
Apple TV is like 70 bucks if you just
strip the remote away the remote is 79
bucks dude
how is the remote more than the set-top
box it is when your Apple I could have
but I literally couldn't believe that
that's why they're the biggest company
in the world
they were there hoping to sell a lot of
remotes yes let's just put it that way
also Apple watch getting some the little
extension links for the Space Gray that
space black link you were you were
feeling that design specifically our
yeah totally that was the one that you
said if I was gonna get one that was the
one so they have these extension kits
for people with really large risk myself
not included I think I removed like five
I think I moved like five of them all so
we keep on going Apple has their
headphones that match their devices
Apple is now not only doing a gold
headphone but by Beats they're also
doing a rose gold phone rose gold
headphones so if you scroll to if you
click on the like the last color of that
configuration you'll be able to see the
it's rose go this one right here oh I
see up top up top up top up top near to
the green yes and then a little higher
near the green that says that to bag
there's like four color dots I'm sorry
oh you know that's like you know let's
go you know when you you know when
you're telling someone to do something
to the computer and you see it and they
don't yeah and you're like no click
that's right and they're like no no it's
over there
over there it drives me bomb in ways
Apple rose gold Beats headphones go and
get them for all you ladies and
gentlemen their allotted there are a lot
of dudes that were on fire about that
gold road that rose gold I swear I'm not
even kidding I got a lot of tweets about
that stuff rose gold bro brah
all right Apple pay great progress here
Apple pay by the end of the year and the
beginning of this year to roll out
support for Domino's and Cinnabon oh
there you go you said a Bambang I just
had a Cinnabon Cinnabon dude I just had
a Cinnabon when I watch this I'd
literally I kid you not I had to sit him
on when I went to the Steve Jobs movie
this past week and that you know I'm
gonna say you had to be in like a movie
theater or in the airport to get
cinnamon most definitely also Walgreens
is going to become the first retailer to
accept their rewards cards using Apple
pay so one of the new functions of the
wallet app is that it supports rewards
cards Walgreens gonna be part of that
and also internationally we've had a lot
of callers ask one is Apple pay coming
to my area they've probably already
heard about this Apple pay is now
available in Canada with American
Express are you have to be on American
Express not everyone is baby steps also
g'day mates
Australia finally getting Apple pay
support as well if you have an American
Express card nice and then the UK is
getting support from two new banks Tesco
bank and TSB but at least you're
starting to instead of being hopeless
and wondering when is any of this gonna
happen you're starting to see progress
Apple is working with more banks to get
more support so just gonna be a matter
of time for Canada and Australia to keep
on getting the love with the Apple pay
yeah when I was um when I was I was
traveling yesterday and I had my
Southwest ticket on my phone right and
it there was an option to add it to my
Apple wallet I was like oh that's kind
of interesting so you know just put your
your whatever yeah you know it's kind of
cool and you did it right no I didn't
because I'm not I'm not you I don't use
okay okay here's the thing let me tell
you because I travel all the time right
like pretty much every other week
minimum once you add it your Apple
wallet the cool thing is because it
knows when your flight is on your lock
screen once it's about like an hour
before your flight it shows up on your
lock screen uh-huh and then you just
swipe and then it shows the boarding
pass immediately you don't have to dig
into your phone that's pretty
yeah yeah cuz I do have to dig into my
phone right then you go like Oh where's
my boarding pass or sometimes people
just like having the physical ticket but
I'm just saying I've gone to the habit
of using that specifically for my travel
nice well I will keep that in mind for
the next time coming up soon actually so
we just teased about a little better
than a Cinnabon bomb bond I had it at
the movies like Beecham and I made a
commitment to go to see the Steve Jobs
movie because they recently remember we
told you they pulled it from 2,000
screens yeah they're like we gotta do
this it's probably good idea if we do
this Apple byte podcast that we actually
watched the movie and so Steven I'd like
to kind of hear your overall consensus
and how about this on a rating of three
uh what is it how about five apples
after you give us your scoop and your
skinny what would you rate the movie I'm
gonna give it three-and-a-half apples I
thought it was I thought it was really
good it was very dialogue heavy and
that's probably why it wasn't so popular
there's no explosions was no like aliens
or laser explosions Steve Jobs mouth was
the explosions yeah and a lot of it was
like really inside baseball you know
like a lot of things that only people
who really followed Steve Jobs wouldn't
know about you know like his boss firing
him and stuff like that
so um I did love it I did really liked
it a lot my wife except for the woman
kicking my chair behind me the whole way
nervous it reminded me why I don't like
to see movies and movie theaters nervous
need that just like that who's kicking
me the whole time I tell I turn around
and say can you stop can you stop in
your leg I did twice and I was just like
okay I guess you're just gonna keep
kicking my chair well I was like we're
just gonna keep kicking my chair you
know this but you know other than that
it was great I thought it was really
good
I enjoyed it a lot my wife cried to my
wife what does she cry which part you
know when he gives the attend the end
part yeah like the the fight though
right when they have the fight yeah
front of all the people yeah that would
never happen I don't think that really
happens I think he was even came out and
said himself that it didn't say that was
all fiction and yeah you get all the
people too awkward like yeah everyone so
anyways that's our review Beechum gives
it three-and-a-half stars I bet I'm
apples I think that beats you would have
might have given it four
apples if the lady wasn't kicking your
chair the whole time yes yes and I
definitely give it a solid three I liked
it I liked it okay enough about the
Steve Jobs movie the show is about you
guys as well you guys and gals so let's
take some calls we're gonna hear what
you guys have seen we're gonna talk
about it hey guys it's Jordan British
from Adelaide Australia I love your show
I'm not sure if I left a voicemail or
not you did I'd know but just wondering
do you think Apple ever do a universal
operating system like what um Microsoft
has done like with the new surface
especially with the iPad pro and the
keyboard it reminds me a lot of the
surface of everything Apple will ever do
a universal OS across all their devices
all right thanks but thanks Jordan
regular caller a longtime listener
everybody if you're feeding us good
things to think about and talk about
we're gonna keep on showing you love and
putting it right back right off the top
right now the answer is no and I'll tell
you why Apple still is very stubborn
about how they feel they've continued to
kind of position this as the iPad pro is
its own device its own experience they
refuse to acknowledge the fact that the
surface pro basically exists they also
refuse to acknowledge that the iPad pro
is a result of the surface pro success
and what they did and I think once you
start seeing people actually threaten
Apple's market share meaning you start
seeing people going towards the surface
Pro because it really is the only tablet
right now that can truly serve as a
desktop laptop type hybrid then once
Apple feels threatened a little bit I
think you'll see them although they're
working on it in the background I think
you'll see them make a real push and try
and satisfy that audience look at them
historically Samsung had the big screen
phone Apple refused the big screen phone
for probably two and a half years took
them a long time and guess what they
have now a big screen phone Apple knows
that they have the marketing muscle to
do whatever they want they see what
trends are happening and then when they
feel the squeeze a little bit or they
see their percentages of market share
dropping
they do what those other companies do
and they bring him right back and that's
exactly what we saw at the iPhone 6 and
the success yeah well I mean when
Windows 8 came out it was very tailored
towards the surface tablets and everyone
freaked out it was a Windows user yes
like I can't use my computer like this
like I can't turn off an app without
having to swipe and do all this crazy
stuff then they quickly did the 8.1
update to fix that right and now Windows
10 is like the perfect it's like a
hybrid Yaniv it's really good honestly
it's really really really cool really
good I like the fact that you have a
quick swipe tap to basically change it
from desktop mode to more of a tablet
mode yes really smart the own the thing
though then if you want to talk about
you know I'm raving about the service
Pro I think the drawback of the surface
pro though is as a touch device although
cool it's not nearly as extensive as
Apple because of the app ecosystem right
so you can go into touch mode it has
those great big metro tiles yeah but I
don't really like yeah but what the
content on there other than your basic
general services all these apps all
these other games all these other
creative apps and things of that nature
they're on the iPad pro yeah so the iPad
pro still succeeds as a touch device the
Microsoft Surface pro doesn't fail but
it just doesn't have the support there
and it really shines as a true laptop
e-type hybrid that has some touch
functionality yeah I mean I love I love
my my Windows 10 machine now that it you
know it's all I could touch things and
just you know it just just looks
prettier now so it's it's it's much more
easier to use so there you go I don't
think we'll see it until they actually
feel real threatened they will be they
are working on something but they are so
stubborn right now just wait until they
change their tune which is what
typically happens all right number two
how you doing first of all I just want
to say I'm a huge fan of your show and I
love everything you're doing my name is
George Haynes from Houston Texas and my
question I want to know what if Apple
have to do with the iPad pro in the
future to be able to replace the current
laptops and desktops thank you
George Haines I got nothing but love for
you accept the fact that
you're in the same city where the
Rockettes are and I'm in the city where
the Warriors are I'm just playing George
this kind of this question kind of
dovetails to what we're talking about
what does Apple need to do I if they
want me to use the iPad pro as a laptop
they're gonna have to come up with
something better than what they have
right now I'll uh something that
Microsoft Surface is doing now what else
they need to do with the iPad pro that
people aren't talking about as much I've
used the pencil for a few yeah several
days now the thing that sticks out about
the iPad pro to me the most is that we
have these drawing apps that currently
existed they're adapted a little bit mad
or better to the iPad pro but if you
want to treat this like a pro device you
have to have Pro apps like true pro apps
and I don't know if developers are gonna
really jump on board and make a
dedicated Pro app yeah just for the iPad
pro yeah you know that takes a lot of
investment in resources they already
have an iPad version of the app but to
make it a truly pro like would we ever
see true photoshop on this stylus based
I don't I don't it's gonna start to get
messy right now so adobe has to invest
in it they have to do it they have to
direct all the resources in it they have
base more basic stripped-down versions
and a nice sketchy nap but not true
Photoshop so I think that's the biggest
thing that will we see in six months to
a year I talked about the potential of
it will we see actual dedicated Pro apps
some of the apps that are super popular
that exist on the desktop adapted to an
iPad pro I don't know I just I don't
know yet cuz you know Microsoft Adobe
pledged their support but their apps are
still pretty much working exactly the
same as they were before the iPad pro
came out mhm
so we'll see cool
thanks Ari and I was born I was born in
Houston George so word up you were born
in Houston oh yeah Houston born raised
are you staring at me like that it was
like he's like dude h-town you're
calling out the Rockets I'm not calling
out I'm not calling out h-town I'm
calling out the Rockets
I've spent extensive time in each town
they have some great places to go at
night yeah that was a good
that was a good the playoffs when they
were played that Warriors in the
playoffs good that's a good series
because we won I'm not gonna be that I'm
not gonna be that guy
all right next call all right hi my name
is Geo I'm from Michigan I was wondering
what you think apples gonna do with its
other iPad know that I pros out Apple
didn't really upgrade iPad Mini by much
and it didn't really occur at iPad air
at all so how do you think Apple will
create their iPads going forward do you
think they'll treat it like that iPod
Touch or like the iPhone or what do you
think thank you and I love the show hi
thanks for calling my man I do think
that the they're not gonna treat like
the iPod Touch we're just exist and
never really gets updated but I think
the update cycle which has already been
proven is going to be less the iPad air
never got a three version so we'll see
that Apple's getting thin from a
manpower standpoint and you can see this
reason being they put all these
resources in the Apple watch they put
all these resources in the app Apple
iPad pro something had to suffer and it
was the iPad air 3 right I think that
you'll still see an upgrade this coming
year for the iPad air 3 it'll be an
incremental upgrade tablets the market
is still slow it's not like we're seeing
everyone run out and get a tablet just
cuz the iPad pro came out it's gonna
help bump them up a little bit but I
think when they look at the market
they're not gonna be doing an upgrade
every year it might be more like a year
and a half a year and three quarters for
iPad upgrades that's how I feel based on
what they've also shown us from this
past year and when I look at the iPad
pro there's a lot of power on here
that's untapped there's no reason for
them to all of a sudden do an upgrade in
the year when they still need real apps
that work for it and developers to work
off of a baseline that they can get used
to familiar with so plus their key notes
are just be like five days long be like
okay coming out the iPad for me and you
know just forever just will take too
long we'll be here all day
we love we love it when their keynotes
last over two hours here it's awesome so
yeah that that's that's that's where I'm
sticking with that I mean
you like you said Beach you've still had
your at what you had third generation
and I'm actually like was thinking the
other day maybe I should buy a second
third generation for my other son so
they have matching iPads I don't know
why but my other ones getting older now
so he's like you know they're fighting
they're fighting over the iPad you don't
even have an iPad it's their iPad no
it's not my iPad at all it is theirs
alright everybody um we are just gonna
wrap up I think is that oh did we fall
within like the 30-minute time frame
think so yeah I think we're pretty good
