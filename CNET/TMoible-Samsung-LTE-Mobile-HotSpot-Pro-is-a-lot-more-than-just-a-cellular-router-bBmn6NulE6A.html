demos here and this is the all new
Samsung LTE mobile hotspot pro from
t-mobile now pay attention because this
thing here is my favorite let's find out
why shall we now first of all is very
fast offering the average of 20 megabit
per second for downloading and some 10
milliseconds for uploading in the
statistical Bay Area of course by far
the fastest I have the scene let's find
out how fast we actually here in a
building a dungeon really and take a
look it is still offering quite good
numbers the second thing I buy this one
is a design is black on top and black on
bottom with the red strip running around
here and they come with these adapter
and USB cable right here for to charge
it when you are out and about but if you
forget this well don't worry because the
rest trip here hi something really cool
take a look there you go you can pull it
out and voila is another USB cable now
you can use this one right here to
charge it using any standard USB adapter
or with a computer just like that if you
like me who never forget anything but
this cable here will not become
redundant that's because it can pull out
this side right here and now you can
actually charge another mobile device
really cool in it and now with all the
charging going on if I unplug the router
from the power guess what
it still chart the mobile device that's
right the samsung here is the very first
mobile router I've seen that also can
work as a juice pack so basically it
gives you two most important thing you
want on the go fast internet and extra
battery life so forget about food and
water this is what you want to pack now
in my testing the samsung here with a
full charge can bring an iPhone 5 from
empty to full and stay have some juice
left very impressive now what is not so
impressive by this one is the screen on
top here look at this it's actually LCD
screen that show the status of the
device but it's complete statics it
means you cannot
any setting at all for example here I
can see I have a one tick message but
there's no way to read it now to do that
or to change the setting of the router
you have to use the web interface that's
quite inconvenient but honestly you do
not need to use that very often because
at the box it comes pre-configured with
a Wi-Fi network and a password and with
that you can actually connect up to 10
devices to it and use the Internet in
fact I do not mind the lack of a
touchscreen at all because the surface
and the bottom of the device here are
actually fingering magnets they attract
and retain your fingerprint even before
you touch it now underneath the battery
here there's a micro SIM slot the device
is locked to t-mobile though but it can
possibly be unlocked to work with other
carriers so what's the price of this
router well you can play hard $7 for it
or pay $50 now and $5 per month for 24
months like a payment plan but that's no
interest now for data you can choose to
pay 20 or 30 or 40 50 or 60 or $70 per
month four point five two point five
four point five six point five eight
point five or ten point five gig updated
cap respectively I'm not sure what's up
with the 0.5 I'm sure is better than
point four point three or no point at
all now for more on this router check
out my full review com if you're
wondering if I need this when I'm out
and about the answer is no but I might
want it actually I don't want it I only
one luck so I have everything else
that's only because I don't know and
this has been the first look at the
samsung LTE hotspot pro from t-mobile
