how to contributor and today we're going
to take a look at how to set up and use
the new queen feature in iphone for iOS
I thought it was just announced
yesterday in the Apple Keynote revealing
the new iPad as well as the new app of
TV and this beam feature is pretty neat
so what we're going to do is when you
first install and launch ipho you'll
notice that wireless beaming is
automatically turned on if for some
reason it's not we've gone in and turned
it off make sure you tap on the gear and
turn on wireless beaming also we'll need
to make sure that all the iOS devices
you're going to be sharing photos
between are located or connected to the
same wireless network so once we have
all that set up what you'll do is go in
and view any album so here we have
photostream and let's pull up just a
random photo here and what I can do here
to beam it over to the iphone which i
have iphoto running on already is tap on
the share key then being the notice it
says selected or all in all is actually
great out so I wouldn't be able to soon
all 263 photos but i can send the one
selected it found my device right away
and again that's because I I have iphoto
already running on the iphone we'll go
ahead and select it that that's the
device i want to send it to and then be
in photos now you'll see i have a
dialogue over your TV or accept or
reject the transfer request I go I trust
the ipad so i'm going to go ahead and
hit yes and in a matter of a couple
seconds you'll see that the photo has
been beamed from the ipad to my iphone
and to verify that there's a new beamed
album here in the I photo albums list
that I could tap on and give you the
thumbnails and scroll over and there's
the photo I just beamed in from my ipad
to my phone once again that's how to
setup and use beam in iPhoto for iOS
