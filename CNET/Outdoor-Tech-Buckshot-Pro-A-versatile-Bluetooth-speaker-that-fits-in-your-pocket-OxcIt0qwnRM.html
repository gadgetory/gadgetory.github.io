outdoor Tex rugged water-resistant
Bluetooth speaker the Buckshot pro which
retails for $80 and comes in multiple
color options in the past few months
we've reviewed several of these tiny
Bluetooth speakers and what's
interesting about this one is that not
only is it a portable wireless speaker
but it can also be used as a USB charger
for your phone and comes equipped with a
detachable LED light you can use that
light as a flashlight or strap it onto
your bikes handlebars and use it as a
bike light I wouldn't say the light is
all that strong so don't expect it to
totally light up the road in front of
you but there is a strobe mode that at
least allows this to work is a safety
light while riding previously outdoor
tech made a smaller version of the
speaker the Buckshot the base on that
model was rather thin and while this
doesn't exactly pack a lot of low-end
the base has been augmented a bit and
the speaker sounds better overall and
plays louder also battery life has
improved to 10 hours which is good when
you consider a lot of these micro
speakers deliver 5 to 7 hours of battery
life from a sound standpoint even with
the additional bass this speaker doesn't
measure up to such competitors as the
JBL clip plus so republic Punk or the
sony srs x11 but it is more versatile
and it is definitely travel friendly and
well suited for hiking or camping and
david car noise and that's the Outdoor
tech Buckshot pro thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
