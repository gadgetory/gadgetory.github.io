could play catch with this is the Omni
GoPros red built to tackle a 360 VR
head-on now even though you probably
wouldn't throw around a camera like this
the Omni is modular and designed for
rough treatment in theory if a piece
breaks you can just swap it out but
before we get into the specs let's take
a look and see what the complete five
thousand dollar out-of-the-box solution
gets you the Omni houses six hero4 black
cameras which means six separate microSD
cards and batteries unfortunately the
Omni isn't compatible with in newer hero
5 if five thousand US dollars is a
little bit too much cash the rig sells
for fifteen hundred dollars on its own
if you bring your own cameras unlike the
earlier freedom 360 mount where you have
to start and stop recording on all six
cameras individually the Omni has one
central camera you start and stop
recording from it plus it automatically
sends the settings you have on the
primary camera to all of the others in
the rig if you run the Omni on it's in
camera batteries you get about 45
minutes of runtime so for intensive
shoots you're going to need to use these
external battery packs you'll get around
three hours if you're using lower
resolution settings so that's the spec
sheet what does it actually like to
shoot with the one-button operation of
the Omni is incredibly easy there's no
sink lap you need to worry about and it
feels just like you're filming with a
single GoPro except it just happens to
be in a 360 array editing is usually the
tedious part of making 360 but the only
makes it easy with one click the
imported software finds your footage on
the micro SD cards or on your computer
from here you can see a low resolution
through you stitch color correction and
stabilization options press Start and
the crunching begins and it's quick a
two minute for cam clip or around four
gigabytes of footage takes 15 minutes or
so to import stitch and Hum correct it
is likely that you'll still need to make
tweaks in something like colors order
patter video
especially if you come across ghosting
issues which we do but the only does
cope well in low light and with motion
shots
although parallax can still be an issue
overall though the Omni is really well
thought out it's not waterproof so
thrill-seekers will have to wait and see
if GoPro releases f05 version for now as
an inexpensive entry point into
professional 360 VR it ticks plenty of
boxes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
