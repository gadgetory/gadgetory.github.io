kind of surprising went by very quickly
but really tried to clear my head and
figure out what I want to do next I I
realized I don't think I'm completely
ready to go and play golf full time but
I haven't really found something that I
can completely sink my teeth into
something that I'm completely passionate
about her so one of the biggest craze is
going through right now is VR right so
where do you think it's headed but I
still think it has a little bit of a way
to go I do think it's going to be
evolutionary for gaming I don't know if
it's going to completely change the way
people play games but i do think we'll
add to that immersive nature and will
have a major impact on gaming the toys
to life thing is becoming huge is it a
flash in the pan it's something that's
always been appealing to me one of the
companies i had the opportunity to meet
with recently was anki drive the cool
thing about anki drive is you're still
using you know your Android or your
smartphone or your tablet but then
you're physically looking at cars racing
around the track what's the best game
you ever played I used to love a game
called choplifter on the game boy and I
played the heck out of that and I tended
to travel all the time and I still do so
i'm not really a living room type gamer
I'm kind of an on-the-fly gamer and I'd
be lying to say I'm not addicted to to
super cell right now with clash of clans
and you know when my shield is up and
it's not a good time to go into battle I
go over to heyday and I work on my crops
over there and then maybe I'll play a
couple of levels of candy crush and I
never thought I'd be saying that even a
year ago what do you think of how
Microsoft's doing right now I think
they've got a little bit of identity
crisis going on right now although I
think they've kind of come out of it but
I don't know that the average gamer is
fully aware that you still hear a lot of
people talking about their initial
presentation for the xbox one a lot of
the confusion over digital rights
management and ability to use used games
and have it on and of course they made
ultimately i think the right decision in
all those areas but because it was a
departure from what they initially said
that that baggage tends to stick with
you what about sony how do you feel
about how they're doing well i mean i
think the playstation 4 is a runaway
success and i'm very proud of what we
were able to accomplish there that was
in
amazing thing I think one of the big
challenges for Sony and for the
PlayStation 4 is that it's a very
expensive industry you've got some real
fierce competition so I think keeping
their eye on the prize and being focused
on the crown jewel is going to be the
the smartest move for them and I think
anything that takes their focus off of
that could ultimately leave the door
open for competition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
