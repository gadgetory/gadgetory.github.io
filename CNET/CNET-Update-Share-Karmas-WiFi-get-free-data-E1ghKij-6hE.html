Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update it's the last updates show of the
year so let's jump in with a new device
that could change the way you pay for
internet access karma is a 4g mobile
hotspot that uses the clearwire wimax
network anyone who buys this $80 hotspot
can get free data for every person that
hops on and uses it that's why they call
it karma if you let someone connect to
your hotspot the network gives both of
you 100 megabytes of data if you want to
save money that means you need more
people to connect to your network but of
course we've all been taught to not
trust range Wi-Fi hotspots so if you
just go to a coffee shop or an airport
what people even want to connect to your
karma connecting to the hot spot
requires signing in with a Facebook
account so maybe that will discourage
people from connecting but there are
some good points there's no contract and
the data you accumulate never expires if
you don't have people to connect with
you'll have to pay $14 for 1 Giga data
which is still quite cheap if you travel
often this is an easy device to take
around and just load up data when you
need it it isn't practical though if
you're always streaming movies and using
things like Netflix or online gaming at
home in a previous show I discussed a
similar product from freedompop buying
the home router will get you one
gigabyte of data for free every month
but users can also earn more data for
free by referring friends the network
for both of these services is clearwire
and it's in about 80 metro cities I've
used the network's hotspot in New York
and found it to be reliable and a good
speed for everyday web browsing there's
also been an interesting development in
the traditional television space the
company Aereo lets users watch live
broadcast TV on the internet for small
fee network operators have sued area
because it doesn't pay for stations that
are broadcast free over the air waves
and those lawsuits are still ongoing but
now the company has its first cable TV
station partner Bloomberg TV for eight
dollars a month users can even record
live TV to watch shows later like a DVR
right now only New Yorkers can access
area but the service plans to expand to
15 others
early next year and if you're in need of
a gift idea or need to give something at
the last minute you can pull out your
iPhone and quickly send someone an app
iOS 6 users now can gift an app to
someone right from the app store you
can't give an Android app as a gift but
there's always gift cards to the Google
Play Store and if you know someone with
an e-reader or a tablet you can gift an
e-book for the kindle and nook that's
your tech news update you can get links
to all of the stories I mentioned on our
blog sina com / update the show returns
the first week of January as we gear up
for the biggest tech conference the
Consumer Electronics Show thanks for
watching and happy holidays from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey
see you in 2013</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
