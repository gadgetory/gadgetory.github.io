product lineup every one of our products
has an either new software all new
hardware and software so the Nest
Learning Thermostat is a software
upgrade if your temperature is too hot
or too cold in your house we'll send you
a message to your phone
we also are updating the software so
that it works with nest Protect's so if
there's a fire in your home we don't
blow smoke or extra oxygen inside the
home and it shuts down the Nest Learning
Thermostat immediately and send you a
notice that that's happening on the nest
protect all new hardware we've designed
it from the ground up to have a split
spectrum sensor Dropcam today has now
been sunsetted and is now called nest
cam all of our Dropcam customers will be
fully supported by nest and the nest cam
all new hardware 1080p great video
quality and a versatile stand and
service to allow you to put your nest
cam anywhere and enjoy high quality
video one thing we were asked was safety
temperature alerts so on Nest Learning
Thermostat they want to know when their
home was getting too hot or too cold and
they want to make sure their pipes
weren't freezing or maybe something in
their house their plants were dying
because it was too hot so we put that
feature in specifically because the
customers requested it and we've been
doing feature upgrades for all
generations of Nest Learning Thermostat
as well as nest protect continually to
deliver on the promise of software
updates to your hardware so you don't
have to put new hardware in your home
every 18 or 24 months like you do a
smart phone we wanted to make software
the enabler not always the hardware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
