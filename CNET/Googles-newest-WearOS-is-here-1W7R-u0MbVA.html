SmartWatch instead there are a lot of
Google where OS watches and a lot more
coming this fall with updated features
like NFC payments and heartrate google
also has a whole new version of where OS
that's available to download and if you
have a wear OS watch or Android wear
watch you should definitely check it out
I downloaded it on a fossil cue
explorers HR and this is what it does
it's basically a bunch of easy to swipe
gestures that really help you access a
lot of key features on the watch a lot
faster and it feels a lot easier to use
than it did before everything new and
where OS is all about gestures and
they're all off the main watch face so
if you swipe down now instead of getting
settings you actually get a number of
little widgets and controls which is a
lot like Apple watch allows you get to
things like google pay and other
features faster and even play music from
here which is great if you swipe up you
get your notifications and now they're
all compressed they're not nested like
Apple watch OS 5 but still there are a
lot more compressed than they were
before and they're a lot easier to swipe
and scan and you can use a digital crown
if your watch has that then if you swipe
over here down to the left you get
google fit Google fits been redesigned
it now has activity rings based on move
and heart points which look for more
active activity and everyday activity
all this is a lot more like a regular
fitness tracker it's a lot easier to
scan not only is the Fitness better but
it's easier to access and then if you
swipe to the right you get Google
Assistant this gives you basic little
things you could search google assistant
with it it has a lot of recommended
shortcuts that are pretty random like
interesting fact or recite a limerick
what is the interesting fact Google
as of 2017 Hong Kong has the most
skyscrapers in the world so with all
those basic swipe gestures and if you
want to access watch faces now you press
and hold to get to them it basically
allows you to do a lot of quick swipe
interactions on the watch which save a
lot of time and on this watch actually
they feel pretty fluid where our West
watch faces can be always on like you
see here in a dimmer mode and then they
activate when you touch them and watch
faces can be changed by tapping and
holding and selecting different ones
some of them with complications which
add information some of just which have
interesting funky designs each watch and
wear OS has its own selection of watch
faces you can also download others
to get to all of your apps in where OS
nothing's changed you still click on the
side button and bring up your list of
apps to scroll through
if you're looking to buy a Google watch
and you have an Android phone there are
a lot of choices out there including
Samsung Galaxy watch which runs a
totally different set of software and
has different Fitness features but if
you already have a Google wear OS or
Android wear watch download this update
I think it's gotten a lot better and I
think the improvements are really
noticeable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
