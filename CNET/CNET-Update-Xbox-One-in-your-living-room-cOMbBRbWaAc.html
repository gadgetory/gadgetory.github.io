room of the future I'm Jeff Bakalar
filling in for Bridget Carey this is
your cnet update earlier this week
Microsoft invited myself along with
other cnet editors to get a look at what
kind of media capabilities Xbox one is
going to deliver in his summary cnet
editor matthew miskovic outlined live TV
integration the one guide overlay
built-in voice and motion control and
other features the big highlights from
the piece explain that DVR compatibility
will probably be the biggest issue out
of the box so instead of using your
voice you're likely going to have to
grab your cable boxes remote to
scheduled recordings now the one guide
which acts as sort of a channel guide
for your TV will also feature something
called app channels which any app can
program into the interface it's
basically like a shortcut for services
like Hulu straight to your channel guide
now we were also let down by the news of
DLNA support its built-in but it seems
that Xbox one is only going to work with
Microsoft's proprietary play two system
keep it here at cnet for my full review
of Xbox one in the coming weeks and of
course Xbox one hit stores on Friday
November 22nd we finally have some more
info on the mysterious Google barge
situation cnet first broke the story
about a shady barge hiding out in San
Francisco and only until now has google
come out and admitted that they are in
fact behind the floating structure cnet
reporter daniel Terdiman says that when
completed the barge will be covered in
sales and act as a temporary technology
exhibit space have you ever used Wi-Fi
on a plane odds are you've heard of
go-go the service that connects you to
air-to-ground internet from 35,000 feet
up starting soon goggle will roll out a
new service which will use internet
connectivity for making calls and
sending texts users will be able to
download a companion app that will force
their phone into roaming mode which will
allow you to use text and talk
functionality air travelers won't need
to wait long to use the new tech it's on
schedule to be implemented in the first
quarter of 2014
finally after an impressive IPO launch
Twitter still recognizes that the
service needs to attract new users
Twitter CEO said earlier this week that
while the 140 character language of
Twitter is rapidly evolving it's
simultaneously alienating newcomers to
the service which creates an
intimidating platform then not just
anyone can dive right into @ sign
hashtag RT that's your tech news update
you can find more details on our show
blog that's cnet com / update make sure
you follow me on Twitter from our
Studios here in New York I'm Jeff
