extreme pro solid-state drive from
SanDisk basically is a standard into the
drive that replaced regular hard drive
like this one or this one right here and
offer must must faster performance if
you're wondering why this buggy is so
huge that's because of me I have a huge
amount of mojo which explain why all of
you can only buy this right here in this
standard packaging much smaller that is
but no worries it be happy anyway
because this is a great drive in my
testing it register the real-world copy
speed of some 500 megabyte per second
almost double that of many competing
drives basically what you're looking at
right here is the fastest SSD on the
market and if that is not enticing
enough this also come with something
that no other SSD has the warranty sand
is so sure about the extreme Pro here
and backed it up with a 10 year warranty
prior to this a 5 year warranty is
enough to make us happy now we can
double that happiness on top of that the
driver also supposed to give you very
consistent performance even after you
haven't used it for a long time and also
very high endurance rating of 80
terabyte which is the amount of data you
can write on it before it becomes
unreliable now 80 terabyte is about
82,000 gigabyte and that means if you
write on the drive here 20 gigabyte per
day every day they would take some 11
years before the drives become
unreliable other than that the driver is
very similar to other SSD on the market
it come in a seven millimeter thick
design but does have this spacer piece
right here to add some more thickness to
it in case you want to use it in a drive
by desire for standard laptop hard drive
now over here is a standard SATA
connector the drive works with OS 8 a
standard but it support the SATA 3
sickly bit per second which you should
use it with to get the best performance
out of it now the noose and extreme pro
here is available in three capacity of
240 gigabyte for an 80 gigabyte and 960
gig goodbye
that has the suggested price of 180
dollars three hundred $69 and 599
dollars in the US and for more the
driver check out my full review at
cnn.com by the way I have all three
capacity here who's not very surprising
considering again the size of the box
now while surprising though is on the
inside ladies Sanders also includes some
very very sweet sweet things of me right
here
it's very soon indeed and that's because
I'm dumb no and this has been the first
look at the SanDisk Extreme Pro so state
dry everybody would have tasted</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
