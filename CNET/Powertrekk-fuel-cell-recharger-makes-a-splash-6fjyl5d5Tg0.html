chemistry and he's going to show me how
to charge up their fuel cell mobile
device recharger and here here it is by
the way in pieces that's the cartridge
that's the base that's the top and
that's the water all right what do you
do so this is the power truck fuel cell
systems if you want power out for
multiple days basically this is a
hydrogen fuel cell the oxygen comes in
through the air from the top hydrogen
comes in through the base in here this
is your hydrogen generation component so
this is the water tray so it's designed
to really kind of scoop up water from a
lake or river wherever you're out
backpacking so but right now I'm just
going to fill it up doesn't matter if
you know you don't want sediment in the
water but it doesn't matter if there's
that was a bad okay hang on a second
hanger and this by the way is your
reporter with fuel cell of water on his
hair this by the way I have to say this
is what happened in the first demo and I
was told us would never happen again
it's a wrong angle out on it on the
table hang on a second while I towel off
here excuse me are we early it's outdoor
power equipment okay I'm told you can
fuel this with it almost any form of
liquid including some unmentionable once
and I'm glad you used water can I just
say that we have them studies with
synthetic urine only
yes what you couldn't get anybody to do
the real test yet all right i'm mostly
dry now so now we've got water in there
so and what was hate me is there's a
spring yeah and that that pressurizes
the water to put it into this cartridge
I'll say okay all right so that curtner
hold on that cartridge is what so this
cartridge is a sodium silicide cartridge
okay it's designed it's certified to
take on board a passenger aircraft you
can take three of them on board it's you
can do 100 kilograms of crush and all
directions without any deformation to
can you can drop it thermal cycling
we've gone through pages of testing on
it now so Liam silicide which you make
that's what your company does your a
chemical company that's when you combine
it with water you get the hydrogen hence
your fuel cell system alright so keep
going here okay so sodium suicide it's
really made of just sodium and silicon
sodium comes all basically from Niagara
Falls energy in the US with massive
producer of sodium okay put in there yet
so so now as soon as i connect these two
then waters from the pressurized water
will start not going into the cartridge
I know we're going to give you a phone
this is my and actually saw the green
light turn on yeah that's because
hydrogen is now being generated so the
fuel cell is running at this point this
is my other phone it's an android phone
I gotta get some water off the peg at
second alright it's dry now and we're
going to plug it in and see if it starts
charging so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
