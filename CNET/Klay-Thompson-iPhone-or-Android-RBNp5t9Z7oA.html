up yourself and tech outside a
basketball off the top your phone are
you an iPhone guy or an Android phone
guy I'm an iPhone and I don't think it's
a really by choice thing it's just I
grew up using you know iPads - not iPads
iPods now they're an iPhone they got
your iPod in your iPhone so it's just so
user-friendly I mean be hard for me to
change now so you would not be switching
anytime soon right I don't think so uh
you know I even have MacBook - that's a
you know I used to be PC used to be just
a little flip phone but now I just Apple
gotta give them credit they do a good
job with just user accessibility yep um
what about a lot of us use apps everyday
is there kind of an app that you are
using the most right now or one that
you've always loved I don't know if it's
really beneficial in my life but I love
pineapple pokers just cuz I love playing
cards that's my app I probably use the
most that post mates really good I think
that's a great idea you know it uh you
know they're like a middleman you know
but they go and deliver you if they get
whatever food you need I think that's a
great app as well and just general apps
like Yelp use Yelp what I want to go you
know find a good place to eat travel
with so many different cities a lot of
us also do like group messaging I heard
you like to run the Warriors like the
teammates kind of have a group chat you
gotta get on that or you're on my
website actually because got family the
Bahamas and whatsapp is a great way to
connect with people overseas um
obviously a shot tracker obviously app I
use the most for my work and for my work
life you know it's all II that that's
really beneficial when you're playing
basketball every other apps kind of a
distraction we see you're posting on IG
okay right okay really but uh you guys a
good way to connect with the fans okay
this is not my own personal question but
some of my lady friends want to know is
there a dating app of choice that you
know Wow no not no dating apps I've
heard of you know no no dating apps for
me no tinder or I don't even know the
other ones I know there's me Bob or
booboo yeah my friends are on that but
uh no dating asked for me over here I
don't think I don't think I need
anything I don't think I'll be very low
profile in there cuz that's alright and
then the last question is this might
take a second to think about you know if
your phone could do one thing for you
that it doesn't do right now like
anything whether it's for like you or
for Rocco or something like if you could
just say I want my phone to do this mmm
what what might that be to make your
life a little easier it's a good
question we think what could it do
try wish my phone could take out the
trash for me cuz trash day always slips
my mind sucks because we always build up
the trash then we got a mark we got a
what's the ration or her trash and I
wish that my phone could physically take
my trash from a garage to curbside for
the garbage pickup and that's a legit
answer there right on okay thanks a lot
I appreciate it well thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
