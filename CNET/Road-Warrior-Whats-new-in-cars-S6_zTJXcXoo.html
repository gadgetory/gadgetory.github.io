cnet.com and welcome to Road Warrior
where we take a look at the hottest
gadgets for life on the go coming up
with all the hoopla around CES it's easy
to forget about the Detroit Auto Show
but that also happened and this episode
is all about cars and the stuff that
goes in them let's start with something
you can use in or out of the car the XM
sky Phi 3 radio rich demuro shows it off
there's a few ways you can get your XM
programming on this you can have this
mounted in your car so you can get it in
your car do the whole setup where you
have an antenna you can also get it at
home using a dock like this one so you
can actually pop it in your dock and
listen at home with the antenna and the
power cord then you could pop it out of
the dock like I have it and listen on
the go it also stores 10 hours of XM
programming and I help you through the
areas with no reception next up the
pioneer avic z2 Kevin Massey explains
the new easier to follow map screen one
of the major upgrades for the avic z2 is
that the folks at pioneer have combined
forces with tele atlas which is a
mapping database company Sally atlas has
is using a system called point address
which is an extensive database of 45
million individual addresses located by
GPS coordinates oh I also noticed on the
maps there's little icons of like I see
McDonald's icon they have like chili so
when you're driving you can see all
those places that's right and one of the
one of the best things about this is
that this split screen map view you've
got the over overhead birds eye view
here but you also have this 3d
impression of literally driving down the
street and you can see the points of
interest flowing by on either side of
the road here the avic g2 also plays
music and video as well and the nav
system is hard drive based not DVD now
let's get to some cars the smart fortwo
is finally coming to the US but is this
miniscule $15,000 car really safe little
tiny cars have often had that stigma
attached to them in the US market when
you're driving around amongst Tahoes and
expeditions you can see why so they're
going to message something called the
treaty on safety cell which is the
framework inside the car they'll portray
this thing as a little vault on wheels
and it's loaded with airbag so that is
standard in that low price deliveries on
the smart fortwo are expected in early
two thousand eight small not your thing
no worries let's try the big old Ford
interceptor concept car then big some
might even call it chunky under the hood
you'll find something very chunky a
400-horsepower 5-liter v8 hooked up to a
6-speed manual I love the idea of a
six-speed gearbox manually shifted in a
big four door that did you hear the
rumors a while back about a Mustang
sedam this is it obviously it's not a
Mustang by any look but it is loosely
based on Mustang mechanicals Brian ads
there's no truth to the rumor of a
Mustang station wagon or SUV or flying
Mustang it's just not true that's it for
this edition of road warrior I'm Tom
Merritt check back next time for more
gadgets that keep you armed and
dangerously productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
