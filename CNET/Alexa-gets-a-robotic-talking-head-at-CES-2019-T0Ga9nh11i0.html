Eureka Park at Tech West this place is a
bit of a maze but I've managed to find
something incredibly cool it's from an
Oregon startup called rogue harmonics
they're two people and they have two
really incredible robots now if you're
kind of sick of speaking to your smart
speaker in the corner cause it's just a
white or black box it doesn't really
offer you much maybe this one's for you
this is Elena and she's designed
designed to be an interface for you to
speak to your smart speaker so you feel
like you're speaking to a human with
real feelings kind of she's hooked up to
the Alexis speaker here she's got six
digital motors inside her face that help
her mouth move and her eyes and
generally make her feel just a little
bit creepy I'm having a bit of an
uncanny valley moment right here these
guys have worked on two robots so this
one here is more of a consumer model and
it's designed to sort of help people who
may need language development skills
people who are living with autism
spectrum disorder may be elderly people
who need to communicate regularly and
feel like they have companionship it's
also designed to help us as people get
used to the idea of robots being
invisible so imagine you're jumping into
an autonomous car you're going to feel a
little bit weird getting into the
backseat when there's no driver this
could be your driver to get you used to
the idea of that autonomy me a kind of
stepping stone before you get to the
real thing so I'm gonna ask it a
question
Alexa what should I do in Las Vegas
Old Las Vegas Mormons Dave Historic Park
and tule springs Alexa what's the
weather like today right now in
Wilsonville it's 54 degrees Fahrenheit
with cloudy skies today's forecast has
lots of clouds with a high of 56 degrees
and a low of 42 degrees this one's my
favorite Alexa why don't you have arms
sorry I'm not sure no one's really sure
here either it's a cool idea and the one
behind me is Alan the robot now this is
a sign kind of Morford developers maybe
businesses who are looking to interface
with their artificial intelligence so
instead of it instead of having to trawl
through lines of code or run through
huge amounts of data you might be
interacting with Alan to work out how
your artificial intelligence is
developing it's an interesting concept
and it's certainly showing how our
robotics has come because even though
we're really developing in a huge leaps
and bounds when it comes to artificial
intelligence we still kind of like
talking to a human face even if the
human face has purple eyes a white eye
robot kind of face and it's going to
haunt your dreams at night I'm quite
excited to be here I've seen a lot of
stuff like this it's been a jilted
conversation and I'm actually just
mostly pretty terrified being down here
but it's a cool concept and it's one of
the things on show here there's so many
strange bizarre wonderful things half of
it we may never see on market this kind
of thing I'd be kind of delighted to see
because quite frankly I'm sick of
speaking to my smart speaker at home and
just having a conversation with a box
I'd rather have a conversation with
Elena all right I'm going to hang out
maybe teach her a few language skills
but make sure you stay tuned to seen it
because at 1:00 p.m. we'll be back and
we will be
for the best of CES okay thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
