doing a great party trick at a bar you
want to see just how thin a laptop can
get everyone nods as you reveal the
eight point nine eight millimeter thick
swift seven because of these sizes you
really do have to split hairs and it
looks even more impressive because of
the big 14-inch screen that's great at
all but being the thinnest laptop in
town isn't enough to keep my interest
after that wow factor first impression
what's more impressive is that I
actually loved using the Swift seven as
my main laptop it manages to include a
bright 14 inch full HD display and one
that's also a touchscreen all in a
silent fanless body the keyboard is very
typable and there's a large touchpad
just beware that because this laptop is
so thin the touchpad is just that a pad
it doesn't click down so everything is
done through tapping of course I had to
compare it to other really thin laptops
like the MacBook Pro and the HP Spectre
the spectre is ten point four
millimeters thick and even though it's
only a hair over one millimetre
difference you can really tell when
stacking them up side by side but the
Swift has an older slower CPU still fine
for everyday use and a webcam that sits
below the screen which is never a
favorite yes these are forgivable but
less so at this very premium $16.99
price sure calling yourself the world's
thinnest laptop is a bit of a gimmick
but I have to admit I had fun using the
Swift 7 and never regretted throwing it
in my band for some on the go laptop it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
