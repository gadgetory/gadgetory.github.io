thoughtful design the sensible
implementation of its keyboard cover and
the innovations brought about by its
start interface unfortunately apps
support is dismal performance especially
on the Internet
can be slow at times and like the old
guy at the club still hanging around
after last call the traditional Windows
interface is still here wearing out is
welcome hi I'm Eric Franklin and today
I'll take a first look at Microsoft
Surface first let's talk about design
surface has a larger than usual ten
point six inch screen there's a built-in
kickstand on the back as well as micro
HDMI a full USB 2.0 port and hidden
under the kickstand a micro SD card slot
front and back cameras are 720p capable
there's also a headphone jack and a nice
clicky volume rocker and power /sleep
button the Windows Home touch sensor
will take you back to the start
interface if you're ever confused or
loss surface runs on Windows RT kind of
a light version of Windows 8 which
includes the Tao based start interface
if you're accustomed to other tablet
interfaces this one will take some
getting used to over the course of a
week I went from hating it to absolutely
loving it and then finally landing it
liking it with some reservations I won't
spend too much time here as this isn't a
Windows RT review but I will point out
my three favorite things first the
gestures swipe left to get the charms
menu swipe right for recent apps it's
white right then left for a list of
recent apps
swipe up or down for more options swipe
down across the screen to close an app
like I said there's definitely a lot to
learn here but it feels great once you
do then there's split screen Samsung
tried this earlier in the year with a
note 10.1 but here it's fully realized
it allows you to watch movies while you
work or read comics while you watch
movies or even watch TV shows while we
watch movies or play games or whatever I
really really dig this feature and
lastly search you can easily search the
entire
drive or just a particular app it's a
convenient and efficient solution the
problem here is that the interface is
still linked with the old Windows
desktop interface surface comes with
office 2013 preview and each of those
apps runs from the desktop you can't
install apps to this interface which
isn't touch optimized and has small
icons and links that are just
frustrating to use and some options like
programs and features serve no purpose
at all touch cover doesn't have
depressive Okies so it's gonna take some
getting used to but after a few days
thanks to the tablet's extra wide body
you may find is actually more
comfortable than any other tablet
keyboard accessory you've ever used type
cover which does have depressive Okies
is even better with a much shorter
learning curve so what's the bad well
apps actually they're not so much bad as
pretty non-existent if you're an app
theme you need not apply here also web
speeds and opening app speeds are
inconsistent and usually feel sluggish
games performance
I don't really know there aren't enough
quality games here to fairly judge again
more apps please movies on the Zune
Marketplace look crisp though surface
starts at 500 bucks for 32 gigabytes
that same configs available for $600
with a touch cover and $700 gets you the
64 gigabyte version with the touch
company that's not cheap and those
looking simply for its how it to watch
movies on they want to opt for cheaper
alternatives but thanks to its
comfortable
covered keyboard accessories and the
inclusion of office 2013 service is the
best productivity tablet yet it's a real
shame though that there aren't more apps
to choose from check out my full review
for more details once again this is Eric
Franklin and this has been a first look
at the Microsoft Surface
