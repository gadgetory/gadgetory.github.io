Gavin and these are our pics taken
straight from our site music download
com angie is out today so i figured it's
my chance to pick an electronica artist
so my pick this week is crystal castles
like groups like Hot Chip and justice
crystal castles fit into what i like to
call dance music for hipsters it's an
edgier style of electronica that's
influenced by punk indie rock sometimes
goth and even old school video game
music check out their song untrust us
which uses an eerie vocal sample from
the band death from above 1979
so you might find them closer to Moby at
the record store but backstage you're
more likely to see them hanging out with
bands like block party we have a few
tracks on our site so just search for
Crystal Castles hey this is Mike towel
my pick for this week is devin the dude
who's got a new album out smoke sessions
vol 1 on starz music sessions his first
album since leaving rap-a-lot records
which was his home for over 15 years but
don't expect to hear anything different
as the title of his album suggests
expect to hear more o's to a certain
herbal stimulant and women like the
downloadable track on our site making it
hard most sessions vol 1 is in stores
now and he's also touring in select
cities with his crew the coffee brothers
so look for him to be in the hood near
you soon hey this is Kurt and my pic
this week is the new album mark pick
roll called CODIS dreams Justin duties
marching to play drums with a Seattle
band the Screaming Trees but he's now
releasing records under his own name
they're dark murky and moody and the
style similar to that of nick cave lee
hazlewood ian more or even pick roles
old bandmate mark lanegan
Figueroa says the inspiration for Cody's
dream came during a road trip through
the south with no car stereo I have no
idea if that was by choice or not but it
doesn't matter because the result is
great it's a series of swampy southern
gothic songs about spooky small towns
and weird characters to drift in and out
let's right in the middle comes a cool
Dorjee cover of bob dylan's one more
copper car one month Cody's dream is out
now in bloodshot records and we have a
full album stream posted on download
music to find it just go to music
download calm and search on the name
mark pickerel that's p I cker TL</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
