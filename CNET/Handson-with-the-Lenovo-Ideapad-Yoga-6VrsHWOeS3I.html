I've got in my hands is the ideapad yoga
from Lenovo and you can see this looks
like a regular 13-inch laptop except you
take the the lid you flip it back around
itself and now it's kind of like a
tablet and I know you're saying we've
seen convertible tablets before those
have all had kind of a centre games that
swivels around and folds down that's
kind of a point of weakness year by
having the hinge on either side here
it's actually a lot sturdier and what
the yoga does is it deactivates the
keyboard so once it's folded over the
tablet form the keyboard is not going to
work you can just use the on-screen
keyboard and it deactivates the touchpad
and it's actually got a little bit of a
leather cover right here so you can put
it down on your desk it's not going to
damage it and it gives you from the
front something it looks like a tablet
and you can fold it in kind of a tent
mode if you like that or you can tilt it
up backwards like this or of course if
you're like me you can just use it as a
traditional laptop I think that helps
people sort of adapt to sort of a tablet
environment by saying it's a product you
could also just use like a regular
laptop you're going to see this later in
2012 I think hobby around 1399 for the
13 inch version hopefully with windows 8
and hopefully with the latest generation
of Intel processors at CES 2012 I'm Dan
Akron and that is the lenovo ideapad
yoga
