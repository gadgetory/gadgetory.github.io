is a review of the Cree br30 led now
br30 means bulging reflector and that
just means that the bulb bounces the
light out in one direction instead of
the on the directional light you might
get from a standard light bulb and this
one does a very good job in terms of
efficiency it uses 9.5 wats to put out a
total lumen output of 650 lumens that's
good for 68 lumens per watt very decent
for an LED floodlight and if you're
upgrading from an incandescent or
halogen like this one you're going to be
happy with the power savings like other
br30 LEDs the Cree light promises to
last for 25,000 hours or over 20 years
at an average of three hours per day so
it's going to save you money for a long
time it puts out light at a nice yellowy
2,700 k it looks good on paper it's a
perfectly fine bulb but I still don't
recommend it and here's why the bulb
cost twenty dollars and that was a good
price a year ago when LEDs hadn't come
down yet but they have and there's more
competitors out there and there are
pretty good competitors out there like
the GE revealed BR 30 LED which just won
our editors choice that bulb has the
same general specs as the Cree light a
slight uptick in the wattage to make for
better color quality but still very
efficient it also costs two dollars less
so you can get that bowl but the same
ten year warranty the same overall
quality for less I think that's a much
better deal than the Cree bulb if they
cost the same I'd probably still prefer
the GE reveal so the fact that it costs
less is just the icing on the cake in
addition to that price point the cree
LED has some other problems with it that
i'm not huge fan of the first of which
is the fact that it does flickr a bit on
dimmer switches your performance may
vary there a lot of dimmer switches out
there but on every switch we tried it
with here in our lab we found that a
flickered quite a bit now Cree has been
pretty aggressive about their pricing
getting to the bottom of that price
range right away to try and get out in
front of the competition with be our 30s
it feels that they fall in a bit behind
other bulbs that Korea's put out have
seen price cuts in the year since
they've been out they've kind of
adjusted to make sure that they're still
very competitive this one has not it's
the same price point as when it was
first introduced back in July of 2013 it
might get a price cut in the near future
you don't know but even if it did I
don't know that I'd recommend it because
the market has already come down just
take a look at this Phillips
BR 30 slim style this is a $13 bulb does
a perfectly good job has some of the
same problems with Korea with flickering
but all in all pretty comparable I don't
think he's going to come down to $13
they'd have to in order to compete with
this one in the end cree bulbs are very
good overall and in most categories they
tend to leave the way but be our 30s
they are behind the curve until they
play catch-up I say skip it and go with
something else for seeing that I'm right
