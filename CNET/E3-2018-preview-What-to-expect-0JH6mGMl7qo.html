games I'm talking about
III 2018 and there is less than a week
to go before the show kicks off here at
the Los Angeles Convention Center but
what's in store for the big three here
are our predictions even though Sony
Interactive Entertainment CEO John
Coderre says the PlayStation 4 is in the
final phase of its lifecycle Sony will
be firing on all cylinders at e3 and
showing off its console exclusives
spider-man day is gone The Last of Us -
and death stranding will almost
certainly see lots of face time at this
year's show our wildest prediction that
Sony is going to show off the successor
to the PlayStation 4 even just a glimpse
but don't hold your breath
Microsoft is in the very same boat as
Sony with Xbox one a good way through
its own life cycle they'll also be
bringing big exclusives to the show
crackdown 3 looks like it's finally
launching this year and it could come
with a battle royale mode to compete
with games like pub G and fortnight's
I'm also predicting the announcement of
halo 6 because pillow games tend to come
around every few years and they're due
as for Nintendo they have made it clear
they will be leaning heavily into Smash
Brothers force which at this year's show
we're also probably going to get more
information on Metroid Prime for a new
Animal Crossing announcement hopefully
and some good third-party ports like
fallout 3 and fortnight as for new
hardware announcements the Nintendo
switch is fully in its prime so don't
expect anything there but I have heard
rumblings of a possible n64 classic
which fingers craft skies because that
could be really cool oh that's it for
our e3 predictions what are your guesses
what are your wish list drop them down
in the comments and stay tuned to see
Netcom we'll be carrying all of the
biggest press conferences kicking off on
June 9th with EA I'm ashley Esqueda
