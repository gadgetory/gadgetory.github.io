anniversary galaxy phone here's how it
compares on paper to the iPhone 10s
these top of the line phones come with a
premium price tag in the US the Galaxy S
ten starts at $900 while the iPhone 10's
starts at a thousand while many phones
from 2018 embraced a notch in the screen
to fit the front-facing camera
the S 10 instead has a hole-punch camera
at the front of the screen the display
itself is a 6.1 inch edge to edge AMOLED
and has Gorilla Glass 6 to protect it
from drops and scratches with Gorilla
Glass 5 around the back the iPhone 10 s
is a 5.8 inch OLED screen and while we
don't know officially if it's Gorilla
Glass or not Apple says it's the most
durable glass ever on a smart phone both
also come in a larger screen version the
S 10 plus is 6.4 inches and the 10s max
is 6.5 the S 10 plus also has two front
facing cameras which is how you can tell
them apart
Apple's phone comes in space grey silver
or gold while Samsung is pink black blue
or white in the US the S 10 plus adds
the option of a ceramic finish in black
or white and if you're a fan of the
headphone jack of the galaxy is the only
one that has a standard 3.5 milk jock
apart from running iOS and Android these
two phones have many other features that
set them apart the Galaxy has Qualcomm's
latest snapdragon 855 while apple has
its most recent a12 chip in the iPhone
Samsung has put a brand new ultrasonic
fingerprint reader embedded in the
screen plus facial recognition Apple
uses its own version of facial
recognition called face ID or a pin to
authenticate and unlock your phone for
storage you get the choice of either 128
or 512 gigabytes on the Galaxy plus it
also has the option to add a microSD
card for expandable storage the 10 s has
three storage options of 64 128 or 256
gigabytes with no expansion option
both phones are rated as ip68 which
means they're water-resistant and
wireless charging is standard on both
but the galaxy also supports wireless
power share you can charge any cheat of
ice like the Galaxy buds from the back
of the phone
Samsung has a thirty four hundred
million power battery on the s10 and
forty one hundred on the s10 plus Apple
doesn't release official battery
capacities but in tear downs the tennis
and tennis max appear to have a smaller
battery than the Galaxy phones
respectively but real-world performance
is always variable so stay tuned for our
battery tests the galaxy is a camera
powerhouse with three units around the
back versus the iPhones to camera number
one on the galaxy is an ultra wide-angle
at 16 megapixels with an aperture of
f-22 the second is a standard wide-angle
at 12 megapixels with optical image
stabilization and a variable aperture
between F 1.5 and F 2.4 just like last
year's galaxy s 9 camera number 3 is for
telephoto at 12 megapixels with an F 2.4
aperture and OAS compare that to the
iPhone which has two rear cameras both
of 12 megapixels with OAS the wide-angle
lens is F 1 point 8 and the telephoto is
F 2 point 4 the galaxy has a special
mode for capturing better low-light
photos called
bright nights the iPhone has auto
low-light FPS which is a mode to capture
better video in low-light the selfies
the iPhone has apples true depth camera
with an aperture of f28 - and a 7
megapixel sensor while the s tens front
camera is 10 megapixels with a wider
maximum aperture of f11 the S 10 Plus
adds another selfie camera to capture
depth information
both the Galaxy S ten and the iPhone 10s
are impressive premium phones so stay
tuned for the review to see how they
perform in the real world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
