lot like the streaming players from
Apple and Roku but it's what's on the
inside that really counts I'm Bill
Detweiler and this is cracking open
following in the footsteps of the Apple
TV and the streaming players from Roku
the fire TV is a small black box it's
four and a half inches square and just
over half an inch thick there's really
nothing much to see on the front and
sides of the box but along the back
you'll find a bevy of connectors there's
a power Jack HDMI port optical audio
port Ethernet jack and even a USB slot
the fire TVs remote is pretty similar to
the competition with one big difference
it has a microphone that viewers can use
with the players voice search feature
opening the fire TV is ridiculously
simple using a thin tool or screwdriver
carefully pop loose the plastic tabs
holding the base to the upper shell and
then gently separate the two now that
we're inside we can see the box's
circuit board the board is attached to a
large heatsink with no less than 10
Phillips screws the heatsink in turn is
attached to the plastic case with
adhesive
now after removing the screws you can
lift out the board leaving the zinc
aluminum heatsink in place once we
remove the metal shields from the
circuit board our fire TV teardown is
complete and we can turn our attention
to the remote after removing the battery
cover and a few more Phillips screws you
can gently pry apart the case now
there's a bit of glue along the bottom
edge so you'll want to take care not to
crack the housing or damage any of the
internal components in the process the
circuit board is held to the upper half
of the housing with several additional
screws and once you've removed them the
board and button pad can come out now a
special note on the board are the
microphone and the voice processor now
with both the fire TV and its remote in
pieces this cracking open is a wrap so
how does amazon's $99 box
up against the competing players from
Apple and Roku well the fire TV has a
quad core 1.7 gigahertz crate 300
processor and Adreno 320 GPU 2 gigs of
ram and 8 gigs of internal storage
in contrast the Apple TV has a single
core Apple a5 sauk 512 Meg's of RAM and
8 gigs of storage the Roku 3 does have a
dual core a non processor but like the
Apple TV
it only has 512 Meg's of RAM the fire TV
definitely wins out when it comes to
hardware and the voice enhanced remote
is a cool feature but having better
hardware will only get you so far when
it comes to streaming media players the
real value is in the content which often
comes down to a personal preference more
so than a cut and dry decision the fire
TV supports third-party apps like
Netflix Hulu Plus and Pandora but its
interface favours content from Amazon
Instant which shouldn't really be a
surprise given that this is Amazon's box
now for more information on the fire TV
including an extensive look at the user
interface and content offerings check
