Monsters and have been since I was a kid
and I when Universal asked me if I'd be
interested in doing the mummy I jumped
at the chance but I really wanted to
figure out a way to do it to honor
everything that I loved about those
films and also bring it to a new
audience that may not have actually seen
them either the Karloff mummy movies or
the Brendan Fraser mummy movies and the
challenge was figuring out a way to to
pay tribute to all of them but but also
bring something new to the table the
dark universe which is going to be our
endeavour to launch all the monster
relaunched all that all the monster
films was not actually on the agenda at
the beginning they came to me about
mummy specifically and as I started to
develop the script for it one of the
ideas in looking for a way to
differentiate from the movies that came
before was that the mummy existed in a
larger continuum of monsters and there
was an organization that may have either
been hunting them or protecting them
depending on what the monster was and
certainly tracking and cataloging them
over history and the idea of the larger
monster universe began to take shape and
ultimately the agenda kind of dovetail
before the story was naturally going
it's a major point of pride you know the
universal was built on the Munsters the
first universal film ever was hunchback
and I think they feel that it is their
their legacy that heritage and that we
are now inheriting that mantle and we
need to do honor by that and people who
love those films will see that that is
that these new films are being made by
people who love those from those monster
movies
you know the idea that he is a character
who has his own connection to the nature
of evil and certainly seems to carry
himself as if you were from a different
time which may suggest an in fact he is
I like that idea you know all the
monsters are rooted in mythology's that
have existed for millennia
centuries you know over long periods of
time and I think per Digium is certainly
not a new organization and Jeckle may be
a lot older than he looks
I believe that the best way to build a
universe is to give the audience
incredibly satisfying monster movies
that make you fall in love with each
individual monster in the way that I
know I did when I was a kid and and saw
those films but also within the context
of that to open doors to the larger dark
universe
welcome to a new world of cults
and monsters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
