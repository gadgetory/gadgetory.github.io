all-in-one desktop PC monitor and
stretch it out from the regular 16 by 9
aspect ratio to a 21 by 9 aspect ratio
well you get something very unusual like
this Lenovo B 750 it's a known one
desktop PC but the the monitor is much
wider than you would expect we've seen a
handful of both individual monitors and
even one or two laptops they have this
21 by 9 aspect ratio that basically
means the screen is 2560 wide by 1080
high 1080 being the same as in a regular
1920 by 1080 display it's not like
having 2 1080p monitors next to each
other but it does give you a lot more
screen real estate than you would with
just one regular monitor you can use
this for a couple of things you can kind
of replace a multiple monitor set up and
have two fairly big let's say browser
windows or application windows next to
each other it's also great for movies HD
films especially blu-rays we'll play on
this if you have the right software
without those litterbox black bar at the
top and bottom it'll actually fill the
entire screen cinema scope style and the
third reason you may be interested in
this is gaming is actually a lot of fun
this guy has a discrete graphics card an
nvidia geforce gtx 760 that's a pretty
decent card it's last year's card it's
not the highest end but it's okay and if
you get a game to play at the need of
resolution of the screen then you get a
lot larger field of vision you basically
get more sort of peripheral vision while
you're playing either a first person in
our third person action game we played
Bioshock the page Skyrim we've played
metro and few other games and it felt
like a much more immersive experience
the trade-off being that you do have to
dial down some of the detail settings
and the frame rates are not gonna be as
good when we went from 1920 by 1080
resolution to the wider 2560 resolution
we definitely took a bit of a
performance hit and that's why it's good
that we have a decent mid to mid high
graphics card in here already of course
you also get an HDMI input so you can
just use this with an external device
like like a laptop or a tablet or a game
console it's got a sub work from the
back
in addition to the two speakers here so
the sound is pretty decent and of course
because it's a desktop all-in-one you
get a lot of USB ports six of them as a
matter of fact now we're more used to
seeing you know two maybe three on a
laptop
it's an unusual system it's not for
everybody I found it to be a lot of fun
and I think the high-end parts near the
core i7 the decent GPU the big hard
drive and this really big screen you can
get it all for about 1450 which is a
pretty decent price considering this is
unlike pretty much anything else you're
gonna get ipad akron and that's the
Lenovo Li 750</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
