company just announced three major new
additions to Google Earth on google maps
so what we're looking at here is a
preview of some new technology what I'm
showing here is an example of this new
3d imagery and reconstructed buildings
on a Galaxy Nexus and Here I am in san
francisco so i'm just going to go ahead
and pan around and show the fact that i
can just fly around these 3d models we
haven't announced an exact date but this
is going to be coming out in the in the
coming weeks where does the stata come
from do you own or contract your own
airplanes to do this so we do have our
own planes as well as contract with
partners for acquiring the imagery
that's necessary for creating these 3d
reconstructions we're really excited
about bringing this technology to our
users wherever they are on whatever
platform there in today I'm here to tell
you that you will no longer need those
paper maps like many other google apps
Google Maps is going offline once you
confirm your selection the map will
automatically start downloading onto the
device and as you can see the map may be
clear at this zoom level but as I get
off the plane and start zooming in
you'll notice that the map is virtually
unusable now as a comparison the device
where we have just downloaded the google
map as i start zooming in the map
remains clear even down to street level
so you can easily see where you are and
where you're going here is what we call
the tracker let's see if I can play done
correctly we hope to you know use this
and working with partners as early as
this forum even sooner go to a whole
bunch of places and bring you imagery
that you've only dreamed of see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
