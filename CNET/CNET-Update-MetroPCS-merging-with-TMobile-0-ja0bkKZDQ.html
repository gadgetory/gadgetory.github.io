phones and in home entertainment I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your scene at
update t-mobile is merging with the
prepaid regional cellphone carrier metro
pcs
if the deal is approved changes won't
happen until the first half of 2013 the
CEO of t-mobile said that this merger
were made the company a leader in no
contract phones and that makes life
harder for Sprint which has its prepaid
business with Boost Mobile virgin mobile
and assurance Wireless and Microsoft
seems to have a busy October on the same
day that the new Windows operating
system is coming out that's October 26
which is also the same day that the
surface tablet is going on sale
Microsoft is also planning to launch a
new streaming music service called Xbox
music now this is according to the verge
so Microsoft hasn't officially said
anything yet but this Xbox music would
likely be like Spotify where you can
stream music for free with ads or
purchase a subscription you'll be able
to get this on your windows phones
tablets computers and of course Xbox 360
its Microsoft's way of taking on Sony's
music unlimited service which starts at
$5 a month
in other news we're watching this week
Google will be adding street view images
to the mobile web version of Google Maps
that's according to all things digital
count that as another win for Google
Maps Redbox the company with those red
DVD rental kiosks they're starting to
sell event tickets out of those DVD
machines it's only testing it in
Philadelphia for now but event tickets
are being sold at or below face value
and there's only a 1 dollar fee logitech
has introduced its latest all-in-one
remote the Logitech Harmony touch and
yes it has a touchscreen this clicker is
logitech's high-end model and it
features the same controls and
programming that has made harmony
remotes so popular you just now get it
all on a touchscreen and there are fewer
buttons you can program your favorite
channels as icons on the screen and this
model is also easier to make setup
changes you have to recharge it in a
cradle every 2 or 3 days and
this doesn't come cheap it's 250 dollars
just think you can get a tablet for less
but you may find it worth the cost if it
makes your home theater easier to manage
now I have to return this back to the
CNET labs the editors are putting
through the tests now so stay tuned for
our full review and that's your tech
news update for today but before we end
I need to correct an error on a previous
show I mistakenly said that Cricket
Wireless is selling the iPhone 5
unlocked and that's not true I should
have said cricket sells the iPhone 5
without a contract sorry if I caused
confusion I'm Bridget Carey thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
