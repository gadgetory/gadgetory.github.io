this new virtual reality technology
makes it a no-brainer hope you guys like
brain teasers welcome to what the future
on today's show
brain surgery goes VR robotic skins let
you turn inanimate objects into robots
and a Rubik's Cube that solves itself
we're diving in headfirst let's get to
it for a long time
surgeons have had to rely on
two-dimensional MRI and CT scans to get
a look inside a patient's brain but
that's changed thanks to a new use of
virtual reality technology called snap
which stands for surgical navigation
advanced platform made by a company
called surgical theater it combines
traditional 2d brain scans to create a
3d model of a patient's brain that can
be explored in virtual reality for
patients and their families this
technology makes these complex and
frightening processes easier to
understand brain tumors aneurysms
malformations and blood vessels can all
be easily observed vr also allows
surgeons to test different approaches
with virtual surgical tools so that they
can find the best entry point close to
the targeted area and with the least
probability of causing damage to the
brain the technology was cleared by the
fda in 2013 and is being tested in
research hospitals right now so far it's
been used in over 6,000 surgeries who
the heck wants to carry a bunch of heavy
robots into space not NASA that's why
researchers at Yale have developed these
robotic skins instead of spending the
money transporting several bulky robots
into space to perform different tasks
these robotic skins allow astronauts to
create simple functional robots on the
fly here you can see three different
examples of ways these robots can move
the skins are modular meaning you could
combine several skins to create more
complex motions the Yale research team
isn't stopping it inanimate objects
want to improve your posture just wrap
some robotic skins around your back to
prevent slouching in this configuration
the skin can give you a tactile reminder
to sit back up when you slouch past a
certain threshold
last but not least the Rubik's Cube that
doesn't need any help from you
Takashi kaburagi is the mastermind
behind the world's smartest rubik's cube
he spent two years making this dream a
reality just listen to his reaction when
it solved itself for the first time
there's something oddly soothing about
watching this little robotic cube
spinning around trying to sort itself
out sometimes in its efforts to set
itself right it veers off course into
danger luckily for the cube there's a
loving hand to guide it back to safety
if only all of life's problems could
sort themselves out with such grace it's
time for a question from one of our
viewers Gio hard asked us on Facebook
where can I buy a self solving Rubik's
Cube thanks for the question Gio
unfortunately you can't at least not yet
for now the only way to get the sweet
satisfaction of a salt cube is to do it
yourself there are lots of tutorials
online so I'm sure you can figure it out
jump down to the comments and let us
know what makes you say WTF that's all
for this week I'm Jessie Orel we'll see
you next time on what the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
