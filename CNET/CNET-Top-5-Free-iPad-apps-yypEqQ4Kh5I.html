as a way to show the world that you're
the kind of person is willing to pay for
quality but when it comes to software
you guys really love the free stuff I'm
Tamil bell and this top five we're
counting down apple's most popular free
ipad apps for the second week of
februari so list that's always in flux
here's a snapshot of what's popular and
free starting things off at number five
youtube a victim of the great google iOS
purge of 2012 and pretty much one of the
first apps and a new ipad owner will
download it out of the box i mean if you
can't get your fix of HD videos of
kittens chasing lasers then what's an
ipad even good for might as well just
hand that thing over to your kid no you
didn't really hand this thing over to
your kid did you oh man really at number
four baby care and dress up play love
and have fun with babies that's really
the whole name of the app one has to
hope that this is being downloaded for
children or maybe aspiring teen mothers
I also have to think that if I'm ever
held captive by a psychopathic killer
this is probably how they're going to
pass the time while I'm trapped in their
makeshift dungeon moisturizing on a
lighter note coming in at number three
galaxy on fire 2 HD now this is a
graphically stunning video game for the
iPad it's an outerspace shoot them up
with some role-playing elements it's
great for living out your Battlestar
Galactica fantasy and a great way to
show off a Retina Display bad news is
that free price expires right about now
at number 2 what's the word HD it's a
word puzzle game where you get for
pictures with some common theme and then
you name the theme with the letters
provided in advance to the next round
but you can't figure out what a garden
hose a pair of tweezers Arthur
Fonzarelli and umlaut have in common
well then you can get a hint for a price
genius now before we get to our number
one free iPad app let's take a look back
at Apple's list of the most downloaded
free iPad apps of 2012 now that's a
sensible list it's not a baby dress up
the whole bunch that temple run game
drove me nuts though alright and now the
most popular free iPad app for quite a
few weeks Temple Run 2 ah no you think
this guy would have learned his lesson
by now stay away from the damn temple
but no now he's got a slide down ropes
and ride through mine shafts it's not an
app like a sustained panic attack makes
you miss those fat like these birds
everyone was crazy for central times so
there you have it five of the most
popular ipad apps that you're not
spending money on for more top 5s like
this head over top 5 cnet com and be
sure to follow my ramblings over on
twitter i'm donna bell thanks for
