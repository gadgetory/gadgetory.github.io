show that covers everything related to
alphabet Inc including wham-o Google
Android and more I'm your guide Aya's
Akhtar and you are the excellent
audience today we're talking about some
serious Google issues an accident with a
whammo car your comments and more but
first Samsung's unveiled its foldable
phone sort of let's go to galaxy gateway
the Twitter account for Android
developers posted a tweet a new form
factor coming next year
from Android partners Android apps run
seamlessly as a device folds achieving
this form factors chief feature screen
continuity Dave Burke VP of engineering
for Android at the Android developers
conference said that they are already
working with Samsung on a device coming
next year this all happened well before
Samsung got around to showing off its
folding phone at its own Developers
Conference so what did Samsung show off
there was a promo video that didn't show
a whole lot then an exec brought out a
foldable phone from his pocket on the
outside was a 4-inch screen when opened
up you saw a 7.3 inch screen now it
looked like a really chunky design just
hard edged the Samsung exec explained
that the device was disguised the name
of the foldable phone was not given
instead we found out then if display is
called Infinity flex display the
foldable phone could be mass-produced in
the coming months
how does Android work on a folding phone
the apps you're using on the small
screen can pop up on your main display
when you open up the phone samsung
called the small front display the cover
display and the large one the main
display Samsung also showed off the
ability to run three apps at one time
with a feature called multi active
window Google's head of Android UX also
made an appearance to mention that
Google is building support for folding
phones right into Android let's stop
over at the garden of Google
a New York Times article detailed how
Google handles sexual harassment in the
past the piece said that the creator of
Android Andy Rubin was accused of sexual
misconduct by another employee an
internal investigation by the company
found her claim credible Rubin was asked
to resign from his post by Larry Page
with that resignation Rubin was paid out
90 million dollars as an exit package
The Times article also said that Google
protected two other executives after
accusations of sexual misconduct both
left the company but received millions
of dollars another executive was able to
keep their position Google did nothing
to publicize any of these events after
The Times piece a memo was sent to
Google employees by Google CEO sundar
Pichai and VP of people operations
Eileen Naughton a copy of the memo was
published by Business Insider calm the
memo says that in the last two years
forty eight people have been terminated
for sexual harassment including 13 who
were senior managers and above none of
these individuals received an exit
package at a conference pichai said
quote there's been anger and frustration
within the company we all feel it I feel
it too at Google we set a very high bar
and we clearly didn't live up to our
expectations end quote
he also added there are concrete steps
coming up the report got the attention
of many at Google who staged walkouts
and offices all around the world the
organizers of the protest were a post on
the cut comm explaining themselves they
want a number of things including an end
to forced arbitration in cases of
harassment and discrimination for all
current and future employees equal pay
and a publicly disclosed sexual
harassment transparency report the
organizer said that more than 20,000
Google employees and contractors were a
part of the walkout in response
Google announced that it would change
its harassment policies let's head to
weigh Moe away
bueno published a post discussing a
collision between a way Moe car and a
motorcycle
according to way moe a test driver took
control of the car after seeing a
passenger car to the left moved toward
the way Moe cars lane the test driver
moved the way Moe car to the right lane
the driver did not see a motorcyclist
that moved to the right lane to pass the
way Moe car the bumper hit the
motorcycle way Moe included a link to
the accident report the motorcyclist
reported injuries and was taken to the
hospital
way Moe says that after a review of the
accident that its technology would have
avoided the collision by taking a safer
course of action the post says that way
Mo's tech correctly anticipated and
predicted the future behavior of both
the merging vehicle and the motorcyclist
so maybe the humans shouldn't have taken
over way to throw the driver under the
bus wait that's a really poor choice of
words let's go to uptown updates guess
what there's a new nuke no really I'm
not kidding Barnes and Noble will be
releasing a new Nook on November 14th
and it'll cost a whopping 130 bucks why
are we talking about this on alphabet
city because this Nook runs Android the
Nook has a 10.1 inch screen with 32 gigs
of storage
unlike the Amazon fire tablets the Nook
has access to the Google Play Store
right out of the box
meanwhile the pixel slate is up for
pre-order Best Buy says it will be
delivered on November 22nd meanwhile
Google store says around the same time
let's go to comment Cove this is the
part of the shell reach on a spotlight
at the most amazing audience in the
world you find folks gog and asks is it
a right time to buy a flagship or wait
for 5g flagship that's a great question
I think that depends on how old your
current phone is I'm hanging onto my
note 8 for another year or two I'm
curious about how long it will take for
5g networks to be widely available
there's lots of different factors
involved guys let us know your opinion
in the comments Trent asks why do we
want foldable phones though I'll feel
that one I think the idea is having one
device being your everything device a
larger screen that is portable could
allow that to happen
thanks to everyone for writing in if
you've enjoyed your stay in Alphabet
City please like and subscribe
a my as actor and I'll see you online
but one more thing at the Android
developers conference Google showed off
the ability for apps to update from
within the app you wouldn't need to go
to the Play Store to force an update
also here's a shout out to Mark Thomas
