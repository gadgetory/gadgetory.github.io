you've heard a lot about skinny and a
lot of different things but the
challenge with skinny bundles is your
skinny is different than my skinny which
is different than someone else's skinny
this is an incredibly robust premium
content full of rich content from each
of these providers the only one missing
from this is CBS and Showtime which
we're working through actively there's
no annual contract there's no cable box
there's no waiting for an installer to
come between certain hours we're having
to take time off work there's no credit
check you can cancel anytime not only
can you cancel but because it's app
based you could you can move up and down
in between packages within the app
itself from the names of the package we
took a completely different approach
it's not a gold silver platinum this
audience we've got to speak to
completely different we created live a
little
just drag go big and you got to have it
all and the price points you see here or
everyday prices everyday simple pricing
this is not promotional this doesn't
roll off what you see is what you get
and the channel count isn't stocked full
of music titles or public interest this
is paid premium content from a few
slides back if this doesn't have 4k this
is limited to two streams right this
doesn't have the premium sports but for
a segment of audience this is a very
compelling value proposition to be able
to get two streams all that content and
hopefully you'll see in the demo wrapped
up in a very data-driven personalized
fashion out of the gate we're gonna
offer Argo package over a hundred
channels for $35 and anyone who comes in
during this introductory price will be
grandfathered as long as they're a
customer and stay out what I want to
show you is if you hit menu or the up
you can get quick guides and soon to
watch the settings so if you swipe up
what you're going to get is this curated
option you can look at your home there's
usually this sister this first group of
stuff is stuff that you've recently
watched or things that you have listed
as your favorite I'm going to show you
how easy that is I think what what I
want you to take away from here is this
is a doing experience that is really
taking television the next level because
it doesn't stick you right into a linear
guides Christian it takes you one of the
things that matter most so if I was just
watching this as
us or speechless or kingdom or maybe as
I scrolled some of my other favorite
stations this is telling me everything
that's on live right this moment these
are not bought assets for a later time
these are live assets into right now but
you can flip through these channels
pretty quickly in live assets what and
we've got gala vision and Univision Golf
Channel but what you can do is you can
set your favorites right so that first
role would be everything that you're
most interested in and all devices are
welcome you'll see downstairs whether
it's Apple devices phones tablets
Android devices all your favorite
browsers all the major streaming devices
Apple Amazon fire TV chromecast Roku
will follow in the next two to four
weeks but the other three will be at
launch we're also working with Apple
that across all of our retail stores if
you pre buy the first three months of
directing it out we'll give you an Apple
TV product and in the store they'll be
able to walk out with that Apple TV
product so we're incredibly excited
about that also because it's a voice
enable it's a great experience same goes
with fire TV sticks if you want to pre
buy your first month you get an apple
fire TV stick as well as the Alexa voice
remote include it for free if you pre
buy your first month HBO you can add it
for five dollars I somebody thought it
was a second there should be a one here
but for five bucks the full HBO
portfolio all of the vaad content all of
the on-demand content will be available
from season one
you can add Cinemax for five dollars on
top of the price points that I shared
when this is all this coming in 36 hours
everything but the last two pieces
Taylor will be in a few weeks and Reese
is going to be early next year
everything else I said prior to that is
coming to market in the next 36 hours</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
