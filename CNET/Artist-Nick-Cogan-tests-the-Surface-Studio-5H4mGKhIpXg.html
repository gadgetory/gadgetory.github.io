an artist writer I've worked on ad
campaigns for feature films like the
peanuts movie and Rio and Ice Age today
I'm trying out the surface studio what's
most important for most people who are
looking at something like this is that
it feels like natural media feels like a
pencil yeah I definitely like the
feeling of the tip the nib at home I
have the Wacom Cintiq which is a 20 inch
pen display similar functionality of
this it's just the display and that's
the industry standard this is similar to
the Cintiq in that I can tip it down and
up the Cintiq also allows you to rotate
the entire monitor you know drawing like
this is harder for me than drawing like
this I'm right-handed I use Photoshop I
use flash after-effects on a Mac so you
obviously have to have a pretty high-end
computer if you're using these drawing
and painting tools this is my first time
using the dial going back and finding
all the menus through this is really
time consuming even just going back from
color to brush and sort of toggling
through the different colors sort of
gets in your way whereas there's
probably a quicker key command for video
editing be great for scrubbing footage
dry and gruesome nightmarish stuff and
I'm not gonna stop I said I was gonna
draw something cute and I didn't it so
horrific let's just go all in he's
hunched over I think the big barrier is
gonna be that it's windows-based and so
many people in the creative fields are
really already decades down using Mac's
for me I always get instantly confused
when I'm on a Windows computer this is
definitely a great tool for artists I
think it is really comparable if not a
little bit better than my current setup
as a drawing tool this is great there's
a lot of fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
