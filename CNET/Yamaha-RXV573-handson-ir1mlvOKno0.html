and we're going to take a look at the
Yamaha rxv 573 this is a 7.1 AV receiver
with built-in airplay and it's currently
selling for five hundred dollars the
design is pretty much like any other AV
receiver on the market it's a big
full-size receiver so you're gonna need
a sizable shelf to hold the whole system
the included remote is about as
confusing as it gets with tons of tiny
buttons and confusing labels so you're
probably going to want to get a
universal remote if you go with this
receiver now you can also control it
with Yamaha smart phone app which is
available for both iOS and Android and
that has a lot more straightforward
interface than the physical remote you
could do simple stuff like change the
inputs or adjust the volume but what's
really nice is it's much faster if
you're gonna scroll through the list of
internet radio stations which can be
pretty tough to navigate on the actual
receiver now some AV receivers have
upgraded to fancy graphical displays but
the setup menus on the Yamaha still look
pretty ancient it's pretty bizarre to
see this kind of blocky text on a hi-def
TV especially as when you're navigating
the entire screen refreshes every time
you press a button now you're not going
to see these kind of setup menus that
often but this is the same kind of
experience you get using the built-in
airplay functionality there's no album
art just basic artist information and
song title around back you'll see the
connectivity there are only four HDMI
inputs on the back which is pretty
skimpy when most receivers at this price
includes six there's an Ethernet port
which you'll need to connect for airplay
smart phone control and internet radio
but there aren't any additional
streaming music services like built-in
Pandora or Spotify for legacy devices
there are also for digital audio inputs
including two optical and two coaxial
ports sound quality on the Yamaha is
pretty solid we had our resident audio
file Steve Guttenberg listen to the
receiver and it performed well with both
music and movies it held its own even
when we put it head-to-head with our
reference then on EVR 1912 even when we
switched over to to channel music so
this is a pretty solid
Avia receiver but even with that strong
sound quality the rxv 573 doesn't have a
lot to recommend it over competitors
like the Akio TX NR 414 that offer six
HDMI inputs for less than $300 and if
you don't need the full 7.1 channels the
step-down rxv 473 is basically the same
except it's just a 5.1 model for less
money
so the rxv 573 isn't a bad AV receiver
but most people will find a better value
elsewhere
I'm maxing Muscovy act from CNET and
this is the Yamaha rxv 573</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
