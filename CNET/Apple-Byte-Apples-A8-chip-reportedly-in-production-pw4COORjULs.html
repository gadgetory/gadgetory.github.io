you created the ipad but you thought of
the ipad before I made up the iPad hey
high-five baby buddies for life yeah
this is how we do uh we dance what was
it are you doing hmm what are you doing
nothing Mitch nothing looks like you're
playing with Steve Jobs dolls no those
are not dolls this is a 16 action figure
replica look it's fully poseable this is
valuable stuff okay all right okay have
fun playing with your dolls they're not
dolls their figures oh you look nice in
your suit today let's shake and Brian
song here and welcome to the Apple by
for everything good and bad inside the
world of Apple and the big news this
week is all about Apple's carplay
formerly known as iOS in the car now
Mercedes Volvo and Ferrari are the first
three manufacturers to show off car play
in action at the geneva motor show car
play will enable users to make calls
navigate maps listen to music and access
messages from the dashboard of
compatible cars now Syria can also be
activated by pressing a dedicated button
on your steering wheel Kevin Jones
calling Kevin Jones and there's
third-party support for services like
Spotify I Heart Radio and stitcher but
Pandora confirmed it will not be one of
the apps integrated with car play now
Pandora's the most popular music app on
iTunes but since its station based by
genre or artist it was probably too
similar to iTunes radio and of course
Apple is going to give them the big boot
now did you really have to do that bad
apple bad bad apple now the big a has
also made deals for future integration
including BMW Honda Nissan and pretty
much every other car company you can
think of the only stand outside of yet
to commit is Audi who's aligned with
Android for now and Tesla remains mum
but we should expect car manufacturers
to support both platforms over time
unless they are dumb now we also have a
few iphone nuggets for you according to
commercial times Apple's new chip
partner TSMC has begun production on the
next gen a8 chip that we expect to see
in the next iPhone 6 the report claims
the new 20 nanometer a a chip will
include a quad core 64 bit processor
with quad-core graphics and an earlier
starts production compared with previous
years should give Apple more flexibility
to comfortably launch the new iphone in
the third quarter of this year now Apple
Safari deal with GT advanced
technologies expects to hit full
production in the second half of 2014
now GT actually halted sales of their
sapphire furnaces to build out capacity
for apples Arizona facility but 2014 and
beyond should be a transformative one
for them they anticipate at sapphire
segments will account for eighty percent
of their total revenue in 2014 and sees
growth estimates over a billion dollars
in 2015 and they're pretty happy about
that but one company not so happy about
that corning's Gorilla Glass now their
senior VP went on a defensive rant after
he was asked his thoughts on other
device makers him Apple using sapphire
in their devices Tony Tripoli said it's
about ten times more expensive it's
about 1.6 times heavier it's
environmentally unfriendly it takes
about 100 times more energy to generate
a sapphire crystal then it does glass it
transmits less light which means either
it's dimmer devices or shorter battery
life it continues to break I think well
it's a scratch-resistant product it
still breaks and our testing says that
gorilla glass can take about two and a
half times more pressure lesson of the
day don't make a gorilla angry now trip
knees points are valid but we will
really know how well sapphire performs
in the real world until it starts making
it into more products now an iWatch news
the information reports that as Apple is
continuing its work on the iWatch it's
placing a large focus on expanding
series ability to interface with
third-party apps with input methods on a
watch limited due to its screen size
series voice capabilities will be key
for them obviously now the report points
out how Siri can't do things like book a
car rental or make hotel reservations
and the only mess
knapp it can really work with is its own
right now and real talk Apple fans Siri
has a ways to go to even match google
voice's accuracy I know you don't want
to hear that all right in the quick
bytes iOS 7.1 has been in developers
hands for quite some time with
improvements in visual tweaks but dairy
fireballs John Gruber says it could come
any day now he says apple plans to
release an iOS 7.1 reliant app that will
stream the itunes festival performances
from South by Southwest and the festival
starts on March 11 so that timetable
points to us getting it real soon and
the latest rumor from digit times claims
the Cupertino kids will stop production
of the 13-inch non retina macbook pro in
this second half of 2014 the writing's
been on the wall with a discontinuation
of the 15-inch macbook pro so this
wouldn't be a total surprise there's
only one hundred dollar difference
between the macbook pro 13 and the
macbook pro 13 retina but it would
finally eliminate apples last laptop
with an optical disc drive but it's
still alive it's not gone yet alright
let's get to our killer giveaway this
week our friends at legend toys are back
at it with their amazing Steve Jobs 16
scale collectible figures not dolls
figures they've created two new figures
with 70 Steve Jobs whose rocket is
double-breasted suit and there's also a
tease Steve Jobs who's Ryan is mock
turtleneck and jeans the figures retail
for 199 each re-invented the ipad no it
was my idea first i came up with the
apple computer now the fan service by
legend toys mr. Kato and miss Nakamura
to create these figures is really
unmatched they even replicated the first
Apple Computer out of laser cut wood
with a detailed motherboard inside in
the packaging is even shaped like the
original computer so we're giving away
two of each of the figures a way to you
the Apple biters for a total of four now

Apple by to cnet com or tweet
