is called the industrial control across
from demo it's based off a pipe dream
music video I guess that was digitally
animated I was made by an amusing and
this was over seven years ago so
originally it was thought that this is
going to be kind of brought in the life
but that was our challenge and we did it
and we did it in 90 days which is pretty
outstanding so Street reviewed a lot of
this deciding on Intel Architecture
especially the hardware and software
side so I'll get more into that after
show but now just we'll go ahead and
pick up and throw the show
so pretty cool like I said before this
was all made and from concept to
creation in just 90 days there's seven
Intel Atom processors around the show
the one in the middle they see there on
the motherboard controls the over 200
different industrial iOS there's also
one in the front and the human machine
interface there's one over there in the
touchscreen there's walk back here at
the smart camera one of the Digital side
and what controlling the music and
there's also three different operating
systems that are all working together
there's a real-time operating system in
the middle there's a windows and XP
embedded there's also a windows 7 64 bit
