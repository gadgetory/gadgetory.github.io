leafy and this is rumor has it the show
where we round up the week's biggest
tech room and then we vote on what
sounds legit and what sounds like it
won't ever happen and remember that you
guys can vote with us look out for the
pole in the interactive player if you're
watching on cnet first up there was a
management shakeup at Apple this week
Apple's retail chief John Browett who
wasn't even with the company a year was
ousted according to several reports this
wasn't surprising because he never
really fit in an apple in a very
surprising move iOS software chief scott
forstall who headed the team that
brought us such gems and Syrian Apple
maps was also let go he'd been with the
company for 15 years now according to
The Wall Street Journal this was a
crisis of manners citing people familiar
with the matter the report says
forestall was forced out after he
refused to sign a letter apologizing for
problems with Apple maps forestall
apparently said that Apple could forgo
an apology just like it did with
antennagate remember that yeah I do
remember that but at least with an
antenna gate Apple gave away phone
bumpers for free for a limited time
maybe for stole wanted to give away
paper maps for free because of the maps
fiasco next up the updated version of
Android jelly bean offers multiple user
accounts but only on tablets not
smartphones TechCrunch speculates that
that's because Nokia owns the patents
for that feature on phones I think that
this rumor is just trying to scapegoat
Nokia i'm trying to think of an instance
when a multi user account would even be
beneficial on a phone at least with
tablets you can share it with friends or
family maybe a special account for when
you'll own the phone to a kid oh yeah
like the kids korner feature that
Windows Phone 8 just released this week
so I don't think that Nokia is to blame
I think that the multi-user thing is
only available on tablets because that's
where people would use it next up the
New York Times reports that google is
testing same-day delivery in San
Francisco which would let you order
items online and have them deliver to
your home within a matter of hours and
at least one national apparel chain is
supposedly involved the time speculates
that the move is to hedge against
competing services from Amazon and eBay
which are apparently also being tested
the wall street journal reported this a
year ago saying that google will melt
its product search feature with a new
quick shipping service that it will
oversee but
how it would work no one is saying
Google wouldn't build warehouses or the
infrastructure of the shipping service
itself according to both reports now
same-day delivery service isn't a new
concept remember Cosmo or web fan those
services were popular but they failed
spectacularly but hopefully Google will
bring an actual sustainable business
model to the table I probably wouldn't
pay extra for same-day shipping I don't
even pay extra for two day shipping but
maybe I'm the only one who feels that
way there are actually things that i
would pay extra for same-day shipping
for like if you're having a party at
night and you want them to deliver
alcohol or a new outfit or cleaning
supplies that you forgot or food i would
pay a premium for that but the thing is
this is the most vague rumor of all time
no one is saying who would be doing the
delivery not Google itself and certainly
not usps with Google just as the
middleman it's unclear what exactly its
role would be is it just going to grease
the wheel will it be hiring bike
messengers the whole thing sounds to me
like a lot of rhetoric and very little
substance I do get why it's good idea I
just don't see how they're going to pull
it off so what do you guys think is
Google on its way to offering same-day
delivery would you mind paying for that
same day delivery what would you order
don't forget to vote or post your
comments on the rumor has it blog we
asked the cnet council members if they
thought Google was testing a same-day
shipping service the cnet councils
composed of five editors who cast their
votes anonymously their opinions are not
an endorsement by Cena or CBS
interactive obviously because these are
rumors folks and the cnet verdict is no
three out of five of our editors do not
think that Google has the same day
delivery service in the works that's our
show everybody please share your rumors
at rumor has it at cnet com or call us
at 1 800 750 cnet and tweet us and with
all the stress of worrying about our
friends family and co-workers affected
by Hurricane sandy we've decided to
postpone my humiliation until next week
to all our viewers on the East Coast
stay warm and safe
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
