launch of the HTC One we're going to
take a look at some of this phone
software treats as well as some of the
new features of HTC Sense 5.0 let's see
what's new all right so in terms of new
software the first thing to talk about
is what HTC is calling blinkfeed now
when you unlock the phone as I've just
done it's what you see here it's this
mosaic style tile very colorful very
brightly colored a list of new story
Social Feeds this thing pulls in from
new sites including cnet it also pulls
in facebook updates things like that the
idea being that right on your home
screen you've got very very quick access
to a couple of news stories that you're
going to want to read if you're just
looking at things in a hurry this is
very customizable as well you can see if
I tap just here I can choose the topics
and services that I want so here are
individual news sources if I pop over to
categories if you're interested in
design or gaming or music then you can
choose to have those things populating
your blinkfeed happily when you pop into
one of these it doesn't take you to the
browser instead it opens it here the bad
news is HTC told me that these things
won't cash offline so you will need an
internet connection to read these
stories at least for now if you want to
share a story there are a host of
options at your disposal including
Dropbox email Google+ or Twitter if you
hold down on the home button for a
moment then it takes you to a Google
search this might be Google now once the
phone gets a software update you can
actually use the HTC One as an infrared
remote control when you send a signal to
your TV you'll see this red flash at the
top which lets you know the signal has
been sent finally let's talk a little
bit about HTC Zoe camera so the zoe
camera takes burst mode photos so that
you can select the best of a series of
stills from a short video but once you
go into the actual gallery itself you've
got this rather interesting view here so
if i tap the event of today you can see
all of the photos and videos that were
taken today washed up in to 1 30 second
video the editing happens automatically
and it looks quite fun and it creates a
clip that you could very very quickly
share to Facebook imagine something like
Apple's I movie but with very little
effort on your part if you're familiar
with the app Flipboard then there'll be
no surprises here but i do like HTC's
done and
do you think this is quite an attractive
interface hopefully it won't be
something that you want to delete
straight away and it will actually keep
you entertained in those moments of
boredom even when you're looking at
blinkfeed you get access to key android
apps along the bottom here by this
launcher and if you swipe to the right
then you get a home screen and it all
starts to look a bit more like the
Android that you're probably used to the
app interface has been given a bit of a
redesign as well you can see HTC's
famous weather widget now has a
minimalist monochrome style and these
apps are look a little bit more spaced
out than they did previously something
that's bound to rock the world of
android fans around the world is that
HTC has ditched one of the
touch-sensitive keys from underneath the
screen so on the right here you have a
home button on the other side you have
fact but HTC has ditched the
multitasking key so how do you multitask
now well it's not too much trickier you
have to double tap this home button and
that brings up a list of your most
recently used apps if you hold down on
the home button for a seconds you get
access to a Google search ok there you
have it those are the most interesting
new software features with this phone
