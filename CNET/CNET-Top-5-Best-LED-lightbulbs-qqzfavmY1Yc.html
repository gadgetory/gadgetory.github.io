every day the most antique and outdated
has got to be the incandescent lightbulb
it's actually amazing these things are
stuck around this long the problem is
they're an absurdly inefficient light
source around 95% of the energy they
consume is turned into heat not light
there's a better way and don't worry I'm
not talking about fluorescent Donald
Bell and in this top five I'm counting
down the five best LED replacement bulbs
rated by C net associate editor Reich
wrists starting off at number five the
GE reveal LED twenty dollars buys you a
60 watt replacement bulb that will last
for decades it's not the brightest bulb
on this list it's a great choice for
both color and price it produces a soft
even tone light that will make your home
and everyone in it look great
yesterday that energy cost here is a
dollar and 32 cents per year at number
four the philips slim style LED now it
may look like someone sat on it but the
flat design here eliminates the need for
a heat sink in the base which cuts down
on cost we're seeing these go for as
little as four dollars per bulb for ball
black and last over a decade with a
yearly energy cost of $1 in twenty six
cents
it's a crazy value now sure it looks a
little weird as a bear ball but once you
throw a lamp shade over it no one can
tell the difference coming in at number
three the Insteon LED bulb not cheap at
30 dollars involved but this one is
built to last
rated at 52,000 hours of use double of
what the competition is saying this bulb
will probably keep burning long after
you're dead even better it includes
built-in automation so you can schedule
it to turn on or off or control it all
with an app it's more than a light bulb
it's a way to screw with your roommates
eye number two the cree 60 watt
replacement LED hard not to love this
bulb not only is it extremely energy
efficient and produces exceptional color
but it's the only bulb here that backs
it all up with a 10 year warranty the
cost $13 and because it's Energy Star
certified you probably can chase down a
rebate that will bring the price closer
to $5
the total winner that said if you're
going to commit to a light bulb for a
few decades why not go deluxe our number
one choice for LED replacement light
bulbs goes to be connected by TCP
wireless LED lighting kit 110 dollars
gets you a three bulb kit that connects
to your home Wi-Fi for all kinds of
nifty automation we also get a handy
little remote control if you don't feel
like fiddling with an app to activate
some mood lighting the bulbs are sturdy
bright and smart three things your
current bulbs aren't so there you go
five LED light bulbs that will make your
home more beautiful save you money and
probably save a few polar bears for more
