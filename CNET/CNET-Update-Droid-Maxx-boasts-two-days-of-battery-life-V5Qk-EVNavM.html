Bridget Carey and this is your CNN
update Verizon unveiled a new suite of
droid phones the top model is the droid
maxx followed by the droid ultra and the
droid mini and they all arrived August
twentieth these are upgrades to the
droid razr line of phones but the name
razor is being dropped the droid maxx
has a max price $300 with a new two-year
contract it has a tough gorilla glass
screen and a battery that's supposed to
last two full days the processor is also
a serious upgrade compared to the RAZR
MAXX HD as for the droid ultra it's the
thinnest droid ever and will sell for
two hundred dollars with the contract
and the mini is smallest in size and
price a 4.3 inch screen for a hundred
dollars with contract all three droids
will have some touchless controls you
can make a phone call or search for
directions without touching the screen
which can be handy for drivers the
droids also have wireless charging and a
bunch of other little software gimmicks
like being able to launch the camera by
twisting your wrist expect to see
similar software perks in the Moto X
which will be unveiled next week hip-hop
pioneer Russell Simmons is launching a
music label for talent discovered on
YouTube he's working with Universal
Music Group to launch this label called
all deaf music and that's in connection
with a new network on youtube called all
def digital as co-founder of Def Jam
Records Simmons discovered artists like
LL Cool J the Beastie Boys and run DMC
today YouTube is where many aspiring
artists hope to be discovered the
challenge is cutting through the noise
to get noticed and pretty much everyone
goes to YouTube to find and share music
so is a natural fit to blend a music
label with emerging YouTube stars the
team of all deaf music will combine
their old-school music industry
experience with new technology that can
analyze data on video traffic Microsoft
is pushing people to subscribe to office
365 so if you were thinking about
getting the yearly subscription there is
a perk spend a hundred dollars on the
annual office subscription and you get a
year of xbox live gold
for free which is worth sixty dollars
the promotion only lasts until September
28th Facebook is finding new ways to
push out advertisements and now is
testing ads in your notifications menu
so if you're someone who plays candy
crush or other mobile games that are
linked to facebook you could see ads for
more games to play right next to the
notifications about your photo tags and
comments yeah let's hope that this is
just a test that your tech news update
