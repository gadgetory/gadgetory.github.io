bakalar it's the 404 show there's just a
new home for dinner throw me off and I'm
Justin you yes you want like you already
said and this is the show where it's
rude to point it is I don't care how old
you are rude to point speaking of
pointing just enough were you someplace
that you should have told us about over
the weekend what are you yeah where are
you or were you I was I was at Fort
Tilden have you been there before it's a
beach nope never been to beach right on
the tip of Brooklyn kind of right by
Coney Island ok I'm off Flatbush at
what's so special about this point and
it's beef I'll get to it if you'd let me
uh anyway so the weird part about this
Beach is that it's mostly families but
then there's a separate part of the
beach um kind of by dead horse Bay where
it's nude right yeah nude beaches are
pretty common in San Francisco so I'm
used to this kind of thing but we but we
parked by the part of the nude beach
right yeah yeah it's weird because the
new beach is kind of separated by a
fishing like a lot of fishermen go to
this part of the beach as well like
appear so it's like oh yeah it's like a
weird dichotomy of like fishermen on the
pier and then also naked dudes for some
reason it's not a lot of naked chicks
like there were some topless women you
know right but a lot of naked dudes fuel
and then some naked fishermen to just
like a combination of both worlds yeah
make send this guy already have the rod
right this is what I'm talking about
gems yeah gems gems Peterson over here
uh that's so funny that at one point it
sort of just you know a nomination to
the naked the nude naked fishermen I
don't know why you forced me to tell you
this story I just I'm kick you know I'm
curious about nude beaches because I
find it fascinating that some people
regardless of how they look naked right
and they're there within their right to
do so at a nude beach when I was in
Dominican Republic a couple months ago
there was a lot of that did you go need
nope did not you know it's never the
people that you want to see you know
I've shown all their bodies I saw a few
in the dr that I was very happy with it
was very happy with I was like yeah tip
them did you go nude I did not go nude
know how those too self-conscious I
don't want you drive your friends no no
we just kind of walked by the new people
and gawked for a little bit behind us
angle oh like seven year old yeah
exactly giggled giggled I'd imagine that
you saw a bunch of new people this
weekend though I did I went to the gay
pride parade here in New York hmm it was
interesting there was a lot of
interesting costumes and lack of
costumes yeah what are you going as
nothing oh we're just walking naked down
know there's there's not any like
complete nudity but there's like skimpy
speedos and there's like topless ladies
with like pasties over their rivals yeah
once again we are an anti pasty show
that's right all Pacey's must die it's
just it doesn't make sense to me you're
leaving nothing to the imagination with
pasties on I mean it's a it's a
pointless accessory as far as I'm
concerned were there any dudes or women
in fake police costumes like in Reno 911
yeah I saw a lot of that Michael Reno
911 what is it called you 911 sorry no
sorry sorry is my mistake it's just that
was very nice Strange Days innocent
mistake it isn't mr. um Reno 911 that's
good is that our next one that is just
great I'd imagine be pretty confusing to
walk up to the wrong cop at the bribery
yeah well you can usually tell because
it's usually like a leather Cop suit he
had a legitimate emergency them and the
handcuffs are furry yeah yeah uh what if
you had a you go up to a real police
officer yeah how'd you do right what
kind of question is that no I'm saying
what if you had a real emergency but you
went up to the wrong cop that would bode
the embarrass money and bed at the same
time yeah one of those one of those
things so it was a good time it's good
yeah yeah I walked in the parade oh you
didn't see a lot yeah so you only got to
see one
of it yeah can you tell us about the
craziest thing you saw at pride I don't
know well I don't know oh there while I
was telling you before there was this a
float with a just a pull and like pull
dancers yeah topless women pole dancer
what that was going anything you have
with pasties right damn it wasn't even
there in a mad well that's cool you got
ya walking in this yeah so the gay pride
parade isn't just for gay men it's for
straight men it's very it's for
everybody I think it's a celebration of
human sexuality yes what is it right
absolutely and that's what matters and
everyone gets laid no I don't know is
that how it works I don't know I got a
ticket for that you had your hand
stamped I was walking in the parade with
the group of gay Mormons I was exciting
that is how now how many are were people
are in your group there there there were
like 40 people in our group there were
we had a group from DC come up and join
us you nerd so that we merging with
Jenny Wow mmm how many Mormon people are
in the country do you know I thought I
could have sworn I heard millions a few
million yeah a few million yeah
interesting i was i think in the whole
world there's like 13 or 14 million wha
really yeah are there more Jews or
Mormons I don't know this is there I
think Jews might have him by like a
small boy they're mormon the mormon
church is growing fast growing by leaps
and bounds and i was watching something
this morning that would talked about how
like Mormonism is uh infiltrating every
facet of of of pop culture it is yeah
you know you got your book of mormon you
got your mitt romney's and all the sort
of stuff right it's interesting yeah
yeah the book mormon on broadway have
you seen it I have it's it's great I
loved it you loved it's actually yeah
cuz it's kind of like the story of my
life no kind of yeah you you had a very
fun elated yeah I exactly it's
exaggerated of course it's it's like
because it's about missionaries throw to
a foreign country yeah to do their
mission and you did that I did that
where'd you go I went to Nicaragua Rilla
so with it were they grateful for your
services they were they were okay and it
was yeah I was an overall good
experience I'm sure that's interesting
I'd we're learning a lot about actually
today know all about the most I socks on
this show ever ever since I've been here
it's true Jim Peterson he's jealous as
well yes Jim's volume baggage and my
father before Jim's let's get into the
stories of the day on this tuesday jun
26 facebook in the news again scumbag
facebook strikes again yep apparently if
you go into your profile and i did this
this morning and this did affect me
facebook has change your default email
address to your facebook email address
right you know the thing you've never
used before in your entire life nor
would you ever apparently if you go in
and check it out so what I did was I I
eliminated that and then I went and made
my gmail one my default one yeah not
only that it also by default or at least
in my experience yep put the Facebook
address on my timeline as well
automatically makes it visible and even
if you didn't have that privacy setting
turned on before so we give the finger
to facebook yep and we say hey man get
out of my life give you enough
information enough trends enough things
to sell me let's maybe not change my
email address you know what so I mean
because I'm an advocate of the devil I
wait that doesn't make because I'm gonna
play devil's advocate I understand why
Facebook did this right horse it's
because they want they're trying to
capitalize on lazy people that don't
want to have to memorize another email
address so they know that you could just
use that handle that everyone shows like
an April or something of this year
remember that like two months ago they
asked everyone to create their own
vanity URL for facebook I did that years
ago that they're using years ago right
they're using that as your email address
anyone can use like what's yours oh do i
maybe i shouldn'ta mine is just you're
just publicly available though it's like
the one in ages yeah what do you mean
whitepages yeah what do you mean
whitepages what because your face that's
offensive
I know but I understand why they did
this but as usual they should have let
opal know they were gonna change right
of course which again for the you know X
amount of times stop doing this top
changings up and not telling anybody
yeah everything they do their privacy
settings is always very confusing and
deliberately confusing at times just
become as transparent as you would want
everyone else to be yeah um was gonna
say oh I think I don't agree with you I
don't think the reason they're doing
this is the cash in on lazy people okay
I don't think no one because of laziness
switches email addresses you know I mean
ok but what do you think they did it
that way I think they're doing it
because I think some of it has to do
with that but it also has to do with the
fact that that's the one thing Facebook
has no grasp on nobody uses Facebook
email if someone told you told you to
email them at you know my name it at
facebook.com/ you'd be like what the
hell is wrong with you right it's like
the equivalent of an AOL address it's
weird it's it's crazy right so that's
the one thing they have no influence on
whatsoever and everything they've done
leading up to this has not made their
service more pervasive in terms of
emails so why not do something sort of
slimy like this right I don't know but
that's what happened and so we encourage
everyone check out your YouTube YouTube
your facebook profile and see if it got
changed on you it's pretty easy to just
change its simple takes five secs
implied it it's just annoying that you
do you go there and you look and you're
like what the hell yeah i didn't do that
mm-hmm it's annoying yes annoying oh I'm
doing the transition okay speaking of
annoying uh where am I gonna go with
this uh which store do you want to talk
about next you're not very good at this
justin no I want to Oh so yesterday we
talked about newsroom the new show on
HBO with Jeff Daniels yeah courage to
everybody to go and check it out well
guess what you can now watch it for free
on YouTube on HBO's youtube channel
right you can watch the entire full
pilot of the newsroom I'm curious to
hear what people have to
does it have to say about it you can
also watch it well okay so this is cool
because HBO's never issued a free pilot
online before not tonight as much as we
wanted them to do it for Game of Thrones
and stuff yeah it's going to be offered
on HBO youtube like you said dailymotion
tv.com on demand platforms like Hulu and
iTunes as a podcast I think this is
interesting because they're sort of
using the immediate reaction to the show
when I premiered on Sunday right I don't
know if this was always in their in
their game plan all along and how long
do you think they're gonna be continuing
to post these I just think it's just a
pilot I just think it's going to be the
first episode right um and you know
obviously it's um it's the first episode
was really good I thought oh you did say
yes you like it I did I really liked it
I saw my favorite scene was the one
where the beginning the beginning where
the the student asks Jeff Daniels
character why America's the greatest
country in the world and just goes off
in like a very uh likes or Kenyan
fashion oh yeah all these crazy
statistics about how United States has
the lowest one literacy rate it's a what
doesn't the lowest ones alone would
silly the only thing I find silly about
watching an Aaron Sorkin show is that
everyone is at the same level of
intelligence in the program there's no
like slackers there's no guys who don't
get it at first everyone is at this same
equivalent you know level of
sophistication and it makes it that you
know you just you just you just feel
like you it's a science fiction world
where nobody you know there's no varying
intelligence is those dummies there's no
dummies even the intern smart yeah even
the intern was like brilliant yeah you
know she's like 20 whatever it is you
know I really like about this show is
that it's set in the real world but in
the recent past break like 2010 right
and so I don't want you to give anything
away and what everyone can watch this
for free now so go out go out and watch
it but point is that it basically takes
a different spin on history that just
happened yeah like the BP oil spill for
example right like exactly the thing the
first shows about yeah yeah what that's
it's not a spoiler i was just like stop
okay gets about this is a stern american
there's other things that the first
episode is about right it's really good
uh Millie I the first comment on the
story is who the f cares about this
progressive propaganda BS show who said
that in the jabber now in the first
comment on the geek Oh system Oh No
likes though yeah I would imagine a lot
of stupid people are not gonna like this
program um let's move along to the next
story in our lovely run down today a
little history lesson remember
everyone's favorite mp3 player winamp it
was seriously my favorite it took me a
long time to finally transition over to
iTunes yeah I I really hung on to that
thing as long as I could the skinning
the plug in the visualizes and I'm
running if you could pull three off
you're gonna be wheless is great my
favorite feature on winamp 3 which was
obviously the best version of it was
twas uh Jay so if you just hit the j
bois right it would bring up a search
query that lets you type in any part of
the song artist duration whatever you
want it and it would bring up your son i
don't think that itunes has something
like that i mean you have to most
certainly do what is the shortcut for it
though uh you have a better just click
on the search you could survive or its
Apple I think it's Apple alt f but don't
you have to be in the music tab of the
left sidebar oh you can be clicked into
playlists and then it will search your
entire library and I think so dude
that's what I'm talking about though is
that Winnipeg winamp is also a very
specific had very specific functionality
not just designed to play music right
let's back it up here back it up let's
go back let's go back to nineteen ninety
seven when when amp was created and ARS
technica put up a really excellent very
thorough history of winamp did you know
that when amp is a acronym know what
does it stand for uh windows advanced
multimedia products okay so that's a
part acronym yeah so it was created by
the company knoll
oft right it was one of the most famous
of products that the company put out
remember that do you remember what the
mascot was the llama the llama the llama
had a name though mike ma my mic the
llama right how kind of a llamas name
Michael this one aim name the lame name
Richard yes pop quiz hotshot do you know
what the motto of winamp was remember
this motto yeah little NSFW but i'll let
you say um I don't remember it was rid
off in a voice like this Jeff tell me I
win it i'm gonna it really kicks the
llama's ass ding ding there you go that
is right where's that come from though I
don't know come true a wesley willis
song who wesley willis what you remember
that artist was like a homeless guy that
made a bunch of crazy music yeah that
guy I don't remember he was pretty big
in the pop culture and like it anyway so
he wesley willis was his independent
recording artist and he was kind of
homeless i think he had schizophrenia
and he has this song called whip the
llamas ass and that's where they took it
from that's cool anyway so it was
released to the world on April 21st 1997
and the reason why I took off so quickly
is because prior to winamp coming out
there was really no way to organize your
digital music right it was wit there was
windows media player which was poured
yeah as real player which was worse it
hit it the perfect time it was right
when mp3s became so popular naps on
Napster was huge and it just it was a
great player that you know it sounded
great it had an equalizer this is like
one of the first ones that made it easy
to use yup arm it was customizable is
cuz it's a huge huge part of it they
think that might have been the first
sort of mainstream introduction of
skinning and customization but they open
source the designs of anyone create
their own skin which was great yeah I
remember I tried to do it oh really I'm
not an artist I was terrible which one
did you make the one that looks like a
chalkboard yeah something stupid
terrible terrible what I really liked
about winamp was that it got out of the
way really easily yeah so you could dock
it into a corner
infinitely resizable into thin line at
that J function we talk about is easy to
drag and drops always on till a list
always on top only one playlist yeah but
you could save them right as a PLU file
which is really cool and that was
something that didn't exist before
winamp um also I didn't realize this
before but even for its time when app
the program was really small
sufficiently small as a super small like
the mac version today I forget which
version they're up to but the mac
version is only four point two megabytes
large great that's compared to iTunes
like over a hundred mega tunes is
becoming such a behemoth yeah it's like
the Titanic you know it's there was a
time when you could run itunes on your
computer and just keep it open right now
it's like a liability you know like geez
stop hogging all the resources yea big
you know ever it's better at switch if
you're sharing a playlist with other
horrible iTunes is a beast they need to
come out with itunes light I'm serious I
great very very you know trim sort of
streamlined version of itunes I would
love that right how they're doing
anymore who knows the hell they're doing
anymore well um so that leads us to this
part of the history lesson their
downfall so um winamp went from about 15
million in 1999 2000 watt 15 million
users in 1999 to 60 million users in
2001 so that was its heyday but then it
got bought out by AOL in 1999 you're
yawning no really just yawning anymore
just yonder just wanted information geez
okay let's speed this up um this is when
they got bought out by AOL they
converted they started working at a
abandoned sweatshop office in potrero
hill in San Francisco and that's when it
all started going downhill and that's
for two reasons one they didn't have a
music subscription service and that was
around the time when everyone started
wanting to pay for mp3s um well that was
the thing because everyone was using
their illegally downloaded mp3s with
this right it came you know after all
will nap sure is gone how am I getting
all those music I have a place to play
up I don't have a place to buy it right
exactly and then the other big
was that when a wall acquired them they
started requiring users to sign with
their AOL accounts in order to subscribe
to the billing service for their arm for
yes for their music subscription program
right and the problem there was that all
the winamp users and you can attest to
this were digital music files right so
like people these are like hackers and
people that loved skinning stuff sure
tinkerers right and that doesn't really
align well with the AOL structure those
a Wells members are Luddites basically
right I like people i just want like the
easiest way to get onto the internet to
opposite side types of you yeah so that
was a little bit of a misalignment that
combined with the original ipad coming
out 2001 on ipod uh coming on 2001
really killed spill disaster yeah and
then when m5 came out and it was bigger
they lost that simple touch and that's
eventually how whenever I and kicked the
llamas ass no more the llama kicked its
ass in the final battle and it's still
available though yeah you can still get
it and you can probably get the good
ones too the old ones that were you know
the versions three and four whatever
right those are great see ya you won't
take a nap before we continue just going
to say that was a great little book
report you did on and when and little
history I like that we should like do
that little a little you know profiling
yes thing to do this fun okay chalkboard
we'll take a break when we come back
more 404 so stick around we'll take a
little nap this is the 404 mr f'ers the
show where we all sing song
you
Ivan Anthony's on San Francisco thank
you looking to the 404 where you won't
care of lemma I would've got a limit no
you won't get him I wouldn't have got a
little I don't know if he had even heard
the original advertised just mocking you
yeah I think he was just doing an
impression of me maybe he looked up the
video after now the video doesn't exist
online a chance because I wanted to show
you what the original is like pretty
funny we're talking about would you call
those local local access uh regional
cable commercials right but jingles like
really catchy no longer at aluminum got
a lemon you knew it you don't know just
reply me was singing the other day well
you won't get a lemon I won't have got
11 from toyota of orange it's pretty
good it's pretty funny guys think of any
from your local hometown you Tom
must have had some crazy cackles I
thought I thought of 1 i'm not sure how
local it is it was from hardees did you
guys have hearties yeah I know what
Hardy's it's like a fast food place but
there was what because they had like
their kids meal was called a silly sac
new nickname for mitch is so stupid
really yeah I'll take three silly sacks
yeah but their song was it's a hearty
silly sexy really sack really makes kids
feel happy like that don't be silly it's
just a sack it's a hearty silly sac but
uh gems you that's why you're on the
fire right now gems oh man gems McGee
over here Oh silly sac 90 goodbye my
eyes wow Marty's silly yeah you guys do
have silly side no I didn't have a heart
there I don't think there are any heart
is on the east coast i don't think so i
think they were bought out by Carl's jr.
ok I know Carl's jr. there's no car
Junior on these cosita no no we just got
sonic that was a big deal yeah yeah
Sonic's terrible you ever had that oh I
I had sonic in vegas and even it was
good I kiram the only fast food I will
settle for is Taco Bell mmm is that
stuff is just magic you're crazy that's
a whole separate conversation no it's
look Carl's jr. is great back in the box
is incredible del taco on top of the
taco yeah talk I read there was there's
some other taco franchise out west
called taco time ooh the other thing
taco time in life and they're slow yes
that's where I had at that outdoor mall
enough salt lake city yeah the Gateway
yeah um it their slogan so it's taco
time and their slogan is isn't it always
isn't it always time I think so pretty
underhanded throw that sucks how can you
say that about fast food chains I just
like the other good ones I'd only
favored wendy's I mean I just don't like
it okay it's you know I and I know if
you just like having a burger and fries
isn't the worst thing you could possibly
do yeah just don't like it though okay
you know I don't really like there's
something about taco bell though and I
haven't had it in years just something
about it that used to really do
something to me probably on a chemical
basis yeah yeah yeah but did you say
whatever it did to me made me smile not
like in Manhattan like the fast food
here really sucks like the the main ones
yeah McDonald's Burger King right it's
just low quality well I mean you get
what your pain ya know like seems like
when I go home to visit my family and I
go to you fast food I just better better
yeah it's clear that you yeah here you
have to worry about crazy people coming
in throwing french fries at yeah I guess
if that's you know one of your main pet
peeve homeless people or something wrong
yeah before we hit voicemails and calls
from the public I want to talk about
something in the news today orbitz the
travel agency website came out this
morning that they are in fact leading
mac users towards more expensive prices
meaning if you use a mac and you go on
orbitz.com
your excuse me results will be brought
more expensive results will be fed to
you before the cheaper alternatives well
you're not getting they're not charging
you more but they're leading you towards
a more expensive product the reason
they're doing this is because their
research has shown that people who own
mac computers spend more on vacation so
and it's kind of not I don't blame them
right I would I think this is smart and
they should be doing it just sucks that
it just came out because now the cats
out of the bag they were they were
basically saying that bolt because
Windows Mac users are willing to pay
twenty to thirty dollars a night more on
hotels and PC users we're going to
deliberately feed them more expensive
options like the four and five-star
hotels um it's smart it's very smart and
and they're no different than Apple
apples convince an entire generation of
people that they need more than they do
for computing I think they're making
people by three thousand dollar Facebook
machines and what's the problem if
money's no object have them spent a
little more on the orbits thing I think
a lot of its psychological too but it's
not like they're hiding the cheaper
hotel offers no they're not all charging
mat customers more hundred percent
that's that's why they're able to do
this and get away with it and they
should continue to do I'm serious as a
Mac user yourself you endorse this PR I
endorse it i mean if you can't
understand that you can you know filter
your search returned by uh price right
and you deserve to get ripped off guess
so but i don't know if that's a direct
correlation between people that spend
more on computers vers it's a gel it's a
general he is a general app it's it's
just like a general sort of statement
that they put into practice it's no
different than google serving you uh ads
based on what your gmail contains yeah
you know but don't you think it's
possible that maybe if someone spent
less on a pc yeah cuter they would have
more money to spend on a vacation that
means that's silly there's a lot of
different factors that go right either
way i'm sure they did this for a reason
and they continue to do it for a reason
maybe was working out over a long enough
period of time you get enough people the
psychology of it all will start to pay
off you know I mean yeah
it's a shady though don't you think very
shady what I mean come on it's it's just
the way business works there's plenty of
shady crap going on like we just talked
about with Facebook and the email thing
there's also too many companies name
orbits by the way there's two and
they're spelled differently there's
three as far as I'm concerned okay
what's four bits the travel
recommendation at the end yeah there's
orbits the gum right its orbit then
there's orbit that weird drink with all
the like speckles in it do you know I'm
talking about there's a like a sound
like a Snapple orbit trust me maybe you
remember these look bring him up pick
him up where it is orbits with a Z the
drink with balls in it is that their
motto yeah I know um yeah I never seen
that very cool I think they're popular
in mid-2000 I didn't really it was like
a very futuristic drink to be having
right um what are the balls in it just
the same stuff in a lava lamps I think
guaranteed to give me just cancer oh
yeah I don't I don't I didn't realize
they were spelled the same way as the
travel site yeah it's funny isn't orbit
drink those balls mmm I don't know what
was their second the drink of balls in
it yeah orbits there's balls in it balls
equal better flavor balls okay I'm
serious you could you know so but you
understand where I'm coming from when I
say that the Mac purchasing mentality
yes so it buys one of those new MacBook
Pros with the retina display right they
probably have more money and uses it to
like you know check their email and go
on facebook yeah they should probably
pay a thousand bucks more on their next
vacation also because they can because
they can't okay you know and there you
know seemingly silly let's get two calls
from the public that I'm to show the
love 86
for Xena yesterday we're talking about
people who had never signed up for
facebook and we got a bunch of calls but
people who in fact themselves had never
signed up so here's why hey for four
guys it's will from Atlanta just calling
in about the facebook argument I guess
I'm not on Facebook and I am just
completely against ever signing up maybe
it's my punk mentality I don't know it's
a little too cool so I just can't be a
part of it i don't know but really what
it comes down to is I just never signed
up and when my 60 year old uncle was
calling me what you're not on Facebook
you need to be on facebook I didn't at
that point I'm like now no way in hell
you want to see pictures of my kid go
follow my wife there's no way no way I
just I really don't want psycho ex
girlfriends finding me because they will
and I just I'm a little more private you
like you know my I guess my perspective
here so yeah talk to you later bye
alright that i do man I do none of the
people I know who are not on Facebook
have that explanation yeah that was the
first good one I've ever heard I'm
trying to think about if my life has
been enriched significantly by the
existence of facebook do you think you
would something bad would have happened
to you had you not had a face no count
no yeah my life is neither building
anything nor yours it worse yeah yeah
exactly it's just enough to keep your
profile alive yeah yeah I don't know
what it is I don't love it you know it's
a way to kill boredom yeah that's really
all it is but it's only this is lacking
of that on the internet there's plenty
of sites and you don't have to share
every single detail in every photo of
your life yeah like some people do yeah
naughty private if you want to for sure
you can be totally private and totally
closed off which is fine alright one
more call about this Chicago from Eric
there's one's counting on your facebook
discussion yesterday oh one of those
guys it doesn't have Facebook and I do
the same thing that we used to do before
Facebook whenever I need know something
get a call or text or my good friends
having a baby i found out before
everybody on facebook was simply a text
so you know I think you guys are way
over eighteen the facebook crap I'm to
tell you how many canvassing people just
send they're glued to each other and
moving craft and bunch of that crap all
right this is gonna duvall van to get
off my lawn I feel like um so he's not
wrong though um there's nothing wrong
with you know actually calling somebody
but there's also time when people used
to say what are you not writing letters
for and stuff like that right um yeah I
don't know everyone's got their own
prerogative i guess going on their
prerogative what do you think um I'm
look i mean i use facebook for very
minimal tasks during the day but there's
something there's no news that I've
missed out on because i have not been on
facebook all day long right yeah uh I'm
telling you the one the one thing that's
sorry started to really nag me I guess
is my mom being office okay well your
mom is on Facebook cut room she hasn't
added me yet cuz i don't know we don't
care love my life's doing I don't know
what she doesn't face but I know she's
hearing this now and I'm sorry I'm just
I'm being totally honest yeah so you
know like she'll chill call me and
she'll say did you see that on facebook
and I'm just like your mom has every
right as you to be on facebook why
should she be I'm not cheating friends I
am NOT saying that what are you putting
words in my mouth I'm not saying that
she doesn't deserve to be on facebook

loose women make it a period joke Jeff
really is so mature yeah we have not out
of the room also I'll say that Fifty
Shades of Grey is not a good book I'm
not recommending it to anybody in terms
of reading and writing quality is just
from its Jack Barrymore it's like a 12th
grade reading level first of all don't
knock
don't knock book because of their
reading level why not because that's
silly yeah you can be a great writer no
not great right out of level beyond you
know I had a 12th grader but this wasn't
a 12th way to their wrote the book I'm
just saying you're blaming the book
because is it what you said because it's
a 12th grade am on that's not fair I why
not because the giver was what like
fifth grade maybe they'll know book
sounds like the author had a thesaurus
next to her maybe they did the word for
good another word for going to use nice
three thousand times yeah alright so
it's another word for throbbing member
is that like the giver for example is
technically children's book writer Lois
Lowry wrote that I think I like a 12 13
year old I don't know what the reading
level is I just a lollipop yeah it's
like a young adult book great it's great
and does it read like you should be 4 12
year olds this one does I'm noticing
ready player one I'm I went back in like
read a couple parts yeah sort of feels
like it like maybe the writing isn't
spectacular wait you ups are you read
parts of what I went back and read some
parts of ready player one oh yeah ernest
cline but it's still a great book and i
definitely recommend it but it's not at
i'm sure it's a better i'm sure it's
written better than 50 she's grave yeah
