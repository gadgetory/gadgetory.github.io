buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
fun with high level math at press
conferences good old-fashioned mob style
evil for Microsoft and Spotify for real
but first it's the gadget of the week
the gadget of the week is the HP
touchpad which I personally predicted
could be a dark horse to run away with
the tablet market thanks to the user
friendly webOS interface the little
cards and HP's good industrial design
well turns out it's still kind of a dark
horse reviews have been lukewarm our own
Donald Bell probably put it best
actually he said it was a great
competitor to the original iPad but now
it's a little big heavy and kind of
greasy and it needs more and better apps
letdown HP webos boss jon rubinstein
sent out an internal memo urging staff
not to be discouraged by the negative
reviews and saying basically it's a
marathon not a sprint plus you said
over-the-air updates are coming soon to
address its issues all that is good I
got to say a hundred dollar price cut
probably wouldn't hurt either I want to
believe and now for the news facebook
held a press event this week to announce
something awesome and here it is a short
tutorial on the meaning of exponential
growth and we've seen this trend for the
last really since the site began where
I'm if you plot it out the amount of
stuff that people are sharing it's
growing at this exponential rate you
know one of our investors always tells
me that humans are really bad at
understanding exponential growth so you
don't tend to look at them like this
because they just go off the chart too
quickly so you tend to look at them in
what we call log normalized graph right
so that way if you look at the y axis
here it's on it's skewed right so it's
not going out the way nearly this is
kind of how people tend to look at these
exponential graphs to plot out how
progress is being made over time oh okay
after regaling us with normalized graphs
and whatnot
facebook CEO mark zuckerberg got to the
awesome part no not integration with
Spotify or an iPad app or the rumored
project Spartan mobile development
initiative that will bring iOS to its
knees nope it was group chat and video
chat using skypes technology nano that
was it but look at the demo all I have
to do is good call and right now we
negotiate the call connections between
the two machines you see the video
window getting ready and launching on
good and then we connect right through
to Jerry wherever he is right now we see
a self image of ourselves and then his
video loads so that I can see him how
are the launch numbers looking Jerry
they're looking really good we've
already launched some millions of users
awesome so thanks a lot guys I know you
guys are working hard I just wanted to
call it how to fill great great awesome
thanks guys yep awesome facebook you
keep saying that word awesome I don't
think it means what you think it means
now don't get me wrong group chat and
video chat are perfectly useful features
that would have made for a perfectly
nice blog post maybe not a press
conference and it might not have been
such a letdown if it weren't for the
other big buzz of the week google+
invite started trickling out last week
and to hear the tech press tell it
google+ is the new prom king baby the
new social network lets you drag and
drop friends into your own special
circles like friends or acquaintances or
work friends and you can make your own
circles and then decide who you want to
post to and you can do public or private
posts so it's like a combination of
Twitter and Facebook and it integrates
with your gmail and your Android and
it's so new and shiny plus it's hangout
feature lets you do group video chat
with up to nine people even using your
phone so yeah facebook you might want to
scamper on back to the awesome lab and
get to work because you got competition
oh and by the way Facebook is blocking
all attempts to import your facebook
contacts
to Google+ whether it's Chrome
extensions or workarounds all of it you
can try facebook you can try speaking of
the wrong way to win Microsoft is
reportedly demanding that Samsung pay
licensing fees of fifteen dollars for
every Android smartphone it sells
fifteen dollars per phone now Microsoft
has used copyright infringement threats
to get licensing fees from HTC and some
smaller android phone makers and it's
currently battling with motorola and
barnes a noble over their android
devices microsoft also reportedly hinted
that it might take less licensing money
from samsung in exchange for a
partnership where Samsung makes more
windows phone phones so that's evil also
microsoft announced a partnership with
chinese search engine giant Baidu and it
will use Bing to deliver all the totally
censored english-language web searches
in China so that's a morally
questionable land grab yes yes compared
to Google which actually left China
rather than sensor at search results
Google's having a pretty good week PR
Weis but don't worry I'm sure they'll
scare the bejesus out of us soon and
finally Spotify everyone's favorite
music service that they've never used is
coming to the US officially I know is
that the last of the tech unicorns it
might be Spotify has signed its last
American label deal and it's headed here
sometime soon for a price we don't yet
know and with features that have yet to
be announced I guess that unicorns not
totally dead yet this is getting kind of
twisted all right that's the buzz report
for this week everyone I'm Mollywood and
thank you for watching
fifteen dollars for every Android
smartphone it sells yeah man out what up
man out when I'm and I went out when I'm
gonna thank you err yes manamana is like
the ultimate virus well that's awesome
all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
