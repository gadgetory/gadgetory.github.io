I'm Bridget Carey this is your cnet
update even robot cars have to deal with
the police sometimes Google's
self-driving car was pulled over by a
police officer for driving too slow but
the humans inside didn't get a ticket
just a warning it happened not too far
from Google's Mountain View California
offices this little white pod was
driving 24 miles an hour in a 35 mile
per hour zone and it was pulled over
when the officer saw it was causing a
traffic backup it is lawful to go slower
25 in a 35 zone and Google won't let the
car go faster than 25 miles an hour for
safety reasons but instead of causing
drama on the roads some self-driving
cars are taking the test to fake city
streets Ford is the first car maker to
test its autonomous vehicles at a
testing facility called em City it's 32
acres of land with roads traffic lights
and fake stores all around it's located
at the University of Michigan's North
Campus research complex Ford like other
car makers have been testing
self-driving cars in the real world but
a campus like this let's engineers
really refine the small stuff by
repeating specific tests exactly the
same in controlled environments Ford is
putting in 1 million dollars toward the
EM City and you know what M city has
that you can't get with testing in
California harsh winter weather yeah
that'll be the hardest test yet well
back to other things Google is working
on the tech giant is trying to make
email more secure for everyone if you
have gmail and someone sends you an
email over an unencrypted connection
you'll get a warning that it could be
risky to open the message these warnings
will start in the coming months the hope
is that this is going to encourage more
email providers to use proper encryption
security which prevents snooping from
attackers and yes even government
agencies that are trying to tap into
messages as they travel to you and for
those of you that prefer the
disappearing messages of snapchat the
app just launched something called a
lens store you can pay 99 cents for a
funky photo filter and keep it forever
snapchat started filters recently
press on your face when you're taking a
selfie and you can choose from seven
free ones they put floating things
around you or change your environment
everyone loved the puking rainbow
snapchat will always have some for free
but they maybe just for a limited time
so if you want to keep the one you like
forever you'll have to spend a buck in
the lens door to keep it snapchat says
these lens filters are used in 10
million snaps a day meanwhile Facebook
continues to try to copy the success of
snapchat the network is experimenting
with messages that self-destruct after a
set time but the tests are just in
France right now that's it for this tech
news update and there's more at cnet com
