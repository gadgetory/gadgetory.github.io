is the let's see two big thunder bone
storage device now let's say be known as
a complete who put a fashion and odor
into in a tech device and this two big
device here is no exception
take a look at this route blue thing
right here isn't it mesmerizing now you
want to touch it or push on it
you actually can the only purpose of the
ball right here is to show that the
device is plug in and Power on what you
can play with is actually all in the
back of the device on the back here at
unified to dry Bay they are locked in
but it can open them with a coins now in
case you spend your last Quang on your
solar fix
let's see include this plastic key for
for you to do the job it should when
open you can see the tray can be slide
out easily and you can use a screwdriver
to change the harddrive here the hard
drive the two hard drive here can be set
up in either red one or red zero
configuration in the middle of to drive
base here you will fight two thunderbolt
port one of them is to connect the
device to a computer that have
Thunderbolt port and the other port is
to connect another Thunderbolt to it up
to five of them can be connected
together in a daisy chain setup now the
two big Thunderbolt come with a lot of
thing that you don't need for example is
two part power adapter here come with
enough power head for you to use
anywhere in the world or maybe even more
first of all this one for the state it's
important it keeps to keep it this one
here is for Asia and this one here it
probably for somewhere else I don't know
and this crazy looking thing is probably
for Mars won't go there now you will
find these two this is a tiny tool for
you to use when you want to actually
open the dryest base and the base is
happen to be detachable and you can use
this one to open it if you want to now
unfortunately the let's see also doesn't
come with something you actually really
need that is the Thunderbolt cable which
you will have to buy for another 50
dollars
now in my testing this dry actually
perform really well it's not the fastest
Thunderball stores ever seen but it is
by far so much faster than any other
external hard drive that's due on bay
now price why this thing is also pretty
friendly costing around signal $50 for
the 4 terabyte or $800 for the sick tara
by it's in no way affordable but is
actually much cheaper than other
Thunderball based storage devices I've
seen and if you think that is still too
expensive
hey there's a blue bond for you to play
with I love it
once again my name is dongho and this
has been the first look at the lossy two
Big Thunder ball storage device
