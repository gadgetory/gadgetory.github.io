another mobile rather to show you the
Verizon jetpack my 5 or 6 20 L now
before you go just chill out because
this one is actually very different if
the first one I have a scene that come
with a second batteries meaning that it
gives you another 9 or 10 hours come by
the two you have about almost 2 day
worth of work on just the batteries as a
mobile router the MiFi here allows you
to access Internet on-the-go which means
you can work wherever you are at home at
a cafe in a library or in my case in my
car and in fact I did had a great time
driving around the entire Bay Area
testing the device at a great time for
two reason number one I was able to
access the Internet at a very high 4G
speed virtually everywhere in the Bay
Area and secondly it was sunny outside
and it was by the ocean thinking of my
coworker being locked in here if you
don't believe me could ask any of my
three ladies friend with me at the time
but don't tell my boss on topic it has a
tiny screen that shows a lot of
information the battery gauge the
connected clients the signal strength to
the internet and so on you can also use
the navigation button to access even
more information on top here there's a
power button you can press once to turn
it on a wake it up or press and hold for
a few seconds to turn the device off now
here there is a microUSB port for
charging and connecting the router to
the computer and over here there's a
port for an extended antenna on the
bottom here in fact the battery bay
cover on which you can see the default
network information this is what you
need to get up and running with the
router there are two covers to
accommodate two batteries one of them is
thicker than the other as you can see
here underneath the battery unify the
SIM card slot in the US the router work
with Verizon's 4G and 3G network but
when you travel internationally you can
also swap out this car
to make the router work with the local
service despite the small side this
router come with many feature one of
which is the ability to share the GPS
over Wi-Fi meanings as Wi-Fi clients can
use the routers GPS signal for its own
positioning services despite the two
batteries the MiFi actually not too
expensive costing chests around $50 if
you are willing to sign up for a
two-year contract now if you're not
you're going to cost $260 the only
downside of the device is the fact that
it comes with two pretty expensive data
service that's cost fifty and eighty
dollars per month for a five gigabyte
and 10 gigabyte of data cap after that
is to pay another $10 for each
additional gigabyte once again my name
is dongho and this has been the first
look at the Verizon jet pack my five
four six twenty more buy hotspot route</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
