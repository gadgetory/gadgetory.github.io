how to contributor and today we're going
to take a look at how Siri dictation
works on the new iPad so during the
initial device setup you'll notice
there's a new screen at it and that is
requesting whether or not you want to
enable or disable dictation if you've
set it up and just picked a random
option later on you change your mind
either you want to turn dictation on or
you don't like the extra key on the
keyboard or you never use it and you
want to turn it off it's as easy as
going into the settings app and then
you'll tap on general keyboard and then
down here at the bottom you'll see an
option for dictation you could turn it
off just by toggling the switch you'll
need to confirm that you want to turn it
off if you want to turn it on you'll
need to confirm that you want to enable
it so once it's enabled what you would
do to use it is anywhere you're going to
input text any field that's going to
pull up the keyboard you're going to
notice an extra key down here at the
bottom it has a microphone on it and
what you'll do to start dictating to
Siri or your new iPad is going to tap on
that key hi comma Siri how are you ?
then you tap on it again to stop so
you'll have the blinking dots waiting a
few seconds while it thinks and then
once it comes up with the response
hopefully we get a response there we are
i comma Siri how are you ? exactly what
I asked it to to place in the text field
for me once again this is how to use
Siri on the new iPad make sure visit us
at how to cnet com
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
