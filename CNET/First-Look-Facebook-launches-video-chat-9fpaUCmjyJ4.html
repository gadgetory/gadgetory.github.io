Facebook is doubling down on its
person-to-person communication tools it
starts with the way you see other online
Facebook users everyone using a computer
with a large or a wide screen will
notice that Facebook has taken the list
of who's online and moved it to a side
park reinforcing the fact that Facebook
is a place to connect with friends in
real time not only does a side bar make
Facebook feel more alive but there's a
bit more you can do with your friends
who are online with you in particular
video chat Facebook has partnered with
Skype and you can start a
person-to-person video call from within
a Facebook web page you do need to
install a small executable on your PC or
Mac but the key point is that you don't
need a client app this all works within
the browser it's fast and easy to get a
video call going even if in early
testing we did have some audio sync
problems but if you want to do video
chatting with friends or relatives who
aren't on skype or a more technical
service like Google Facebook video is
just a great solution it is the easiest
online video system to use and it also
has the most users there are over 750
million people on Facebook there are a
few issues though first there's no
integration with Skype even though the
technology comes from a Skype deal Skype
users cannot connect to people on
Facebook nor the other way this will be
added later and could make Facebook and
Skype together the most important
real-time communications network on the
planet but it's not here yet
second video conversations are
person-to-person only those of you
waiting to see how Facebook will trump
Google's new multi person video hangout
feature in Google Plus keep waiting
Facebook video is like Google Talk the
person-to-person video feature not it's
cool new hangout if you want to do video
with a bunch of people all at once
stick to Google and third there's no
mobile access for the video feature it's
another feature that's on the roadmap
but at the moment mobile buddies can't
play along Facebook also just added a
group chat feature so you can huddle
with a bunch of your friends at the same
time in a real-time conversation other
instant message platforms have had group
chat for a while but again when you
build a feature into Facebook all of a
sudden everyone is on it at once the
group chat feature is easy to use
you just click the tool icon and a
person-to-person chat to add additional
people and Facebook will then open up a
new multi-party chat window it can get a
little hard to manage multiple chat
conversations and Facebook at once
though and with the multi-party chat
that might become an issue for heavy
users these new chat features are here
now and they're here for everybody
Facebook isn't rolling them out in dribs
and drabs like that other service all
Facebook users with cameras that is can
now do video calling and everyone can
participate in the group chats for CNET
I'm ready</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
