this isn't a new platform that's kind of
the point we're simply giving TV the
same level of attention as phones and
tablets have traditionally enjoyed we
want you to be able to leverage your
existing skills and investment in
Android and extend them to TV there's
now one android sdk for all form factors
so today i'm going to use the android TV
app on my phone and the best way to
understand android TV is to just see it
in action so what you're about to see is
hot off the press and really just an
early look at the TV support that we're
adding to the de L Developer Preview so
in L we added what we call the TV input
framework to Android so it enables
android-based TVs to handle video from
sources such as hdmi TV tuners and IPTV
receivers and the UI provides a unified
view of your channels in a familiar
channel hopping you I the channel
information on the top now if you want
to do something different just like
every other Android device you press
home and you'll notice that home
overlays on top of the content so i can
keep watching while eyebrows but unlike
phones and tablets where the behaviors
more task-based we designed home to be a
super simple Leanback experience because
TVs unlike computers or mobile devices
they're primarily entertainment
interfaces users don't expect or want
complexity from their TV as I scroll
down you get immediate access to
applications ordered by how often you
use them scroll down again you get
access to your apps also ordered by
usage order now if I scroll back up to
the content recommendations you can see
this is a quick way for me to watch
content the recommendation system is
completely open any app can publish to
it and it's ranked according to your
usage patterns so for example i'm
currently binge watching Game of Thrones
I'm actually I will automatically be
presented with a recommendation for the
next episode like so when Android TV we
decided to build a course search
functionality directly into the
experience powered by voice so for
example I can just simply say Breaking
Bad Google interpret the results get me
a result for the popular TV show now
with one click I can then watch you to
google play movies and TV or any other
service that have installed if I scroll
down you'll see information on cast
members scroll down again I get related
search terms also YouTube clips at the
bottom now I can also pivot on cast
members so for example I can click on
Anna Gunn I'll get that nice material
transition I'll get information on the
actress scroll down I can get movies and
TV shows that you start in even YouTube
clips of interviews with the actress now
the power of google comes into its own
for more abstract queries so for example
i can just say oscar-nominated movies
from 2002 google will interpret that
query the course get me all my
oscar-nominated movies
and so from here of course one click I
think I can watch it now search course
is backed by Google's knowledge graph so
I can also ask a question so for example
I could say something like who played
Katniss and the hunger games and of
course the answer is Jennifer Lawrence
played Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger
Game developing for TV means creating a
10-foot user experience so called
because that's typically how far you're
standing from or sitting from the screen
in l we've expanded the platform to
support a Leanback experience with new
frame or classes that help you to
quickly and easily build fluid cinematic
10-foot user experiences what Android TV
we enable you to take your games to the
biggest screen in your house and the
games are getting really good so for
example let me fire up one of my
favorites which is Leo's fortune with
this game pad this is a really good fun
game it's kind of typical of a modern
android game it's got great gameplay
he's got great graphics fast and fluid I
also like it because our eligio X
designers name is Leo he's not quite as
could leave this guy but I can
definitely see Matt a handlebar mustache
anyway so another advantage of Android
TV is you can tap into google play games
to share our achievements and
leaderboards with friends you can even
play multiplayer games with your friends
playing for penny device so for example
I can launch NBA jam which is a really
great game and play multiplayer game
with my friend Alan here on the sofa
let's try it at all so he's playing on
his tablet I've got my game controller
it's brother this so we have a bet on
the first person to score is me okay
first one to two okay let's go so the
first one person to do has to buy the
other person beard tonight let's go Oh
hopefully I can actually score I'm from
Ireland so i don't really understand
this game android TV enables us to bring
Google cast to more TVs so for example
imagine Alan's visiting my house and he
wants to share his new favorite John
with me he could just fire a play music
on his phone or tablet and cast it
directly to my TV the store will open
officially in the fall with the launch
of L packed with some of the best
content available today for Android
tailored of course for TV so that's a
quick overview of Android TV
