is not actually there in fact the car in
the shot never even showed up on the set
the acting was all done by this rig the
mill Blackbird and was transformed live
right onto the viewfinder of the camera
using a video game engine the blackboard
has been around for about a year but
until recently all the visual effects
had to be added in after the fact which
required hours of rendering and editing
now all the magic happens in real time
epics Unreal Engine the same used in
many video games paints the Camaro onto
the Blackbird rig allowing the director
to see what the car will look like in
the environment just by looking through
the lens or tablet the rest is done by
the Blackbird the frame is customized to
mimic the camaros driving motion and
simultaneously collect data about its
environment to make the final render
look real down to the last shadow just
switch out the wheels or extend the
frame and the mill blackbirds body
morphs into any vehicle at the push of a
button and because it's electric the
suspension twerk and even the
acceleration can all be modified to
match the carb choice whether it's a
sleek sports car or midsize SUV then
it's off to tear up the pavement with a
single driver at the wheel the Blackbird
has a 360-degree camera set up on a
stabilizer and a lidar laser tracking
system to capture lighting and terrain
details which will then be projected
onto the CGI overlay of whatever car it
becomes this means car manufacturers
don't need the finished version of the
latest car in order to shoot a
commercial and they don't risk
competitors catching a glimpse of it
before it launches once the footage has
been captured the visual effects team
can easily tweak or alter the virtual
body and interior this also means you
can reuse the same footage for newer
models as they are released the
Blackbird is already in use so next time
you see a shiny car on screen just
remember you may not be looking at the
real thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
