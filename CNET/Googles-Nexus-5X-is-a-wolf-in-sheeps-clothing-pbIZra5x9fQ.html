anything special it's a plastic phone
and it feels cheap rough edges shallow
buttons I can even hear something rattle
inside when I shake it why would you
possibly want this phone because for 379
dollars it is cheap and yet it feels
nearly as powerful as Samsung's latest
galaxies
it all starts around the back of the
phone right under your index finger tip
that's where the new Nexus fingerprint
sensor lives one touch and you're ready
for action no need to hit the power
button no need to shift my grip on other
phones the fingerprint sensor can
sometimes feel like a bit of a stretch
there is a new use for the Nexus power
button though you can press it twice to
launch the camera even if the phone's
asleep and gosh is this new twelve point
three megapixel Nexus 5x rear camera so
much better than the ones on previous
Google phones I've gotten great pictures
even in low-light it's the same camera
you'll find on the more expensive Nexus
6p right down to the laser autofocus
system what really makes this phone feel
fast though is clean pure Android there
are no unwanted apps or services bogging
down the nexuses speedy hexa core
snapdragon 808 processor and two
gigabytes of RAM only the new Android
marshmallow operating system just don't
expect a lot of great new Android
features I'm a big fan of the new
vertical app tray and I like telling my
apps which permissions they can use but
I wouldn't buy a phone just to get
marshmallow in those features the
biggest new feature now on tap
supposedly lets you Google anything you
see on your screen without interrupting
your flow but it takes longer than I'd
like to bring up too few results I'm
also not a huge fan of the new USB
type-c charging port you'll find on the
bottom edge it charges fast and you can
plug it in upside down but it won't work
with any of the micro USB chargers you
probably have lying around this is also
not the phone to pick for watching
movies with a friend
the 5.2 inch 1080p screen is pretty
crisp but the single speaker yes just
one sounds pretty awful to me
I'm mostly a fan of the Nexus 5x it's
fast cheap lightweight and works on any
u.s. cellular carrier you can even use
it with project Phi Google's own service
that combines multiple networks to give
you more reception in more places I just
wish the Nexus 5x looked and felt a
little better in my hand the original
Nexus 5 which came out two years ago was
cheaper than this phone and it felt
better with a silky smooth soft touch
rear cover and a nice design surely the
new Nexus is a far faster phone but why
should we sacrifice comfort and style
I'm Sean Hollister for CNET and you can
read more about the Nexus 5x in my full
review you'll find it at cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
