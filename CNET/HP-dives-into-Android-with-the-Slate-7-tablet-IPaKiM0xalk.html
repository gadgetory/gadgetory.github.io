at mobile world congress 2013 taking a
look at the HP slate7 so this is the
first android tablet that HP has ever
made and as you can see it's going very
very much for the nexus 7 style of slate
so it's got a 7-inch screen that has a
1024 x 600 pixel resolution it's it's
reasonably thin and it feels quite light
around the back you can see it's got
this matte grey effect and the Beats
Audio logo just down here inside there's
a dual-core arm a9 processor which is
blocks to at 1.6 gigahertz it feels
quite smooth swiping around I have
another chance to run some benchmarks
but preliminarily my first impressions
are that it feels quite smooth around
the back this camera has a 3 megapixel
sensor and there is a front facing
camera as well which is going to come in
handy if you want to make video calls
it's running on Android version 4.1
which is jelly bean but it's not the
very latest version of jelly bean don't
worry though because HP told me it does
have plans to update to version 4.2 in
the near future those who know their way
around Google's operating system will
realize that this is very very close to
the stock version of Android that you'd
get on devices like the Nexus 4 or the
Nexus 7 so what is different well HP has
put some of its own audio software on
board that is Beats Audio of course the
same partnership that it has with its
laptops and what that basically means is
if I go into settings you can see
there's a beats audio option here and
you can tweak these options and that
will modulate the sound probably making
it a little bit basio giving it a little
bit of extra punch now this tablet is
very very cheap it's going to cost 169
dollars or 149 euros when it comes out
in March is coming out in the US first
and yeah that's going to be in March so
it's very very cheap this cheaper than
the nexus 7 I would say the screen
possibly isn't as luxurious as Google's
option but there is of course that
trade-off because you're getting a
cheaper device
so first impressions are this isn't the
most powerful jaw-dropping luxurious
tablet ever but it is extremely cheap so
it could turn out to be a really good
value on the west road to cnet's and
this is the HP slate7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
