includes a great camera for taking
detailed photographs but what about
getting those photos you take on the
iPad backed up to your computer like you
would with any other digital camera well
you have a few options the coolest
option is to use Apple's free iCloud
service to automatically transfer your
photos back to your computer over the
Internet
Apple calls this particular feature
photo stream and it works well once you
jump through a few hoops I'll walk you
through the process from both a Mac and
a PC on a Mac you need to be running OS
10 point 7 or later and have the latest
software versions of iPhoto or aperture
from managing your imported photos go
into your system preferences from the
Apple menu and select iCloud log in with
your Apple ID if you're not already this
is the same login and password you use
for iTunes or the App Store
make sure photo stream is switched on
then close the window for the next step
I'm going to switch back over to my iPad
and make sure the iCloud and photo
stream are enabled go with the settings
I cloud and make sure a photo stream is
turned on next I'm going back to my
computer to launch my photo management
software in this case iPhoto
you'll see an icon here on the left for
Photo Stream click it and you'll be
prompted to turn Photo Stream on
assuming that both your iPad on your
computer are connected to the Internet
you should see photos trickle over from
your iPad and onto your computer and now
that this connection has been made any
new photos you take with the iPad will
be automatically uploaded to the cloud
over Wi-Fi and download it back to your
home computer for safekeeping to pull
off the same trick on a PC you'll need
to be running Windows Vista or later and
a download of apples free iCloud control
panel software install the software and
sign them with your Apple ID an able
photo stream and you see options on the
right here to set the preferred folder
for your iPad photo downloads then hit
apply you should see your iPad photos
show up almost immediately as long as
the computers online now if you find
that photo stream missed some of your
photos or if you want to transfer video
or if you just want another option you
can always break out the iPads included
USB cable and sync the old-fashioned way
when you plug the iPad into your
computer it should work just like
plugging in a digital camera and
automatically launch your photo
management software on a Mac that's
probably iPhoto for Windows it could be
any number of things but you can also
just open up the connected iPads folder
like an external drive and copy your
images over to any folder you choose so
those are the best strategies for
transferring images from an iPad back to
your computer and guess what it works
the same way if you're using iCloud on
your iPhone 2 for a more in-depth
rundown along with links to third-party
apps and backup services that may be a
