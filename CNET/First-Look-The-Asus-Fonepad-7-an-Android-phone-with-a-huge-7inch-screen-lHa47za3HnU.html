well as Zeus may have the perfect
compromise I'm Andrew Hoyle for cnet and
this is the Zeus fonepad 7 an Android
phone with a whopping a 7 inch screen so
we saw the first fonepad only in
February and it hasn't really changed
that much since then it's still
absolutely enormous but it has a plastic
rather than a metal back the 7-inch
Green still has the same 1280 by 800
pixel resolution now that is still the
same as before which is a shame we would
like to see a full HD screen on
something of this size it has 3g
connectivity meaning that it does
function exactly as any other phone
would of course being so big you will
look completely ridiculous holding it to
your head asus has given it a bit of a
power boost though it's still running on
an atom chip this one's clocked at 1.6
gigahertz rather than the one point two
gigahertz of the previous model how much
difference that actually makes remains
to be seen when we give it the full
review treatment it turned on Android
4.2 point to jellybean but asus has also
thrown in quite a lot of its own
software in apps to as it hasn't yet
said exactly how much risk models going
to cuss but that it will be comparable
to the existing model so given that this
one has a plastic back and hasn't had a
screen resolution increase I would hope
it to be a little bit cheaper we'll find
out more when it goes on sale towards
the end of the year I'm Andrew Foyle for
cnet and this is it is Zeus fonepad 7
