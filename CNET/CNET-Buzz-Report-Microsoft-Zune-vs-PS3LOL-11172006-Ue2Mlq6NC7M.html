report and now for the gadget of the
week the gadget of the week is the
Samsung Black Jack it's a new 3g phone
from singular that is looking to take
down the Motorola Q nice slick sexy
black design QWERTY keyboard high-speed
data bright little screen 1.3 megapixel
camera plus catchy name it's so it's
almost like addictive I just can't stop
using that phone I mean I can I can quit
any time I want except that no I can't I
can't hit me hit me and now for the news
the Microsoft Zune came out this week
and you know this thing got terrible
press before it came out and apparently
there was almost no interest in it
whatsoever once it actually hit the
shelves but you know I think the Zune is
getting a raw deal I mean I compared it
to this iPod here and I think it
actually looks pretty good it has this
nice big screen way bigger than this the
sizes are actually fairly similar and
this is 30 whole gigabytes this iPod is
only 5 color screen black and white
screen plus the Zune has way cooler
features like radio and it's also got
this built-in um what is this what this
is a new iPod oh they have new iPods now
Oh somebody should really tell Microsoft
about this actually let's give the Zune
a fair shake after all it is kind of a
cool gadget at least hardware wise I
mean that big screen is great for
watching videos it's got a really nice
interface good sound built-in Wi-Fi plus
it's not too expensive at around $250
but
on the other hand you've got the
PlayStation 3 now this has been delayed
for ages and there are so few going into
production now that most stores are only
going to get a handful of them so most
people won't even be able to get one the
high-end version costs a whopping $600
and their early reports that it has
trouble playing some older PlayStation
games like Grand Theft Auto 4 and of
course it's tied to the blu-ray DVD
format that could end up losing the
format war leaving you stuck with
totally obsolete and overpriced TV to
you someday but the ps3 totally lets you
kill people thank you the Russian space
agency says that it's 20 million dollar
space tourism program is overbooked
until at least 2009 therefore the space
agency has issued the following
statement anyone willing to give up
their seat will be placed on the next
available flight and you'll receive a 20
million dollar voucher for anywhere the
Russian space agency flies plus 3 free
drink tickets which are actually only
good for tang apparently Microsoft is
offering a prank screensaver that mimics
the all-too-familiar blue screen of
death but antivirus company McAfee has
blocked the screen saver as a virus
because they do not think it's funny and
they say the screen saver is only meant
to scare people
Oh McAfee you little joke police you you
just don't get it it's funny because
it's true
I'm Hollywood and this has been the buzz
report thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
