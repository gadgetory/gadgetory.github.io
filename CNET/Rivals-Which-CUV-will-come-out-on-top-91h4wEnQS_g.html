bring together the best of the best to
find out which machine you should take
home today it's small SUVs and we have
three the latest entrance into this
increasingly competitive market from
Jeep
the chunky renegade from Mazda the
rather more curvaceous cx3 and from
Honda it's the brand-new HRV
we'll start with HRV which you can think
of as a slightly less compact version of
one of our favorite compact cars the
Honda Fit it's a little bit taller a
little bit more room inside has
available all-wheel drive yet still
manages 35 miles per gallon on the
highway it's possibly the most
family-friendly choice of the three but
it's also probably the most boring as
configured our HRV starts at a
reasonable twenty six thousand seven
hundred and twenty dollars this is the
2016 Jeep renegade and as an added bonus
this is a trail rated version baby you
know what it lacks in cargo space it
certainly does make up for in off-road
prowess I've got twenty nine miles per
gallon epa-estimated on the highway and
an MSRP of thirty one thousand four
hundred and forty dollars little pricey
the third car in our roundup is the 2016
Mazda cx-3
this is like a beaker version of the
Mazda 3 and it's got plenty of Mazda
zum-zum spirit plus some surprising
driver assistance features this
front-wheel drive model gets 35 miles
per gallon on the highway and our ABS
tested price is twenty eight thousand
three hundred forty dollars
you start with age before beauty and
we're inside the Jeep renegade which is
the oldest of the three but that's not
saying much since it's only been on the
market since last year as Emmy mentioned
it's the most expensive car but it's
also the most powerful with 180
horsepower on top and 175 pound feet of
stump pullin trailer towing torque
actually you can only TOA bout a 2,000
pound trailer that's more than the other
two who aren't ready to tow anything at
all it's also the heaviest of the bunch
weighing in at three thousand four
hundred and ninety pounds that's thanks
to the complex 4x4 system underneath go
for the two wheel drive version and
you'll shave some four hundred pounds
off of that mark but you also get a
smaller motor to go along with it in
terms of driving dynamics well this is
not a road optimized machine this is a
Jeep after all and it feels like you're
driving a Jeep it's over sprung over
dampened and honestly kind of bouncing
most of the time something that I think
will come into its own when Emmy takes
it offroad but this is the only one of
the three that gives you that SUV
driving perspective you're sitting up
high you're looking over the world and
all the smaller cars around you in fact
if this car feels like a much bigger car
than it actually is
by the way did you know that Jeep has
been making cars since 1941 I didn't
either but thankfully they stamped it
right peer on the center of the
dashboard just in case you need to see
that every time you drive the car maybe
it's a Jeep thing
I don't get it next up is the new HRV
which has actually been on the market in
Japan for a couple of years now where
it's called the vessel why the name
changed well Honda obviously wants me to
think of this as being closely related
to its big brother the CRV actually it's
much closer to the fit but that's a good
thing the car weighs 3,100 pounds in all
wheel drive trim as we have hearings
powered by a 141 horsepower motor but go
with the front wheel drive trim and you
can shave some 200 pounds off of that
figure now if you're looking to tow a
jet ski or miniature pony or the like
you should know that Honda doesn't
recommend towing anything with this car
and that's despite having a 1,500 pound
tow rating in Japan overall the HRV is a
comfortable drive if not a particularly
invigorating drive the 141 horsepower
offers decent performance and the grind
is comfortable but it's not really a
great corner carver behind it means the
car has a continuously variable
transmission or a CVT which enthusiasts
love to hate but this one's actually
reasonably responsive it's not going to
invigorate your life behind a means but
it does do a good job of getting power
to ground and it does give you great
fuel economy which is pretty important
in this segment finally is this 40
looking Mazda cx-3 which actually
delivers on that look it's the lightest
of the bunch at 2,800 pounds but
remember this is the only car with
front-wheel drive go with the all-wheel
drive model and you're looking at two
thousand nine hundred and fifty pounds
which is still pretty light compared to
the competition the motor puts down to
146 horsepower and while Mazda again
does not rate this car for towing in the
US in Europe it's rated for a massive
2,600 pounds which would have actually
been class-leading except again you're
not supposed to anything with it here in
the US as soon as you sit in this car
you realize that this is far and away
the sport is to the bunch their seats
actually have bolsters which actually
work the steering wheel actually feels
direct and while it's not especially
powerful again 146 horse powers not a
lot it does get up and go with more
aplomb than any of the other eight
corners better it does have a little bit
of roll in the corners but you can
actually
genuinely good time in this car much
more so than either of the other two of
course in addition to driving your car
from point A to point Z you're also
probably gonna have to haul some stuff
stuff like laundry baskets or bicycles
or babies right people haul babies run
against the middle of the bunch
I've got eighteen point five cubic feet
of space behind the sieve but don't
think that that's going to be enough for
a bicycle so let's take this guy out
let's see how we are with monger baskets
let's see I can't double stack my
laundry basket so I can get two laundry
baskets back there all right car seats
car seats car seats ah let's see can get
this guy in here like that all right
that fits well skip this booster seat oh
my god ours why are these so heavy they
don't even have kids in them this guy
sits in the middle I don't know
quickmail fit three two all the way
through I don't know you guys the second
row seat I'm not sure we're gonna get
all three wait wait get in there kid
oh my gosh so two laundry baskets three
car seats nobody
now the Mazda is definitely the smallest
of the bunch I've only had ten point one
cubic feet of space back here in our
Grand Touring model although that gets a
little bit bigger for the other trim
lines but I'm not even going to try the
bike I know it's not going to work but
laundry baskets looks like as one
trademark laundry basket rating of one
all right now for the car seat let's see
all right we got to get three these
babies across it's hot
calling babies is hot hurry
oh my gosh shoot one there and big guy
because I really have to get back to the
gym oh geez
and there's two I'm not sure about this
third one this might be pushing it God
how come these weigh so much
yeah I mean safety third and all but
that doesn't look right so I think we
can definitely only get two baby feeds
across the back now if you do want to
refold those verses down you get forty
two point three cubic feet of space
which will give you an F for probably
full of laundry baskets but yeah it's a
small Hey I gotta get in better shape
but the true winner is the Honda HRV
I've got 23.2 cubic feet of space behind
these seats it's not quite enough for
the bike but it's definitely going to be
enough for a trademark laundry basket
rating let's see a4 wait for it wait for
it there we go
trademark laundry basket rating a4 but
let's see what happens with the cursor
number 1 I'm getting so good at this
it's like I had kids myself which is
hilarious to anyone who knows hmm this
guy tax car seat this kid's got two
cupholders well I'm not two cupholders
in my car and the last one there we go
oh three car seats trademark laundry
basket reading a four but there is
another thing that makes this car even
better when it comes to utilities so
here's what makes a Honda HRV so special
two words for you magic seat baby
alright anyway so I just flip this guy
up push that down and look I've got room
to haul things that are four feet tall
for navigation and in-cabin electronics
picking a winner from these three cars
is tough all the navigation systems show
plan and perspective view maps they all
use traffic data for dynamic routing
guidance the Jeep and the Honda used
touch screens while the Mazda has a dial
controller on the console none of these
cars support apple carplay or Android
auto yet and that would give them an
edge this renegade comes with a compact
version of deeps UConnect system that
shows on the 6.5 inch touchscreen now I
really like the full-size you can access
them on other Jeep models but this one's
kind of cluttered it's a little harder
to find my way around the interface at
first blush the Honda HRV is a nav
system looks really good there's these
touch controls on the bezel they only
light up when you need them and these
menu icons slide into place that looks
really cool but when you get into the
sub menus you kind of lose the aesthetic
appeal doesn't look quite as good now
for connected features I've got Pandora
and AHA apps integrated with the system
those have to be running off a connected
smartphone my winning pick in this
category is the Mazda cx-3 here I've got
simple controls on the console but let
me control everything on the seven-inch
screen from the simple home screen I can
get music phone and navigation really
easily and guess what this is actually a
touchscreen too so if I can't figure out
these controls I can just choose what I
want right here as with all the
navigation systems here the cx-3 shows
really nice maps I get 3d rendered
buildings in the city and out of the
country here I got nice topographical
features but this is the most a little
bit better because when I'm browsing
around it moves just a little more
smoothly than the other systems for
connected features I have aha Pandora
and stitcher apps integrated with the
car those would have to be running on my
phone to work but what really puts the
cx-3 over the top is its driver
assistance features all the cars in this
test have a backup camera and some sort
of blind spot monitoring system but the
cx-3
takes it further by having a head-up
display and adaptive cruise control
those add safety and comfort on the
highway and that makes the cx-3 the
winner in the electronics category
and now my favorite part of the test
that's right it's the off-road part now
I want to make a little bit of a
distinction between all-wheel drive and
four-wheel drive I mean we could go on
forever about this but suffice it to say
that all-wheel Drive is best for
inclement weather and four-wheel-drive
is best for inclement terrain like this
giant hill here behind me that we are
going to take all three cars up
now this is the front-wheel drive cx-3
you can't get an all-wheel drive and
that's pretty engaging on the pavement
but this is only got 6.10
inches of ground clearance so we're not
going anywhere I can't even get past the
first bump yeah I would say you don't
want to take this baby on anything else
besides a graded dirt road and now I got
to try to back this up now the HRV fares
a little bit better in that it has six
points seven inches of ground clearance
and it's got all-wheel tires but they're
rated for mud and snow but it's still
just an all-wheel drive car there's no
low range there's nothing the all-wheel
drive system is definitely going to do
what it wants to do not necessarily what
you want it to do but it's going this a
lot better than I thought it was going
to just going as slow as I am there we
go
that's as far as we're gonna get that
was a good eight feet of the hill
honestly you know if you had to get
through some soft sand probably dropping
your tire pressures and keeping the Rebs
high we'd get you through it but don't
get cocky
all right Jeep renegade Tom now this is
the trail rated version I have got skid
plates on my transfer case transmission
and on my fuel cell I've got five
different off-road modes here Auto snow
sand mud and rock I have put this baby
in to stand and look at that she is
crawling up like it ain't no thing now
if I wanted to put this into the low
gear I could have come on girl come on
girl come on girl
there you go on I could have a twenty to
one a low gear ratio but I really don't
think I need that
whoo oh man there is nothing like going
off-road I just love it so much
oh no come on girl come on girl
yes hahaha that's my baby how you doing
honestly all you got to do is let the
car do the work for you right you want
to go as slow as possible and as fast as
necessary
all right I see a spot up here where I
can turn around because another great
thing that the renegade has is hill
descent control so let me get this baby
turned around I'm gonna go down hill
right and I've got hill descent control
so I'm going to put it in for low and
press hill descent control hill descent
is on and now I'm gonna take my foot off
the brake and all I'm gonna do is steer
I have to tell you it's a little
nerve-racking look at that I am this it
might not seem like it's super steep you
guys but it's pretty steep hahahahahaha
it goes pretty good if you're going up
on your mountain roads to your cabin I
think you're going to be pretty
satisfied
you've seen how they test Flint let's
talk about the results Emmy I think we
got a clear winner for the off-road
portion oh my gosh of course I mean the
renegade its trail rated I've got 22 one
crawl ratio
I've got skid plates on the bottom this
thing is going to get you wherever you
need to go within reason how about the
interior technology well for the nav
systems and stuff like that you know
it's a pretty tough choice I'll have
connected features I'm really good nav
systems but I went with the cx-3
ultimately because it also has a driver
assistance systems it's got adaptive
cruise control and a head-up display and
you just don't really find that in this
segment then these cars quite match that
so cx-3 for electronics and in terms of
driving dynamics the Jeep has the most
power but it really doesn't feel that
way on the road all of us were fighting
over the keys for the cx-3 that's the
most fun on the road for sure the HRV is
fine it's comfortable it's not really
that dynamic it kind of lacks
personality I would by and large
absolutely the cx-3 is the most fun but
we still got to pick a winner here yeah
that's a tough one to slice up because
each of these cars has their strengths
you know I mean I would personally go
with the CH 3 because I like the looks
of it I like the driving character but
maybe the end of the day for the segment
practicality any which would you take
down yeah I mean I always pick my cards
based on personality and the Jeep
renegade has it in spades so I really do
love that but again I do see the value
in the HRT yeah and I think in terms of
driving dynamics again which would be
something that I would be looking for
would be to see X 3 but ultimately if
you're talking practicality and if
you're talking about cost and economy to
the hunt is pretty hard to beat so I
think we got to go with the practical
choice right yeah I mean I got it I like
the cx-3 a great driving character but
calling it an SUV it's got it's so small
it's so tiny there's no cargo room and
just you know for this segment
practicality practicality practicality
HRV all right well if you want to go
off-road its the Jeep if you want to
have the most fun on the road it's the
Mazda but overall it's got to be the
Honda HRV
