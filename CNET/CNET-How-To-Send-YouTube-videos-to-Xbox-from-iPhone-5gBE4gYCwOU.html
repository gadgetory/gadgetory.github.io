love YouTube I love YouTube and I could
watch the CNET channel on YouTube all
day long but when I get home what I
really want to do is take my mobile
YouTube experience and put it on my TV
so how do you do that
well YouTube has a feature called send
to TV which does exactly that if you've
never seen it before
Google just added it to their iOS app
but it's been available on Android for
some time now so I'm mentioning that to
save you the trouble of leaving me 50
comments pointing out the fact that's
been on Android I understand
Android had it first but now the rest of
us can play with it how do you make it
all work well here I've got my iPhone
I've got my TV and my xbox but it could
just as well be my Android phone a
tablet and a ps3 or even just an
internet-connected Smart TV that
includes an up-to-date YouTube app
whichever way you're getting YouTube on
your TV get it going
make sure you've installed any updates
and then dive into the YouTube settings
so here we are accounts and settings now
you should see an option here called
pair devices I'm gonna go into that and
now the app here is generating a nine
digit number that I'm going to take and
I'm going to plug it into my phone so
the next step here is to open up the app
on your phone go into settings again and
you're gonna find an option here called
pair YouTube TV now I'm gonna enter that
nine digit number that the Xbox
generated I'm gonna put it into my phone
alright I'm also gonna give it a name
just in case I'm ever lucky enough to
own more than one TV in my house I can
distinguish between which TVs I want to
send the video to alright I'm gonna hit
add and there we go connection complete
so now when I select a video on my phone
here in the YouTube app I'll see a
little TV button at the top when I press
it I select the TV's name from the list
and it'll get started right there yes
Bridget Carey
now I can still use the phone here to
pause or play video and also skip around
I can scrub around on the video to find
the exact place I want to go to and if I
want to get that video back from the TV
and on to my phone I just hit that
little TV icon again and select iPhone
from the list it's right back here and
like I said the same trick works with
Android or really any mobile device that
can access youtube.com slash pair
it's the useful trick and unlike Apple's
AirPlay video streaming you don't have
to have everything on the same home
network to pull this off but you do have
to make sure that the YouTube app is
open on both devices so there you go
that's how to blast your YouTube mobile
content onto the big screen for more
