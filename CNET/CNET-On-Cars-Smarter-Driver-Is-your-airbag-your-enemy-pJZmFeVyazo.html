several g-force sensors or
accelerometers mounted around your car
and when they do deploy it's loud and
violent it's something you want working
absolutely perfectly
so it'll walk that fine line between
saving your life and making things work
a counterfeit airbag could even fool the
experts it'll have the right materials
typically you might have the right logo
stamped on and even the right serial
number but that's where the similarity
to a real one ends and can end
dangerously our partners over at State
Farm tipped us off your investigation
was done recently by the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration
and they are detecting bogus air bags in
the marketplace the basic idea is to
offer one at lower cost that's not a
good trade-off you want to make the
problem well they may not deploy in a
crash or not forcefully enough or they
may deploy too hard and they can even
send metal shrapnel flying around inside
the car
now most insurance companies and any
reputable body shop is not going to
hesitate to pay for and put the genuine
item back on there I mean this is a
critical part it's not like you're
replacing a piece of sheet metal now
even if counterfeit airbags were easy to
spot this one's legit but I don't know I
wouldn't the note if I'd been told how
would you spot one of these the shade
tree mechanic doesn't play around with
these things and for good reason this is
the business end this is where there is
that high explosive propellant that
inflates this thing in that fraction of
a second during a collision you don't
want to be fooling around with this and
crossing wires the wrong way so you
leave this kind of thing to body shops
and reputable repair shops however
here's some tips you can use to make
sure that the history of your vehicle or
its future repairs involve real genuine
airbags for the most part vehicles that
have had an airbag replaced in the past
three years by a repair shop that is not
part of a new car dealership could be at
risk now if you think your car may have
passed through a sketchy repair shop
after a past collision or has an airbag
install that was bought online you're
not helpless go to safercar.gov that
government website will hook you up with
call centers that will let you work with
the car maker to determine if you've got
a legitimate airbag in your car they can
often figure that out by doing a data
read of some of the codes that come off
the data bus in your car bitsa also says
if you bought a car with a salvage or
similar title or if you bought an airbag
on ebay and it was really cheap like
under 400 bucks those are also red flags
now I'll grant you this may sound like a
lot of safety be worry warding over a
part you never see and hopefully we'll
never use but airbags are unique in all
the components of a car with a unique
sort of dangerous edge to them you don't
want one that's working mostly right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
