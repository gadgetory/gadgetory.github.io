your first look at the Samsung Galaxy
Avant for t-mobile now this is a budget
phone in the $200 range and overall it's
pretty good it's got Android 4.4 on here
with Samsung's TouchWiz interface so
that gives it a lot of continuity in the
Android world it also has a quad-core
processor that's 1.2 gigahertz from
Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 if you care
about these things and LTE so all this
makes for a pretty robust experience
however there are two disappointments
with this phone the first one is the
screen it's got a smaller 4.5 inch
display but the real problem is that the
resolution is lower and it shows and it
also isn't using Samsung's usual AMOLED
technology it's using a TFT display so
all this means is that the phone is
noticeably duller and images look a
little bit grainy err so that's kind of
a bummer also the camera there's a five
megapixel camera on the back with flash
VGA front-facing camera you're not gonna
get much out of that Samsung's five
megapixel cameras are usually pretty
good this one unfortunately just
couldn't cut it
it was slow to focus never really seemed
to focus really completely I got a lot
of greeny images out of it they weren't
as good as they should have been
otherwise the phone does perform pretty
well and on its own it's nothing that
I'd really get excited about but it's a
totally adequate phone especially in
this price range especially if you're a
t-mobile customer one other thing I will
mention is that there's this material on
the backing it's not quite soft touch
it's matte it doesn't pick up any
fingerprints it feels a little bit more
like naugahyde rather than you know the
usual kind of material and I really like
that I thought it felt good really
maneuverable sized but again the screen
and the camera are low points for this
phone I'm Jessica Dahl court 4c net you
