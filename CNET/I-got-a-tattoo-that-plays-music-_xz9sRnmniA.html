an audio engineer of a bunch of
waveforms that are meaningful to me in
my life my career songs I like
recordings I made that kind of thing
this is this mosaic of commemoration of
my job skin motion is this app I found
that essentially is kind of a dream come
true for me um couple months ago I
stumbled upon this on reddit or
something and it just seemed like the
perfect idea because what it does is it
turns the tattoo itself into a kind of
QR code and it doesn't link to anything
it plays the audio back in real time for
you I'm gonna go ahead and submit to get
a sound wave tattoo my name is nate
Sigurd and i invented the sound wave
tattoo and founded skin motion to bring
tattoos to life using augmented reality
I wanted to do something that had like a
significant impact on people's lives and
express themselves our users are
recording their stories and sharing
their tattoos now on social media
sharing their stories is actually like
part of the empowerment process or like
part of them telling their story about
why why they got their Soundwave tattoo
and what it means to them I finally
decided on settling with this song
called 43% burnt by a band called The
Dillinger Escape Plan
this is a small percentage of my my
vinyl collection just what I like to
keep here at work just in case you know
I need therapy
most of my Dillinger collection has been
on CD in the past I got a couple here
with me this is their most recent signal
for called a limerick death that was off
their dissociation farewell record and
contrast to that under the running board
is one of their earliest releases
classics and then this Jim this is the
end-all be-all
this was the debut full-length release
from 1999 we are looking at trekked to
43% burnt and yeah this is this is the
source code for what's going to happen
on my arm I always loved the industrial
art on this this is just one of those
bands like Dillinger Escape Plan was
introduced to me by a close friend who I
ended up starting playing music with
when I was in high school go figure
loner weird music techy kid and we
decided we wanted to start a band he's
like here here's some here's some
influences and I never heard anything
like The Dillinger Escape Plan before
and he played for me like the first song
was 43% burnt from calculating infinity
and I lost my freaking mind I didn't
know music could do that
so just to upload things it doesn't cost
a dime which I thought was really cool
you can kind of plan your tattoo
strategy out one thing to bear in mind
though it does need to be a fairly small
file their limit is 10 megabytes in size
or 30 seconds in length I went ahead and
pre edited the audio file I'm gonna
upload just took the specific section
out of the song I want so I'm just going
to upload a file and then afterwards
when the activation comes into play
that's when I pay for the subscription
which is 40 bucks to initiate then 10
bucks a year to maintain now we've
generated it I can export this to a PDF
and that's what I'm going to take to the
artist and then from there he's going to
turn it into the stencil and it's all in
his hands from there
all right how are you we are in a car
heading up to the Bronx to go visit red
dragon tattoo Joe Meyers he's one of the
very few artists listed on the skin
motion website I was kind of surprised
at how many artists are not I don't know
if the word is qualified yet but not
listed I'm sure that numbers gonna grow
but it was tricky to try to find folks
even here in New York City yeah he's one
of the couple around the tri-state area
and I figured let's just go for it
that's a promising start hi good night
Don I've got an 11 o'clock with Joe I'm
stoked yeah I've been kind of distracted
the last few days and never really been
able to think about it but I got to wake
up this morning and like look at the
stencil again and I've been listening to
the music you know get my mind in the
right place
we're tattooing the smaller the needle
you want hurts so I mean I'm using a
three round liner
the only thing smaller than this is a
single vinyl so yeah they suck I've done
about three of them though so yeah and
they work yeah everyone everyone I've
done they've sent me the final product I
got little videos of them yeah tattoo
artists were kind of like bartenders
with kind of therapist beauty pastori's
all the time and stuff like that it's a
cool way to touch people's lives yeah
this is probably the most detailed one
I've done yeah yeah
[Laughter]
all right so the appointments over Joe
did an awesome job I'm really happy with
the way it turned out and there's like
very little marking to it any kind of
irritation granted it's a tattoo it's a
little tender but I'm pretty happy with
it
to finish the activation I have to take
a picture and it's it's picky you got to
get a decent amount of size and filling
up the screen make sure that it is
centered it's not bent and I'm not
getting shadows in there and I'm gonna
take that I'm gonna go ahead and upload
it to the app on mobile activation is
currently pending I remember actually
being at a show and trying a wallflower
because those pits can get pretty
intense and they hit the downbeat and
the minute my brain receives that I just
took off running the next thing I know
I'm at the front line just bodies flying
everywhere and I'm face to face with
Greg the lead singer and I'm covered in
spitting a little bit of blood
Gregg grabbed me by the collar of my
shirt and lifted me off the ground with
one arm as we sang the bridge together
you can ask any friend I have if that
song comes on during a live set I
disappear and I become part of the body
notes I know it's not appealing to
everybody but I think that's kind of why
this whole tattoo endeavours turning out
so cool because you can make it super
personal
so I got my email activation they said
it's ready so let's go ahead and try out
the moment of truth and they may have it
as really friggin cool I am so stoked
with this the lyric says I smell that
bring me back
bring me a brick there's there's a lot
of room for interpretation with The
Dillinger Escape Plan I know better than
to try to apply my own to it so take
that how you want other fans out there
