Apple's new MacBook Pro line was that it
was much more different than I expected
our first saw during the exclusive
hands-on walkthrough with a new MacBook
Pro several days before Apple's launch
event and it was immediately clear this
wasn't just the same old MacBook
squeezed down into a slightly slimmer
package with an updated CPU nearly every
part of it has been remade for what is
essentially the 10th anniversary edition
of this iconic laptop the headline here
is the touch bar a slim strip of an OLED
display that six above the keyboard it's
just 60 pixels high but it's a tool that
has the potential to be a Swiss Army
knife of laptop input changing itself
on-the-fly to work across different apps
imitating a series of touch buttons
control sliders and even jog dials this
is Apple's answer for the question of
how to do a Mac version of a touchscreen
without actually adding a touchscreen
aside from the touch bar the force touch
trackpad has been blown up to double its
previous size and now dominates the
wrist rest even more than before with
force touch the pan doesn't actually
click down saving space and allowing for
thinner laptop designs the keyboard is a
major departure for the macbook pro it
looks and feels a lot like the very flat
very shallow keyboard in the 12 inch
macbook i like the 12 inch macbook but
putting the same style of keyboard in
the macbook pro is going to be a big
learning curve for some and some people
are just never going to love it the
bodies on these new 13-inch and 15-inch
models available in traditional silver
or now Space Gray are both a few
millimeters thinner than before and each
is a half pound lighter than the
previous versions these are thinner in
part because they only have to fit in
USB C port four of them for power data
accessories video output just remember
to bring all your dongles but don't
worry the headphone jack is still there
for now but you asked what about the
MacBook Air with Retina display I've
always wanted well there's no new air
but there is a compromise
Apple also has a less expensive version
of the 13-inch MacBook Pro it's got the
same updated design keyboard and
trackpad but no touch bar that's about
as close to a retina MacBook
err as you're going to get</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
