and wireless earbuds are now the thing
so we're throwing to bad boys in the
ring it's a prize fly put out between
the Apple earpods and the beats next
let's get it on round one and design
Apple's design is hit or miss depending
on your taste they aren't that bad but
then some of you just look like this now
let's just say they won't win any best
design awards anytime soon
but the biggest miss the air pods are
really only one size they either fits
you or they don't
now the beats X are the first beats that
Apple engineers and designers worked on
it brings a looping wireless design that
still has a wire but rests on the back
of your neck plus you'll get five
additional sizing tips to find the best
fit for you you'll have the remote two
thicker parts near the neck or for
powering up the beats X and the other is
to charge them we're used to seeing
wires connected to headphones but there
might be a little too much wire here for
you especially compared to the air pods
now the beats fit so many different ear
sizes but you got to get those earbuds
deep where the air pods just rest on
yours it's a different feel that will
also sway you one way or the other this
round is really personal and it's
honestly too close to call so we're
calling this a tie round two is
Bluetooth nation
the beats X have the same w1 chip inside
of them as the air pod so syncing is a
snap turn them on the panel pops up and
they sing now with the air pods you
don't even need to press a button just
open up the case and you can pair them
I'll back up Apple when they say it's
like magic and we've never seen better
Blu COO syncing from anyone ever now
doing it completely wireless without
pressing a single button is special and
the air pods take round to next round is
feature after $169 air pods giveth and
oh yeah they take it away with the most
stripped-down headphones you'll find
controls are severely limited you have
the option to either tap one of your air
pods to prompt Siri or pause and play
music in the settings it's one or the
other but you can't have both functions
at the same time everything else you do
will have to be done on your phone from
adjusting the volume to changing tracks
you'll get used to this because you have
to but it's just not convenient to have
to go to your phone all the time now
auto pause just works when you take out
the headphones the music stops pop them
back in and music plays there's also
times where the air pods were loosely in
front of my pocket outside of their case
and it would think they were in my ears
and music would play from my pants so
there would literally be a party in my
pants the beats X bring every controller
used - since the iPhone 3GS from 2009
with its remote can change the volume
from the headphones change tracks back
and forth and it can prompt your voice
assistant all without ever touching your
phone there is no auto pause when you
take out the earbuds but this one's a
no-brainer
beats X for the round 3 win next up is
battery life
air pods get you five hours on their own
but the charging case gives you a full
24 hours of juice for you when it's with
you there's a quick charge of 15 minutes
for three hours of juice but you'll need
to carry the charging case around with
you at all times to get more than five
now beats X gets you eight hours of life
on a single charge and a quick charge of
five minutes that gives you two hours of
juice when they're low there is no
charging case needed at all now the
beats X design makes it so much harder
to lose and you can just throw them
anywhere while the air pods make you a
little anal retentive about always
putting them back in their case or
having their case around otherwise you
might lose them or have no backup charge
really the fact that you need something
additional that forces you to change
your behavior to get decent battery life
or prevent you from losing them is more
of a hassle round four goes to the beats
X the final round is sound falling
what really matters with headphones the
sound and this one's no contest the
beats X have a fuller more powerful
punch with a little extra bass and bump
without being overbearing compared to
the air paws now the air pods sound good
and are well balanced they're easily the
best completely wireless earbuds I've
heard so far but the beats X are still
just that much better round 5 goes to
beats X so let's break this down we tie
the first round and then the gup-x went
on a run taking three of the next four
rounds oh sure you could say the beat X
takes this battle four rounds of two and
is your prize fight winner but
earbuds like this with a different
design functionality and feel make it a
unique one the air pods can look silly
to some but they're good they're really
good the beats X have more functionality
better sound and a better price and on
paper that's a no-brainer
but guess what this always comes down to
you I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching
and we'll catch you guys next time for
another prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
