Sumi das we are trying something a
little bit different today joining me
via Skype is josh lowensohn senior
writer for cnet josh thanks for being
with us my pleasure so Josh you are
among the lucky few who received an
invitation this morning for the upcoming
apple event these invites always have
clues what were the clues this time
there really weren't a lot of clues of
today's apple invite oh the big tagline
was this should brighten everyone's day
and did it brighten your day Josh it did
ray my day in the fact that it came when
we were expecting it they sent it just
after 9am pacific time which is kind of
their normal the big thing to look for
on the invite are just a bunch of polka
dots basically of colors you have
yellows greens blues oranges these are
basically the colors were expecting for
their next iPhone the iPhone 5c along
with the newer high-end model the iphone
5s the 5c that's the low cost model
iphone that we're all expecting to be
announced is that right yeah this is the
one that's probably going to cost about
four hundred dollars that's a lot of
analysts and expected between four and
five hundred dollars unlocked as a frame
of reference the iphone 4 which is now a
3 year old model costs four hundred and
fifty dollars so this is probably going
to be cheaper more affordable and maybe
something that's targeted towards
emerging markets like China and India
where a lot of people just buy their
phone upfront not from their carrier so
no clues about possible iPad
announcements then I'm pretty sure this
is going to be here just for iPhones I
think that a newer iPad or iPads are
going to be expected in a an event in
October or maybe even early November
that's something that's typically kind
of bundled in with other announcements
or at least it was last year when Apple
did it last October so I there's a
there's a key reason it kind of launched
those products in that product line at a
later time especially if they're doing
to iphone models a lot of the attention
will shift to tablets and I think if you
look at something like the ipad the ipad
mini those are two things that really
stand on the road now they're very
popular products they
sold in some cases almost as many as a
iphone so it's kind of become apples
second big moneymaker behind the iphone
and is there anything to be inferred
from the location we know the event is
scheduled for September 10th a lot of
people were assuming it would be held
here in San Francisco but it's actually
going to take place in Cupertino yeah
this is happening in Apple's
headquarters and that's not really
unusual they've done some other events
there notably the iphone 4s and 2011 as
well as the new macbook airs as well as
OS 10.7 lion back in 2010 so there's
this kind of long history of doing
events there the curious thing is
whether they're going to do it kind of
on the same scale these events have
gotten larger more and more people are
trying to get in there and cover it and
this is one of the smallest venues to
have it in last year they had in yerba
buena center for the arts which holds a
lot more people and it's also more
central in San Francisco at least its
central for us given that cnet is based
here in San Francisco all right Josh and
you will be attending the event I
presume yeah we'll be there live it's
kind of unclear whether there will be
live video Apple did that last October
for the ipad mini event but not for the
iphone event last September so I guess
we'll see so this week we're expecting a
lot of SmartWatch announcements out of
eva in berlin large conference we know
that samsung will unveil its Galaxy gear
given that rumors have swirled around an
apple iWatch does this put added
pressure on Apple in terms of pressure
for a watch I don't think apples ready
to unveil that yet especially from what
we know from what the teams have been
working on and from rumors we've heard
from our sources it's not at the point
where they're ready to go with it a lot
of the products that we're going to see
this fall kind of got locked down in the
April timeline so if you look at
something like a watch it's just not
ready yet and if you're expecting a
watch this year it's probably best to
wait till next year to see that from
Apple in terms of what that product will
be that's the kind of interesting story
I think a lot of people myself included
are expecting the Samsung watch to kind
of be a companion to your smartphone not
a phone itself something Samsung is
actually done with a couple of previous
products and that's kind of the
direction we expect
able to go to either way we'll count on
you to keep us informed of what's
happening on the inside Josh thank you
for inside scoop I'm Sumi das thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
