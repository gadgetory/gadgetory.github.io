appliances and today we're going to talk
about the kitchenaid ksm150pser the
looks of this KitchenAid are probably
the most appealing thing about this
range if you notice this is a slot in
model which means it's going to look
really nice flush up against your
countertops in your kitchen at home we
have nice straight edges a really classy
stainless steel finish and continuous
grates on the cooktop that add to this
overall sleek appearance the knobs have
a slight texture to them which makes
adjusting the burner temperature pretty
easy there's also a little detail that
doesn't sound like much but the
indicator for which knob to use with
which burner is located right on top of
the cooktop rather than on the side so
you don't have to bend over and
awkwardly try to figure out which burner
you're using when you turn a knob
another really cool feature I liked
about this oven was its steam bake
feature now steam adds even more
moisture to a dish that you're making
like a cake or cupcakes and with this
oven there is a rack that will hold a
tray in which you pour water so while
you're baking the water turns to steam
and adds even more moisture to your dish
we tried it on a couple batches of
muffins and they did turn out not only a
little bit lighter in color than muffins
baked in a traditional mode but the
insides were a lot more moist as well
this is definitely a nice upgrade
feature to have that you don't have to
use all the time it's actually pretty
easy to take the steam tray insert in
and out of the oven one thing that this
KitchenAid was lacking was its cooktop
performance the boil water Tom's that we
tested were a little disappointing
especially for the price of this oven
which is two thousand six hundred and
forty nine dollars now if looks are what
you're after this will be a great
addition to your kitchen it's very
comparable in terms of appearance to
some of the higher-end models like
dacor or jinair but without the price
tag that can be as much as seven
thousand dollars or more however this is
still on the high end of the range scale
especially for a gas model there are a
lot of gas models even from KitchenAid
that are less expensive than this one
and perform many of the same functions
