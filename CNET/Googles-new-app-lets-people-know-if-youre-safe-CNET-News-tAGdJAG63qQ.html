you're safe when emergencies occur
people immediately fear for the safety
of friends and family located near that
event Google introduced a new app called
trusted contacts to share your location
here's how it works
you install the app on your phone and
add the contacts with whom you are
willing to share your location if one of
those contacts requested a location your
phone will show alert if you do not
respond within five minutes the app will
automatically send that contact your
location if both you and your contact
are using the app you'll see who has
been active in the past 20 to 30 minutes
if their battery is low you will see who
was active within the last hour there's
also the option to request a specific
location additionally there's a mode
that shares your location temporarily
with a person for up to 24 hours that's
a good feature to have when you're going
to or coming from someplace that you're
not too familiar with the trusted
contact app is available on Android with
an iOS version coming apple already has
an app similar to this call to find my
friends that shows your locations to iOS
users Facebook also has a feature called
safety check that allows a person to
mark themselves as safe or not in the
area of an emergency for more
