plane that can lift off like a
helicopter and fly like an airplane and
aerogels their 3d printed kind of cool
and the biggest announcement from oculus
rift yet finally know when we're gonna
get it it's tomorrow daily
gritty citizens of the internet welcome
to tomorrow daily the best week talk
show in the known universe I'm Ashley
sceva join he's always Cal anonymous I
didn't know you were gonna do that to me
and I thought you plan I thought it was
like the start of its this is the
release date for the oculus rift and so
was waiting for you to finish your
sentence and then I realized that you
cued me and that's the thing we do on
you get amber get what I was doing you
guys doing it was a trick for both both
the audience are loyal audience and me
almost nobody win it almost went over my
head but then a catcher's mitt came up
from behind my collar and grabbed it and
was like I got it I got it a little
robot catcher's mitt yeah I have a robot
lives in the back of my neck that's
that's what I like to do uh so let's not
very lead here let's talk about oculus
rift and hit the headlines okay so we
know the wonders of the oculus rift it's
so great there's been two iterations of
it when can I line up hold on I'm
building up to my right now okay so
basically Facebook has announced the
official date that we're going to be
able to as consumers get our hands on
the oculus rift and it is officially
2016 21 20 16 so next next year alright
so it's I mean look at there's there's
the the consumer dark it's yummy can
barely see it but I mean to me that's
that's sexy that's a very I'm just gonna
wear around okay so here's the deal
here's why that's kind of like oh not so
great their Facebook okay because
there's actually I like headsets coming
out before that let's just let's run
them down okay okay so i don't know if
you remember valves valve and HTC's of
I've by the vibe that's actually coming
out this year 2015 late this year so
that's going to beat out the oculist
okay so that's the one with the the
lighthouse on the front one that's
pretty great hollow lens is supposed to
come out when Windows 10 comes out
that's a are but that's supposed to come
out when Windows 10 comes out this year
this year me hololens got it so and then
also let's not forget the the first one
that's going to come out which is razors
Oh
vr headset it's going to be pretty cheap
too and that's coming out July 2015 so
learn practically all of them are going
to be that Samsung gear VR is already
already on the annual cardboard is or do
the s6 vr is I believe out like either
now are very very soon like their this
is like okay now we have the updated one
for the galaxy s6 and the s6 edge so not
only does the oculus rift app
competition it's also going to be late
to the game veyron now so that is
actually so that's that's that's the
entire news that's the news got it okay
but for anybody that's falling VR and
sit like this is like taking this to the
future and everybody's getting into it
the question is is that too late and are
they going to beat the oculus our parent
gonna be like well I've got the OS VR or
oh I've got a bye why why should I care
about the oculus so that is a huge
conversation you do to this announcement
being so late it is late and one also
it's asking I mean you kind of alluded
to this it's asking consumers to wait
through flick four or five different
headsets that are out this year like oh
well you get cardboard cuz it's
inexpensive but you have to have a
specific size phone you can do a galaxy
s6 but you gotta have this phone like
and but for me it's like you got to wait
through those three major headsets and
just trust us and I mean I like the
oculus rift a lot and we're gonna see it
at e3 we're gonna be able to see it at
e3 this year which we're very excited
about um this is less using the not us
but seeing it using the Crescent Bay
prototype over I think this was that CES
um so for me it's you know I don't know
because oculus is asking people to wait
they're saying just hold out don't buy
any other headsets because it's not
gonna be cheap like I mean no even a
couple hundred yeah i think the razor
cheap the razor is supposed to be the
cheap one the hollow lens you're not
gonna be able to afford like ninety-nine
percent of you guys are not gonna be
able to afford that letting us including
me no we couldn't even scrape together
in about yourselves Logan producer
Logan's loaded he is
eres tu an amazing macadamia fortune
that you guys just you don't even know
so I through and through I've always
believed that it's gonna be who did it
right who is going to whether it be
valves headset the vibe releasing maybe
a game like portal or maybe releasing if
half life 3 like if they do that they
win right there going to be out of the
gate and people are going to want to
develop for that however if at e3 the
game changes for instance of oculus get
some sort of exclusive things for
facebook or on the oculus rift exclusive
it's all gonna be about like that who is
good like if they have exclusives that's
how they can jockey for a lead position
it's just like smartphones and I and and
even you know streaming media it's
always it never matters who does it
first it always matters who does it best
and and like you were saying and then
the second part of that is is it's all
partnerships now because basically
everyone's got to get like it's a big
now mad scramble for Hollywood studios
for gaming companies for people to make
this content for that headset and that
headset alone yeah so if Facebook is the
only one that allows you to experience
some sort of Facebook thing yeah
accidentally oculus then they may win
but playstation home but there's there
it's going to be a very very interesting
year because now now that all these
headsets are coming out and everyone's
like okay we have our headset now they
need to actually start like show us yeah
showing us their cards and and and
figuring out what what's the better
headset and why should i get there's big
problem with oculus they're not gonna
make the Christmas they're not gonna
make Christmas that's a big deal that's
a big deal and that's that's why vibe is
coming out holiday season they want to
make christmas sales they want to get in
but if there's a king raccoon think
about how long that's a thing like
honest has been in development for ever
and we and people have had hands on it
um people have gotten to make content
for it there's a whole world of content
out there for the oculus we've heard so
many great things about the vibe to like
from what people have seen we've heard
some really incredible things and I
trust valve as a company to make
something spectacular yeah I
think i did cuz they haven't released a
lot of cool hardware yet so i agree with
that however I do think there are a lot
of creative people there that could make
something really special and I like I I
trust them to at least try like to try
to make something really special I'm not
discounted i'm not i'm not out the best
waiting for their makings i'm not saying
it's gonna be a home run it could be a
strikeout I'm just saying they're smart
move would be to make a game because
like I said the person that's gonna win
is gonna be the one that makes it so
that we want to put the head start on
three that we're not just putting it on
out of curiosity portal 3 but that we
want to put it on yeah um it's gonna be
a living in any of their games that need
a three is all they need is a half life
portal I could you imagine how my portal
dad both portal 3 a left 4 dead what
they just do all them for dead yeah well
compatible are we amazing huh so there
you go very interesting is I wish it was
our hashtag of the day you know it's
funny you mention that because it is
it's TD rift is our oh my god I said I'm
so surprised you're like it's like
you're psychic or reading the show notes
it's over God's like I work on the show
dad I'm so strange um tell us are you in
on rift are you out on riff some people
are like I'm over it I'm done I've been
watching this thing and development i'm
tired i want something else I'm I'm all
in on hololens a ours where it's at some
people are like I can't wait for oculus
rift I will wait for it I don't want
anything else and other people I'm on
the fence what's it gonna take what's it
gonna take for you to be fully in or
fully out on risk I'll add something to
that this is a question for you to just
right now with all that you know which
headset if you were just like hey we're
gonna send you one free in the mail
which headset would you want to get and
let's let's not let's take out hollow
words yeah cuz I want a whole different
i want it i want to click this to your
how many practice to VR so which headset
would you like to receive in the mail
just like a now knowing everything right
now I rift I want to risk your going
rift I would go rest alright because
it's because there are partnerships that
we know about their there are things
that are being developed there that
we've seen so I've seen things for riff
that I haven't seen on those other
headsets that's a really good point I
don't think there's a wrong answer no
there isn't there is no wrong as for my
money I I really want the
the vibe i want the vibe because it has
that lighthouse in it and it recognizes
things and it pretty good it has facial
recognition you it knows the room it
knows if you're going to touch a wall it
knows you're getting close to a wall
it's a it's a bigger step in the VR that
we've already done okay the documents
the accuracies the oculus solid but the
vibe it's adding that extra step but
like you said relationships so really we
want to know your feedback TD kale
there's what it is a rift TD riffs okay
if you want to give your kale feedback
you can always do that just find me on
Twitter um okay we got to talk about
these other two stories I'll make them
quick because we really kind of dove in
to oculus today Viera live but okay so
nASA has this new space this new is not
a spacecraft I want to call it a
spacecraft because it comes from NASA
but it's not it's an unmanned aerial
vehicle it's called greased lightning
it's gl10 night in um and it's so small
it's it's only 10 feet wide so here it
is like they're bring it out to carrying
it out yeah 3 meters wide and this thing
is pretty awesome it's an electrically
powered craft and it can take off
vertically like a helicopter and then
fly horizontally like an airplane so
pretty pretty cool that they're sort of
working on this type of technology and
again electric this is the first time
that they were able to successfully
transition from vertical to horizontal
flight to airplane mode they're called
as air that's their airplane mode for
their version of airplane mode hi guys
but this is that this is the take-off so
straight up you don't need a runway it
doesn't need to just need to ride and
you know get some velocity going for it
lifts off into the sky got it going
straight up in the air which is pretty
cool there are eight propellers all
along the wings there's four on each
side and there's two propellers in the
back and basically the four propellers
on each side of the wings are controlled
in groups so each side of the wings
propellers are controlled and engineers
are saying that this type of concept
could be used to deliver sort of small
payloads where runways aren't really an
option so if you you know wanted to
deliver something to a small village
maybe somewhere or maybe somewhere where
there's a lot of thick brush things like
that you couldn't um or maybe in a
disaster zone you couldn't deliver
something you would have to
a vertical takeoff and landing this
would be sort of an OP oh that is sexy
that is so sexy so cool so um and then
they said a larger scaled up version
would fit maybe like one to four people
for a short travel for short trips and
stuff and apparently it is four times
more efficient than a standard
helicopter down with us this is so cool
to me i love these sort of little
projects that they're doing and i'm
looking forward to seeing kind of where
this might go look at that superhero now
that guy is serious very cool crash that
thing right on but yeah I thought that
was really neat and and then uh real
quick before you can go to that next
story uh Logan which headset do you want
for the VR rig breath oh my god I mom
there's nobody answer that usually
there's nervous there's no wrong answer
we're still in the ? okay so third story
so we've mentioned aerogels before do
you remember the picture I took when i
did that JPL tour of the block of
aerogel is like second lightest solid on
the planet it looks see through its kind
of transparent like it's really cool
it's got great insulation properties you
can like there's always like experiments
online where you can hit a blowtorch at
the underside and have like a flower on
the other side of like a thin panel vera
gel and it doesn't burn huh which is
amazing so Erik Jones a pretty awesome
substance and the Lawrence Livermore
National Lab made an aerogel at using
graphene which is also a very curious
material that we've been hearing a lot
about in the news and they didn't using
3d printing and so this is kind of a big
deal in that usually you can't really
control the architecture of like this of
like this type of thing and so they said
if we can control this architecture and
exactly how it is created so you can see
it's like there's a very specific shape
to it they said we might be able to pave
the way for aerogels to be used in
applications that have been totally
unavailable to science for development
up until this point which is like flow
batteries or sensors different things
where you might consider graphing like
we remember how we've seen like sort of
graphene as a as maybe a battery
replacement like there's a
out of different experiments going on
around graphene right now in science and
so this is really cool that they have
been able to do this it is a
controllable and scalable assembly so
they're saying that's been a really big
challenge that's one of it that's been
one of the biggest challenges up until
this point and they've been able to kind
of tackle that which is fantastic and I
just really like that they're sort of
combining both of these not mysterious
materials but these materials that are
so special and so cool and have their
own sort of interesting properties
they're able to actually combine them
and 3d print out aerogel made with
graphene which is just the beard future
tech fusion of materials type stuff so I
just I saw that and I thought it was
really neat and if you guys want to read
about it it is a crazy process to create
this that you can read about in nature
communications as a journal that they
published in so you can check out the
whole the whole shebang it's like very
dense but if you love science you know
pin our genius viewer pin will probably
read through it in about 10 minutes and
understand all of it and build his own
graphene aerogel 3d printer on but but
super fascinating stuff for anybody
who's into that kind of thing and I just
saw it and thought it was pretty cool so
just so you know just an FYI uh but
that's it for headlines and we're gonna
come right back it's Wednesday so we
have a pretty great mod spa that you're
gonna like it's Grand Theft Auto based
its grand theft auto okay well then
hurry up and get over the commercial
break okay let's do that let's we will
be right back so don't click away
welcome back to the show kale is
mimicking a very delightful animated gif
I saw on the internet we did he sent me
yesterday of an Italian Greyhound who is
unable to keep its derp in its mouth
really cute I want to see it dog derbs
dog turks are the best ok so it's
Wednesday which means we got to talk
about Mod Squad
I could have done better um so in Grand
Theft Auto 5 if you have not played it
your menus are played out by your cell
phone those are that's the game you you
pull it up your character goes like
everything you go through all your
little menus and stuff okay so this is a
really awesome mod I thought so the pc
mods just came out skills into it last
week and this guy figured out how to
control the in-game phone menu with his
iphone he like recreated it and is able
to actually just pick up his phone and
use it as a sort of continue the
realistic feel of the game so his name's
planet leaked on reddit the guys on
reddit and he recreated the in-game
phone app with Xcode and then using an
Arduino web server I made it work inside
the game so the I believe that our
jurina web server sends like macro
information like macro keyboard
information over to the game so I could
be wrong about that he added a bunch of
buttons and like gesture control for the
menus so it feels a little smoother to
use on iOS but taking a picture how
amazing oh yeah he's taking a picture in
game which his actual iphone what's
really crazy is that Trevor's phone is
broken this is the character he's
playing us right now is broken it has a
little crack in it because he's a weird
guy he actually has the crack on the
actual image on the app yeah yeah it's
fantastic I mean this guy really spent
spent a little time like kind of working
on this and I just thought it was really
fun and like what a great way to sort of
do something exciting and cool for the
game that you really like planes this is
only the beginning oh pls GTA mods oh my
god this is so good would you install
this Logan know a lot of people are
saying yeah a lot of people are saying
it's a time waster but just for the it's
sort of like a you know it's like a
gimmicky kind of like a don a mod yeah
but I love it I think it's pretty great
listen planet League great i tell you
what i tell you what if they added it so
that it would use your accelerometer and
when you
taking the picture because you can do
the pictures that would be free and you
move around like this and it actually
moves on the screen I would enjoy that
how about that Logan okay sold all right
get on it unfortunately it's not you
can't download the mod right now but cuz
he's not done so it's not complete yet
but um I just thought it was really cool
with that I'm hoping that maybe he'll
release it for everybody to use yeah but
you gotta have a yard short of server
and my account I heard about that yeah
rocks are being single player but
there's the field of vision thing that
was the big one that a lot of people i
guess or reporting the field of vision
mod anyways yeah yeah there's some
there's a weird single-player bannings
happening for grand theft auto 5 because
of mods on pc so that's never good um
but we got to talk about you guys it's
time to talk about you guys it is user
feedback you're Logan Richard GTA I'm
Logan rich in GTA I just I just screwed
up in the stock markets like I put a lot
of money and I'm so loaded right now and
you and it works in your favor oh yeah
crazy mistake they were like no no and
then you want a bunch of money in this
really what I was doing I knew what I
was doing but but it's all good you guys
need some money kitchen t-cog come to
pick up kayla only charge you eighty
percent interest it's a very low
interest rate you can get a very low
interest rate from kill kills gonna
start a loan company in Grand Theft Auto
yell anonymous industries uh so all
right what other was Tony TD robobee are
we asked you guys to tell us if you
would jump into a robot body which if
you could and kill kill had a grin sir
and I thought mine was ok but you guys a
couple of you came up with some good
stuff Neil Rodin said if I could
essentially become immortal send me off
as a probe to explore the galaxy with
Tetris to stop boredom I like that right
well he's a robot so he doesn't have to
worry about like breathing in the vacuum
of space I know how robot would be
pressure and true season is the extent
you Michael really I don't yeah all
right huh well I guess that's sort of a
game that never ends I mean I would not
want to play a game that is linear that
has a beginning a middle Internet yeah
so fair enough but like worldly you're a
robot you'd probably be like pretty good
at Tetris
like a couple days just FYI and then
Frank wrote in and said if my girlfriend
will do it too i want us to travel the
universe in a robo body but still be
able to make robo babies during travel
that is that like that's adorable that's
heartwarming sad part is that he
wouldn't have a heart as a robot so no
no but see again you'd have at least
empathy like cuz it would be your
consciousness in a robot all right so
you'd have an understanding of human
yeah I mean it's not like your heart is
actually wanted they go okay the thing
goes for thing oh that's it that's it we
only got a couple of by the way okay so
I was waiting to the end of this
everybody just wants to be mortal
apparently yeah people just you nobody
sees any downside with being immortal
nope okay nope i right i mean i never
read any of those stories we're being
immortal was bad well i mean it's very
little boring but not bad boring as the
more you just said you won't eat at all
you're like not being in 30 years just
like i've just seen it all over and over
again yeah yeah it's just all the same
spot another iphone yeah yeah iphone
1800 geez you'd be so cocky if you were
immortal though if you look real I know
everything we're gonna play GTA be rich
that's true or I could just borrow some
GTA money from you yes mad GTA money um
okay guys it's time for the very last
piece of user feedback which is always
our phone talker for the day
with a new viewer he wrote in yes
finally finally one new viewer Joaquim
wrote will ruin it in no time Joaquim
read it I know we're sorry walking uh he
wrote it and said hello cnet sorry show
tomorrow daily and here are some
pictures for the show hope you like them

the Swedish archipelago on the island
cauldron maru rune Maru uh I mean it's
amazing this first picture i really

terrifying and it i feel like you could
create an entire survival horror game
right just surrounding this bench and
this light post yeah i feel what's the
story there what's happening what what
what's the game that you're playing
Joaquim should we send help are you
trapped in Silent Hill are you trapped
