you're desperately looking for a reason
not to purchase the new Samsung Galaxy
s7 it seems like an awesome phone so how
can you resist it tell you what I'll
give you the top 5 reasons not to
purchase the galaxy s7 right now at
number 5 you're a megapixel snob the
galaxy s6 packed in a 16 megapixel
camera the galaxy s7 dropped to 12
megapixels after consulting my
calculator app that's a difference of
four whole megapixels and CNET's tests
the s7 with its wimpy 12 megapixel
camera took better photos than the
mighty 16 megapixel s6 camera but you
don't care about that because your snob
at number four no removable battery if
your life revolves around swapping
batteries in and out of cell phones
forget the Samsung Galaxy s7 sure
Samsung gave the s7 a microsd card slot
and water resistance but the battery is
encased within its phone test disc
Samsung at number three the competition
is crazy this year have you taken a look
at the playing field
check out the LG g5 it's like a friggin
transformer it's got an expansion slot
so the phone could do more things than
just be a phone oh yeah then there's
that whole new iPhone thing at number
two it's not a nexus the two Nexus
phones out right now are pretty
impressive
both the Nexus 6p and the Nexus 5x are
reasonably priced they also enjoy a nice
software advantage Nexus phones get the
latest version of Android first none of
that waiting around for Kerry approval
or some other nonsense before we get to
number one let's talk about some reasons
to buy the s7
CNET editor Jessica delcor said the s7
is the best all-around phone out there
better even than the excellent Google
Nexus 6p and the iPhone 6s the s7 is
also an editor's choice and at number
one you've already got an s6 or a note 5
the samsung galaxy s7 is a great phone
but so with the galaxy s6 and the note 5
if you've got either one of those phones
an upgrade isn't really necessary right
now if you don't need expandable storage
or you're able to keep your phone dry
stick with your s6 or note 5 if you
thought I made up that list because I
hate Samsung
you're totally wrong I think there's a
bee's knees and the cat's pajamas for
more top fives check out the internet
they're like everywhere if you want more
top fives like this one check out top
