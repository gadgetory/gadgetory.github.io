money than YouTube by getting a cut of
the subscriptions but will people pay to
watch in most cases if you wait three
days after a video publishes you can see
it for free on vessel or free on YouTube
some traditional media outlets are
providing free content including Sports
Illustrated discovery People magazine
and the New York Times the commercials
are also different on vessel ads before
videos are five seconds long and the
site is peppered with animated graphics
from sponsors if you think of YouTube as
free public access television well then

quickly and to get people using it

access to anyone who signs up by

executives at hulu and it's been backed
by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos but perhaps
Bezos is more focused this week on his
