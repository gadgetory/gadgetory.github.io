phone buffalo and this one is special
for few reason first this is actually a
second unit the first unit right here it
died on me a few months ago when I was
testing it turned out there was a bug
that put it into an infinite boot loop
now the bug is fixed so all is good the
second reason why special because it has
such a long name is so long that even I
can't remember it we have to wait it
from these people right here so here we
go
buffalo air station extreme AC 750
gigabit dual band dd-wrt wz r 750 the
HPD router there you go now let me get
that away if I must like calling me down
with the very cool intelligent funny man
who is 6 feet tall and happens to be
Asian no well that's actually better
unfamiliar well the real reason why is
special here is because this is a very
first router that run dd-wrt firmware I
have a review so what is needing wrt
there's a well-known third-party open
source firmware for routers and access
point now using that firmware on a
router is very much like running Linux
open system on the computer instead of
Windows or Mac OS and generally have to
hack your hardware to install it with
this one here it comes included as a
default factory firmware now in my
opinion dd-wrt is by far the most
advanced firmware that can really bring
out the best of the hardware it also
offered the most feature and the most
in-depth customization in fact that so
much this firmware can offer that even I
might not know them all and I definitely
don't have time to try them all so let's
just look at a few example here well
first this one is true doing bad router
so it come with two Wi-Fi network one
for each band but for each band it can
offer more than a dozen of extra network
called virtual interfaces or virtual
access point no stock firmware can do
that you can even host a very advanced
spot for your home
or your restaurant or your hotel or your
neighborhood it on a simple guest
networking I'm talking about here
there's a few option for you to manage
your hotspot professionally such as
giving the user the option to log in or
even pay for your service you can even
make you internet ad free by making the
router block online commercials or then
turn around into a very powerful VPN
server or VPN client and of course there
are many other feature both for home and
business and with this one here you have
a more in-depth access to their settings
and configurations now in short if you
are a savvy user who want to have a
total control of your home or business
network dd-wrt is the way to go the way
if you choose a regular home user well
you can use this Buffalo here too it
come pre-configured with two Wi-Fi
networks with the information printed on
the underside and usings that you can
just use it right out the box by
plugging the router into the power and
connect is one port here to the prop and
modem now if you want to do more that is
secret label right here that show you
how to access the routers web interface
the router comes with one one port and
for LAN ports all of them are gigabit we
also have a 1u speed 3.0 port and one
USB 2.0 port to host printers or storage
devices it is like to stay vertical like
this we can move is the test post and
around to make it stay flat this way in
my testing this one here proved to be a
solid performer expecially on the five
o'clock frequency band it also has very
stable Wi-Fi signal the range though is
not the best ever seen but likely
because it doesn't come with extra
antennas but with the current cost of
$150 or less it's still a great deal
especially considering it comes with a
three-year warranty now for mall this
Buffalo here check out my full review
seo.com oh by the way the long name of
myself earlier is actually my full name
I carried out the two words because well
I'm modest and also according to my date
he's sexier that way and that's because
I'm dumb no and this has been the first
look as a new router from Buffalo no
size full name again
