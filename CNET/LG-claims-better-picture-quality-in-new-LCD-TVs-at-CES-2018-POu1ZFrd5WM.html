CES 2018 you're looking at LG's best LCD
display not OLED LG is known for its
OLED organic light-emitting diode
displays this is not it this is an LCD
TV a little bit less picture quality but
LG says it has improved from previous
years the biggest difference this year
is the addition of full array local
dimming and technology that allows the
backlight of the screen to dim and
brighten different areas independently
technology we've found on other displays
that really does improve the picture
we'll see how it looks on this one this
is the 9500 series the local dimming is
also available on the 9000 series the
less expensive super UHD TV does not
have us in LG's line this year LG also
had a Google Assistant to its Smart TVs
you can pick up the remote talk into it
do things like searches and ask for
other Google assists and things like you
can even control smart home appliances
using your television so that's a new
addition this TV also works with Google
home you can use it without the remote
to get some select commands you can also
interface with an Alexa skill if you
have an Alexa or an Amazon echo device
to talk to the TV and control it
hands-free that way other picture
quality actors include nano cell which
LG says improves viewing angle and color
the TV also has 4k high dynamic range in
pretty much everything else you'd expect
from a high-end LCD TV that's a quick
look at LG's K 9500 series I'm David
Katz my CES 2018</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
