buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
yes Virginia max can get malware the war
on Sony goes on and one of the easiest
punchlines in tech is soon to be history
forever but first it's the gadget of the
week the gadget of the week is the new
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Nook Simple Touch reader
it's meant to be kind of a kindle killer
it's a smaller nuke with a
black-and-white e-ink screen like the
Kindle but it's a touchscreen so
basically if you still want your books
to look like books there's a nuke for
that that was a lot of rhyming the new
note costs 130 nine dollars like the
Kindle and has built in Wi-Fi but no 3g
and i gotta say i remember when Barnes &amp;amp;
Noble announced it was making an
e-reader and some people thought that
was kind of silly and then the first one
was not good so then some people thought
they were doomed well those people are
suddenly thinking about buying a new
nook so enjoy that last laugh Barnes &amp;amp;
Noble and now for the news Apple had a
bit of a malware scare over the past
couple of weeks an annoying little bit
of malware called Mac defender started
making the rounds on Mac computers in
the early part of May it mostly just
generated porn popups so nothing super
malicious but it was actually Mac
malware in the wild which basically no
one was willing to believe and Apple
certainly wasn't interested in
publicizing because max don't get
viruses everyone support reps actually
leaked internal information about how
Apple told customer support not to
provide any help if the customer said
they were infected with Mac defender
which is just about the time that the
media storm got bad enough that Apple
finally put up a blog post telling users
how to remove Mac defender malware and
hopefully avoid it in the first place so
thanks for that and listen I would
imagine that there will be more attempts
to deliver malware and Trojans and other
nasty things to Mac users in the future
so Apple you might not be able to handle
that with the same old long silence and
then magical solution from on high that
you're used to because if the next piece
of bad we're still
passwords or credit card information
that it is not going to fly poor Sony
just keeps getting hacked the company
had a report this week that personal
data from almost 10,000 users was stolen
from two of its sights one in Canada and
one in Greece sony said only emails
passwords and phone numbers were stolen
not credit card information and that the
sites weren't part of the main Sony
network also though the company said
Sony sites in Indonesia and Thailand
were hacked but no information was
stolen I mean what are their server
passwords one two three four or five
come on guys although it is surprisingly
hard to feel sorry for Sony I mean
remember that time they made their music
CDs secretly drop rootkits on your
computers go look that one up but
seriously lolz hacker types maybe that's
enough because I mean if you keep this
up you might get things like the French
president calling for a more regulated
Internet to keep things civilized he was
speaking this week at the eg8 forum a
get together about the internet and its
effect on global commerce he seemed
generally to indicate that net
neutrality was a bit naive intellectual
property rights are king and everyone
just needs to be reasonable about things
like Francis three strikes law which
lets private industries accused citizens
of piracy without due process and can
result in those citizens getting kicked
off line completely the European Union
by the way rejected the idea of a
nationwide three strikes law so see
civilized and reasonable tend to mean
different things to different people but
merci any way Monsieur Sarkozy and
finally tech unicorns are officially an
endangered species the white iphone came
out and now Duke Nukem Forever has gone
gold that means the code is done the
game discs are being burned the trailers
are out the marketing is happening jun
14th people the date is set what could
possibly delay it now
too easy and that's the buzz report for
this week everyone I'm Mollywood and
thank you for watching this has this
looks like a little Joey pouch or can do
my name and Napoleon welcome to the buzz
report Bienvenue I've is my fault</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
