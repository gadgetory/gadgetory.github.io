bigger brighter things with our huge LED
screens and all of our content here at
cnet now you can check out all of our
life content as cnet com / live we pump
in through that 24 7 you can even take a
look at our little spy camp yeah late at
night if you want to see what we're
doing what creepy things are happening
in Las Vegas at the cnet stage yeah
you'll see them all there so thanks for
hanging with us this is our backstage
pass of everything that scene that's
doing as
yes 2011 and we'll see it here I cannot
confirm or deny whether any creepy
things happened at the scene that stage
late at night only that a lot of quality
programming did occur and the rest stays
in Vegas moving on as Brian mentioned
cnet gives out the official best of CES
awards every year at the show in a whole
slew of categories now here are the
winners in design smartphones and gaming
hey I'm Josh goldland senior editor with
cnet and I'm here at CES 2011 taking a
look at the casio tricks now redesigning
a camera body is a little tough you know
it's been a box design since day one
pretty much but casio seems to have done
that with the tricks the display flips
out and rotates a full 360 degrees and
rotates this way and that 270 degrees
that rotation allows you to shoot
left-handed or right-handed thanks to an
orientation sensor built into the camera
now to get this really slim cool ultra
compact form factor they had to ditch
the optical zoom on this so it's just
digital but you do get a 21 millimeter
ultra ultra wide-angle lens it also
shoots in Full HD video and you'll
notice there's a pretty much a complete
lack of physical controls on this camera
that's because it's using a 3 inch high
res touchscreen display and because of
that swivel display you're able to
position it in different ways so you can
hang it from things to shoot stick it on
a tabletop to shoot so again while it is
pretty tough to break away from a
traditional camera design it seems like
Cassio's done that with the tricks I'm
Josh Goldman CES 2011 this is the casio
tricks
hi I'm Kent German senior editor at cnet
com I'm here at CES 2011 in Las Vegas
and I want to show you a couple new
products from Motorola versus the
motorola atrix 4g know this is one of
eight ents first 4g phones it's runs on
hspa+ so that is a 4g but the 18 c will
be coming out with LTE network later in
the year but for all intents and
purposes it is 4g right now we weren't
expecting 18teen announced 4g devices so
they took us a little bit by surprise
but really glad to see it now this is a
dual-core phone so that doesn't mean
that it does have two one gigahertz
processors now it's interesting because
this is motorola first and it's
definitely a first for us carrier i'm a
little concerned about how this
dual-core processors might affect
battery life but we'll have to see
otherwise features are what you'd expect
for an android phone is by megapixel
camera plenty of multimedia all those
productivity apps personal organizer all
those Google applications assisted GPS
so pretty basic one thing is really
interesting is it coming you can get a
motorola laptop dock now this is a brand
new product it was just announced today
we actually had no idea about it now you
might looks like a laptop and that's
exactly the point but it doesn't do
anything unless you actually take the
phone and you plug it into these ports
here in the back so i'll go ahead and do
that and then we'll take a take just a
second what what this is is it basically
brings your phone and brings it into a
larger screen so everything you do on
the phone from watching videos to
browsing the web using your email all
the sending messages it's just put in
put it on this larger screen so you can
play games you can get really whatever
you want i know a couple people ask well
what's really the point it's just the
point is is everything you can do on
your phone makes it a little more
comfortable you have a nice large screen
there's not that I strain and looking at
a small phone especially for watching
movies and videos or a long period it
does it is supposed to have an eight
hour battery life motorola laptop dock
so that means you could use it on a
pretty long plane ride load a bunch of
movies on the phone and you're good to
go full keyboard pretty basic
instruction no ports or anything to talk
about it's really just about plugging
that phone in you can also get an hdmi
dog and wettest you can put the phone in
run it to an hdmi cable it goes directly
to your TV and you can watch any videos
you
TV or any kind of on the monitor so it's
really some interesting products that
Motorola's done with this again is a
dual-core phone runs on amc's new hspa+
network that is growing network so we
don't know much about it yet but will
will be out in 2011 probably mid-2011
but this is a pretty astre phone i love
these accessories I'm Kim Sherman here
at CES 2010 with the motorola atrix 4g
and the mobil oil laptop dog hey what's
going on everyone i'm jeff bakalar from
cnet com we're here live at CES 2011 i'm
here with the nintendo 3ds is our first
look at the device it comes out in March
we don't have a price yet but it is the
successor to the Nintendo DS I and the
nintendo DS lite it does 3d gaming if
you notice the top screen here displays
a 3d image without the need for 3d
glasses pretty incredible below is a
standard touch screen on the back to
camera lenses allow you to take 3d
photographs which is really cool talking
more about the 3d screen it has a 3d
slide adjuster so you can customize the
3d effect you can make it more intense
or even eliminate it altogether it's
backwards compatible with Nintendo DS
games which is really cool she can play
those old games and it's going to be
reducing doing something called
streetpass which allows this to
communicate with other 3d esas that you
pass by on the street or in your home we
don't know all the details about that
yet but we hope to find out more in
mid-january in terms of size the 3ds is
similar to what you see on the DS Lite
and it has a very nice way to it as well
up front is a headphone sport up front
also is an analog stick and then a deep
head below that and then the
conventional for buttons that we're all
used to on Nintendo portables that's
going to do it for the 3ds here at CES
2011 I'm Jeff Bakalar for cnet com
thanks for watching
now Nintendo was not the only one
showing off glasses-free 3d displays at
CES this year it's definitely a big
trend and we saw glasses-free 3d TVs
from LG Sony and Toshiba good news for
those of us who like to watch TV without
accessories we also let you the people
vote in our little awards show and the
people's voice award is always a cool
look at the thing that grabs your
attention this year your attention was
rightly grabbed by what could be the
smallest coolest gaming PC ever this is
one of the most wild looking laptop here
it's so tiny it just be razor switch
late i'm going to turn around here so
you can see it this is also a concept
piece it is a tiny intel atom powered
laptop from razor designed for playing
pc games you can plug a mouse into it it
has a keyboard and I'm going to fill it
up a little bit so you can see the
keyboard each keyboard key is actually a
little tiny display there's actually the
display under here that gives you a
custom keyboard based on what you're
doing now I'm going to attempt to very
quickly launch a game right here and
this is it's a concept piece it's not
going to hit the stores anytime soon who
knows how much it'll cost who knows what
the components will be but showing that
you can actually get a kind of gaming PC
into a little clamshell design and add
cool stuff to it that actually makes it
usable like customizable keyboards I
think that's we're looking at and
everyone has been very excited to check
this out in person it's a remarkable
idea it's also unusual because usually
think of a gaming laptop as being a
17-pound alienware a dell XPS this I
mean where people just make very casual
games on their simple pcs exactly are
having porno I got the Warcraft style
keys on here if you look at the keyboard
it's actually changed to a warcraft
style a font on the keys sorry that's
the razor switchblade and i think that's
a super cool concept who knows if we'll
actually ever see it but I
this is a boat is like looking really
nice I believe it in not bad for an
ultra mobile pc / portable gaming device
/ thingy we'll see if that ever comes to
the real world one thing that is coming
to the real world with a bang is our CES
best of show winner this is the gadget
that wowed our cnet editors the most
although it won by the slimmest margin
ever it's the go out check it out hi
everybody I'm mollywood from cnet com
here at CES 2011 with a very special
first look this is our CES 2011 best of
show winner the Motorola Xoom tablet so
I thought I would give it the full best
of CES first look treatment now there
were a lot of tablets buy some reports
as many as 50 tablets announced here at
CES and from some big names LG Toshiba
and of course Motorola so what makes
this one so special well first up I have
to say it's partly the design this is
absolutely beautiful it's sexy it's
lighter than the iPad but it has a
slightly bigger display a 10.1 inch
display running at 1280 x 800 resolution
so really nice hi res glossy bright
screen now one of the things that makes
this tablet so appealing is that it's
running Google's honeycomb operating
system that's the version of Android
that is specifically optimized for
tablets and i have to say we found it
very user friendly very tablet friendly
really a good touch screen interface
that made this frankly just a joy to use
it's also running a Tegra 2 dual core
processor with one gig of ram so it's
got some pretty serious horsepower under
the hood here plus there's plenty of
on-board storage it has 32 gigs of
on-board storage with an SD card slot
that's expandable to 32 gigs more so you
can get potentially 64 gigs of storage
on here pretty much all the movies and
music that you're ever going to want
speaking out photos this has another
ipad killer feature dual cameras there's
a 2 megapixel camera in the front a 5
megapixel camera on the back that's
another thing that the ipad lacks as you
know and of course there is support for
flash 10.1 all in all a very powerful
very
attractive comfortable little tablet we
are expecting to see this guy in the
first quarter of 2011 there's no pricing
information yet but they're saying it'll
be competitive so third thing in that's
code for five to seven hundred dollars
we'll see when it finally comes out and
there you have it i'm molly wood from
cnet com with a first look at our best
of CES show winner the Motorola Xoom
tablet congratulations to Motorola on
the zoom and congrats to all of our best
of CES award recipients you can find
that complete list of winners all the
finalists and everything else CES
related over at cnet com and right now
we're going to take a quick break but we
will be right back with more tech review
in just a minute
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly digest of all things good and bad
we've seen here at cnet TV continuing on
in the good before we even had a chance
to catch our breath from CES it was time
to turn our attention to more verizon
iphone rumors except this time the
rumors are true well here it is your
verizon iphone the ever elusive iphone
running on verizon cdma network it was
announced today in New York well it's
exactly what we thought which isn't
necessarily a bad thing there's been a
lot of pent up demand for an iphone on
verizon and that's exactly what we got
today but there are a few little
disappointments there's no gsm chip in
it so that means it's not a world phone
and it's not LTE so it's not on the
superfast network but that might mean
that the battery life is pretty good or
at least the same as what you can get on
the iphone 4 on AT&amp;amp;T network a couple of
details about it it's going to cost 199
dollars for the 16 gig model 299 for the
32 gig model it will launch on februari
10th for everyone if you're an existing
verizon customer however it will launch
on februari third for pre-orders so
you'll get yours before everyone else
does one of the cool things about the
verizon version of the iphone is that it
allows for tethering of up to five
devices that means you can use the
iphone to send data to your tablet or
your laptop or any other device you want
to get on the internet so if you go to
the settings menu you see that one of
the first setting options is personal
hotspot so you click this you turn it on
and you can connect to another device
using Wi-Fi Bluetooth or USB one
possible drawback of this phone is that
the cdma network doesn't allow for voice
calls at the same time as you're using
the data which could be a limitation the
hardware of this phone is very similar
to the AT&amp;amp;T version although there is
this one seam along the top which could
be an antenna seam which could prevent
the problems at the iphone 4 had with
dropped calls because the antenna was
along the bottom one other hardware
difference is there's no sim card slot
one thing we don't know is pricing a
plan so that hotspot tethering that
we're so excited
about could cost more we don't know and
they won't say just yet otherwise it
looks just like an iphone 4 it's just a
new name and a new network iPhone bore
on verizon at long last for cnet news
I'm Natali Morris what a relief although
we do need a new iPhone rumor now while
you're working on thinking of one let's
check out the bad it's bad news for ATT
all the way around not only do they lose
the exclusive on the iPhone they're in
for at least a year of journalists and
consumers gloating about their better
verizon network witnessed the first of
many fairly unscientific speed tests hey
everyone Bonnie top from cnet com here
at the verizon iphone launch event and
i'm sure one of the big questions on
your mind is which network is actually
faster AT&amp;amp;T and verizon turns out we've
got both phones here so we're going to
do a little speed test and let's see who
comes out on top so we are going to pull
up the full New York Times page and see
which one comes out faster ready set go
looks like verizon's winning so far here
we go New York Times is up on the
verizon network 18t just pulled in there
that was actually a significant
difference between the two webpages
verizon it's almost instantaneous
whereas 18t just finished loading the
page so that was our speed test on the
iphone 4 18 t and verizon obviously
that's just one test will do more
extensive testing once we get the phone
in for review and you'll be able to
check out the full review at cnet com
now yes we know it was a verizon event
and there aren't any iphones on that
network yet and there were probably
verizon femtocells stashed under every
desk but still that's got to hurt 18t
just a little maybe there's some good
news waiting for us in the bottom line
turning our attention back to CES the
show made a huge comeback this year it
was bigger and badder than ever and i
have to say even the announcements and
the tech delivered especially after some
seriously slow years so let's wrap up
our best of CES awards as sort of a
taste of what's to come in 2011 Brian
Chong here with sitcom at CES 2011 and
