it our in-house b-boy outfit is gonna do
some stress testing all the way tightest
setting go ahead let's do it alright
it's the dead of winter here in New York
it's freezing but we got an invite to
Nikes headquarters we're gonna be
announcing the new self-lacing sneakers
I'm excited to try it let's go check it
out they just gave me the new Nike adapt
bb's self-lacing sneakers it comes with
an app so as soon as you launch the app
it connects with your sneakers now every
time you close down the app it
disconnects to save battery but as you
can see it just it syncs up very easy so
let me throw them on now there are ready
pretty snug to lace them up you just
play with the app here that's for the
left one an interesting sensation and
the right one
now you can't you probably can't hear it
from here but it makes this loud motor e
sound where it laces them and these this
is the tightest my shoes have ever been
I'm the type of guy that keeps my
sneakers very loose so this is very
strange to me but you know if I was an
athlete a basketball player I could see
why you would want them this tight
alright so just so you can hear them let
me take this one off and I'm gonna lace
the left one and hold them up to the mic
just so you can hear how loud it is
pretty damn loud these are the Nike
adapt bb's OTF that stands for on the
feet for those that speak sneaker heads
so Nikes known for innovating with
sneaker technology it all started with a
waffle pattern and the running shoes and
then they introduced the air we saw
tuned hair airmax
we even saw shocks and now we got the
self-lacing sneakers we've seen these in
a couple pairs of shoes the difference
is these are a little cheaper still
expensive at three hundred and fifty
dollars but we're actually gonna see
some NBA players wear them on the course
so this is the adapt app right here
you need this to sync up with your
sneakers now we're right when you launch
it you're gonna see that they connect
they kind of really quick all the way
down means the left shoe and the right
shoe are all the way loops so if I want
to tighten up all the way and bring them
both up and I can feel them slowly going
up here the loud motor going if you want
to completely kill it get that one right
there and right here this is where you
can set modes if you prefer them a
little bit looser or in different
settings so if you want a a cool-down
mode you can set that all up right here
and I'm right here you can customize the
colors so if you see this will change
the color on the side of the sneaker and
I just adds a little bit of
customization there and then battery
life is right here as you see I have 42%
on the left sneaker 43% on the right and
I've already seen these go down by at
least 5% since I've been here there's a
wireless charging pad you can set their
sneakers on to charge if you want to run
a quick game you can put them on for 15
minutes or lasts a full game if you
wanted to fully charge them you would
set them on the pad for three to four
hours and it lasts 10 to 14 days all
right let me take these off really quick
now the technology inside is what nike
is calling the brain which is a motor
built inside and that's actually what
communicates with the apps
you can lace the sneakers and one thing
to note also you don't need you have to
lace them up these are also button so
you can loosen anti numbers so now let's
look at the sneakers from a style
perspective
I'm personally more of a fan of classics
so I don't know about the way this looks
instantly a reminding me of the old Gary
Payton's those were the first sneakers I
saw that kind of covered the laces one
thing that sticks out to me I've always
been a fan of customizing your laces
having them really loose or putting fat
laces or even doubling them up you don't
have that option here so I'm curious to
see how sneakerheads or people they just
are really into sneaker culture
gravitate to these are these going to be
worn
it's strictly for performance or a
fashion be a key component
coming at you I'm coming hatch you
better watch out
