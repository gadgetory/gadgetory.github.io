awake I think something went wrong with
the hibernation box
we woke up to see 90 years too soon in
the movie you're making a very long
journey what's the thing that would sort
of be the tipping point for you here on
earth to be like I gotta go I gotta get
out of here like I'm gonna go to some
other if we have the ability to go
somewhere else
nuclear war and you got nuclear war
ended
you know like so in the movie you play
an Android named Arthur if you were able
to have an Android and it could only do
one thing for you but could be as
realistic as Arthur what would that
robot do for you
massage remember all of my passwords and
like the last four digits of the credit
card number and like what your Apple ID
is yeah that's good that's a good one
personal security you know just like
rolled right behind me and if I if I
snap my fingers snap neck you have a lot
of lawsuits on your hands yeah well he'd
also be a lawyer if you decided to go
there's one special thing you can bring
what's the thing that you bring with you
and why I am going to assume that by the
point that this can happen the
technology is there to have one small
kind of device that can contain every
book ever written and I is what I would
take with me I think it's a Kindle you
have to be a very big Kindle oh no that
would be yeah well I would come with a
giant server
I'm sure yeah my point would be tiny and
Ivania brain just that everybody that's
great if any of the characters you've
previously played could go on a journey
like this which one would it be my
maybe Tiffany from silver linings
because she's just wacky enough to do it
you know I guess probably Peter quill
from from guardians of the galaxy he's
been on journeys like this that feels
like cheating yeah you're right you're
right sorry um
character on a table the OSI Andy from
Parks and Rec could probably get tricked
onto the boat yeah he would have I you
would be the most useless person woken
up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
