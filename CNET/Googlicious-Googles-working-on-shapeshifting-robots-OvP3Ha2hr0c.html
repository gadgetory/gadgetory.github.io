welcome to google issues for all the
Google goodness that we can pack inside
of a show all right let's get to it and
we're going to start things off with
some science and a partnership between
MIT and Google's Boston Dynamics who are
working on developing shape-shifting
robot now you might recall that google
bought Boston Dynamics in 2013 who is
known for some of the robotic prototypes
like the 29 mile-per-hour running
cheetah and the pet man amazing and
scary at the same time now MIT and
Google are now developing the next gens
shape-shifting robots built from
materials like wax and foam that can
change shape when heated and squish or
contort through small spaces it's really
cool stuff in don't worry we're not at
t1000 liquid metal designs yet also
report by BBC News says nvidia is
working on a new android based gaming
platform running pc quality games and
powered by their new Tegra one processor
and will also be able to stream games to
televisions with an HDMI out port and a
controller accessory the new device will
also be able to play mobile games on the
go and Android apps similar to their
shield system in video also recently had
a device referred to as the shield
tablet pass through the global
certification form and this could be a
combination tablet and controller setup
that the BBC is talking about and Google
is making moves to prep some of its
other platforms to adopt their new
material design UI they're pushing for
with Android L which is still a name
that could be anything from lemon to
lollipop or lasagna yes lasagna you can
see in some of these comparison shots
with the pre-release of the Google Play
Store how content is being pushed to the
forefront compared to the current design
giving this a stripped-down and much
more cleaner look and feel with an
emphasis on hero images as well they're
also incorporating a similar material
design with bolder colors and a
simplified look and feel with Google
Docs sheets and slides as well now
Android we're still trying to figure
itself out in its way ahead of the
competition right now as more developers
jump on board so if you own an Android
wear SmartWatch you guys should check
out
we're mini launcher that brings an
application drawer to easily access the
apps you want to use where is primarily
made to be voice controlled but that
doesn't mean you want to talk to your
wrist all the time so check it out on
the Play Store it's free and worth
trying out also still sticking with apps
on wearables this one's pretty cool for
glass the app is called my radar weather
radar and you can call it up by saying
ok glass show the weather and you'll see
an animated radar screen based on your
location kind of fun kind of cool and
they have the full apps for Android and
iOS already and Samsung is looking to
make their s-pen even better for the
next note a recent patent describes a
samsung stylus working on ultrasound
waves now sensors on the corner of a
device like a phone or tablet would be
able to detect the ultrasound waves the
stylus produces and calculate its
position based on the distance from the
sensors the main benefit this would help
to lower the cost of the digitizer
potentially allow it to be thinner and
also reduce some of the potential costs
as well and according to a report from
Korean site eTnews Samsung is preparing
to launch an all metal device as early
as next month called the Galaxy alpha
it's expected to be marketed as a
premium smartphone made of metal with
its main goal of countering apple's
upcoming iphone now it would go a long
ways to really squash one of the biggest
complaints about Samsung's phones that
it isn't metal but it hasn't Earth their
sales because of its plastic body
alright I'm going to go on a little
vacation so we'll be gone for a couple
weeks but that doesn't mean we're going
to be gone for good that's going to do
it for this week's show just email us at
Google licious at cnet com or tweet me a
brian Tong in maybe I'll write to you
from a beach I really won't thanks so
much for watching it will see you guys
next time for some more of that Google
issues
