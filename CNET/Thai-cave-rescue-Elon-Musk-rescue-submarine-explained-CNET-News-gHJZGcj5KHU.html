method to save the thai youth soccer
team trapped in a cave it involves a kid
sized submarine this is a tube made from
SpaceX rocket parts and musk has been
sharing video of this pod being tested
in a pool at a high school in Los
Angeles musk the head of SpaceX Tesla
and the tunnel digging boring company
shared details of the plan on Twitter
and he said the tube is light enough to
be carried by two divers and small
enough to get in through narrow gaps in
the cave this tube has oxygen ports and
a cone on the nose to protect it from
getting hit with rocks Musk tweeted that
the pod is built from the liquid oxygen
transfer tube of a SpaceX Falcon 9
rocket and in this journey a passenger
is laying inside the tube with his arms
crossed the diameter is very tight just
12.2 inches once out of the water the
team has to unlock the door carefully
adjusting the pressure and screwing off
multiple bolts eventually the hatch is
opened and the man can slide out of the
top end now as of this report the pod is
currently on its way to Thailand to help
in the rescue efforts but it may not

narrow underwater passage the team of 12
boys and their soccer coach have been
trapped for two weeks after heavy rains
flooded the cave and blocked the exit so
far several boys have already
successfully been rescued the journey
out of the cave is dangerous a former
Thai Navy diver died in the caves during
a mission to deliver air tanks to the
group as for the musk submarine tube he
says if the cave rescue does not need it
this container could also be modified
for use as an escape pod in space I'm
