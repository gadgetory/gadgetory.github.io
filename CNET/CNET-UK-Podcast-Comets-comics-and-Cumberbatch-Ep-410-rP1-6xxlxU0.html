cnet UK podcast mrs. episode 410 for
friday the fourteenth in november 2014
ladies and gentlemen we are floating in
space european space pods have landed a
robot on a comet hurtling the blackness
of space millions of miles away and as
if that isn't exciting enough Microsoft
has lost his first non nokia phone
giffgaff gone 4g and iron man has
switched sides I'm rich Trent ohmic
joining me in a high-tech learning
studio this week is Luke Milky Way hello
space sounds interesting it doesn't
sound as Iron Man switching sides yeah
exactly what we'll talk more about a
second and also joining us is Andy worm
oil haha very good as always we are
filming the podcast so at c3 heavenly
bodies you can see this hand all our
videos on cnet or youtube.com slash seen
it without let's start with weak knees
can start off by talking about
wallet-friendly network gift gap yes
wish I had some some cool news is now
doing 4G and which is one of the I think
one of the only UK networks that isn't
offering 4g the moment that's all yeah
this we use first and then vodafone yeah
and a three it's got it is no to join
the union and now giffgaff is here and
actually he's got some good deals as
you'd expect this giffgaff already is
very cheap it's an mvno which means it's
actually using a different networks
infrastructure llevo tues that's right
it's technically owned by 02 but it's
kind of done as an offshoot so it's back
to keep the cost down to keep costs down
as it is so for only 12 pounds a month
you get 500 minutes of calls unlimited
text and a gigabyte of 4G data of course
you are going to want more data it
doesn't offer an unlimited package but
for 18 pounds you can get five gig of
data a five gig is a lot and it's kind
of an air she going to get to unlimited
I mean I am a pretty heavy user and I
don't tend to use more than about three
in a moment well so I've got a lot I'm
always like this cuz I'm on giffgaff and
so that I mean it's always been a great
deal for me I mean they actually do cell
phones out but if you if you buy if you
haven't owned a phone already yeah and
you can see a gift sack giffgaff sim in
there I have unlimited 3g data for 12
pounds which is fantastic I've been
having that for years on a few years you
know I've never really had any problems
with it I've always been really happy
yeah so yeah yeah like you don't use
gift after you know no okay what do you
feel about the advantage let me ask you
about the advantage of buying the phone
outright and popping in a giffgaff sim
or from like three like a similar only
plan is up it's not better cheaper
another sounds right that's all right
speaking of buying a new phone well
speaking about on your phone if you do
want anything you want it for cheap
microsoft has the first microsoft phone
now the ink has dried on Microsoft
buyout of Nokia's so this is a nokia
lumia phone but the naki name is no
longer there so this is the Microsoft
Lumia 535 so that so that's the official
name that they shuttered on it's just a
Microsoft Lumia
so thankfully it's not Microsoft devices
which is kind of how it was playing
itself a little bit before this phone
which is asking me a mouthful a
Microsoft devices Leumi no no no you
actually tried to 75 350 yeah I so I
went hands-on with this phone it's nice
it's kind of fun it's it's exactly where
they expect from thee from if it was a
Nokia Lumia that they haven't done
anything different its own people right
just but all the same people all the
same everything else it's just but only
the branding is different yeah it's nice
you know it's 5 inches so it's fairly
big but it's it's fairly slim it's got
some colorful interchangeable cases
which nakia always well before and got
my new windows phone 8.1 software only
thing is it doesn't have 4g so you want
to get your cheap giffgaff sim it's not
going to is not going to function
properly with the fiber there are I mean
I've just got a nokia 1320 which is yeah
he finds that sets that's but yeah i'm
trying i like that the 535 will be very
cheap it's going to be about 109 euros
so about the 70 quid mark so that is
very so you know forgivable that you
don't have 4g because as well if you
want a phone it's that cheap and you
probably don't want to pay extra for 4G
so you'd be happy I'm just going for as
you say the unlimited 3g 12 pounds deal
rather than page 18 for a lot of 4G data
so like I know everyone would agree I
was concern oh um trem tram in the
comment says i'm not sure why someone
would consider this phone over the Moto
G even compared to the 2013 edition
unless they really didn't want android
people don't ya salacious puck meanwhile
says that's amazing specs for a $150
Phone and Windows Phone and Windows
Phone sorry is actually bearable on
low-end hardware unlike Android actually
bearable they should know they should
put that on the phones emboss I have
something to say about that over here as
i'm sure you your long-term listeners
may be where are you saying that it's
actually not there yes possibly about no
I'm final minutes phone I think it's
more than bearable I think if it does
get mean that's for more than bearable
yeah
one and a half stars and that's I mean
that's the whole point of firm of
Windows Phone isn't it that it is
designed to be to work with hardware so
that you can have a really cheap phone
and you still get the exact same
software experience as you get with with
any you know any other phone yeah
exactly if I have anything it's it's
almost better on the low end because it
doesn't take as much to run so this
phone is on the ghoul core processor but
it's still really really Swift if
anything you get less value from Windows
Phone at the high end when you're paying
500 pounds for a flagship nokia phone
but you're getting the exact same
experience like things like camera and
screen quality increases but the
software and and how you navigate that
software doesn't differ at all I agree
with you absolutely Andy those expensive
windows phones are a ripoff um what does
an actual branding decision then what do
we think about the the idea of change or
form taro Bors what I think I think it's
all bull who wants someone who thinks is
gumming short not here wasn't cool but
Microsoft is your way cool well the
thing is you know even if you're going
to give nokia any kind of cool points
Microsoft has where your cool points
yeah than that so whatever you say think
about nokia microsoft is worse like yeah
and of course especially for us in
europe work naki obviously a european
company yeah in brand was hugely famous
and sort of beloved yeah you know if
like famous house of all the fashions
for your 3210 exactly everyone's
everyone's snake it was everyone's first
phone everyone has a drawer at home with
one of those old nokia charges in it
somewhere and so there's a lot of
goodwill behind the name so yeah I'm sad
that it's gone hmm I mean Microsoft is a
more famous name maybe makes more sense
in the US well absolutely I mean what
it's a woulda bucks more coincidental
well t feel good says claim says i don't
understand the logic why ditch such a
well-known brand when it's known for
creating decent hardware microsoft not
so much if only nokia chosen android and
not Windows Phone their story would be a
whole lot different um I would take
issue with that as we have discussed
previously i'm not sure that Nokia's
fate would have been different if it had
gone for Android because if you look at
the companies that are making android
vines today they're great phones but
it's not really working out especially
well for the companies that make them so
even Samsung which is by far the company
that's done the best out of Android and
is now really struggling because it just
finds get cheaper and cheaper and
cheaper and it's sort of its what what
industry onlooker crystal ball gazer
types like to call a race to the bottom
hmm so that's a really good point I'd
like to hear you elaborate on that even
further on video is there some some way
that could happen no no but you could
try I don't think it'll work but you
could try searching cnet adventures in
tech nokia android in google again i
don't think it'll work but you could try
but a visiting possibility a video about
nokia and android might pop like a like
a North no point in my testimony small
it's like life you know life in here one
in ten yeah alright what else is going
on um is it a good phone for Microsoft
them is it a good phone for Microsoft
well let's hear what the people have to
say yeah King WR says it would have made
more sense to choose a flagship phone to
switch to the Microsoft branding and to
do it with some fanfare I just can't
figure out how Microsoft continues to be
so inept at branding themselves ouch
they have all the money in the world why
can't they get good marketing talent or
advice harsh words i disagree i don't
think it makes any sense to go in all
guns blazing with a big flagship why
hundy enemy parade well it was a great
with it was a great faculty quote from
you know a great man the classic film
faculty uh you know if you want to take
over the world you don't go and blow up
the White House Independence Day style
you sneak in through the back door you
know it's about it's about it's about
going slowly and getting people sort of
used to it on the cheap red which is 0
pitch is in the area that Nokia does
incredibly well it click about the ashes
and stuff in install Asian markets hmm
that's what it's doing it is nice words
for lies late 90s sci-fi horror comedy
maybe if anybody is a good film the only
Elijah Wood played a blinder perfect who
maybe if anything Microsoft should be
making less of his phones over there to
be absolutely no posters and there
should be one in carphone warehouse or
something on a shelf and it's also what
what's that colorful fight over there
they quickly like pull pull the curtain
over it that's nothing don't you worry
about that well a lot of people would
argue that is what they're already doing
what Nokia don't know but have you seen
the Samsung s5 no well that's this is
exciting stuff but I think the big news
the week has to be the fact we've landed
a washing machine on a comet or
something Andy what's the news come at
me bro well that sir is exactly it's you
have said it we have put a washing
machine on a comment no it's the rosetta
mission yeah and now this was this has
been in 10 years in the making as it
were we're ten years ago we fired out a
probe into space and it's been it's been
using planets gravitation 22 not
whiplash whistling shuttle a slingshot
thank you around to gain speed into
action my bursting lot with whiplash
yeah we finally found a way to to catch
up with a comet and it's actually landed
on a comet we have we have landed
something on a comment we have landed
something on a comet in a meeting that
one more time yeah we humans have landed
something on a comet it's daddy's
incredible a comment is traveling four
times the speed of a speeding bullet
apparently and they've they've Grable
standing he nearly went wrong didn't it
had some harpoon whom problems and sort
of bounced into abandoned while they
think might be a crater so it may be in
slightly the wrong position we were
almost writing its orbit chew area I'd
already get on so we have old for
applause all bit so this is that this
the thing yes so it semi was supposed to
like fire a harpoon and real itself in
but some excite scientists there it's
supposed to really something but now
they've they've kind of landed and
harpoons didn't fire but they don't fly
the harpoons now in case they ping
themselves also spake you're just
sitting there waiting on the whale he's
waiting for that space whale I mean just
I mean we've had a couple of good
comments about this the kind of sum up
how how big that an achievement this is
yes we have um ldi 17 I do 17 it tells
not matter says it was following a hell
of a complicated and many years long
path with several planetary gravity
assist flybys just to avoid having to
carry an impractical amount of fuel
imagine doing the orbital calculations
for all that and making sure you got it
right well and on top of that they have
to calculate a trajectory for dropping
filler
village that's a robot like like filet o
fish but it's actually filet o space
they couldn't afford to put any
propulsion or guidance on that so they
have to let it loose at just the right
speed and direction yeah in just the
right time to that seven hours later it
will fall onto the rubber ducky at just
the right point and hopefully not too
fast otherwise it will bounce off again
and be lost in space lost in space we
should point out is that the comet is
rubber duck shaped which is why it stays
rubber ducky yeah yeah it's incredible I
mean it's a fantastic example I'm it is
European to mention so Austrians built
the anchor the fins provided the memory
for the command sister who built the
harpoons it's designed by the hungarian
a sturdy engineering the Germans
produced the flywheel the Italians
provided the solar panels the Irish made
computer process a good good work out of
the Irish Poland come up with a sense
the Dutch help with a descent and the
switch produced panoramic camera with
cameras and a spectrometer as written
came up with blankets apparently boys
also instruments to study I stopped
trying to come across and also some of
the work was done by people who are
studying part-time at the Open
University okay give yourselves a big
hand open university and space
travelers everybody but we not like some
of us could Spacey everybody but you're
not you're not so keen on space travel
are you um I've kind of had my mind
changed a little bit on the sorts of
space exploration in theory i think i've
talked about on podcast again so this
might be sort of like boring and
repetitive fury Felicity's I'm sorry it
was a it was a the podcaster yeah yeah
yeah cuz it was a column I cause Caitlin
Moran she won't think about it and it
was like if we can explore space all we
want but we're not gonna find anything
as good as Earth hmm I was like yeah
actually like Earth isn't like I feel
like people sort of sci-fi fans people
geeky people who can't look out the
stairs ton of any sort pride in earth
but this brilliant it's got like it's
got like polar bears and waterfalls it's
such a good planet okay it's like you
know maybe we should you know just enjoy
this one yeah look inwards maybe well
that's fair enough but I mean you can't
argue that obviously that space travel
is a waste of time and money I mean
things working out there certainly get
LEDs in edit LEDs in medical therapy
we're just about heart-to-heart power
assisting device talk about artificial
limbs scratch resistant lenses space
blankets as every mouth and runner will
be thankful that blanket aircraft
another blanket lobby got in touch with
you
this vodka big blanket winter's coming
you'll be thankful for the researchers
going to these blockages episode we'll
all just be wearing a big blanket yeah
you'll be shipping a home duvet I wore
my black regular radial tires and
firefighting equipment temper foam
enrich baby food portable cordless
vacuums freeze-drying water purification
solar cells are all kinds of software
stuff improved mine safety food safety
all kinds of West it's incredible
actually I'd say the the sort of stuff
we do in the comment comment is really
cool because it isn't sort of about
about trying to abandon earth or
anything it's about finding information
about the the history of the universe
that could be of practical use to us in
the present exactly the origins of life
on Earth and Vista achievement I saw him
on Twitter on a car remember who did it
so I'm afraid I can't credit them but
they said it was along the lines of like
10 years ago hmm we shot something at a
moving target and moving four times the
speed of a speeding bullet and we hit it
with bullseye accuracy yeah Oh five
hundred million advanced kilometers away
it's like it that is mind-blowing shesh
that we can do that yeah like it sits
safely assume i like how we're all using
this we in the same way that we use like
yeah its humanity humanity has done this
we have to we have to rally around it
well i don't think i have been any help
I mean unless maybe some taxes i paid
helped but it to be honest i think
probably in some way I'm sure indirectly
I've been more of a hindrance it wasn't
a date or anything was it they didn't
moral support murrells bubble is an
incredible achievement and we're very
proud to welcome to yeah he was involved
coming back down to earth with a bump
now speaking of amazing achievement
hearing me more amazing things coming
from the samsung ray hey Sam Samsung has
a whole load of new things from its
developer conference in San Francisco
and that is in America UK listeners so
they have him have a few he had a few
things they have something called the
sim band or Sinbad the sailor as I
Amanda sighs I'm and the sailors like to
call it the flow the gear VR and project
beyond I'm going to tell you a little
bit more about the
in depth so actually our sim bantha well
tell you about Sinbad yes it's in band
is it looks very much like the gear rest
it's like a wearable watch of the big
curved screen but this is really focused
on health it's got a lot more health
trackers to to check like blood flow EKG
body temperature skin temperature like
kind of thing like actually useful
information rather than just being a
terrible pedometer which is what nearly
all health tracking things do this
actually potentially has some medical
use because it also stores this
information on to Samsung is working on
like a cloud storage for health
information that can be shared with like
NHS and with doctors and things so as
particularly important if you're am sort
of having that your heart rate or blood
pressure and a constant monitoring by
your doctor is if I want to go into the
the doctor surgery every week and
wasting their time in having your object
your body checked over and stuff this
can be constantly monitoring it and so
your doctor can just be alerted if he
sees anything going wrong if he says
okay this is going bad your heart rate
constantly to high when you check you
out but it may well be that takes 8-10
weeks pass and you don't need to go in
and waste the time that's got your
daughter can text you and be like calm
down yeah I'll sit down comet this hole
connect connected health is it's going
to be it's going to be a very big deal
it is it really cool I mean obviously
the big question though is this at this
is early days this kind of stuff from
the big question is accuracy of these
are consumer products they're not
medical grade products and one of the
things kind of we were talking earlier
about Norton's podcast but the news that
the NHS considering a kite mark for
health apps yeah so it's obviously kind
of moving towards this idea of kind of
these these equipment these had these
apps these these wearables becoming
actually kind of medical-grade to
actually be able to connect you and your
hair giver or your health yeah a
professional to like that will make a
difference I think it's fantastic your
chili exciting well quite a lot of them
are more for is for tracking a condition
rather than diagnosing it so it's not
that some of them aren't accurate enough
to really say here's what you have but
they can monitor its progress in and be
able to pick up on signs they should be
checked out further by and by dr. we saw
that actually got a real big body of
data is yeah we saw that I was serving
body yeah
we covered from the UK trade investment
thing last year we saw there was an app
that you can track potential skin cancer
blemishes on your skin you can take
photos of it you can't say for certain
whether or not oh that blemish on this
one day is to cancerous but it can track
its progress and if the app can register
that is getting worse or changing size
and shape or color it can then alert
that and tell you you should go and get
this checked out now okay so powerful
stuff I feel useful alright so what else
have we seen what's what's flow tell us
a bit about flow Luke you like miss
winters what about flying my eyes I
should have risotto flow is like
Samsung's answer to Apple's continuity
basically so it's a sort of way of
moving programs and processes between
devices we don't know a whole lot more
than that at the moment so apples
handoff thing that allows you to sort of
text and make calls from your computer
via your iPhone kind of thing yeah yeah
that's right um but okay well we'll find
that bit more about this as fun guys I
think that in you the other thing about
it though is that sort of iphone getting
in trouble for saying this but Apple is
more the kind of company where you tend
to sort of by all of the things okay so
met that okay I can see the the comments
lighting up already yeah he sounds just
like the little switches go okay but let
let's let him complete the thought
commenters little it's not going to get
any better but the fools not gonna it's
better but I mean like who owns all the
Samsung stuff you know those chase so
you buy you'd bite you might buy an imac
and then you might buy an iphone but no
one goes out and goes where I'm gonna
get a samsung laptop and I'm gonna get a
samsung there well I think certainly
like many men like fewer people do
enough so then I think like flowers
maybe young when you think of the
ecosystem around some song you think of
Android rather than thinking smell
that's the thing you you were definitely
by if you view you definitely buy an
android phone and an Android tablet we
wouldn't it early by Samsung for both
which is obviously Apple is the only
company that does iOS that's why you
would have the same idea you would have
the same operating system across things
because other than alex has no choice
yeah exactly you've more apps for iPhone
I don't to buy them again for an Android
tablet so that's why you'll buy the same
and same goes for but again you'd have
an HTC phone maybe in a samsung tablet
or I
the other thing is that Samsung phones
and samsung laptops are so different
well Apple that apple really is one of
the only tech companies and makes
different categories of devices that all
sort of have Rizzuto together Yale
anyway yeah in terms of yeah that's good
well we'll be keeping an eye on all this
stuff as well one of things I thought
was interesting was the gear VR device
this is Samsung's virtual reality
headset you put it on and you can be and
you know in a game or oh yeah widget
alee I think I seems to because I the
other week i was at web summit event
which is big kind of tech conference in
dublin and one of the events that i went
to was I saw her ass back kind of
keynote presentation by the founder of
oculus who make the oculus rift headset
which is kind of the headset that that
has kicked off interest in virtual
reality again and one of the things they
said is that one of the things they're
worried about is that these big rivals
like Sony like Samsung are going to come
in and try and make these these kind of
products to kind of capture this virtual
reality interest around and he's a bit
worried that he says he's worried that
they're going to come in too early and
they're gonna have a product isn't ready
that hasn't solved the problems of like
motion sickness or whatever and that
might lead to because he was buying the
Sony device let's project Morpheus or
buying the Samsung gear VR and then
getting sick and then going all virtual
reality doesn't work so it's kind of
interesting to see where these guys are
up to and and whether they are going to
rush this product out to kind of capture
this psycho also it's an oculus is
basically saying you're ruining it mmm
cuz oculus are taking their sweet time
putting out a device they haven't been
that many thing that yeah you're making
it yeah and Sam so much ism term yes to
it be mean to call Samsung's rushed when
it means that I had to go in it and we
had a demo where am it's a camera
underneath a helicopter going over like
a glacier and I'm wearing and looking
around and as the helicopter is going
over I'm looking around like a look up
and I can see the helicopter and I can
look all as I'm moving around its
seamlessly was really really good
simulates being tied to the under
similar exactly similar to terror of
simulate the white bars gripping on
helical but the gear VR is basically
it's just a shell for a galaxy note you
have to have it's not it's not doesn't
have its own screen projection so if you
put your phone inside basically this
this holder and yeah it's the the unit
itself has all the sensors and got
controls on it so it's you know it's
more than just a shell of plastic on
your face I mean rush
rushing into a market with something
cheap mmm sort of Samsung's whole thing
no they're really d'etre yeah exactly
you know it's like if I was a 1920s
detective yeah and it was a crime scene
yeah and the crime was someone had
rushed into a market with a the cheaper
cheaper version of a successful product
yes I'd be like get down to the Samsung
club should we call up the usual
suspects no need no need the same
problem we've got with them with the MVR
and stuff like this it seemed like we
had with 3d there's not enough content
that you capture you might have to do
with it we've seen demos of Armani
oculus rift I'm on I'm on a roller
coaster great I said you have a quick
demo and that's it yeah but what a
project beyond is that samsung also
discussed at San Francisco is a X camera
that can film in 360 degrees okay the
idea being that you can actually take
this out and you can go and wander
through any other grand canyon and
that's in the United States English
listeners yeah and then film this stuff
meant example they're bigger yeah you
can eat cucumber yes then you've got
something to actually theoretically then
should watch back using the VR headset
and you can actually look around as you
would have done when you were walking
there and holiday if there's a game a
consumer product actually well it's
still early days but you can find out
more about all this these new pieces of
kit on cnet com look out for that also
speaking of Samsung yes Samsung has been
doing some sneaky little sliding into
the Avengers 2 trailer safely yeah Phil
which you you wrote about today that's
true so there's a new extended trailer
for the age of Ultron which is the
second Avengers movie featuring Iron Man
Thor Black Widow Hawkeye and ya gotta
say how he seamlessly I passed that on
to you because I have no idea about no
fair enough that was good no one would
have noticed if you hadn't just drawn
attention to its jay way yeah what's
worse is what something about this about
this is that it is sort of Samsung
sponson obviously Samsung's done a big
product placement deal I imagine there's
a lot of money change hands because
Black Widow is she's in shield
headquarters wherever and she's looking
at some stuff on a tablet and yep it's a
samsung tablet and also later on there's
a fight in a samsung shop so I'm petite
looking forward to seeing if the Samsung
shop gets smashed up
yoki oral trends but then in a durable
phone screens you scratch resistant
absolutely look I will pick one up it'll
be his only line in the film he'd be
like my goodness this hasn't been
scratched at all because like everyone
will be like quiet Oh Hulk's doing
something he'll he's doing something but
what is interesting about this as well
as the Iron Man has switched sides his
switch loyalties going a supervillain no
he's switching loyalties when it comes
to mobile phones because in there in the
early iron man movie star you know Julia
Iron Man a Tony Stark in fact he carried
an LG phone oh now he's am so now we're
such dorks yeah hey still they still
sticking with android though so he
didn't want to lose on his apps yeah oh
yeah obviously it's important to the
Android ecosystem is a google boy quite
obviously okay well moving on to more
film things yeah hang on before we
before you at your point to make about
it actually you have something Satan
about plots to take over the world yeah
so Sean um Thanos and see when we were
talking earlier I want to just get this
out into the public space so super
villains in comics and coming book
movies whatever they might try something
an evil scheme you're sort of trying to
get an object yeah I think you were
telling me that in the Avengers the
Avenger bus is coming do-do-do-do-do
it's it's some kind of glove I think
most I think they're trying to get the
tesseract and then it's something to do
with the Infinity Gauntlet I envisioned
it has such a great banquettes I Thanos
we see in the end of the First Avenger
bus is coming moving yeah that he's got
a big are they made of sorts of space
whales yep robot space wells and like
robot aliens on space bicycles yeah
which is which is a really powerful army
space hairdresser and his mate is a
rogue yeah yeah yeah I'm kind of
wondering yeah should Thanos be thinking
I need to get a glove that makes me even
stronger because he's really strong
here's or glad to get Brooke exactly or
should he be directing mmm forces he
does have in a more efficient way okay
and and I would draw a parallel to it
like the superheroes and always win hmm
they don't find a glove yeah that makes
them win yeah spider-man doesn't get new
shoes or like Thor isn't like our this
this cardigan makes me more powerful so
now I win easily cardigan of us go the
car to get the cut cut get now come in a
run base it's already million
um yeah it's got again he has got there
it is very side mirrors there in that so
much they are Scotty so yeah I wonder if
maybe super villain should stop trying
to find thing that makes them stronger
and just try and maybe sort of like grow
as people or just come up with a better
plan if you've got a space whale yes
don't be like I'll send it to New York
where Thor and Iron Man the whole car
send it I don't know blow up the Sun
let's just leave you like super villains
they don't need super weapons they need
efficiency experts basically they to
channel the resource they need a
consultant like me yes that's chase I
have to hit me up on Twitter super
villains also there is a big film
opening quickly this this weekend in UK
cinemas which were very excited about
yes I'm gonna have a straight back to
you the Gaza it's something about an
elite combat let's shoot it so no we may
have reached peak cumberbatch lately but
this is quite exciting it's erm it's
film about Alan Turing and the Bletchley
Park code breakers is called the
imitation game sat this week and I saw
it recently it's a it's a good
performance for Cumberbatch it's an
interesting film even if you do know the
store expect tragic story of Alan Turing
sadly and even if you do another story
it's got us quite some interesting
context an extra details and it kind of
ties in the story with some interesting
contemporary concerns about surveillance
and and sort of and you know
intelligence and how intelligence is
used and reasons for going to war and
all this kind of thing so it seems like
velvet takes a few historical liberties
but it's it's a good starting point if
you don't with that too familiar with
the story then i would recommend it it's
worth worth seeing your smashing sea
cucumber patch doing a spain you
certainly do ok well as right what we're
gonna do now is gonna move straight on
to the quiz exciting who's going to go
ahead ribs let's do it to move on
okay so yes it's quiz time the
leaderboard currently stands at Jason is
on five Luke is on five and ears on 40 I
need your Swansea if Andy's come back
this weapons when you go off
gallivanting taking photos of stuff no
this is what happens when you do a quiz
entirely about superhero films well then
what about you'll enjoy this week's quiz
it's all about superior films next night
everybody MIT's space and other things
and ugly space question one how many
years is a Spock have no I'm only
kidding that's that's that's one of the
questions how many left it right its
final frontier oh that was a real
question all right points sorry real
question number one how many tales does
comet have Luke how many tales come home
to that's the right answer Joe what
they're made of one's made a fire and
ones made of ice I glass enough ones a
dust trail what is a plasma trail but
that sir yeah yeah yeah dust is just ice
in space absolutely okay then questions
sea lions good science well done
everybody question 2 what is a calm its
perihelion and the oil its biggest
embarrassment is close one way that is
not the Quran salute during a show yeah
sure okay just buzzing in for formality
um was using a para perihelion Harry
helium yeah I'm saying that correctly
science experts is it it is it it's the
shape of its orbit that's all that's
pretty close it's very it is involved
the orbit I can't give you the point but
it's very personal but is actually the
closest point in a comet's orbit to the
Sun but you were on the right lines
you're on the right jeck turi you might
say I've got a pretty good instinct for
comments I think you think you have yeah
and a final question Andy its all to
play for here question 3 halley's comet
is visible from Earth roughly every 75
years legend has it those sightings
coincide with momentous events in human
history name one event in human history
that's been linked to a sighting of
Halley's Comet
does anyone know you're gonna buzz in
Andy question yep right there I am going
to say the Queen's coronation Queen's
coronation is not linked Halley's Comet
I'm afraid nightbat night yeah not bad
leaking out go should have googled it
while he wasn't saying oh yeah cause I'm
gonna have a go yeah um well if I only
knew I'm sure we sure it's been there in
my lifetime it has a so so it's like
let's slice quite a 2000 so 75 years
what's that starts egg-mobile ah is not
the correct answer I'm afraid you could
have had some things like the Battle of
Hastings is one famous one which mark
our producer was no worse for you nobody
was looking well i was i was looking at
but he started doing it after i had
already buzzed in mark wasn't at the
battle of it actually if anyone was was
going to actually you've been out the
battle of hastings would have been mad
well oh yeah and so the winner is this
week it's luke well done congratulations
leak do you have to sign break of it ok
how many ways i'll go i'll give you the
time i care not to land on comet 67p the
Rosetta probe had to match speed with
the comet and how fast is comet 67p
hurtling through space in miles per hour
in what so miles per hour oh I only nine
kilometers um hang on let me just carry
the one a 67 million that's interesting
guess yeah um okay i'm already lost
trailer the correct answer is 40,000
miles per hour so that wait no no lies
give me give me give me a second to
think okay go on and they have a nice
forget it forty thousands o is the
correct yeah only that was worth
something but i get a point back I don't
think you do that if I leave this
podcast with my pride intact take that
doubter I think that ship has sailed
that that rocket ship does that
like hanging back to pick up critical
supplies rich and I boarded it and I am
off to can't come back to pick a LAN
device glory I think I fuel to make one
exit this quiz is degenerating into
intuitive burning up in the atmosphere
it's decaying orbit anyway so why don't
we want to hear what you guys been
saying in this week's feedback
yes feedback time yes feedback time
Phillip Thompson says which do you think
is better out of the following okay so I
want you guys quick VAR responses on
this sega megadrive oz net mmm Mega
Drive sonic or Mario Sonic mmm pac-man
or miss pac-man flu I'm not a big game
road I don't this come out put my man
specially space invaders or asteroids oh
ok I have an opinion on this one space
invaders but that's because I'm in my
commodore 64 when am I tape operated
Commodore 64 for our younger viewers and
this is that we went UA a game while you
waited for the game to load off the tape
you played another game in the meantime
you got two games so I was waiting for
Ghostbusters to load I'd play space
invaders are you older than time itself
I am I certainly is why I was born when
the last time halley's comet came and
doing me yeah there you go Craig Higgins
says what do you think about the latest
elite dangerous game that's our elite
dangerous yeah we actually put this to
Nick who is our resident sort of
spacefaring strategy real-time
excitement game person and Nick said and
I haven't played it but it looks
spectacularly ambitious and realistic
it's very interesting that such a
hardcore game sad such Essex has has had
such success in crowdfunding and I'd
love to play it with oculus looking
around your pit in 3d would be
amazing look around a cockpit in 3d
would be amazing that is very very cheap
yeah what else is going on Martin Leo
David Robertson says yeah very simple
question who will be the judge of that
Martin yeah do you believe that the very
limited hardware of the new next-gen
consoles will hold back the development
of better more involved games as the
hardware wouldn't be able to handle it
and you I think no I don't particularly
agree with the statement that they are
already limited hardware really well no
quite potent rabigh several point they
were why do you think that Martin Leo
DVD is that I think it's because and
it's a fair enough observation is
because this is really the first console
generation I think we're there hasn't
been a massive visual obvious visual
improvement over the previous generate
but I don't think this is really sort of
Sony and Microsoft being limited I think
it's just they sort of cobbled together
the best hardware that they could not
the time together well they're just like
yeah this is like this is this is like
posh hard way and so it's what they do
every sort of console generation so you
know throw it together girl it was good
at the time in seven years already yeah
they take whatever they sort of think
they can afford to put in a little box
in your living room I suppose it just
unexcited it feels like you have to
future-proof consoles go they do hang
around for a lot longer than yeah they
do they do but on the other hand
developers um if you look at it like
consoles like the xbox 360 if you look
at the games when that launched compared
to the games at the end of its life span
yeah there's sort of difference in in
gameplay and graphics and everything was
vast so if you give developers time to
get to grips with the hardware then and
we'll probably see there the actual
consoles iterate as well I mean they
will probably be upgrades in the
meantime film maybe maybe okay all right
Phillip Thompson yes um who asked
there's no question from earlier says do
you have any idea on if or when 4G might
be coming to virgin mobile it seems
strange I don't offer it yet as they are
an MVNO using EE / oranges and that's
right mvno is what we're talking about
with gift Kathy yeah I said that I think
they're wonderful s I was wrong
obviously virgin mobile are yet to
announce any 4g so yeah we spoke to the
end of end of October I think and then
they said they have no no plans but yeah
actually I was fishing in them forums
and found them someone with that kind of
official forum tag said they have no
news on 4G as of late October as always
knocked over but we will keep you posted
just like with you with giffgaff so keep
your eyes peeled lovely aren't we like
that mark Alvarez says when is Android L
coming to the nexus 4 good question when
is it we have some good news on that
it's actually available from now really
so if you do have a nexus 4 or nexus 5
or a link Nexus 7 as well tablet you
head into settings and check for your
software updates you should find some
lollipop goodness although they sort of
tend to go in way tend to go in waves
and stuff done
it might if it's not a panic yeah
hopefully I'll be very soon yeah but
hopefully by the time you hear this
because we're recording it now so
fingers crossed the time you hear or
gotta get out of this in the exactly
yeah we reported a couple days ago so
but I tell you here it will be now and
then Oh God anyway this no well it says
what advances are happening with google
glasses are they more discreet etc
something else to look for during exam
times yeah it's come quiet I've only
since they went on sale in the UK mmm
yes yeah has been quiet it was a big
thing and one was super excited and they
had all those cool videos of habit is
what Google glass is going to do and it
was big deal and went to tail of us and
then they have their big lunch in the UK
and nothing else has really happened
we've not heard anything about new
software updates or new versions
probably because Google is spending so
much time working on new Android and
Android wear which Android wear is kind
of taking a lot of functionality that
we're hoping to have with Google glass
and putting into the watch so maybe
we'll sometimes now L is out there we
might see some updates to you well
that's the last I mean to be fair you
can you can get some designer frames has
been a few different frames sir so you
can look a little bit more discreetly
look a bit more like actual classes but
you do still look a bit like a nerd
really on it yes it's a big one for size
to stuff to the side of them this blue
or orange like you can't disguise that
who some nice frames no and mr. mantis
messy house guests sorry five mangled
that pronunciation I sincerely apologize
pretty good I like that well I mean it
was again if it was if it was correct it
was good um says the new imac game
changer or just a fancy ripoff well how
much is it before we discuss with a
triple dance at 2,000 pounds um it's
it's neither of those things I'm afraid
it's not it no it's not it's not a rip
off because it's a 5k screen 5k and it's
got us a really powerful tech and then
but it's not really a game change and
we've already got very high resolution
like monitors that you can buy so if you
really into graphics and photography and
designers definitely need high
resolution if you want to go and get
that but it's not can afford it and you
want the fanciest desks yeah it does a
good job but it's expensive
it's it's like it's just fine it's not
other things and on that modest note the
feedback is concluded that is the end en
oh well thanks very much for the
feedback everybody thanks for your
questions keep coming keep the feedback
coming by emailing us on you email
address cnet you play podcast at CBS
