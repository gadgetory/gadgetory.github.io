that are allergic to accidents Wow and
worrying about parts for your car down
the road time to check the tech EC cars
differently
you love them on the road and under the
hood but also check the tech and are
known for telling it like it is ugly is
included at no extra cost the good the
bad the bottom line this is CNN on cars
welcome to see net on cars to show all
about high-tech cars and modern driving
i'm brian coulis well it wasn't that
long ago that we first met the new Ford
GT January 2015 at the Detroit Auto Show
where it was an unexpected surprise
unveil and the initial story was lots of
power
audacious styling exotic materials to be
honest we've heard that song before in
the supercar cannon what was really
interesting was our more recent trip to
Ford Silicon Valley Research Institute
where we got a look at the car from a
different angle and learned that less
truly is more when it comes to the new
GT
let's face it we hear about lightweight
technology in the auto industry all the
time but for most car buyers
it doesn't really print but what
lightweight is all about is everything
that a vehicle is all about better
performance better fuel efficiency which
leads to lower emissions and better
handling dynamics in every direction the
vehicle goes
committed to this epic is becoming for
GT 600 plus horsepower from a turbo v6
mounted in the middle on an aluminum
subframe behind a carbon fiber centered
tub driving the rear wheels to be honest
that architecture has been done before
and you can buy a 700 horsepower Dodge
Challenger for 60 grand so what's really
going on here
it's how the new GT will seek
performance by burdening itself less
lighter weight and less envelope the
vehicle's physical outline it's the
essential story of this car now ROG this
is such a big effort got a car with
incredible performance but it's got less
weight less bolt right so our
performance you know now is a lot about
efficiencies if you look at our latest
f-150 all aluminum body we took more
than 700 pounds out of that vehicle and
there all the attributes get better when
you take weight out improve your fuel
efficiency we can soften up the
suspension the ride gets better so it
all feeds on itself some of the parts
we're seeing that you're also displaying
here have a lot of carbon reinforced
plastics things that were exotic and
used in small volumes you're seeing this
is a high-volume technique to make a lot
of parts in affordable cars well we can
use performance vehicles to prove out
some technologies then bring it to high
volume iterate the designs take those
learnings and bring it to high volume
mainstream manufacturing so what used to
be went on Sunday sell on Monday is now
lightweight on Sunday absolutely for the
engineer it's it's win on Sunday and
then take that and mainstream on Monday
how important is it to use carbon fiber
versus aluminum carbon fiber is lighter
and it's strong and as a designer what
it does is give me greater flexibility
to create unique forms that I can't
create in steel and aluminium one of
these flying buttresses are one that you
point out why couldn't you have made
those flying buttresses out of aluminum
we hear that all the time we couldn't
have done that in metal steel or
aluminium needs to be pressed it needs
to have you need to have a die and it's
and you have maximum draw depth and then
you have radiuses which which are really
restricting based on your maximum depth
of draw it would tear or be too thin
yeah we too thin I wouldn't get the draw
depth between between this point and
this point yeah in a tool put the first
things you notice is you come back like
so is this thing gets real narrow real
fast in fact you could reach across and
touch the other glass it's three key
factors in creating the ultimate
performance call one is lightweight
second is aerodynamics it has a really
really tapered cabin it's really narrow
at the cabin and it allows us also to
manage the airflow much better than on a
traditional full volume car this
tapering here helps the wind to see less
car yes as it's coming yes we would
normally think the face is kind of where
it all in so a normal car you would fill
out this volume that you just ever
because would be here but imagine how
much that's a foot that's yeah on each
side which I'm not pushing through the
air we're managing the airflow to direct
it straight onto the aero devices like
the real witches and we hear so much
about light weight of products but it's
also light footprint the rage in
supercars these days has been hybrid
Porsches 918
Maurice laferrari the McLaren p1 but to
stay light and lean Ford skip the added
motor big battery in the inverter that
would have meant weight and volume to
put somewhere less under the skin means
less skin to move through the air main
reasons we chose this engine is it is
compact it's one of our you know
mainstream engines yes it's got a little
bit you know few of the components a
little bit more exotic with a little
more the foundations of this car are the
same that's in your f-150 and it allows
us to shrink wrap all this body around
this engine it also produces high power
over 600 horsepower from this engine
it's also fuel efficient if we didn't
need the extra two cylinders why do why
do we need to put them on if they added
weight and they added fuel consumption
yeah yeah I did we need them as I look
at it here I see these buttresses come
back and they seem to almost be
supporting these these pods over the
rear wheels what's in there is an
intercooler there's a vent a grill on
the front it's real isn't it's an
intercooler and ray
later the air feeds through the buttress
so it's not just that that is your bleed
off to go in into the air feeds into
that your intake run yes
so we exhaust the air through the middle
of the lamps these engineering ideas
created great aesthetic design ideas you
know it's it's a beautiful looking thing
yeah right but it's also clever
and innovative and in it and that
balance between looking amazing but also
delivering a clever solution is what
this car is all about
now lightweight technologies do have
some hurdles they tend to be exotic in
terms of rapid workflow and production
they tend to be more expensive right now
as we've heard about some of the carbon
fiber technologies and let's face it the
auto industry is one that is known for
inertia doing things the way it's done
things although that's changing quite a
bit lately
still the GTS wholesale light weighting
approach is a leading-edge look at what
is and will increasingly happen to
mainstream cars light weighting is no
longer optional or limited to cars in
the stratosphere like this it makes
every motion a car accomplishes better
and does it with less energy
now all the specs and hard details I
know you're craving like its performance
numbers and of course its price are
still out in the future away this car
doesn't go into production for 2016 and
arise as a model 2017 and you can bet
they'll be spoken for prior to hitting
showrooms now we may differ on
self-driving versus the joy of driving
but nobody takes any joy in the dumbest
part of driving a collision but your
next car may not even allow them as the
smarter driver we'll find out when you
see that on cars returns
along the way to the fully self-driving
car we're going to make a few stops one
of which will be the crash proof car the
concept is a car with sufficiently
sophisticated driver assist technology
that it can avoid or alert you to avoid
almost any collision ESP initiates a
one-sided braking intervention that can
move the vehicle out of the danger zone
that's a talent that is distinct from
being able to drive itself Volvo's new
xc90 for example is a first step toward
its goal of crash free or at least
injury from crash free cars by 2020
among the tech to get it there is
automatic braking to prevent frontal
collisions automatic braking to avoid
turning left into oncoming traffic
pedestrian and animal detection Road
edge and barrier detection adaptive
cruise control with steering assistance
and vehicle-to-vehicle communications
none of this is science fiction
although the v2v technology is still
being brokered between regulators and
car makers at CES Ford gave a very
realistic look of coming v2v technology
that can let cars signal each other Wow
providing another layer of inputs to
help them avoid collisions really
important and efficient way to run
someone is the audible warnings I heard
a difference of room shaking okay which
means get out the way warning exactly
yeah BMW is showing how an array of
laser scanners looking out from around
the car can detect almost anything that
is about to occupy the same space as the
vehicle the purest definition of a
collision from another car to a
pedestrian to a wall we need to keep in
mind that the driver is the best sensor
that we have however drivers do time to
get distracted and we need to bring him
back into the loop which we do by
providing the warning and assisting him
with the braking situation the European
Union is aiming for zero road fatalities
by 2050 and sooner than that
cutting them in half by 2020 largely
relying on these kinds of technology
bundles even in showrooms today it pays
to double check if the car you're
considering buying has as many of these
technologies as possible on the march
toward crash proof driving
welcome back to CNN on cars coming to
you from our home at the Mount Tam Motor
Club just north of the Golden Gate
Bridge well it's early days for the
Apple watch of course and separate from
Apple's incursion in the dash with their
carplay technology the watch is already
getting a bit of a head start on a lot
of wrists as a way to make driving
perhaps a little easier hopefully a
little better makes for a good car tech
101 Apple's Tim Cook has gone so far as
to suggest that this their watch well
one day replace the keys to your car and
that elaborate wireless remote we're not
quite there yet
however even in these early days we're
seeing a fair number of apps being
offered by car makers and other car
technology companies to hopefully make
driving a little simpler a little easier
a little better because you're wearing
something smart on your wrist BMWs eye
remote was the first Apple watch car app
we ever saw it came out on the debut day
of the watch and it works with the
company's eye line of highly electrified
vehicles you can do what is basically
telematics that you're used to on your
phone but now on your wrist check the
charge of your car lock the doors unlock
the doors get guidance back to where you
parked it precondition the climate you
can do that easily cuts an electric car
doesn't really need to start the engine
in any sense and you can also see how
the charge is going to map out to where
you might want to go the car will even
through that watch app suggest the best
time to leave to use the least
electricity to get there but again not
really anything you couldn't do on your
phone already
ditto for Porsches app which is the same
basic basket of telematics although it
works in a broader more conventional
array of their cars they apply it to
Cayenne makan and a few others as well
as their 918 hybrid supercar but we're
basically still in the telematics area
Hyundai's blue link app is actually on
Android first since that was the first
SmartWatch platform of any scale but as
of our show today it's still in the
process of being ported to Apple watch
now automatics a popular app you put on
your phone it talks to an obd to
wireless dongle you stick up under your
dash and it gives you all kinds of
information about your trips your
driving style for economy or safety also
where you parked your car and which
trips you want to tag as expensable for
business now in terms of their watch app
they've chosen to keep things pretty
lean and taken just those last two
functions where's my car and tag this
trip as business expense and port those
to the watch as the primary functions
they can bring everything there they're
just not sure it all belongs here which
i think is good savvy restraint now pay
by phone is one of the class of
connected parking apps that lets you
check your status of the meter feed the
thing find parking spaces in some cases
of these apps it seems like a natural to
have on your wrist that's when you're
away from the car but you want to have a
very quick glanceable reminder that hey
your time is running out and perhaps you
can extend the time right from your ribs
now you don't have to buy a new car to
use Apple watch with it
add-on telematics makers like Viper for
example know that porting their existing
phone apps to Apple watch is a sexy
headline allowing you to go to your
wrist to unlock precondition or get the
location alerts about your car that you
already can get on their phone app and
command a lot of these things by voice
again not new but different
okay a couple of organizing principles
to help you think about where the watch
fits in your driving first they have two
basic locations one is wall driving
glanceable on your wrist which tends to
already be up high and in your view
while you're driving tends to be good
ergonomics and keeps your gaze roughly
where it should be
if those notifications are worthwhile
the other area is of course out of the
car when you're away from the vehicle
and you need something to very quickly
and cleanly remind you that if you need
to get back to your car time running out
on your meter or an easy way to get back
to where your car is if you forgot where
you parked it or tell you if it's
charging or needs to be charged and then
you've got two competing areas of
platforms that are coming to compete
with other perhaps augment the watch and
that would be things like apple carplay
and android auto which are going to
bring a lot of this smartphone DNA to a
richer fixed display in the dash that is
better integrated with the car you've
also got to keep an eye on head-up
display which car makers are going
headlong to adopt and that can give you
an extremely elegant presentation
information right where your glance
already is and should be
and again highly integrated to the
vehicle either way the watch is showing
some early legs for the driver but as
with most of its modes that it's
promising it is yet to promise that it
is better not just different from how
we're doing things now
in a moment how old is too old when it
comes to buying a used car when seen at
on cars returned
what Jaguar needs is a small family exec
saloon something to really hammer home
to the Germans just how good Jags could
be and it hopes the XE is the car for
the job it's taken all its best bits and
put them right where the Germans can see
them now
two questions remain is it worthy of
wearing a Jaguar badge
and should the Germans be afraid can
answer both of those with one word yes

welcome back to CNET on cars i'm brian
coulis so time on the show we take one
of your emails and this one comes in
from Luke M who's riding in from
Pennsylvania got a question about older
cars and parts
he says when buying a used car that he
intends to last a long time how old is
too old what I mean is he says what is
too old when it comes to repairs due to
brittle or worn parts well Luke I can't
speak to any particular car about how
fast it will age there's too many
variables about the car itself what make
model and year how it's been driven how
many miles how many years and in what
kind of climate I have to leave that to
you but as long as parts are available
for whatever car you buy you're
generally in pretty good shape to either
do it yourself find them an expensive
shop or go to the dealer but as an owner
myself of mostly older cars my youngest
is 13 my older ones are 47 and 48 I can
tell you that parts availability is kind
of the linchpin to keeping a car running
and doing so affordably let's talk about
the parts world automakers generally are
on the hook to make a full array of
replacement parts as long as a given
model of car is out there under warranty
now those warranties will vary
dramatically some car makers are three
year warranties some are ten years and
you've got different warranties for
emissions bumper to bumper and
powertrain so that's kind of your
universe of fresh off-the-shelf new
parts
now once your car has been out of
production so long that the carmaker no
longer builds a lot of parts for it
you've got five other avenues to keep it
running and to keep the right parts on
it first of all you got the aftermarket
these are companies that make parts that
are virtually identical to the factory
parts but they're not made by the
factory
next is remanufactured or what they
could also call recondition these are
old parts that came off a car worn out
and got rebuilt up to hopefully factory
spec to have another go down from that
you just get plain old used parts that
may still have plenty of life in them we
used to get these at junkyards
exclusively now you get them at eBay as
much as you go to the boneyard and carry
your wrenches around and pull your own
parts the ladder is a lot more fun than
going online but maybe not as fruitful
there's a concept of nos this is new old
stock that means a part that was sold
new by the dealer or the factory but
never moved off the shelf it's obsolete
now but there may be a little bit of
stock out there
these are prized by a lot of folks that
have older cars you can find these again
typically on eBay or from specialty nos
parts retailers and finally if your card
cheats classic status and has enough
people out there that own it there will
be companies that retool to make parts
for it again they often buy the tooling
and the dyes from the factory or the
factory supplier and they're making
virtually identical new parts again but
this is a bit of a crapshoot your car
has to be among those that achieves true
classic status and have enough folks
crying out for the particular part that
you want made again the bottom line to
keep any old car running and flush with
parts that you need is popularity I'd
rather chase down parts for the oldest
Accord then for the last model near core
it's a matter of numbers if you have
enough people who drove the car for
enough years there's enough residual
demand for many cases decades to keep
the factories cranking out the parts
thanks for watching hope you enjoyed
