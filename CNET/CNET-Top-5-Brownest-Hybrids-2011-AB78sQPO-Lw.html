their hybrid version others are a
different shape I'm Brian Cooley with
top 5 brownest hybrids for 2011 rolling
piles of green wash that get barely
better mpg than their conventional
version and charge you plenty for that
lack of improvement we've ranked these
guys by the skint difference in their
average mpg over the non hybrid version
and when there was a tie we broke it by
looking at tailpipe emissions and price
penalty so the hybrids that made this
list are sorted dirty piggy and
expensive not what you had in mind is it
let's do it number 5 is almost a
caricature it's the Cadillac Escalade
hybrid one of the first cars that
signaled this whole hybrid thing is
gonna get a little out of hand it gets
just 5 mpg better than a conventional
laid but that's at least good enough for
21 mpg average versus a hoggish 16 on
the straight gas engine model but you'll
pay eight thousand dollars more for that
lift number four is the BMW x6
ActiveHybrid that kind of coupe utility
vehicle average mpg of 18 just four mpg
better than a gas v8 and it sports a
huge price bump almost 20 grand more
than the gas engine ride while
delivering the worst emission numbers of
any car in this list talk about some
inconvenient truths number three brings
us another BMW the active 7 hybrid just
three mpg average better than a regular
750 I though to be fair with this guy
lacks in mpg improvement it makes up in
speed it's really quick like four and a
half seconds zero to 60 but I'm sorry
the regular gas engine 750 s no slouch
either and for the extra 13 grand you
can easily soothe your ego with a really
nice bottle of some bold moves EEE
Reeth time you lose a drag race number
two on our list of the brownest green
cars is the VW Touareg hybrid get this
just two mpg better than a straight-up
Touareg without an electric motor and it
costs 16 grand more presciently VW calls
this the rare beast in its lineup and
with numbers like these my hunch is
it'll stay that way before I take you to
the number1 brownest hybrid for 2011
let's restore your faith in the most
hyped cars on earth here's a list of
some hybrids that do deliver stellar
double-digit mpg gains over their
conventional counterparts those guys
will change your fundamental fuel outlet
okay the number one hybrid car that
makes you mouth the word idiot when its
owner turns away is the Lexus LS 600h
l also just two mpg better than a non
hybrid LS 460 l with a middling 20 mpg
average and for that you pay sit down
$37,000 more I know the equipment levels
will vary between these models but still
you could buy an entire Lincoln MKZ
hybrid for the premium it takes to get a
Lexus LS Hybrid and still have a couple
grand left to go buy some carbon credits
or someone okay if this whole piece is
just backfired horribly and now you want
to buy one of these dubious rides head
over to cars dot cnet.com where we have
most of them review and for more top
fives like this go to top-5 cnet.com i'm
