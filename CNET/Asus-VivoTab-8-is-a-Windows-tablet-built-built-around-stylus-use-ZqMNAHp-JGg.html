and feel the same here's one that's at
least a little bit different I'm Dan
Ackerman and this is the soos vo Tab 8
and we've looked at eight inch Windows 8
tablets from Dell from Lenovo from Acer
they all generally have the same
components inside some of the slightly
better performance I'm a slightly better
battery life some have more ports and
connections they all cost around three
or four hundred dollars in order to
stand out from the crowd you've got to
have something that nobody else has in
the case of the vivo Tab 8 it does do
one interesting thing it has a stylus
built in a Wacom stylus and it's tucked
right into this little slot right in the
corner here and of course with the
standard Wacom 1,024 pressure level
stylus and it works with a variety of
programs you do get one or two built in
including Microsoft OneNote if you want
other compatible software you're gonna
have to go out and download that
yourself otherwise this is a you know a
standard fairly low resolution screen
just like most of the other tablets
we've seen Intel Atom processor two gigs
of ram 64 gigs of storage so not as much
you get an even a lower level budget
laptop but when you have a small 8 inch
device like this you're probably not
gonna store that much on it if you do a
lot of let's say watching videos are you
if I'm just gonna stream them from
Netflix or something like that obviously
Kindle books also a good reason to use a
smaller tablet those don't take up a lot
of room and that's why you can get away
or that smaller SSD on these tablets
it's neither the lightest nor the
heaviest of the Windows 8 8 inch tablets
that we've reviewed recently right in
the middle I do like that it has a
fairly fingerprint-resistant matte
finish on the back it's odd that the
camera is over here in the center of the
bonding rather than up in the upper left
hand corner we usually find it so keep
that in mind if you're gonna be taking a
lot of photos with it and it's also
slightly annoying to me that the windows
key which is very important in these
things it's it's a little physical
button right over here that may be hard
to find otherwise you can just kind of
pull out from the corner and get to it
right here from what they call the
charms bar now in order to get this
Wacom tablet you're gonna pay a little
bit more comfortable Windows 8 tablet
usually around $2.99 this guy is a
little bit more it's 329
that's a pretty reasonable premium to
pay if you're really gonna use that
Wacom stylus because none of the other
8-inch Windows 8 tablets in this price
range have that feature built-in I'm Dan
Ackerman and that's the isuzu vivo Tab 8</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
