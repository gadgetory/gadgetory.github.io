it puts stuff on the clown when actually
resign
up there by finger game because it's
very much down-to-earth I know that
because well I'm done go and also I have
the proof right there that's right this
is the my clown from W D now this is a
network attached storage device or in a
server and way meaning is very much like
an external hard drive but instead of
connecting to a computer you connect to
a hub a switch or a router and become
available to the rest of the network now
in a server like this it's not new in
fact before this EE has a few episodes
such as this my book world right here or
the my book line that is newer and yes I
have everything but the my clouds
different though because apart from
serving the local network now you can
actually share data through the internet
very easily let me show it for example I
can take you know the photo of my friend
behind a camera over there a few of them
like that looking good and then I would
upload this to the my cloud and now I
can actually view it on my laptop or
share it with many many other devices
and that can happen even if these two
devices here are thousands of miles away
as long as they are both connected to
the internet where I can say for sure
that the my cloud is very easy to set up
you have to do it plug into the network
and power and download the app on your
mobile device right here and that's it
you run the apps as long as the two of
them is in the same local network the
two device is going to be connected and
when you go out and about it going to
work - now if you have a friend who
lived really far away and when he mewho
to connect to the server you just have
to send him an access code the court
will help his device to connect to this
completely remotely now of course you
know for security the person also need
an user account to access the thing you
want them to access on the my cloud now
there's a lot of thing you can do with
the my cloud device here apart from
being a personal
cloud server it also served the local
network being a server for streaming for
a Time Machine backup as well at data
sharing and so on in my testing it offer
up to 67 megabyte per second for writing
and some 87 megabyte per second for
reading that is very fast for a single
Bolam device like this one here in fact
it is the fastest I've seen of its kind
now note that this is a single volume
NAT server and that means if the hard
drive on the inside for some reason died
you will lose everything the good news
is you actually come with a very nifty
feature con safepoint
allows you to backup is content to
another drive plug into its USB port
right here or to another unit of this
one and it's actually easy to get to of
this because is quite affordable the my
cloud is available in three capacity to
tailor by three to a bar and 40 by that
cost $150 $180 and two and 50 dollars
respectively for more they check out the
phone with us at calm and by the way
when you're watching this and be out and
about for about few weeks so ladies in
the meantime to film that emotional
voice you can play this video again and
again and again I'm going to seal it
with a smile rather say this and that's
because I'm down low and this has been
the first look at the my cloud from EE
be good and see you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
