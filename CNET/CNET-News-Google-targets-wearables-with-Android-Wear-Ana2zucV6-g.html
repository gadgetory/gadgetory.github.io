phase in the miniaturization of
technology which means that it's finally
possible to make a powerful computer
small enough to wear comfortably on your
body all day long and there's a huge
opportunity to bring rich user
experiences to these devices and that's
why we're building Android wear as our
platform for wearables based on android
android wear makes it easy for
developers to reach users on this new
form factor using precisely the same
tools we're already familiar with on
android phones and tablets people will
people will be wearing these small
powerful devices so style is important
and that's why Android wear supports
both square and circular screens and we
think that there will be a wide variety
of fashionable designs sensors will help
them understand your context so they can
provide useful information when you need
it and help you reach your fitness goals
and as the device that you always have
with you your watch will also provide
intelligent answers to spoken questions
and as Dave showed us earlier act as
your key in a multi-screen world across
the world people check their Android
phones an average of 125 times every day
and that's why we've designed Android
wear to quickly show you relevant
information and make sure you never miss
an important message while letting you
stay engaged with the people that you're
actually with we do this by working to
understand the context of what you care
about while enabling very brief
interactions with the device let's take
a closer look at some of the contextual
information that Android wear provides
when you're traveling so jeff's about to
leave on that big trip to the world to
the World Cup it's the morning of his
flight so his phone is already
displaying relevant information for his
trip he can see his flight status and
even show his boarding pass
his hotel address will be there when he
needs it and he knows whether or not
he'll need to pack an umbrella it does
look like it's going to rain in Brazil
on Friday once he's in Brazil Android
wear continues to give him useful timely
information at a glance whether it's his
restaurant reservation the time back at
home so he knows when to call his family
or the local bus schedule and while he's
walking around the city Jeff can see how
many steps he's taken today along with a
step history for the week on
devices that support it he can even
check his heart rate after a jog so
we've shown you what Android wear can do
out of the box we're even more excited
to see what developers build on top of
this platform with Pinterest you can
follow other people's pins Pinterest app
will let you know when you're near a
place has been pinned by someone you
follow so Jeff's friend Suzy loves
korean BBQ and she's somewhat of an
authority in the best restaurants in San
Francisco so when Jeff is in the city
pinterest can notify him that he's near
one of Susie's pinned restaurants the
notification will appear on his wrist
just like this and it uses pages
allowing him to quickly glance at the
details then swipe to see a map and if
he likes it he can start navigation
right from his wrist this is using
Google Maps for Mobile which gives you
turn-by-turn directions on your watch
it's particularly useful when you're
walking and it works with all Android
wear devices in addition to what's
possible with notifications bridge from
the phone today we're making a full
android wear SDK available which enables
you to write code
each 24 is an app that makes food
ordering both fun and easy I watched
this hopefully I'm going to order a
pizza in 20 seconds when it comes to
take I'd I'm a creature of habit and eat
24 is recognized this and takes
advantage of that contextual stream
around the same time I made an order
last week it posts a notification
suggesting i order again I can tap on
the notification and launch into their
full screen you I and here I'm presented
with a beautiful interface that lets me
confirm the kind of food I'd like today
let's stick with pizza and then I can
quickly swipe to see and repeat my last
order just one more tap to pay and the
pizzas on its way
I think that clocked in under 20 seconds
lift is a transportation service and
ride-sharing app that allows you to
request a car to pick you up at your
exact location lift have implemented our
call a car intent so it's really easy to
just walk outside and say ok Google call
me a car you'll see that lift is able to
determine Jeff's exact location from his
phone presents this confirmation screen
so he can verify his address the app has
also made great use of notifications in
the stream you can see when your car has
arrived keep up-to-date throughout the
journey and even rate your driver right
from your wrist when you're at your
destination thanks to all our developers
alright we showed a preview of a couple
of watches we were working on with our
partners back in March the LG G watch
will be available to order later today
on the Play Store in addition you might
have caught a glimpse of a new device
during the demos we're very happy that
Samsung is joining the Android wear
family with the Samsung gear lives
and the samsung gear life is also
available to order later today the Moto
360 is the first watch to adopt the rond
Android wear UI and it will be available
for sale later this summer those are
just the first three watches there are
many more on the way and we're thrilled
to enable developers across the world to
build apps for what we believe will be a
revolutionary new form factor
