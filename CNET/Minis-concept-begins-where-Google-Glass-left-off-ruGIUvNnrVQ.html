wearing the mini admitted vision goggles
these are a are goggles powered by
qualcomm they have a Snapdragon chip in
them by Qualcomm they have to 720p
displays and a GPS plus a couple of
cameras and these will let the goggles
know where I am in the world the glasses
put up informational displays in my
vision so for example during the
demonstration I looked at a couple of
posters telling me about various events
and the glasses told me where one of the
events was located I was able to start
navigation just by clicking a little
button on top of here that said ok
started navigation told me the distance
to my car told me the distance in the
car to the position and then from
walking from the car to the actual
destination so starting off navigation I
got into the car and that's where the
really cool thing starts because in the
car wearing these goggles it not only
gave me route guidance directions
showing me really interesting graphics
of where to make turns it also showed me
my current speed the speed limit on the
street and it actually showed safety
information it could show me if there
was somebody in the street that was
maybe about to run in the direction of
the car and I can look through the sides
of the car and see what was around me so
that's very cool stuff and also when I
got to a parking space it actually
identified the parking space and let me
see how close I was to the curb through
the car door with these glasses now
these aren't actually x-ray glasses this
is the whole concept system and the car
actually has glasses on the side so when
I got into the car the glass is
connected with the car over Wi-Fi so
they use the car's navigation system
actually to help me find my way where I
was going and use the cameras in the car
to show me what was around the outside
of it of course these are just concept
glasses this is a system that they're
working on and it might come to us in
the very near future if it does it could
add a lot of useful information and a
lot of useful safety features this could
be the future of safe driving I'm Wayne

vision goggles
