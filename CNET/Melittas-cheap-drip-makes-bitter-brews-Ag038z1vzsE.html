it and right now we're taking a look at
the Melita
ten cup thermal coffee maker this
machine basically tries to pack in a lot
of the same features and performance as
some of the big names and coffee brewing
but it falls a little short so what's
really nice about this machine is it
costs $69 which is pretty inexpensive
compared to the one hundred and sixty
two hundred or even three hundred dollar
drip machines you will see on the market
so what's also really nice is you get
this very handsome thermal carafe as
part of the package it is stainless
steel pretty solid has a handy little
tab here for decanting your coffee
without making a huge mess which is
something that a lot of other coffee
makers don't have there are a lot of
areas where the Malita definitely fall
short first off it takes a long time to
brew ten cups of coffee anywhere from
eight and a half nine maybe even twelve
minutes long and that's just
unacceptable
furthermore the coffee flavor is on the
bitter side it's actually very
unpleasant to drink and I think that has
a lot to do with how long it takes to
brew the coffee itself now Malita talks
up this ability for you to select the
Bruce strength you can select regular by
standard or you can go to bold or even
select a robust the only problem is I
can't tell the difference between any of
those I also don't like this cheap
feeling glossy plastic surface on the
top and the back it definitely is not a
premium feel or gives you a sense of
quality and Malita doesn't even throw in
a measuring scoop you have to provide
that one yourself
the Malita 10 cup thermal coffee maker
really tries to outdo basic mr. coffee
machines and hang with the big boys of
drip brewing for less unfortunately it
can't match the likes of Bunn Bonavita
and techno forum in terms of making a
good cup of joe I'm Brian Bennett for
CNET and we've just taken a look at the
Malita 10 cup thermal coffee machine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
