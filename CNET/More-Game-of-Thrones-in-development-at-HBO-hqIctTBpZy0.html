Thrones in the future HBO announced it
was developing not one not two not three
but four different projects related to
Westeros click one more project we could
have our very own war of the five kings
HBO told The Hollywood Reporter quote
we've closed deals for four very
talented writers to each explore
different time periods of George RR
Martin's vast and rich universe there is
no set timetable for these projects
we'll take as much or as little time as
the writers need and as with all our
development we will evaluate what we
have when the scripts are in unquote
okay HBO I might be on board with this
but who exactly are these writers first
up max borenstein who wrote Kong Skull
Island Jane Goldman who wrote x-men
first class Brian Helgeland who wrote
legend and Carly Rae who wrote for Mad
Men in addition ray and Goldman are
working alongside the man himself george
RR martin now before we all start
flipping out on HBO and accusing them of
drowning us in Game of Thrones here's
some context first off HBO can kill or
greenlight any of these projects at any
given time secondly not all of them have
to be multi season TV series so for
example one of them could be an original
film on HBO another one could be a
single season miniseries there are a lot
of different options here up to and
including a VR experience we asked one
local wild length this is what she said
you know nothing Jon Snow
okay you agree we might not know
anything just like Jon Snow about these
projects but I can say we'll all be
keeping our eyes peeled when Game of
Thrones season 7 premieres on July 16th
2017 for any and all hints Easter eggs
or otherwise that HBO might drop for us
for more ride your dragon over to
