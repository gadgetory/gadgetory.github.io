celebrates 25 years of cell phone
innovations with some futuristic designs
pick the right tablet with our holiday
buying guide amateur movie makers can go
pro with this mini camcorder and how to
stay safe and secure when shopping
online it's all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and we
tell you what's good and what's bad in
the world of tech plus offer our own
unique tech wisdom in the form of the
bottom line let's start things off with
the good no matter what you think of
Nokia now you have the nokia research
center to thank for a lot of the mobile
phone developments we take for granted
from ringtones to text messages the
center opened in 1986 and to celebrate
its 25th anniversary in november the NRC
held an open house to show off some
innovations that we can look for in the
years to come Bonnie cha was there for
the tour hey everyone i am Banita from
tina calm and we are here in Sunnyvale
California where Nokia is celebrating
the 25th anniversary of their nokia
research center over the years they've
come up with things like the ringtone
SMS and now they are working on some
really interesting exciting stuff
including bendable displays and all
touch screen phones so let's have a look
at what they're doing ok so we are here
with auntie salo who is the product
manager of a very interesting device
called the kinetic device so why don't
you explain what it is and give us a
little demo yeah so no kinetic device
shows you how intuitive and easy
interaction can be by bending and
twisting a flexible device so by bending
to watch you you can zoom in the image
is pending away to mouth and twisting
you can browse to me cheese either in
the stepwise or keep it twisted good go
slowly or fast if you twist more then
when you find the image you just paint
in the tomb went out to mouth we have a
music application where you can browse
list by twisting and then activate the
song by by bending the device and
unpause it and that's an Okie connect
device a little while ago I wrote up
about a nokia concept phone called
which was an all touch screen phone and
now we've got the senior design manager
here your go to explain the concept so
you've got the phone on front here and
you've got you know in this sample there
is the phone on the front and the labs
on top right on the back side right and
it of course I can interact for example
dragging the content let's say an
address to the map but then it fights ok
so this application is called 3d World
gates and it's basically lets you see
through the planet so we are now looking
on top of Sunnyvale where we are and i
zoom in so it makes everything
transparent below us and wherever I
point with the phone it it always shows
what's on the opposite side of the
planet if you would dig a hole to South
America able to dig to that direction
you can show news or we can show images
that people have uploaded from these
places so there you have a look at some
of the projects that Nokia is working on
unfortunately probably won't see some of
these devices in the near future but
hopefully we'll see some of the
technology in upcoming devices and we
look forward to more great inventions
from Nokia in the years to come I'm
Bonnie top or cnet com usually bonnie is
pretty critical of a flimsy handset that
Ben's too much but I guess in this case
it makes sense if nothing else did
should lead to fewer cracked screens in
the future and maybe some of those
advancements will make their way into
the tablet world as well but until then
there are still plenty of models to
choose from and more coming every day
but if you're looking to buy a tablet in
time for the holidays here's a handy
guide i put together with donald bell to
help you make up your mind
I am ollywood from cnet com here with a
2011 holiday buying guide I'm talking
with senior editor Donald Bell about
tablets and e-readers hello Donald has
gone what is happening in the tablet
world is it all still just iPad in
theory no in the hearts and minds of
most probably yes it's our highest-rated
tablet on cnet our editors choice it
nails everything you kind of want
content wise on the device it doesn't
hurt that it's also like one of the most
attractive-looking devices on the market
so what are some of the alternatives to
the iPad though if you decide you want
to go a different direction and why
would you sure really the alternatives
all android based this year we saw a lot
of android-based tablets coming out like
the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 this is one
with really the kind of the same
dimension the same screen real estate as
the ipad 2 but you're getting the
android interface the android options a
lot of people i have android smartphones
they're comfortable with the Android
services and the Google way of doing
things the other great choice that we
recommend is the sony tablet s and
Sony's done a lot of work to make the
Android experience on their tablet kind
of uniquely theirs you're also getting a
lot of a PlayStation gaming support on
this too so you're going to have gaming
content here that you're not going to
find on the iPad do what about people
who are trying to decide between a
tablet and an e-reader what are some of
the differences there obviously other
than the huge price difference well
that's really I'd say the biggest
difference you're getting now down to 79
dollars I want to thank for the the
Amazon Kindle with ads they're going to
work outdoors in direct sunlight where a
tablet screen isn't going to do as well
you're also going to get a lot better
battery life out of ink piece because
it's working so much less to have
graphic performance and display all the
colors so one big question this season
with the introduction of the kindle fire
seems to be what should you get ipad or
kindle fire can you give us the pros and
cons well yeah sure there's a big
difference in price you're only paying
199 dollars for the kindle fire versus
499 at minimum for an ipad you're also
getting a lot of the services that if
you're a big fan of amazon you're going
to have those built right into the
tablet front and center and it
it's going to be a great ereader as well
so the kindle fire it seems like in some
ways the ipad is a full-fledged tablet
experience the kindle fire is a fancier
ereader the kindle fire is is one of
those good enough products that's going
to be for a lot of people who don't want
to spend the five hundred dollars you
just couldn't spend the five hundred
dollars is going to get you close and
it's going to provide a lot of fun but
it's not going to be the kind of device
that you would take to work necessarily
and use as I as a laptop replacement
what do you say that a tablet or
e-reader is going to be a popular gift
this year yeah yeah there's plenty of
them out there a lot of people want to
sell them to you there's gonna be some
good prices out there people when they
get them they're going to know that
there's something new to dig into and a
lot of that app store experience we're
going to be able to find games and
content really customize it for what
you're into is the big appeal great
thank you so much tunnels absolutely for
all of Donald's tablet and ereader pics
visit our cnet holiday gift guide at
cnet com and if you're trying to decide
between tablet specs or really any
wireless device from a phone to a
computer to a router Brian Cooley has a
new episode of device and conquer
explaining all the different ways to get
online with wireless not uncommon
anymore to see someone walking down the
street with all this stuff in their
hands a laptop a tablet a smartphone and
none of it makes any sense unless it's
connected wirelessly but a lot of people
are still unclear on 3G 4G Wi-Fi how you
use them and where you find them i'm
brian cooley here to lay out the flavors
of wireless
okay in no particular order the flavors
of wireless our Wi-Fi 3G and 4G Wi-Fi is
short for wireless fidelity which tells
you absolutely nothing about what it is
or what it does so that's why no one
ever calls it by the long name what it
really is is a wireless internet
connection that you know from places
like this like building lobbies coffee
shops airport lounges it eliminates this
the internet or Ethernet cable but gives
you similar speed within a wireless
range of let's say about a hundred feet
from one of those that's a Wi-Fi router
it could also be a Wi-Fi access point
now Wi-Fi is generally the fastest of
the connections I'll show you today but
it also has the most brittle or limited
range now when your device to text Wi-Fi
in the area you have found what's called
a hot spot but move too far away from
that hotspot you lose your connection so
here's our snapshot of Wi-Fi speed high
range 100 to 200 feet enough to cover a
home office or shop cost anywhere from
free when you're at home and some public
places to free with purchase at some
merchants to really expensive on a plane
or other places where it's a profit
Center okay now 3G 3G comes to you over
cellular networks like what powers your
smartphone coverage here is the big
story with Wi-Fi for example you can
walk out of coverage literally in a few
steps in some cases with 3g you might
drive for hours and not leave coverage
but the speed is like night and day this
is just a fraction of the speed you'll
get on a Wi-Fi hotspot so you make a
trade-off now the way you connect is
real different too unlike with Wi-Fi you
don't run around scrounging up another
network when you don't find coverage
with 3g you have signed up for a carrier
and their giant coverage area should do
you if though you're in a dead zone
you're stuck you're not gonna hop on to
some other cellular carrier ad-hoc
you're just gonna sit there fuming so
here's our snapshot of 3g speed okay not
great range up to hundreds of miles or
more cost typically 30 to 50 bucks a
month through your wireless carrier bill
now as I mentioned 3g speed isn't really
all that great it's mostly about
coverage but that's where its new cousin
4g comes in it's the coverage of 3g
promising the speed of Wi-Fi anyway
you go or put another way it might
finally make smartphones and tablets
work as fast as they show you in the TV
commercials but getting the 4g requires
you cross two big hurdles first of all
your network provider has to offer it
that's a lot of upgrading it has to be
done across the country then you have to
go replace whatever it is you're
carrying with something 4G enabled you
see a 4G network does nothing to improve
a 3G device we've been talking about all
these flavors of wireless as they
pertain to mobile devices but bear in
mind these same technologies are doing
great things for gadgets and products in
your home that never go anywhere as well
as in cars that never stop going
everywhere but now wherever you
encounter the flavors of wireless you'll
understand how they work and how you get
them mainly the flavor of wireless that
I want is everywhere and always on and
totally reliable but it sounds like
that's not quite on the menu yet if
you're looking for the type of gadget to
take along to the types of places you
probably won't have Wi-Fi you want to
check out one of our favorites the GoPro
Hero sports camera the gopro hero is
back and after three generations not
much has changed for the sports camera
at least not physically I'm antuan
goodwin let's take a first look at the
newest member of the GoPro sports camera
family the gopro HD hero2 now externally
there are only a few places where the HD
hero2 differs from the first gen gopro
HD hero that we tested almost two years
ago it's got a larger recording
indicator on the front and three more
indicators on the top back and bottom so
that you can now tell from every angle
whether this thing's actually on or not
the lens is a higher quality glass unit
but the focal length is still fixed at
GoPro signature 170 degree wide angle
now back there's the backpack port for
connecting GoPros add-on modules such as
an LCD or an extended battery there's a
new hdmi video output and on the other
side the analog inputs and outputs are
now labeled you also won't need to break
out the instruction manual to understand
GoPros newly designed interface which
now features icons
text where the old model only had
cryptic numeric codes this if anything
is the single greatest update that the
HD hero2 games over the predecessors but
it's not the only one the HD hero2 also
features a new 11 megapixel sensor for
still photography and a new burst photo
mode that captures 10 full resolution
shots in just one second there's also a
new slow-motion video mode that capture
standard definition video at 120 frames
per second that's perfect for capturing
the minut details of motion that are
normally too fast for the eye to see the
rest of the GoPros video modes are still
intact with the total of seven video
modes including 1080p HD video at 30
frames per second and 720p video at up
to 60 frames per second and there are
four still photo modes including a time
lapse single shot and the burst mode
that we mentioned earlier the gopro hero
line of cameras is still among the
rugged ax stin the market this first in
HD hero has fallen off no fewer than
three cars at speed and it's no worse
for wear and the increase in user
friendliness and functionality helps
catapult the HD hero2 back to the top of
our list of favorite sports cameras you
want to check out my full review of the
gopro HD hero 2 on cnet com for even
more details about the things that I
liked and disliked about this camera and
how it compares to the competition from
contour until then I've been antuan
goodwin and this is going to first look
at the gopro HD hero2 sports camera
system
leave it to Antoine to come up with the
action shots to help show off the
cameras he covers but please tell me
there are some outtakes well I go track
down some lost footage let's take a
break we'll be back with more CNN tech
review right after this
welcome back to the CNN tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good it is deeply
annoying to sit down and watch a movie
or a TV show on your big beautiful flat
screen TV and having a giant streak of
light on the screen but sort of hanging
the walls with blackout curtains or
putting the TV in the basement what can
you do Brian Cooley has the answer five
of them in fact
I'll tell you today's list kind of makes
a mockery of the name of this entire
series top five how about the only five
that's about how few good non-glare
high-def TVs are out there for you
you're about to meet most of them I'm
Brian Cooley with the top five non glare
matte screen televisions so you can
watch TV without having to sit in the
dark number five the toshiba TL 5 15
series it gets a good rating from us
does the basics well it's an LED LCD
with solid image quality but it's off
angle viewing suffers more than most
it's backlighting was a little unstable
at times and you can pass on its passive
3d technology it does have toshiba's net
TV platform of connected services which
you're probably about as excited over as
the content partners who aren't on it
number for the sony kdl ax 720 series
this is currently Sony's least expensive
TV that combines 3d and a 240 hertz
refresh rate to those are nice specs
it's also their best TV right now that
has one of these anti glare screens we
rate this one good as well like the
toshiba it's real energy efficient by
the way it got our green pick award
number three steps us up into the very
good category with the sharp aquos
quattron le 730 to you series it's a
good-looking TV but more than that it's
a big TV 70-inch TVs this size are rare
even in rich folks homes but this one
could actually be in your home thanks to
a remarkably cheap street price around
2,500 bucks that's a great value on a
per acre basis but that doesn't include
construction costs for reinforcing the
wall where you hang it number two the
samsung LN d630 series this is the non
glare TV you want if you just want a
non-glare TV and don't care about
built-in internet streaming and 3d and
LED backlighting none of that here but a
good picture in a nice-looking case with
low glare for a good price that could be
the formula okay before I take you to
our favorite non glare TV why are there
so few of them out there well three
major reasons first
a glossy screen tends to deliver a
picture that looks a little sharper
because matte screens tend to scatter
the light of the image secondly a glossy
screen may attract images like a
Kardashian attracts stupid but the
manufacturers say they contain the
reflection better instead of kind of
smearing it around like a matte screen
and finally glossy screens look really
shiny in the store and manufacturers
think they catch your eye better and you
walk over and check it out seriously
okay the number one TV that won't act
like some giant makeup mirror on your
wall is the LG LW 5600 series this will
get you the best image quality in the
bunch today it's an LED backlit LCD it
has good internet connectivity for
streaming on the other hand it's passive
3d technologies kind of lame and if you
get well off angle the picture goes to
pieces pretty fast but if you want the
best picture in a non-glare set this is
your guy thanks to cnet's david katz
meyer who personally loves non-glare tvs
as i do and i would recommend you always
check out his team's reviews before you
buy any television or you might end up
buying some real nasty shiny thing and a
whole lot of blackout curtains to go
with it and that's not a good for more
top 5s like this go to top 5 cnet com
i'm brian cooley thanks for watching
it's kind of a bummer that you have to
make so many trade-offs to avoid the
glare although speaking of trade-offs
let's take a look at another display
that will never show up in that top 5
list as we move along to the bed now
that 3d has made its way onto gaming
consoles the idea of picking up a 3d TV
may seem more worthwhile unless you
actually get tricked into buying this
little number from Sony hey what's going
on everyone I'm Jeff Bakalar for
cnet.com today I'm checking out the sony
playstation 3d display now this sony
playstation 3d display is a 23 and a
half inch monitor specifically designed
to use saima hbu technology now that
allows two players to see their own
screen with the use of these 3d glasses
now the image each player sees
individually of course is in 3d but it
definitely works and it's actually a
very cool effect it also comes with a
copy of motorstorm apocalypse and an
hdmi cable unfortunately though that's
about all this display has going for it
I experienced a handful of
disappointments with the display during
my month of testing it now for starters
the display only comes with one pair of
these 3d glasses which basically takes
away the whole idea of some of you you
need two sets of glasses for it to work
and they go separately for about seventy
dollars also there's only four games in
the playstation 3 library that actually
work with some of you so if you're
buying this just for that the novelty is
probably going to wear off pretty
quickly now in terms of design the
display is actually pretty slick but I
don't understand how Sony is shipping
this without a remote control how do you
do that I guess it's good that the
screen is so small though because you
probably only want to sit within an
arm's reach to play anyway luckily then
you'll have access to the controls and
buttons that are on the backside of the
unit now this is a display monitor not a
TV so there's no tuner around back you
can't just plug in your coax cable
you can they'll connect up to three
devices it's got two hdmi ports and one
component input I also like the fact
that there's a headphone jack around
back too so you can plug that in and not
disturb anyone around you the
PlayStation 3 has a lot of 3d games and
they look great on the display picture
quality is actually pretty good but when
you're using the Sign love you
technology things become a little dicey
first off the two players need to sit
really close together so that the angle
isn't disturbed which really does not
make for the most comfortable of gaming
environments also considering how small
the screen actually is also it's going
to take you some trial and error to
correctly program the glasses so that
they work properly with the one and two
player settings it's tough to imagine
using the PlayStation 3 display in a
practical situation Sony first download
it as a great dorm room fit but it's
five hundred dollars for that price two
roommates could go out and buy their own
bigger HD televisions it's also too
small for most practical uses so I
really think gamers will prefer a bigger
screen speaking of the screen this is
among the most reflective things I've
ever seen in my time here at seen it the
glare is awful well it's got good
picture quality its price and laundry
list of annoyances make the PlayStation
3d display tough to recommend to anyone
in particular if it dropped in price
maybe got a bigger screen size and rid
of this god-awful glare I'd have an
easier time recommending it to someone
I'm Jeff Bakalar for cnet.com and this
has been the sony playstation 3d display
i'm sure it seemed like a good idea on
paper but i can't really imagine two
guys in a dorm room playing gears of war
3 while practically sitting on each
other's laps but maybe it's a good date
idea alright let's keep it moving right
on down to the bottom line
Black Friday and Cyber Monday have come
and gone and now the holiday shopping
season is in full swing odds are you're
doing more of your shopping online than
ever but are you doing it safely you
will be if you follow these tips from
Sharon Vaknin with the holiday season in
full swing it's easy to get a little
retail happy online and more than that
on the web you've got customer reviews
no long lines and no psychotic shoppers
with pepper spray fighting you for
products yeah that happened in real life
but before you start crossing items off
your wish list there are a few online
shopping tips you need to know I'm
Sharon backing for Cena here to show you
how to shop safely and avoid online scam
first only shop on sites that are
trusted and well known like every
holiday season you'll see a ton of email
Facebook and Twitter spam for heavily
discounted gadgets if you do click
through on any of these offers always
check the address bar to make sure the
URL matches the website you're on
scammers love creating websites that
look and act like real ones only
designed to steal your information so
verify that URL and look for that lock
that tells you the website is using a
secure connection when you're sure the
website is trustworthy and you're ready
to purchase the product consider these
things while checking out you'll
probably be asked to create an account
with the website that's fine but give it
a unique password different from any
other online account and do not let the
site store your credit card information
they do this to speed up the checkout
process for future purchases but if
someone gets a hold of your account
they'll have easy access to your funds
and definitely use a credit card instead
of a debit card or checks because it's
actually the safest way to shop online
the electronic funds transfer Act limits
your liability to 50 and sometimes zero
dollars depending on your bank if you
report fraudulent charges within two
days of discovering them so always keep
tabs on your online credit statement for
fraud in order to take advantage of that
limited liability when you
checked out take a screenshot of the
order page and save it to a dedicated
receipts folder for future reference in
case your order is somehow mishandled
and finally even though this might be
obvious please for the love of
Technology do not shop on a public
computer where there might be keyloggers
installed which are programs that can
record your keyboard strokes on the same
note don't shop on a public unsecured
network like a cafe or your neighbors
Wi-Fi your web transactions could be
intercepted but if you absolutely have
to shop on an unsecured internet
connection use a program like hotspot
shield to protect you from any kind of
spying you have any online shopping tips
tweet me or let me know on facebook for
cnet I'm Sharon Vaknin the bottom line
this week spend without fear little
shoppers I was kind of sad to hear that
my plan to curl up in a Starbucks chair
and get all my shopping done is probably
a no-go but maybe I'll just bring my own
internet because i do not do stores and
that's going to do it for this week's
show everyone but come back next time
for an all-new cnet tech review when
we'll start looking at our top gift
choices for the 2011 holiday season
until then there are tons of great
videos available every day at CNN TV com
I'll see you next time and thank you for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
