of Ynez livestream of CES 2016 we're
coming to you from the South Hall of the
Las Vegas Convention Center I'm Bridget
Carey and I'm Jeff Bakalar and this is
inside scoop every morning we kick off
CNET's live stream of the Consumer
Electronics Show but it's the last day
of the show yeah and I'm not gonna lie
it's been a long week of non-stop tech
news and analysis of things that roll
and talk to you and fly and do all the
stuff yeah and after being here for five
days we could use some help getting
things going this morning so how about
some high-tech coffee to give us a jolt
join us on stage is Yoshi
mesh ulam he's CEO Ripple's and he
brings us the ripple maker
it's a 3d printer that you can find
perhaps in your local coffee shop in the
future hi hi thanks for having me all
right so explain what the concept of
this is because you have some coffee in
front of you and they're a 3d printer
right they go together so we created a
Reaper maker to allow baristas to
personalize cups of coffee for their
consumers so every day when the consumer
comes to the shop he can get something
new something exciting and create a
small little of joy where the coffee
experience becomes much richer and much
more exciting interesting so how how
does it work we saw sort samples and
they're kind of amazing we're going to
do one in just a little bit here but how
does it actually print the image onto
the cone what is it what is printing
exactly yeah and and why is it okay to
drink ha ha great great question okay so
the river maker as you said it's a 3d
mechanics we using inkjet with coffee
extract so it has coffee extract in a
pod
well that we sprinkle in order to create
the image so there's no artificial
ingredients nothing that you need to be
worried about and it's such a small
amount that we do not affect the flavor
of the coffee we don't affect the
quality of the coffee inside the cup so
that's that's essentially from a
technology standpoint on the ribbon
maker the reveal maker is also an IOT
device
energy at the end of things so it's
connected to a cloud service allowing
baristas to choose from a wide variety
of relevant content that we upload for
them and they also have access to the
system so they can create their own
ripples and excite their customers with
our own unique designs so ahead of time
we emailed you photos that you could
print out could you give it could you
start one otherwise let me do it right
now
so you already pre-made the coffee has
foam on top right you're gonna stick it
in the machine we pre-made the coffee so
this is this is the way it is it's also
done in a coffee shop
the barista prepares the coffee the
regular way whatever machine whatever
beans they use and they put they put the
coffee
under the driven maker and then there is
a touch screen where they can select
images we'll talk about you can also
send them images via an app the code the
coffee ripples app that's available in
the App Store and you can find ripple
makers in your neighborhood you can
prepare them and send them to your
coffee shop even yourself is with the
Apple tell you where there are ones yeah
they have location-based the rippen like
here is also location-based so they know
how to find each other and you can
communicate with it and there's a
variety of content here and images that
we send before or right here and let's
see how it works so you select the image
you confirm it Wow and here we go the
Reba Maker is designed to support any
size of cup so essentially as you can
see it doesn't matter really what the
height of the cup because we know each
coffee shop has their own size it's
already done it's already done and here
you go Bridget OH
your morning coffee is ready let's show
everyone right over here Wow I said oh
my gosh it is right here look at that it
that's great as my face on a cup of
coffee and we'll do another on and that
is certainly what Jeff are you ready for
this I don't I don't know if I can
handle my face on coffee uh you know
there's no ideas only one way to know
yeah right that's it so hot so the
machine is able to detect this the the
radius of the opening of the cup and yet
automatically adjusts for yes and we
Center it we return at all to be a nice
nice rounded Luke Oh
here you God I look at well do you have
to what one more sure let's do one more
wow so there you can see it Jeff have
you ever thought of yourself being
drinkable uh yes but not literally
that's okay I can't wait to taste my so
well wow this is interesting you know
what why don't you Jeff why don't you
bring these down I have to cook I think
the best way to get going on our last
day this shit I wanna I want to drink
your face uh what are you gonna drink
better so if I drink you do I gain your
powers no you gave my soul oh is that
how it works a little bit all right feel
like I should ask my wife if this yeah I
know
yeah all right Cheers bottoms up
I'll Bridget you're delicious you throw
me oh wow I just put a nice little hole
in your head that's okay we see that was
this pretty cool yeah you're right it
doesn't affect the taste just tastes
like coffee now are there places using
this right now like yeah yes so so we
started with the Lufthansa lounges
business doesn't versus lounges the
airline airline yes so they're serving
rippled coffee in their lounges and we
have and the selected coffee shops in
New York and through the beginning of
the year we are launching the product in
a boarder scale in the u.s. very good
and and so because it's in the cloud a
customer can walk in and send an image
to the store right away and just get
something custom done right they can get
it custom that they can even send it to
a friend and surprise him so you want to
you want to wish a very unique happy
birthday to your friend you can use the
app and do that as well this is very
cool and I love how fast it works
awesome stuff Thanks thank you for
joining us yes yeah thank you very much
I feel refreshed how about you Jeff I
feel weird that I drank you mom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
