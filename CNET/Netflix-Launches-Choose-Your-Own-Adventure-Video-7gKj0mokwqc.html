any Android device at least not yet it
should work on some Smart TVs and on
iPhones and iPads this is not the first
time someone has mashed the

video YouTube creators have put their
own twist on interactive stories for a
few years now people can create buttons
that link out to other videos to hash
together a similar experience this
technology is also coming to the movie
