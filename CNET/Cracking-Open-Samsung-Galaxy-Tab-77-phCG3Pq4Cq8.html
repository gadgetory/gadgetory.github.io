tablets with its Galaxy Tab 7.7 well I'm
Bill Detweiler head technology editor at
CNET's sister site tech Republic and I'm
going to crack open the Tab 7.7 for a
look at the hardware inside despite
looking a lot like the Tab 2 7.0 which I
cracked open last week opening the Tab
7.7 s case requires a completely
different approach instead of starting
along the tablets edge and working my
way around the case I started on the
front inserting a thin metal tool
between the front glass and edge of the
back cover applying gentle outward
pressure I popped the cover loose from
the front panel assembly after working
my way around the case I removed the
back cover as with the previous Samsung
tablets I've cracked open the Tab 7.7
has a very clean internal hardware
layout an l-shaped motherboard is
mounted along the tablets upper and left
edges a circuit board mounted along the
bottom edge contains the connector port
speaker assembly and what appear to be
two antennas the units large battery
takes up much of the internal space now
I really like that the motherboard has
snap-on connectors as they make the
components easy to detach I also like
that most of the internal components can
be replaced separately my only real
complaint about the tablets design is
the way Samsung joined the front panel
and the display the two are either fused
together into a single piece or held
together with really strong adhesive now
where the screen held in place with
screws you can easily replace a cracked
front panel without buying a new display
and vice versa
looking at the Tab 7.7 s internal
hardware we find a 5100 milliamp hour
battery 2 speakers an IR blaster and a
beautiful AMOLED display which has a
resolution of 1280 by 800 pixels now
like the Galaxy Tab plus the Tab 7.7 has
a 2 megapixel front facing camera and a
3 megapixel rear facing one powering the
device is Samsung's
1.4 gigahertz dual core Exynos 4210
processor and one gig of ram now as is
common in current smartphone and tablet
designs the application processor is
mounted under the DRAM memory package in
what's called a package-on-package
configuration for cellular connectivity
Samsung used its own LTE baseband
processor and a vehicle accom a video
chip which they also used in the Galaxy
Nexus now rounding out the Tab 7.7 other
major chips are a Samsung 16 gig flash
storage chip a 3-axis gyroscope from
InvenSense gps processor from CSR a
silicon image HDMI chip and an atmel
touch screen controller now given all
the tablets high-end hardware it's not
surprising that Samsung is asking a
high-end price now as of this taping you
can buy the Tab 7.7 for four hundred and
fifty dollars with a two-year Verizon
contract without the contract the price
jumps does $700
Samsung definitely set the standard for
7-inch tablets with the Tab 7.7 it's
thin powerful has a beautiful display
and 4G support but the high price and
two-year commitment may scare away some
buyers now to see more Galaxy Tab 7.7
