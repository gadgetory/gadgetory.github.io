Lumia 1020 now the test I have in mind
today isn't the most likely occurrence
but given that it's crush season and
given the theme of this week's show I
thought we would conduct our pressure
and moisture test with something special
a little crush of my own I want you to
know this it's kind of a lifelong dream
of mine the lifelong dream didn't
involve the phone but it's pretty
awesome anyway okay get in there phone
you need to just come you know what you
cheat a little bit in Barry put that
down in there okay I hope it isn't like
crack this is super squishy guys I'm
making Windows Phone wine 1020 vintage
it's kind of slippery bones getting a
little slippery you can see splashing
alright
I'm just gonna let it marinate for a
minute grape juice on my hands okay
let's rescue it
all right pretty wet I can't do anything
with his phone until I rinse it so sorry
dude you're getting a double dunking huh
okay right work okay let me just remind
you again that I know perfectly well
that I'm not supposed to try to turn the
phone on at this point but here I go
okay I felt a vibration but I'm not
seeing much in terms of the screen
definitely does not want to come back on
so I'm gonna try to dry it out well oh
wait it's restarting you can do it
little nokia don't worry I'll try you
out I'll try you later just show us what
you got buddy
Windows Phone it's on look at that I'm
gonna go to the gallery I want to see if
it was recording okay it looks like we
may have done some damage to the camera
which is kind of a tragedy although to
be honest I think I'm gonna do more
damage to the camera because you didn't
think I was gonna leave out the drop
test to do so now my phone is all sticky
and it's starting to attract bees so I
feel like I need to get rid of it
Oh No my phone fell
some water splashed out all around it
and grape juice got a little dirty
dirts now turning to mud otherwise gonna
really see much damage at all I think we
should try that again a lot of water
came out that time
no physical damage but I can see a
little bit of a dent right here but
listen the great thing about these Nokia
phones is that they're made like
absolute tanks I really believe that if
something's gonna take it out it's gonna
be the water well the wine mm-hmm and
that's it but we are gonna try to dry it
out and we'll check back in I'm pulling
for this little guy I like the yellow so
here is the bag of rice which the 1020
has been marinating in for several weeks
now I took it out though earlier today
and I've been charging it all day so
let's see if I can get it to come on
first I have to see if I can remember
which one of these buttons that are
totally unlabeled is the power button I
think it's the middle one it seems like
that button doesn't even depress anymore
okay there we go
nothing let's try the bottom button
nothing there now while it was charging
the little windows light was blinking
and at one point it sort of restarted
itself and gave me the Windows Phone
logo and then said that the battery was
dead but I think what it really meant
unfortunately was that the entire phone
is dead it was a valiant effort but even
the pretty tough Nokia Lumia 1020 cannot
survive being made into one
