larger and a little bit rounder than
when the car first arrived and split
opinions right down the middle
this second-generation model and the
special release series trim does little
for world peace let's drive it and check
the tech the most interesting thing
about this xB is that it's a release
series 2,000 copies one color that's the
tradition
last year it was nura sake before that
absolutely red you get the idea the most
interesting thing about all ex B's is
that they're considered a pretty cool
blank slate from which to customize
either with a wide array of TRD toys
from the factory or the huge amount of
tech you can do aftermarket if you buy
one of these stock and just drive it I
think you sort of missed the point
all right so what distinguishes an XP
from a release series 8xb well the most
obvious have you spotted it the paint
this is called voodoo blue because it'll
make anybody believe in the devil
although I got to tell you I got lots of
thumbs up while driving it I don't get
it
bodykit all around from Ken's style that
redoes the front the chin the lower
buttress hanging off the back and these
side fairings here below the door line
and you've also got this carbon fiber
stuff around here I think that's part of
the kit the wheels by the way are not
those are an ala carte option not part
of a release series and there's more
inside I gotta say I kind of like the xB
it kind of reminds me of the old early
fans like you know early in mid 60's
econo lines and dodge vans and things
like that it's really upright it's
really utilitarian it's funky it's kind
of fun
now this hole right here is where you've
got a real sketch pad to work with it's
a double din vacancy in the dash they
ship it with a standard Pioneer branded
Scion system with eight speakers two of
which are these door tweeters up here
and from there you can go up to this guy
which is an improved Alpine audio CD
slot touchscreen but no nav no DVD
playback it's got a nav button here for
an outboard navigation module but you
don't really want to do nav on that
little screen they've also got a big
7-inch unit if you want to go fall on
that from the factory what I would do is
just stay with the base pioneer unit
don't pay any more and then go
aftermarket if you buy a car like this
you want to kind of express your own
system and probably do up the amps and
subs and all that kind of thing in
consultation with our own Antoine
Goodwin almost assuredly when you do go
stock you've got CD am/fm XM compatible
but not included right off to get and
you always have auxilary and USB which
is iPod compatible down here in the
console I kind of like how they do this
you see that little floor right there
it's actually a false floor lift that up
and that's where you can hide your gear
plugged into one of the port's put this
back and you might not know I have
anything in here now the Bluetooth ring
on this car is crazy at least one of the
upgraded head units has Bluetooth built
in but on our
we have the ala carte Bluetooth which is
suck tooth it's this thing over here for
300 bucks they add this guy in and it's
got these little buttons you've seen me
demonstrate this before you hold the
button down and it makes certain beeps
and that's how you pair it or make calls
there's no display there's no point and
Scion has handily anticipated you may
either be stupid or not live near Radio
Shack and they have a Scion branded and
bagged auxilary cable never seen that
before from a car maker inside the car
some of the release eight stuff is this
unique upholstery black with the blue
inserts you've got this little badge
right here that tells you your serial
number I'm not sure you can see this
when the headlights are on yep lights up
all blue you've also got a power glass
roof up here kind of a spacious one I
like that and you've got these nice blue
logo xB release eight floor mats you can
wipe your shoes all over what you paid
for our shift er is up here on this
interesting console that has what looks
to be a commercial restaurant mandolin
right there we have the automatic in
this case which has a traditional gate a
shiftable gate no paddles on it and by
the way this automatics are rather
antiquated for speed the base on this
car is a 5-speed manual okay none of the
hood of a Scion xB whether it's a
release 8 or any xB you got the same ol
motor but I'm not gonna smear at it
because folks Toyota built an empire on
engines like this a perfectly good
garden-variety nice running forever
running in line for 2.4 liter in this
case variable valve timing 16 valves for
4 cylinder it's a modern engine but
there's no gee-whiz tech going on here
158 horsepower 162 foot-pounds of torque
I like the chunky torque number we'll
see how that plays out on the road in a
minute zero to sixty on this guy which
weighs about 3000 pounds is perfectly
fine eight and a half seconds depending
on your gearbox and the mileage is also
perfectly fine 20 to 28
Scion xB doesn't make any pretensions
about being some kind of performance car
more of a cool quirky paint your own
thing car it is roomy inside you get a
nice big broad shouldered feeling inside
this guy it obviously mimics its
external lines the ride is pretty tight
lease from that plus the relatively
teeny build and lack of much sound
deadening makes for a bit of utilitarian
ride but the powertrain is one that I
like it's not going to blow anybody away
but it's what we used to call zippy or
perky this transmission is probably kind
of a weak link I mean four speeds means
that you're frequently not getting the
most out of this motor not from what I
can tell okay let's price this X beat
starts off at sixteen seven delivered
with a manual gearbox a five-speed if
you want the four-speed automatic at 950
now the release series package it's a
different car it's not something you can
option in but it raises the price of an
xB by twenty four hundred dollars or so
other options include all those
different head units I mentioned they
range from like 450 to $2000 again look
at the aftermarket first because that's
all that Toyota's selling you here is an
aftermarket head unit from the factory
does really make a lot of sense to me
and the one you don't want to buy is the
$300 for that annoying screen list non
interface Bluetooth rig you can do
better
