keyboard glory days I'm Bridget Carey
this is your cnet update blackberry
revealed a new smartphone designed to
appeal to those hardcore fans that love
the signature keyboard it's called the
blackberry classic but this time it can
run android apps the software also runs
blackberry assistant which is sort of
like Apple's Siri or Google now where
you can ask questions and give voice
commands if you already left blackberry
for Android or iPhone it'll be hard to
go back to a small 3.5 inch screen and
the camera isn't so great but if you
know someone craving the classic feel
you can pre-order it for four hundred
and fifty dollars but you have to buy a
plan separately it only works on
t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T networks moving from
the past to the future get ready for
more google glass copycats as other
companies put their spin on wearable
displays sony has come up with a way to
turn any pair of glasses into smart
glasses with an attachable concept a
small display is snapped onto your frame
and a pictures beamed onto the lenses
sony says you may want to use this for
sports so you can see stats in front of
you it's hard to believe it'll look as
good as these mock-up designs but we'll
get to see it for ourselves when it's
shown off at CES 2015 the week-long tech
expo kicks off on sunday january fourth
and while sony goes after google glass
tag heuer goes after the Apple watch the
head of the swiss luxury watchmaker has
told reporters the company's going after
the SmartWatch market and has entered in
several partnerships to do so according
to Reuters it may use Intel processors
to create fitness tracking watches the
Apple watch won't come out until
sometime early next year and when it
does it'll stand out among other
smartwatches for one reason Apple pay
you'll be able to use the watch to pay
with a wave of your wrist Apple has
announced dozens of new banks and retail
stores are accepting Apple pay now
including suntrust TD Bank North America
and Commerce Bank as well as staples
winn-dixie and albertsons that's
according to the new york times but the
company has also been busy lately
dealing with a lawsuit surrounding iPods
and I
on Tuesday Apple was found not guilty of
anti-competitive conduct in a trial that
has been lingering for nearly a decade
Apple was accused of harming customers
by blocking competitors music from plane
on the ipod from 2006 to 2009 back then
apple rolled out an itunes update that
disables your ipod if it detected songs
from a competing music store and you had
to restore your ipod to factory settings
Apple argued this was done for security
reasons the jury found that the itunes
update had genuine product improvements
this means companies like Apple can keep
building systems that are closed off to
competitors formats if they so choose to
