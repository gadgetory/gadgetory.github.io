here if you notice I actually do not
have much hair but it's not my look on
my hair talking about rather the reason
why I'm losing it
the Thunderball devices now there's
nothing wrong with the Thunderbolt
standard it's super fast so why am i
pulling my hair over these there are a
few reasons first they are very
expensive these Pegasus are sick here
costs about $2,000 it does give you 12
terabyte of storage space though but
this little one right here from Lissy
only two at 40 gig $900 or even this
adapter here from Seagate no storage
$190 all of these here come by actually
worth more than a few month my salary is
true the second reason is this right all
support sternum bone standard meaning
they only work with Macs and not with
all of them but the third and also the
biggest reason why they would drive me
and you to likely crazy is the fact that
none of them come with the Thunderbolt
cable this cable here is required for
them to work with a computer and or
another and cost another $50 and when
you receive one I realized that is
actually really long and 6.6 feet is
longer for any situation
in fact the cable itself is sometime
bulkier than the device itself now Apple
says that telling ball is not about
storage it's also can handle video and
audio but so is USB now at this point I
cannot help but compare Thunderbolt 2
USB obviously USB is slower but it has a
way more option and the cable come in
all shapes and sizes and is so much
cheaper just a few dollars each
now if only Apple could mess that with
the Thunderbolt cable that would be nice
and there you go make sure you
understand Thunderball before you get
one device on the plus side it will give
you very fast performance you're going
to find out more information on these
devices as they're calm if you have a
tip on how to grow
listen to my way on my Facebook I do
really need to get my confidence back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
