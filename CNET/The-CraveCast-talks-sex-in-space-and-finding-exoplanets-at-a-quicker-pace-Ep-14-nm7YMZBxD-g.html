your host eric mack and today once again
we're talking about one of craves main
obsessions hey we talk about a lot but
I've got a feature on Sina today that
I've been working on for a while and
we're also going to watch part of a
follow-up interview with one of my
favorite astrobiologists in a few
minutes plus we'll talk about sex in
space and the latest space inspired
games to come out of III this week so
it's a space show everyone can relate to
and speaking of relatable people i'm
joined today by stephen Beecham GF
sparkman KO c atoms in the cnet studios
in san francisco and also via the magic
of skype from Texas is craves dedicated
microgravity pornography correspondent
Danny Gallagher hi mom how does everyone
doing yeah great good now if you want to
join in on the conversation ask us any
questions or leave some comments you can
always tweet at us at crave CRA ve on
twitter and there's also a livestream
chat room and the youtube chat room is
going on as well right now and as always
a big thank you to the award-winning
taos news who loans us this t1 line for
me to do the creative cast here from
Taos New Mexico each month and this week
my hometown newspaper has a really cool
story on some local folks here that are
working to help out people in nepal by
delivering lightweight efficient stoves
to the earth quake stricken area it's a
really cool story so check that out and
let's move right into space news so to
set this up a little bit this is the
story if you got it Stephen that went
live this morning on that's the credit
cast one yeah the the exoplanet story
I've been working on for a couple of
years off and on our at least thinking
about it to kind of set the scene take
you back to 2013 i went to a panel at
South by Southwest there it is of the
panel on with NASA folks on the James
Webb Space Telescope which is the Space
Telescope that's going to
succeed the Hubble and all these NASA
folks and these kind of smart astronomer
type people were all just talking about
finding life beyond Earth with these
next-generation telescopes just like it
was kind of it and an inevitability and
a year later I made a visit to the mound
aquella Manichean Hawaii where there's a
lot of the biggest telescopes on earth I
spoke to people there who kind of have
the same sentiment and so I've been
looking into this over the past few
years talking to astronomers
astrobiologists and the result is of
this piece that went up this morning and
we're also going to hear in just a few
minutes from one of the astrobiologist
that I talked to for the story our dr.
Abel Mendez from the University of
Puerto Rico at Arecibo there is and so
there's also a astrobiology conference
going on this week in Chicago so seemed
like a good reason to do yet another
space show and so the basic thrust of
the piece is basically the James Webb
Space Telescope launches in 2018 there's
another companion telescope that goes by
the name of tests it's an acronym that I
forget at the moment transiting
exoplanet survey satellite there it is
boom and that's a good number watching
that's in 2017 that that one's launching
and then there's about a half-dozen
other ones that are going to be coming
online in the next decade or so and so
all this basically gives us an entirely
new set of hardware to look for signs of
life beyond Earth and we've been relying
for a few decades now largely on
telescopes like a Kepler and Spitzer and
Hubble all of which are pretty much at
the end of their life Hubble was built
get get this in the 1980s so wow I read
about that time yeah it's actly so
that's the technology look here plz
upload an upgrade yeah there's hardware
bra drops right every time they look in
the dial it makes this noise like well
that's what they've been doing a couple
for years I was upgrading it but they
have to send astronauts up there to
physically do it they can't just do it
with a software update like which will
be awesome will still pay
yeah people still paying for ll email
yes I mean at some point I mean you
could try to load mass effect on your
Atari 2600 and at some point it's just
not going to work but actually now
cartridges right but the big thing
really with telescopes is the size of
the lens so that you know that reflects
the light back from what you're looking
at so at some point you've just got to
upload you know the CPU which in a
telescope is basically the lens and what
really size does matter as I'm sure
we'll get to in our in our second
segment so I spoke with dr. Abelman des
and he down at the University of Puerto
Rico which has they have one of the
biggest radio telescopes down there and
we're one of the first people to one of
the first facilities to accidentally
detect a planet beyond our solar system
all the way back in nineteen ninety two
so I mean what kind of blows my mind
here and what I talked to dr. Mendez
about is in the last 20 years or so
we've gone from living in a world where
we couldn't confirm more than one planet
beyond our own solar system to now we've
confirmed at least a couple of thousand
and we're pretty sure there's literally
billions more dr. Mendez has actually
started keeping a catalog of the
confirmed ones and I like dr. Mendez
because he's really a realist in this
area and we talked to NASA folks they
kind of have to be like we're going to
do amazing things and we're going to
find this inevitably because they're
they're constantly trying to keep their
budget going so we have to keep
excitement in the public going but you
get a really a good picture from dr.
Mendez and if you've got the video from
last night I spoke with him again last
night from that astrobiology conference
in Chicago and we talked a little bit
about you know where his mind frame his
frame of mind has gone from when he
started this search and which is
probably kind of where I'm at right now
where it's like very exciting and then
you get into it and the reality of it of
it hits here's dr. Mendez
and then when you start working in this
field you feel that you are quite
positive that given the sheer number of
stars that they the possibility of a
planet just like air because we have the
evidence evidence that that is possible
is just us so it's just finding what
more but the more you know the details
of all the different things from from
this astronomy or the limitation for the
geology and the pollution of the planet
and all the limitations of biology used
it seems harder and it looks more like
the planet just like Earth they seem to
be quite rare so that that make it
harder to discover them it's see it
seems like it's almost all about
gambling because the the chances of
there being nothing else in you know the
vast universe seems impossible but the
chances of like you're saying everything
being exactly perfect for complex
life-forms is almost just as as against
the odds right yes yes if you look at
Earth in the history of Earth I'm
finally almost five billions of history
most of the time has been without
complex life only in the last third
percent of the history air the thing
that's very interesting because
obscenely was a increase and co2 levels
decrease and the temperatures were
stabilized then you have the right
conditions for life so maybe if we have
those conditions earlier maybe it
happened he could happen a little bit
earlier in the planet evolution because
evolution you would take any but it's
impressive that just in less than seven
hundred million years you have a large
evolution of life on Earth from simple
to complex that's what I called the
Cambrian explosion it was a so he shows
you that you have the great condition
life will go but the programming is just
finding the right conditions seems to be
a problem and not only of time but also
of space and
and something rare for further what to
look for so there you go that's dr. Abel
Mendez from the University of Puerto
Rico at arras evo he's in the piece that
I wrote it up on crave today on the the
new tools that are going to be coming
online in the next decade to help us
find evidence of life beyond Earth any
faster reactions you guys that's cool I
mean finally like a scientist thing yeah
there's probably lots of life out there
and we just need to find it it's gonna
take us a while it's very rare but you
know usually it's always guys saying now
there's nothing out there with the only
thing here you know it's that's always
the line everyone toes so that's cool
dr. an older generation you know the one
that size in movies always asking
science or faith you know that's that's
the human only model yeah well you're
saying oh go ahead no go for Jenni well
I was just say is he saying that like
the first step is we have to figure out
which of these planets can sustain life
and then is that enough to determine if
that there is life or do we you know
have to literally find someone with a
high their sign on a planet I mean I
think I I I think when you talk to these
people they're definitely kind of trying
to set expectations low because the odds
are you know if we find anything it's
probably going to be a bacteria right
like it'll be evidence of a you know
methane or bacteria Jinora something
that's maybe being created by some
microbe you know somewhere on another
another planet because what he was
saying is the conditions that have to
exist for complex life like humans or
cheetahs or whatever to form is like
mathematically crazy but it's also
mathematically crazy that it wouldn't
exist anywhere else what's so this is
kind of you know what's called the Fermi
paradox like it must be out there so why
haven't we seen it well one of the
reasons might be that the the scales of
distance and time that you're dealing
with on a cosmic level are crazy I mean
we can't really even conceive of how
ours the universe is and the amount of
time that Earth has taken to form you
know if you've watched cosmos with neil
degrasse tyson he goes into this a
little bit but i mean the amount
of time that humans have existed on the
planet is like nothing so we have to not
only be looking for a planet that could
conceivably have life on it but we have
to be looking at it at the right moment
in its history when it could be
supporting life so which it's a crazy
needle in a haystack thing about this
specifically what we're looking for in
addition to conditions that could
support life that we're familiar with
what Danny was saying you mentioned in
your article Eric that they're looking
for biosignatures waste products
basically gases like methane carbon
dioxide right and I mean and and even
then when you find I mean really what
would be kind of the home run would be
to find lots of oxygen you know in the
atmosphere of a planet but even then
it's not you know they're like methane
and other thing and other bio signatures
they can be created through processes
that don't involve life so even if we
find these bio signatures which is what
we think we'll be able to do with these
telescopes then there will probably a
process of building something even more
advanced to confirm that it's not a
false positive or something so you know
it's it's an interesting balance of
trying to be realistic and enthusiastic
about it because it's still a long way
to find this however it's crazy how far
we've come in five or or 15 years you
know and another thing that he talked
about that I didn't include in that clip
was I asked him you know a lot of the
exoplanets we know now can't come from
Kepler right and so I asked mom did you
expect Kepler to be as successful as it
has been and he said you know we tweaks
we knew Kepler was going to find
exoplanets we did not know that it was
going to find exoplanets so similar to
earth um you know with with water and
and rocky you know rocky land and
basically what you need to to foster
life as we know it that's cool so I mean
they're finding that stuff on Mars
recently they found methane and other
kinds of gases that were bribed products
of life-forms you know so yeah it's not
as closer than we think you know
I was really surprised how soon Eric you
were saying they were expecting to get
some kind of yeah and I mean that you
know the date the dates vary um one of
the most sara seager who's in the it was
in the Peace she's at MIT you know she's
one of the more optimistic people and
she thinks you know these next
telescopes with a little bit of luck
should be able to help us find you know
some planets with oxygen in their
atmospheres and then there's a guy at
NASA named Kevin hand who's actually put
a date on it he thinks by about twenty
thirty four that's that's kind of his
deadline for when he thinks we should
find life elsewhere so yeah it's closer
than you think in I like the way you
know Sara Seager puts it she's like it
could be it could be decades but you
know she still expects that at some
point in her life you're going to be
able to go outside with your children
point to a star and say that star has a
planet around it with life on it maybe
just bacteria but there's something up
there so they're yummy stuff Stephen
Hawking doesn't want us to find find
life rags he's afraid they'll all come
kill us right isn't one of the fun fake
way to make my life okay okay yeah okay
which he claims he isn't but but now is
John Oliver pointed out how do I know if
someone wanted to warn me about
artificial intelligence and hide the
fact that they were artificially
intelligent you would be the ideal
person to hide the fact that there's
artificial intelligence and that's when
I think Hawkin called him an idiot and
then they just moved on this sounds like
the way that exchange should go that's
important story walking written by
Christmas but just I I have a hard time
to his name I actually looked this up on
one of those how do you pronounce names
sites one time and found three different
variations on it so I can't tell you
either it could be majestic it could not
be yeah well while we're on the subject
of what's that I call him Chris yeah
that seems to work on the subjective of
life we could get to the more tradition
way of creating life and Danny you had a
piece recently about another effort
they're both egg way to do something by
the corner literally nothing to do with
any way that's okay I'm about I'm about
to bring this whole thing way down
anyway so um with my story cuz i love
how we started with this oh there's
there's life on Earth and now porn in
space well we were talking about
bacteria boom yeah I'm say there you go
that's how you do a Segway I'm kidding
uh so earlier no it was last week I'm
sorry uh apparently a website uh that
i'm told offers free porn called pornhub
is launching an IndieGoGo campaign to
film the first adult film in outer space
oh and hi mom crowdfunding other words
they call it it's they want 3.4 million
dollars they say they need 3.4 million
dollars to film the first outer space
adult film that they've called sex
pleurae shin which I that's weak yeah
come on you know you couldn't do I came
up with the upright stuff see that's
good uh feel free to add your own
hashtag jeff has so no I don't guys no
no let's get him out right now I was
just pitching what she said I just
pitching my idea to Jeff of a
crowdfunding site just for porn anyway
carry on I think there was one like that
actor must Bob I can't say the name yeah
yeah exactly that's why i was typing in
but it rhymes with Kickstarter that
should be a thing I started a family
podcast so these are our astronauts here
in the video yes there um what are their
names i evoke they don't even try
anymore Olivia or lovia Johnny much in
the secrets named johnny sins very
biblical pair of names right there on
the thing yeah and they're sitting on i
came up with i think the greatest porn
name of all time uh where was I called I
just got
they were sitting on the set of Cosmos a
spank time odyssey sorry Neil death
Tyson I'll leave um I thought at all XXX
is good too yeah oh thank you so yeah so
they want it I just can't get they want
3.4 million just to go up in space to
see if they can act badly that that
seems like a little bit well like how
many is going to the plot yeah exactly i
want to know how much in lighting script
make yeah well i'm gonna know about zero
gravity isn't that the big question
right and i think there with this case i
mean i don't know if they're going
through like Elon I hope they're not
going thru Elon Musk at least no direct
well they're not gonna get his eyes aza
back yeah but yeah it I assume they want
to do more than just go up in the I
don't know the technical term but the
vomit comet company yeah yeah they want
to actually go into space so which I you
know SpaceX is awkward enough it's gonna
be you know it yeah you know it when it
happens to me at least like you know I
always say to myself well things could
go bad but at least I have gravity yeah
you know that's that's that's my plus I
I don't go ahead god I've got so many
things I just I can't yeah hi I'm sure
you got plenty of questions but I don't
think it wouldn't worry like like like
physically like don't you need like
blood flow going in a certain direction
and there's no gravity in space so you
know well and you know they're just just
physically there's like Newton what
Newton's laws are you know like things
need an equal and opposite reaction and
you know you're gonna either there's
gonna be nothing to there's there's
problems of thrust let's just put it on
her name yeah look um and also I haven't
checked this today but last I heard they
were still way pretty far off from their
goal right 515 $1,000 right now wow so
pretty
they have I Shenmue III lie its ass
that's right yeah I mean this is a site
that is mostly renowned for its free
content right so viruses yeah in so many
forums ah well but I actually I watched
thick to the IndieGoGo pitch and it's
terrible I guess it's a very like
hastily put together I mean just from a
production standpoint um like if they I
mean did you study a lot of production
yeah for comparison for science ever my
days may I assume let's make it like a
new de Hagen acting coach that would be
awesome feels good that would be this is
the creepiest guy in the whole video I
don't know if he's real about to do yeah
oh you can't show it okay yes I he just
I'll just say this I know where they're
at 50,000 because of that guy really
everybody nobody look like it's you
gonna be in the movie well I'm not
giving money to that guy yet yeah i mean
just logistically i don't know what are
they gonna they're gonna go to this
space station or I mean it seems like it
would probably have to be a suborbital
flight right which is I don't like a
virgin galactic thing yeah virgin colada
yeah this is Phil you don't need to put
a lot of thought into preparations
that's why they think oh we can just
give 3 million to some space company
that's and that's probably what they
call it will give it to some space
company and they'll let us go into space
and no there's like to me just just just
I don't want to get too technical but
there's its space so liquids don't yeah
you know that something's get like can
you Scotchgard a whole ship basically
they do is my issue because you said you
had three mellitus only for done are we
done talking about this is mine okay you
wonder last word okay where he saying
Danny
no I'm done how's answered a question I
think we're all done good I think that's
how the script ends Thank You manner
okay it's a nice to see that what I was
gonna say was so I have a forward review
of this future movie if it ever gets
made Lex realistic boob physics yes and
that is a video game segue to e3 Eric
there you go all right well um you broke
from our glorious future to space porn
too you know what I mean let's just
bring it down to video games what's
going on in e3 there's like games and
stuff what wait III is beneath porn
we're my twitter feed yesterday III is
foreign yeah porn for everyone I work
with and me so some pretty excited
people there it's porn that doesn't
require Scotchgard well we've got it we
do have at least a few space related
games that were introduced I think
yesterday add in at e3 in LA starting
with the star wars battlefront which
there's some interesting things going
out on souls wife and that but here's
the trailer on si juice why do you have
to bring us down right before this
amazing trailer nobody think about Han
Solo's wife for a second just look at
this
it's long though we don't like oh it's
certain person yeah well this is actual
this is supposed to be actual gameplay
footage right not just a trailer yeah
this is game plan bro sorry nice so I
mean there's a big difference there in
terms of so it's Wolfenstein Star Wars I
like it but wait till they get outside
dude
I was saying on Twitter I always forget
that Star Wars is supposed to be about
wars because I'm also remember a bunch
of stealth missions you know hiding
sneaking flirting dekinai this I have
the same thought about Star Trek it's
about trekking certain amount of trick I
do so I mean at this point in it how
many Star Wars first-person shooters do
we have this can't be the first
obviously ah there's a nice of the one
of it I think neither a one or all of
the Knights of the Old Republic no no no
or jedi jedi knight dark forces that was
like long time horses there hasn't been
learning a while I don't think I think
dark forces really like it's just been
Battlefront and that I'm really aware of
the most popular one and then there's
the Force Unleashed which I love we have
a sword the whole time huh star wars old
republic has a minigame section called
galactic starfighter that looks like
it's just been completely eclipsed by
this anybody who wants to play this kind
of things I think gonna move over so why
should I care about the this one that
was introduced yesterday as a total noob
like what's what's the what's cool with
this one well it's a new EA game in its
star wars battlefront Darth Vader's in
its 2015 their jetpack actual looks guy
yeah there's jetpacks there's there's
stars in there's Wars you can apparently
blood and a DAT with a pistol which is a
bit of a shock oh yeah we saw that you
gotta hit it in just the right spot I
don't know wait wait wait here we go
we're flying in a speeder here and it's
gorgeous Eric oh my God look at that oh
and since should we count rebel assault
as a first person yeah that was like you
were enough yeah in this one of these
right coverage either yeah well I know
punch chips yeah yeah oh and so
technically she's action whenever they
said that they got the they got
permission to use no don't point that go
back go back look at the thing never
mind I'll start talking I think it looks
good it looks totally fun
I mean you know it's gonna be really
popular I'm sure why they haven't done
it sooner they're probably time
everything for the film to come out blah
blah blah all the merchandise people are
gonna get burnt out star wars before it
comes out we've had people say it
already yea i meant why you haven't done
a first-person star wars game like this
sooner I mean I know the film you got to
tie it to the film and merchandising and
everything but I mean this this is this
to me looks like pretty much what
they've been asking for this makes up
for bounty hunter yeah ollu like you
don't like bounty hunter no no I mean I
really wanted to like it and then when
it came out and I played it I was like
I've never been more disappointed holy
crap battlefronts do get him out in 2005
wow this is a very three announcement
yesterday Star Wars all the games coming
out all the Star Wars games coming out
Oh Star Wars unos coming out Oh they've
already have that it's impeach aren t it
well then it but you don't have the new
Star Wars oh yeah yeah they're gonna
have like chrome cards and stuff right
sit Beecham had you not heard about on
so his wife I haven't heard about in
Hansel his wife well are you my ears
closed great to inform you that um
according to the new Canon that they're
doing now which I'm gonna say right here
I'm starting to reject the concept that
they can decide what Star Wars Canon is
for me Star Wars Canon is those first
three movies and I'm stopping there
everything else is just an interesting
idea whose today here yay I think Disney
well Disney colleges now yeah yeah so
they threw out all the extended universe
that doesn't count anymore but they're
doing new ken and now and apparently
these comic books they're doing now
count as part of the star wars universe
which means that it is now canon truth
the Han Solo was married at the time he
met Princess Leia and the two of them
run into his wife later I wait was he
married a Chewbacca no no her name's
sana solo I believe and they say she's
human in the wiki that she looks like a
Cathar to me but I'm anyway so she hates
him she's a bitter ex basically only
they're still married and she's tracking
him down and he's been also they're
pulling a blues brother
anyway it's all very depressing and I've
ejected frankly I'm good I got into that
ring I have to stop that's creepy
because you know Carrie Fisher was John
Belushi's crazed X and the Blues
Brothers oh yeah so is the whole Mookie
gonna be like Chewbacca and honest hello
in a phone booth and then Carrie Fisher
walks in with a flamethrower they're
gonna drive through a mall at some point
right let's hope so I mean that that's
you sound like yeah like carrie fisher's
home movies yeah yeah that's what you
which could be quite interesting based
on her memoir that came out of a few
years back oh you guys reading you that
oh yeah yeah she's like wishful drinking
or yeah let's cut from the edge yeah
sorry um so um by the way that jetpack
gameplay looked amazing fantasy yes
we're talking about we first watch yeah
we're like they have jet packs it looks
like it looks like they're gonna have
jet packs and mass effect for a fighter
jet pack here and at some point Admiral
Ackbar talks to you and does not say
that it's a trap okay see it's an
analyst that's a situation where are
they unexpectedly got you it's a sneaker
it's a quagmire yeah it's funny but IDK
i play star wars the old republic and
somebody makes and it's a trap joke like
every single night and has done for the
last couple of years no one ever gets
tired of that one it's me it's a trap as
the new was up honestly it's it was
funny when Robot Chicken did it I gotta
see I gotta see there he is there's a
Hefner I bar was he say okay to go crash
site but it looks like they am I ovary
to first prepare to defend yourselves
until we could get there that sounds
like a longer way of saying that yeah
your things are there already waiting
for you they're gonna shoot unexpectedly
what it's not a trap okay watch this jet
pack
yeah I understand that sold me right so
I'm sold to yeah you can do that instead
I game bounty hunter has a move called
death from above where you you go up in
a jet pack and then you fire down into
it see ya know I got to play that again
bounty hunter on a gamecube I still have
it on gamecube yeah meets it well my son
has it oh cool sometimes he lets me play
it I have to ask nicely he's not
actually kidding about that no I'm not
he commandeered all of my old consoles
wow so that's a whole other show yeah so
another game from e3 Mass Effect
Andromeda anyone follow this one um so I
am I the biggest mass effect fan here
and I'm thinking you are ya okay if the
check it's not important carry on
shoulda thing yeah so basically this is
set after the controversial end of mass
effect 3 I think long after and it's
definitely not starting Shepherd for
obvious reasons they're in a new guy
this music selection kind of it is in
fact on you Josh they credited it at the
bottom nice yes significance in the
music selection I think it's because
it's a wild frontier like you're in a
new galaxy you're exploring um but you
know honestly I didn't really get very
much from this trailer except that it's
supposed to look gorgeous than there
will be jet packs and you're still in n7
there's a strong about I think there's a
close up on the shirt you're still in m7
but you know why we're they haven't
really told us yet who we're supposed to
care about or why or what's going on
it's just sort of another Mass Effect
game like its mass spec we sat down on
the kids and here we go just shows up at
a plan that pulls out his gun yes I'm
done here I'm universe serie a season
okay there you go limit limited
jetpacking
I'd still take limited Jack that's not
the main character they said by the way
oh really yeah they said more on that
later I don't know why they chose to
feature this that's cool jetpack move
right there yeah you know sometimes you
know you get up up near the top of the
stairs you're just like cheese you know
just need that little extra boost to get
you all the way exactly this is the
first boost and punch type of Jetpack
rather than the flying dad package I
think if I think it's more fractal yeah
yeah dude none of that was gameplay was
it no that was a tenth all render ok as
a trailer yeah they say they're using
the engine that they're planning to use
in the game what it was something funny
it's like this represents the their goal
for the gameplay which means like after
a little rat way back yeah it's actually
a 16-bit game that they could do that
big word Mass Effect 8-bit cinema I'll
that'd be cool does that exist yet it
should ask my picture yeah I feel like I
can remember some ads like back in the
90s for like nintendo super nintendo
games where they they have like you know
movie cinematic quality trailers and
then there's no indication of you know
what the actual 16-bit is going to look
like well even remember being very
disappointed like the old Atari games if
you looked at like the cover art on
those it's like amazing there's like oh
my god you have like this magic wand and
you're like getting rid of it and then
like you know you're square or Barbies
yeah actually Barbie drawing a Barbie
yeah that was so relevant everyone
pip-pip injury does the other day face
now they think of it the only game that
doesn't work that way the original Mega
Man cuz the cover was so bad it's like
well the game's got to be awesome they
clearly didn't hire a good artist it's
true I don't omit some of the pac-man
cover Evers a copper creepy looking like
for reals I want to set expectations
whoa yeah that's what's different about
today's gamer today's gamer you look at
a you look at a trailer like that and
you're like oh the game could be this
awesome but when we were kids you'd see
like the Super Nintendo commercial and
you're like I'm gonna get to do that and
then you play the game and it's two dots
fighting up square hey when you think
about it we had the body you know what
I'm surprised us in our game
right now two dots fighting ask where i
can see that on steam a lot i'm
launching an IndieGoGo for it there you
go fetch it'll go faster than that movie
two dots in the square if it doesn't
work is it a game at work as it do does
it comic 1 square it's a place coming
this fall to ABC so before we started
the show we started talking about all
these games coming ahead at e3 and
Steven then feverishly loaded every
trailer that he could so now that we got
a couple of minutes left what what
announcement out of III space related or
not is is most exciting so that we
Steven can play some entry okay I saw we
saw the I'm just gonna talk about this
hollow lens Oh God oh yeah thing is so
cool so this is uh the hollow lens is
this piece of gear you wear on your head
you wear like glasses right and it's
made by microsoft and they did a really
cool demo of it at e3 it's augmented
reality yes yeah this was the minecraft
yeah this is a minor yeah okay so I mean
imagine having a Mario level on your
table let me just fast forward here real
quick so this is like this is kind of
like Microsoft Google glass but it
actually been designed it for things
that make sense yeah it's like a
hologram vr kind of thing so watch they
put this level into this table here and
this is the coolest thing ever I would
play mario like this I would stand at a
table and play mario like this wow so
when I picture this war is D&amp;amp;D like that
guy's Dungeon Master's your the helpless
little person walking on and he starts
destroying stuff all around you
lightning strike magic missile so she's
playing the game holding a tablet and
that's her character in the game right
yeah that's so cool I'm just imagine I
mean people meet making games could use
this to oh yeah
the sims god no Lydia loud oh I can zoom
in and out for a better perspective
closer where's the Sanford is somebody's
gonna use this to make an adult though
oh yeah totally it's stay on that be
Danny yeah that's why I'm here really I
went to a talk on hacking the connects
to do porn one time oh yeah yeah that
was like two years ago too so me yeah
there's oculus rift there's all kind
 in this room they always innovate
yeah that's yeah a lot of money sorry I
than moving the table or just moving
around I think they are he is moving the
table see how he grabs it he's pulling
it around yeah oh he's pulling most of
all around oh no I stalling the level
around okay it's cool yeah none of this
is really happening so again when you
buy this it'll be just 16 bit okay
they're gonna do everything lift it up
now oh yeah that that would come in very
handy it tells you where you can take
for resource against and there's this
whole underground oh that's so cool so
it kind of reminds me a jurassic world
when you know there's all those
Holograms of dinosaurs oh yeah visitor
center and you know just be such a cool
learning tool like an awful lot i DNT
like really you need 16 blocks strategy
she's not worried about conserving
resources hololens ipad sit and all know
a wholesome man's in Minecraft I think
they need a better sound effects for
this model game I can just focus my gaze
do they do the users program sound
effects or how does that work no it
comes with I mean you can get I step
back I know somebody has like done like
mods and stuff where you can like
somebody added like 8-bit sounds so it
actually will sound like an Atari game
when you're like chillin like creepers
and stuff Pigpen depicts need an upgrade
I'm pretty sure you can change the
sounds if you want did she just put it
he
just did a lightning strike on the pic
make it a zombie Pigman huh like you do
see oh we lost Eric oh no I'm so I'm
still okay uh yeah it's just having
video issues um well that that's about
all the time that we have we have one
more awesome trailer or anything that we
want to go out on um well that
everyone's really excited about this
last the last guardian game I don't know
much about it but you guys know anything
about it wow yeah this is one that's
been like in development hell for like
forever a millennium yeah it was kind of
a big surprise everyone's like oh sorry
game yeah I read an article last year
her someone was saying you know this is
never gonna happen we shall just accept
that here here's why that's okay yeah
but it didn't help uh-huh yeah so what
does this game about I don't even know
prob about six guy who he's the last guy
he's a guardian which is a guardian
physique easy laughs are involved but is
it be necessary when you say lasts I
mean influence interest as opposed to a
male heir guardian if you're let's
remember time yeah oh my god are there
sure so say stop grammar time I'm sure
they're there have to be well so this
this trailer made Scott's done very sad
cuz he's all by himself no no he's not
by himself that's the thing he's got
this friend who may be dying
such a while a rafter kind of lump Scott
caught at a giant puppy dragon but
chihuahua raptor works to ya anyway so
their friends and apparently it's always
tragic oh I can't getting my hat he's
part cat occurring does he have emerald
horns yeah at least for nubs or nubs
anyway so this was just a gameplay demo
huh you know I don't know anything about
this game looks like a little guy yeah
all I've known is that it's just it's
been in work forever this looks like
this looks like high definition Monument
Valley on acid yeah I keep thinking of
like the neverending story yeah
something that's supposed to be sad and
touching and that kind of thing which I
was wondering if it's based on the last
unicorn in a way oh yeah worry if george
RR martin wrote peach dragon hahaha did
you look what's happened to pass on
makati did you interview where George
Martin he was saying that when he read
to learn the Rings trilogy he thought
that Tolkien's plans to pick all the
characters off one by one genuinely
thought Fred it was dead when she'll
have stung him I'd I think that really
tells you something man his mind think
so I know that's off topic but I just
lending object permanence it's funny we
were gonna talk about Game of Thrones
last night and so less than I watched
the finale and that was my first game of
Thrones episode ever how you feeling and
the only I enjoyed it but they it was
funny because the only preparation that
any my friends ever gave to me was she
says the first thing you need to know
about game with rings Game of Thrones is
that george RR martin it's a cruel
bastard and so and so I went into it
with that and I'm like yeah that that's
pretty much does it make any sense to
you know cuz I didn't know any of the
characters or you know I mean I know Jon
Snow Johnson oh I say that right yeah I
look like that's more on right now I
know about John I look like my dad I
know about Jon Snow um so but that was
the weird part was knowing that I kind
of but I could see a certain moment
coming but it still was like oh that was
if I if I'd been up to this point I'd
probably be crying right now uh but no
it was yeah so that was that was my
george RR martin story yeah do you think
if george RR martin were in charge of
the Lord of the Rings universe that the
The Hobbit race would be extinct by now
the way he would handle it
unquestionably anyone would be raped and
then dead Frodo's head would be on a
stick somewhere and on that note yeah
was it on a stick ZDNet does have them
