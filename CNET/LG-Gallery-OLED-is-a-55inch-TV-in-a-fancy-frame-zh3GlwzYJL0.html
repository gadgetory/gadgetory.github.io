ether 2013 in berlin this is the
company's gallery OLED TV now this is an
older TV that you can mount on your wall
and that's not all it comes with this
bizarre gallery s picture frame around
the side that LG will chuck in when you
buy one this model here shows a cutaway
so that you can see what the speakers
will look like behind this canvas cover
but if you take a look at some of these
other models that are on display you can
see some more fanciful concept frames
that LG might start making if enough
people buy these TVs if that's not
quirky enough for you it also folds away
from the wall so you can position it at
an angle now LG already has a curved
OLED TV but it's curved really better
does it really add to the viewing
experience it's not that clear so you
might want to opt for the more
traditional flat screen this is a 1080p
display it's not the new 4k resolution
but that's not a huge issue to be honest
because our LED looks so fantastic by
itself it's a kind of screen technology
that's currently mostly used in mobile
phones and it means that blacks on
screen look really really dark and
colors are really really bright it's
coming out in Europe first but it will
also be coming to the States for more
from Aoife check out cnet.com slash
on the cuesta way and this is LG's
gallery OLED TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
