2018 is amazing but it can be really
hectic there is one booth here that is
setting itself apart from the rest and
that is Toto the makers of smart toilets
and other bathroom fixtures but here
they have an all-new product called the
floating tub
it is a nineteen thousand dollar marbled
covered bathtub that has all sorts of
integrate attack but the coolest thing
is that it is designed to mimic
zero-gravity basically the feeling of
floating in space so the way they do
this is with the design in the bottom of
the bathtub it has integrated jets that
are designed to sort of buoy your feet
up into the air and make it feel like
you're actually floating but you'll be
in the bathtub it also has a panel on
the inside where you can make
adjustments you can turn on LED light
panel that goes along the bottom side of
the outside of the tub which is supposed
to add ambience and some mood lighting
to the whole bathroom experience it also
has a built-in pillow that also has an
integrated faucet that is designed to
bring water around your neck for an even
more relaxed experience it's also
adjustable if you have people of
different heights using the bathtub
again this thing is almost twenty
thousand dollars but it's so cool and
looks so amazing that I really want to
test it at this unit smart home when it
becomes available in the third quarter
of this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
