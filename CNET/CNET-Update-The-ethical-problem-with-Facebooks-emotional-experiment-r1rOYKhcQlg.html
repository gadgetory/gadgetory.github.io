Facebook I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update the world has yet
another reason to distrust Facebook more
than six hundred and eighty thousand
Facebook users have been subjected to a
psychological experiment and it was done
without the knowledge of the
participants the network's set out to
see if it could manipulate users
emotions and it worked with academia to
conduct a week-long test back in January
of 2012 those chosen for the experiment
either saw only positive posts in their
feed or they only saw posts with
negative words the studies showed that
if you saw mostly happy words you are a
little more positive in what you shared
in your status update and you're
slightly more negative when you're
subjected to a week of doom and gloom
now we learned of this because the study
was published in a science journal and
adding to the ethical problems the study
was funded by the government
Facebook was toying with people's mental
health but why to learn if
advertisements could take advantage of
our moods if you aren't posting much
well Facebook cranked up the kittens to
get you happy again with any study the
typical ethical practice is to get
informed consent from your subjects so
people know they're part of an
experiment Facebook says it was fair
game to test us because of one word
hidden deep in the data use policy you
know that document that none of us read
it states that your information may be
used for internal operations and
research when I think of research in
that context I think of Facebook wanting
to study where I click not that I want
Facebook to use me as a lab rat to see
if it can make me sad I wouldn't be
surprised if an organization perhaps the
Federal Trade Commission goes after
Facebook for not being clear over how
this research data was being used but
going forward if enough people speak out
and complain or shy away from using
Facebook well then it could take a hint
and it might be more transparent about
future experiments the network is on
shaky ground as it is now with public
trust and even if you don't care to be
tested on you should care about this
because Facebook is collecting health
information
Facebook owns the fitness tracking app
called moves and as fitness tracking
bands and smartwatches grew in
popularity we have to wonder what sort
of health information will Facebook have
on us and can we trust what it does with
that data
well let's switch gears to Google's
social network no not Google+ not that
Buzz thing I mean Google's first social
network
it's called Orkut and after 10 years
Google is shutting it down Orkut was
really big in Brazil and India but it'll
close on September 30th google says it
rather focused its energy on YouTube
blogger and Google+ that's your tech
