your car alerts you when your headlights
are left on but not when your kids are
left in a trickier problem to solve for
of course but also vastly more important
the feds tracked the problem of child
fatalities and locked hot cars but many
people actually follow the work of
meteorologists on all of San Jose State
University in Silicon Valley he call
eighths media reports and estimates that
between 1998 and 2009 494 children about
37 each year died locked in hot cars in
the u.s. more than half the kids who die
of hyperthermia in cars are 2 years old
or younger about half of them were left
in the car by accident by a forgetful
parent we just parked next to a car
Walmart Cadillac Escalade ok the baby is
been in the carrier screaming and no one
around a modern car is unfortunately a
very efficient calorimeter of sorts its
seals and insulation are deadly good at
trapping solar energy the majority of
heating happens in the first 20 minutes
or so cracking the windows has almost no
effect even flow has a new set of there
baby seats out with a technology called
sensor safe it's an electronic sensing
technology to warn you you've got a
child buckled in the seat in the back
and especially a rear-facing one which
is another hazard in and of itself out
of sight out of mind
now an electronic sensing baby seat is
actually not anything new the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration
looked at nearly two dozen of these
things back in 2012 and decreed most of
them junk let's see how Evenflo seeks to
break the mold
now if you're in the front of the car
you do a one-time install of this dongle
that comes with the sensors safe seat as
you can tell by that in this is an obd2
port dongle this goes up underneath your
dash now once that's installed that
stays there you're not having to take
that in and out all the time it works on
any car with an obd2 port made since
2008 not since 1996 when obd2 first
arrived so you've got to have a later
car because that's when they implement
it what's called the can protocol an
electronic language that that dongle
relies on okay now here in the back of
the car you install the seat and of
course latch it in safely that's a whole
different topic get your child in here
and then this is the key this is the
little sensor safe clip this green thing
once you click this across their chest
under armpits and around their legs that
locks in now you close the loop as soon
as you drive above five miles an hour
for more than a few seconds this thing
starts transmitting to the receiver we
just installed that there's a child in
here then the next time you stop and
turn off the engine you get a chime
instantly reminding you this is buckled
around your child in the back don't
forget them a lot of experts like this
approach better than some of the
previous technologies which were
proximity based where once you got far
enough away from the car or the seat you
then got a warning a lot of folks say no
warn parents immediately so there's no
chance of them getting far away and
forgetting
now a few notes about this apparatus if
you're concerned about EMF or radiation
coming off this transmitter Evenflo says
it's about the same power as a car
remote key fob which is pretty low power
and that it barely uses any time
transmitting about one second in two
hours of driving if you want to use this
as a hand-me-down which of course you do
the battery here is not replaceable but
you can get or buy another one from
evenflo you just replace the whole clip
you'll buy it if it's after the first
year or so of the seat you'll get a new
one for free if it's before then if you
have more than one kid you're gonna have
more than one seat well you can have
multiples of these that report into one
receiver under the dash it's not just a
one to one relationship and if you have
a hybrid or a car with automatic
start/stop technology that would stop
and perhaps throw this thing off you
need to get a separate special receiver
up there under the dash which Evenflo
will send you and it's green instead of
the one we have which is black so
electronic sensing that warns you
immediately when you come to a stop some
interesting modern technology
innovations for today's cars that are
hybrid and have auto start/stop and it's
from a major maker at a major retailer
Walmart's got the exclusive on this for
one year until summer of 2016
goes for about a hundred and fifty bucks
now without the sensor safetech looks
like you can get almost the exact same
seat for ninety dollars so you're
definitely paying a premium here but it
seems to be going down the right path</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
