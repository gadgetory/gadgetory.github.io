editor here at cnet.com and today we
take a first look at the ZTE overture
this is a new phone for AO wireless now
AO is a T's prepaid brand but you don't
have a contract you just buy the phone
outright you have a month-to-month and
you can leave whenever you want it looks
like a lot of other Android phones it's
the basic black rectangle but it's got
some touches which I like there is a
4-inch display it's pretty bright
colorful you know it's not gonna knock
your socks off of course but I think it
certainly does a job it is Android 4.1
so a little bit of an older Android OS
there are three home screens which you
can of course populate as you want with
folders with widgets has the same
virtual keyboard as you see another
Android handset same keypad down below
you see those standard touch controls
for back for home and for the menu or
sub menu key one thing I like though is
when you're coming off the lockscreen
now this only works if you don't have a
PIN code or the pattern is you see this
little green dot if you pinch out like
this you'll see six shortcuts that
actually take you directly to those
functions so you can change these as you
like but I just thought it was a nice
touch likes the visual effect of it like
that you could just jump directly to
those features without having to get
into the menus here on the side we have
a volume rocker it's really nice and
thick so I could definitely find it when
I was on the phone on the side there's a
microUSB charger port here on the top
there's the 3.5 milimeter headset jack
and the power control on the back
there's a camera with a flash now there
is this textured surface on the back it
kind of looks like leather of course
it's not leather but I did like the feel
of it just made the phone a little more
interesting it does have a 5 megapixel
camera it is pretty well stocked with
editing features photo quality is about
average for this kind of phone certainly
does the job for quick shots you know
you're on the go you just want to share
something course the phone does come a
bunch of Google applications so you'd
expect you can go to Google Play to
download a lot more apps as I mentioned
the overture does have a 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core processor that makes it
actually pretty fast one annoying thing
though is when you turn on the phone you
get this little jingle that promotes the
carrier's name
it's kind of annoying I really couldn't
find a way to turn it off so just when
you're starting up the phone and you
don't want anybody to hear it you might
want to put it against your hand or just
turn down the volume
it does have 18 T's LTE service so web
pages loaded quickly I could download
applications so really on the speed
portion the phone does well call quality
was bit variable some voices sound a
little high-pitched volume could have
been a get louder for $150 this phone
really isn't a bad Buy the overture has
a good processor it has LTE it has
enough features to keep you busy and it
has the design it's easy to use I just
wish the call quality can be a little
bit better and there are new Android
version I'm Kent German and this is the
ZTE overture with AO wireless</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
