on July 15th and to celebrate its
release the film is teamed up with the
VR company the void to make an
interactive experience called
Ghostbusters dimension the exhibit is
being hosted by Madame Tussauds in New
York where visitors can walk through a
Ghostbusters theme subway station and
research room say what's up the Slimer
and then get up close and personal with
life-sized wax statues of the stars of
the film and these figures are amazing
we saw some of the other wax statues in
the building and these were easily the
best around
best of all ivan reitman the creator and
director of the first two Ghostbusters
films and producer on the new one was on
hand to chat about the void experience
the amazing thing about virtual reality
is you're in the middle of it really
when you turn your face or you look up
you're dead center and that's
complicated if you think about it in
terms of storytelling because most
storytelling doesn't have us as in the
center so the void experience itself is
actually pretty cool they strap you in a
haptic feedback vest and then put on a
serious headset you have to wear a heavy
backpack too because the whole thing is
wireless which is actually something in
VR I've never done they wouldn't let us
film inside but you're basically walking
through a funhouse with wind fans and
vibrating floors that work in tandem
with the VR video being fed into your
goggles
I could also hear my two teammates and
see virtual avatars of them in the VR
experience I could also hear sound
effects and the directions through the
headset honestly it was probably the
best VR experience I've ever had if only
because the funhouse design of it all is
so convincing the blaster guns you play
in the game had really good feedback and
look like proton packs in the VR world
the tech driving the entire experience
is pretty impressive the haptic vests
vibrate in the correct position of your
body which felt a little strange but it
really worked visually the whole thing
looked really good even if the graphics
felt a bit below some of the high-end
stuff we've seen in oculus NH
Seve i've access to madame tussauds and
the ghostbusters dimension is $50 if
you're in New York or visiting soon it's
worth checking out not just because
doing this is way cheaper than owning an
HTC vibe or an oculus but also because
of the other theme park elements the
vibrations the misting in my face yes
they missed it in my face it's just
something you can't get at home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
