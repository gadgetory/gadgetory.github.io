in the form of the P 10 and P 10 plus
and it's a p10 we're looking at here it
looks pretty similar to the previous p9
with the all-metal design and dual
cameras on the back in this blue shade
actually looks quite a lot like the
Google pixel but there's still plenty of
updates here it still has one camera
that shoots in color and one that shoots
in black and white but the black and
white one has had his resolution
significantly bumped to 20 megapixels
those updated camera software -
including a portrait mode that uses face
recognition to create artistic depth of
field inside the phone is the same
supercharged octa-core processor seen in
the extremely potent Huawei make nine so
expect the p10 to handle any task with
ease
it's got a 5.1 inch full HD display
making it very comfortable to hold while
the P 10 plus packs a larger 5.5 inch
screen the fingerprint sensor has moved
from the back of the phone to the front
and it now doubles up as a home button
as well both phones will come with at
least 64 gig of storage expandable with
microSD cards and they both run on the
latest Android nuga software the phones
are due to hit shells in Australia and
Europe including the UK in March with
the p10 costing arrive 550 pounds or 600
pounds with a p10 plus the US
availability isn't yet known but stay
tuned to see net for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
