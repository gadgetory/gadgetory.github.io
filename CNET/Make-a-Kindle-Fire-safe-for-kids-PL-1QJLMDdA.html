with a how-to on how to make the Amazon
Kindle Fire tablet safe for kids
let's father myself I know that the
Kindle Fire can be a great way to reward
your kid for good behavior treating them
with a game of Angry Birds or their
favorite cartoon but I also know that my
kid is not quite ready yet for
everything that the Internet and the web
entails plus this thing's connected to
my credit card and Amazon I'm not ready
for him to run loose with that quite yet
to keep your kids experience contained
to just the content that's on the Kindle
Fire Amazon has provided a passcode lock
feature on its Wi-Fi connection to use
it first check to make sure you're
running the latest OS by diving into the
settings and looking at the device info
you need to be on system version 6 point
2 point 1 or later next back into the
settings menu and tap restrictions tap
the switch to create a password and this
should automatically disable the Wi-Fi
connection to test it try to open a web
page you'll also notice that there's
this key icon in the top right corner
indicating that the Wi-Fi is locked to
unlock it click the Wi-Fi icon and tap
the switch you'll be prompted for your
password and the Wi-Fi connection will
remain unlocked and so you go back and
switch it off again finally just because
you've clipped this thing's internet
connection it doesn't mean you've
completely sanitized the Kindle Fire
take a minute to comb through the
content you've already loaded up maybe
there's an r-rated movie or an explicit
song or some zombie game with exploding
heads whatever it is you can erase it by
pressing and holding the item and
selecting delete Amazon backs all the
stuff up to the cloud so you can
download it again later if you want
that's how to make the Amazon Kindle
Fire safe for kids while still
preserving all of the fun stuff for
cnet.com i'm donald bell
