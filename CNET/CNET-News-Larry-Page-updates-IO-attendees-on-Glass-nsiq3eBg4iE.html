Greg with de sky 9 we're developing apps
for Google glass and I was really
excited to see the all the new things
that Google is providing and also
realized that it kind of trounced most
of his easting businesses I was
wondering if you could speak to what you
feel are the largest area of
opportunities for developing on glass
outside of what Google will provide
naturally and a bonus question what will
be the production run for glass for
consumers well i mean i have to assyria
doubts but site i don't know what the
production numbers will be i think we're
more focused on with glass glass is a
new category it's quite different than
the existing computing devices and so i
think it's great that we've started on
it but I think our main goal is to get
happy users using glass and so we put on
you know a bunch out to developers I see
a lot of people with them in the
audience we want to make sure we're
building experiences that really make
people happy and so the team has tried
to build the minimal set of things just
rip rack t'kul sake minimal set of
things that will provide a great
experience and make happy users and then
you can get going and work on it for the
next 10 years in the ivory successive
one is going to be better obviously so I
think part of the answer is we don't
know you know I think the basic use
cases we have our own photography are
amazing i love taking kids of my
pictures of my kids with glass and
movies and so on and i find that you
know for me that's enough i have the
young kids for me that's another reason
to have glass just there i think if you
didn't have young kids you might not
feel exactly that way i'm not sure i
don't i have young kids so can tell
communications are also pretty amazing
navigation is amazing
certainly if you're walking you know if
you're in manhattan or something having
glass for navigation is unbelievable i
find is really really nice and i also
find that navigations amazing some of
the core experiences we have our think
are pretty amazing communications phone
calls has some buses voice you saw the
things we're doing around voice it's
amazing to always have the device there
to do that so I think ultimately a lot
of your experiences can move to glass
and we're relying on all of you to
figure all that out we're trying to get
the base thing to make app users so we
can get on with it we're lined with that
thank you you're welcome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
