forward since the original iPhone and it
is all screen it is beautiful to look at
it is incredible
to hold the display fits edge to edge
top to bottom it goes into each corner
where it follows the tight curve of the
design it has glass on both the front in
the back using the same super-strong
formula as iPhone 8 the ban is made from
a surgical grade stainless steel that's
both durable and polishes to a beautiful
finish it's engineered to be water and
dust resistant at a microscopic level
comes in two beautiful finishes space
grey and silver iPhone 10 has an all-new
display it's called the super Retina
display start with the super Retina
display is five point eight inches on
the diagonal it's got 24 36 by 1125
resolution that's over 2.7 million
pixels it is 458 pixels per inch now
this is the highest resolution and pixel
density ever in an iPhone the super
Retina display uses OLED technology this
is the first OLED display great enough
to be in an iPhone now with the display
going edge to edge and top to bottom on
bottom there's no more home button so
now when you want to go to the home
screen you simply swipe up from the
bottom you go home it's that simple and
the same fluid gesture also works for
multi tasking so if you're in an app and
you want a multi task you just swipe up
in the bottom you pause for split second
and you're in multi tasking and then you
can tap on any app and jump right to it
I know what you're thinking about what
about unlocking how do you unlock your
phone with iPhone 10 the iPhone 10 your
iPhone is locked until you look at it
and it recognizes you nothing has ever
been simpler more natural and effortless

to make face ID possible took some of
the most advanced technology we have
ever created and much of it is packed
right up here into this tiny little area
at the top of the display we call this
the true depth camera system and it is
made up of incredible state-of-the-art
technology there's an infrared camera a
flood illuminator the front side camera
and a dot projector and that's not all
there's also the proximity sensor the
ambient light sensor the speaker and
microphone all packed into this to depth
camera system area it is amazing in
