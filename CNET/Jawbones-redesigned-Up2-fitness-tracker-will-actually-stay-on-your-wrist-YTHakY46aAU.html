to out now that's more stylish and will
actually stay on your wrist this new
model features a slight redesign with a
hook clasp that makes the band less
likely to fall off it's leaps and bounds
better than the original up two which
was already one of our favorite fitness
trackers if you're not familiar with it
the up two was a bare-bones fitness
tracker it doesn't have a heart rate
sensor and there's no GPS or any sort of
notifications from your smartphone it
only does the basics but it does them
pretty well it can track the steps you
take distance traveled and calories
burned it will also automatically track
your sleep at night but it's not perfect
I found that up to has trouble
determining whether I'm laying awake in
bed or actually sleeping one of the best
things about the up is the software the
jawbone mobile app is extremely powerful
and frankly it's one of my favorites
aside from activity tracking there's
also food drink and mood tracking you
can also create teams and compete with
others but the flagship feature is the
smart coaching tips and feedback it's
pretty simple the more you use the up
software the more we'll learn about you
after only a few days of use you'll be
provided with feedback and tips to
better improve your life the up notice I
tend to stay up late so reminding me to
avoid the blue light from my smartphone
to help me fall asleep another
notification remind me to swap out chips
for crackers to aid in my weight loss
it's this sort of feedback and smart
coaching that makes the up shine ask for
battery life you can expect to get
around seven days the tracker is also
water resistant and can be worn in the
shower but not while swimming one of my
favorite things about the redesign is it
allows you to where the band flipped
around so that the bulky part is hidden
and the straps are on top this makes it
look more like a trendy bracelet than an
activity tracker
it also doesn't look half bad when you
wear it with a watch the redesigned up 2
is available now for $100 in the US
jawbone will continue selling the
original up but I wouldn't recommend
buying it the clasp is a bit finicky and
it doesn't keep the band on your wrist
if you're buying a jawbone the new up 2
with the lightweight and thin straps is
the one you
should get it still has some limitations
but it's better than ever before for
