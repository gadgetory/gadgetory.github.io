game Amazon it's kind of weird huh and
the fire phone is kind of weird too it's
not cheap it's not exactly pretty and
it's locked into Amazon's ecosystem of
apps and media so why buy this thing I'm
Donald Bell and in today's top five I'm
counting down the five most interesting
features of the Amazon fire phone
features that might even convince you to
give it a shot
starting off at number five
head-tracking 3d now I know that
anything 3d should be met with some
healthy skepticism but the way Amazon is
doing this is legitimately
groundbreaking stuff the phone uses four
cameras to track your head position in
real time and fool your brain into
seeing 3d on a 2d screen even if you
just use it to show off the lockscreen
image on your phone I can guarantee that
you will be showing this trick off to
everyone you know and isn't showing off
what technology is all about at number
four gesture control we've seen gesture
control on phones before the iPhone has
their shake to undo feature and the
Samsung Galaxy has their tilt controls
for scrolling and flipping pages but
Amazon it's the first to really bake
these gestures and tilt controls into
every aspect of the phone tilting
reveals menus and shortcuts a swivel
will show you your notifications and a
twist will reveal extra info like
restaurant ratings on a map I can't tell
yet if this is the future or a carpal
tunnel lawsuit waiting to happen but I'm
excited to give it a try coming in at
number three the Mayday button sure it's
advertised as a way for lonely guys to
chat up a redhead who's paid to tolerate
them but the truth is even if you don't
buy this phone the Mayday button could
save your relationships chances are if
you're watching CNET videos somebody
probably considers you their free tech
support so what if instead of calling
you mom press this mate a button and
could chat up our friend ginger here
think of the hours of your life you just
got back at number two Firefly the press
of a button you can call upon the powers
of the great Amazon brain to make sense
of the world around you Firefly can tell
you what song is playing with
TV show you're watching and if you point
it at something Firefly will try extra
hard to try to find a way to order it on
Amazon for you pair it up with a stolen
credit card and you've basically got a
magic Genie with unlimited wishes you'll
go to prison man what a weekend which
brings us to my number one Amazon fire
phone feature unlimited photo storage
every photo and video you take on this
phone will get automatically backed up
in full resolution to your Amazon Cloud
Drive no extra fees no storage limits if
you've ever lost a phone before you know
that losing your photos can be the
biggest bummer especially if there are
photos of your kid or a vacation or
sasquatch having those precious images
backed up automatically with no worry of
hitting a storage limit is a killer
feature so there you go five features at
the fire phone that could put it at the
top of your Amazon wishlist more info on
the fire phone and its competition

fives from me
