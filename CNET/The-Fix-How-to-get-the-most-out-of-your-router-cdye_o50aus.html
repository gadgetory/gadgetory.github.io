mean you're using it to its full
potential maybe someone else is the
initial setup and you may or may not
even be aware there are settings and
options you can even change don't worry
though
I'm going to show you a few tips and
tricks on how to improve your network
experience and how to access your router
settings first access your router
settings by going to its IP address
you'll usually find this address on the
bottom or back of your router use a
username and password provided but be
sure to change it to something more
secure when you get a chance once you're
in the first thing you want to do is
change your routers name or SSID too
many times I've gone over to a friend's
house only to see that their router is
listed as d-link such-and-such with a
bunch of numbers and letters behind it
no name your router to something easily
recognizable at least for the sake of
your visitors next update your firmware
sometimes connection or performance
issues will crop up and having the
latest firmware which is just the
software program for your router can
improve performance and fix issues you
also want to change your networks
password this is the password required
for devices to access your Wi-Fi change
this to something secure but something
you're likely to remember not just a
bunch of random numbers and letters if
you only have a 2.4 gigahertz band
router you should know that it uses some
of the same radio channels as your baby
monitor and your microwave not to
mention that if your neighbor is using
the same Wi-Fi channel as the one you're
using or one that shares bandwidth with
yours it's gonna interfere with your
performance so one of the fastest
channels to use 1 6 and 11 using those
channels should optimize your router
speed if you have a 5 gigahertz band
router you'll likely get faster internet
performance if you use that band 5
gigahertz there are more radio channels
to choose from and each has its own
bandwidth also be sure to choose either
Auto or 2040 for your channel bandwidth
this will give you the fastest speed
while making sure that your network is
compatible with as many devices as
possible there are plenty of other
options in your router settings
however the ones I just pointed out are
the easiest and most efficient</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
