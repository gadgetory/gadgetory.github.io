here's this happening this week on scene
at scrape block the beautification robot
applies makeup to human faces but as you
can see it does a terrible job to
students from the University of Applied
Arts in Vienna Austria created the
makeup bot to show the world that robots
are not always the best solution for
everyday tasks on this planet sometimes
it takes a human touch the
beautification robot was on display at
the 2015 Biennale Internationale design
in Saint Etienne France
the robot has two arms one for holding
the makeup brush that smears black
streaks on your face enhancing human
sexiness and another arm that holds a
tube of lipstick and rotates on a wheel
applying the perfect circle of lipstick
to the user German filmmaker and volcano
enthusiast Marc's egg lot was lucky
enough to witness and capture a
lightning storm generated by the
Sakurajima volcano during an eruption
earlier this month in Japan volcanic
lightning otherwise known as a dirty
thunderstorm is very rare but for some
reason this particular volcano seems to
produce a lot of it making it a great
place to study the phenomenon this video
is posted on Barcroft TVs YouTube
channel so if you get a chance check it
out now you can get your kicks with
these LED embedded kicks from Japanese
startup no new folks to do or is a
programmable performance shoe containing
100 full color remotely controlled LEDs
outfitted with advanced motion sensors
in a wireless bluetooth module your
dance moves will never be the same the
shoes connect to an app via bluetooth so
a user can jam the color of your shoes
as you bust a move on the dance floor
the shoes can also be set to respond a
certain way to the wearer's move the LED
shoes contain nine axis sensors embedded
in each soul which pick up the wears
movements and real time
this data can then be used to wirelessly
control various external devices such as
musical instruments video game
controllers and simple foot switches you
can get your own pair of orph LED smart
shoes for an early-bird pledge of $270
at IndieGoGo comm science fiction is
catching up with reality as we try to
wrap our heads around this terminator
like 3d printer that slowly renders
objects from a pool of liquid a startup
called carbon 3d is showing off their
new style of 3d printing called clip or
continuous liquid interface production
the clip technology uses photosensitive
resin that reacts to UV light in oxygen
producing objects that grow out of a
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle like ooze as
the printer slowly races them upwards
now it might take me all day to explain
exactly how this works but according to
the carbon 3d website at the heart of
the clip process is a special window
that is transparent sunlight and
permeable to oxygen much like a contact
lens by controlling the oxygen flux
through the window
flip creates a dead zone in the resin
pool just tens of microns thick about
two to three diameters of red blood cell
where photo polymerization cannot occur
as a series of cross-sectional images of
a 3d model is played like a movie into
the resin pool from underneath the
physical object emerges continuously
from just above the dead zone need more
about the carbon 3d printer in the crave
blog post
alright guys that's the show thank you
very much for watching as always you can
find all these new stores to see that
