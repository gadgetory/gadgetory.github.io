Tuesday time for another delicious
episode of the 359 podcast with Ben Fox
Rubin and Alfred Aang what are you
laughing at that was really nice intro
thank you so much I try dee-licious it's
nice to be back thank you very much
we're glad I'm glad we survived last
week i use it's good to have you back
fresh cuts that was in yeah yeah yeah
thank you hey I to keep up with you man
oh um anyway today we're gonna be
talking about Google's 3d sensing camera
tech called tango it's coming to its
first phone first consumer phone ever
you could buy it today if you wanted to
and we're also going to be discussing
our conversation with Microsoft's head
of devices Panos Panay and what he had
to say about the surface dial we'll see
if we can get to somewhere else after
that but I think that's about it for
today's show as always sending your
questions and comments will try to get
to as many as possible at the end of the
show and I think that's about it
anything else that Adam let's get the
show started let's do it let's get it
started and we'll start the recording of
the podcast in three two welcome to the
359 where we talk about the top tech
news of the day plus whatever else we
want to throw in I'm Ben Fox Rubin I'm
Alfred Aang the first phone using
Google's 3d sensing tango camera
technology is on sale starting today
it's the lenovo fab to phone oh sorry
it's the lenovo fab to pro it's a six
point four inch device starting at four
ninety nine cameras technology if you
don't know what it is uses two cameras
to measure objects when you're looking
right at them where it adds virtual
objects to the real into real-world
pictures kind of like pokemon go what do
you think of this less cool stuff let's
just forget about this as a phone in
general I mean just looking at it for
its camera functionality it it does feel
like Pokemon go on like steroids if
nothing I'm very excited about the the
furniture feature that they were showing
all right you can kind of like take
stuff from online and then just point it
at you know at something your house to
see what it look like I think that's one
of like the most obvious usages for this
type of technology and I think this is
like a that's that's like an easy way to
do it it's on your
own you can just kind of walk around
your apartment to do it I think I think
it's a good building block in step 2
what basically you know augmented
reality needs to be at you know just be
in everyone's pockets I I don't think it
should be its own device but you know I
think there's building blocks to this
kind of stuff so I think it's important
that they they roll out something like
this and then eventually it'll just be
on every device yeah yeah yeahs one of
the important things to mention too is
that more tangle enabled phones are
expected next year so this is just the
first one and as you said this this
could get revised or it could get
streamlined as it continues being added
in one of the things that I also like
about this is that you know like with
the oculus rift or the microsoft
hololens these are like these big chunky
devices you have to stick them on your
head and your kind of like divorced from
the rest of the world when you're doing
it I kind of think that this is a great
way to introduce people to a are kind of
like Pokemon go did yeah I think this is
uh has a lot of opportunity for gaming
they were showing off his kind of like
racing game that was based off of them
they are with their camera I think it
has a lot of great potential you saw a
Pokemon go took over the world totally
interesting to see what they'll do next
with it or there's a lot more gamers
that are trying to get outside more and
use augmented reality as a part of it so
you know using you know something i can
scan like the object in you know your
surroundings just using the camera
sounds incredible yeah Pokemon goes
different was using a camera in your gps
but it wasn't like scanning stuffs i'm
saying i'm thinking you know in these
terms they might even be able to take
stuff and put it to scale with like your
surroundings yeah definitely wanted to
get to the next story our own Scott
Stein chatted with Microsoft's head of
devices Panos Panay when he was in town
for the microsoft event last week pinay
hinted that the surface dial which is a
new kind of accessory that can be placed
right on a touchscreen is just the
beginning or it could be just the
beginning for a new sets new set of
accessories what do you think about that
I think it's really cool I you know I
was very excited to learn that the dial
could wasn't just for the surface studio
that you know that's right we're showing
off you put on any Windows 10 device I
was compatible with it and I think
that's the way to go with it you know
you don't want these you know crazy
awesome devices attached to like three
thousand dollar desktops and things are
you accessories like yes really
cool access you don't want that like oh
but that only works with this thing
right than three thousand dollars to use
it I'm curious to see what other you
know you know accessories are thinking
about putting out there the most obvious
one seemed to be a pen but you know they
already have that I know what would be
cool if they just added like um like a
touch bar onto their surface book sorry
i totally stole that joke from you but
no they're probably not going to do that
I really think I'd really like you to do
too but yeah I my imagination is failing
me here on you know what else could be
there yeah the surface style is totally
different so it will be interesting to
see what else Microsoft comes out with
anyway if we want to read more about
these stories check us out on cnet I'm
Ben Fox Rubin I'm Alfred hang thanks for
listening and thanks for sticking with
us in the chat i'm gonna start looking
at the questions right now a lot of
people do like the dial I think we're on
par with that we like dial too yeah it's
only 99 bucks by the way is okay granted
only is not the nicest like some people
might not want to pay that much how much
was the Apple pen Oh God pencil wiggle
pencil I will look it up right now but
I'm almost positive are we doing prices
right style on this I feel like it was
149 or something off the top of my head
but I might be wrong about that I'm
gonna go if 9999 it was now so you can
either get an apple pencil or a surface
dial for ninety-nine dollars I'm more
interested in the dial or you could buy
amazon prime for a year I'm gonna go
with that one no apples and oranges hey
slide wants to know do you think six
point four inches is just too big and
that isn't definitely very big for me
that's a personal question yeah that is
original context yeah oh we just got
scammed dude we just got alright that's
fine little mischief night Michael thing
that you started on the tango phone no I
know I know um I I would have said
absolutely it's there but do I have I
have an iphone 6 and that's five a seven
plus eight point seven yeah seven plus
is like 5.5 isn't it you
yeah so like 6.4 like nah no I think
they're trying to get people excited and
interested in the just get a tablet then
why didn't they just go to a tablet once
michael says that they should have just
made a tablet smartphone maybe ideas
like they wanted it's something in
everyone's pockets you know that it's
accessible like that to give a lot more
outreach with it but I i agree 6.4 is a
little bit ridiculous just make a tablet
here's a small possibility that they may
have needed to make it that big at least
initially so the two different cameras
that are used for this 3d sensing could
be far enough apart and they could put
everything else into the phone that is
just a theory i'm just throwing it out
there but because this is the first one
out in the market maybe they had to make
the phone a little i think i think i
think that the point is though why make
it a phone why make it a phone and
because they wanna marry for the idea of
like it's going with you everywhere baby
yeah that's what I was the rhetoric is
about the red primary tablet market
Rises yes yeah which was the story
they're never gonna get to hit in the
hidden character again that was our
easter egg story so that we were gonna
mention that like the tablet market is
doing very very poorly so it makes a lot
of sense that they would do a phone
because phones just sell better than
tablets these days that's true do we
want to take a look at that story as
little bonus here yeah why not loyal
viewers for our loyal viewers in the
regular podcast but exclusive to you on
youtube right so this is this is
something that's been going on for quite
some time and researcher IDC just came
out with their quarterly report Apple is
still number one ahead of everybody else
as far as tablets are concerned with
tablet sales for the third quarter
however they've been seeing shrinking
demand for the tablets for a really long
time a big reason for that is is that
you buy a tablet you don't need to
replace it after two years you don't
need to replace it after three or four
years sometimes or even more than that
what was interesting about this report
to is one of the guys that was actually
coming out with a lot of sales a lot
more sales than they did last year was
actually Amazon because they sell these
low-cost tablets you could throw them at
your kids not literally now but um what
is going on at the rubin house a lot of
people a lot of people probably just
want like a simple tablet that they
could use and like have
kids use and if they break it whenever
no big deal yeah i just that i use the
fifty-dollar tablet yeah I'm okay with
it it's not perfect not the greatest
doesn't do with the iPad does know that
most people a lot of people don't need
that and so that seems to be the main
growth area for the tablet let me put
netflix on it can you answer an email on
it you know i haven't used the fire
tablet i have like a i'm different
amazon tablet and it works just fine
that's what I don't know I got a kind of
simple core basic lucky and web browsing
personals xsarahx and it's plasticky the
back is plasticky the front is glass the
screens perfectly fine maybe the touch
screen isn't like completely perfect
like I've tried out iPads before and
like yeah it's a totally smoother device
that kind of thing however you're paying
so much more money for it like I'm
willing to deal with getting a slightly
work product for like yeah I point on
why the tablet market is shrinking now
cuz like I look at that tablet unless
that like cracks or like you know craps
out on me I'm perfectly fine with just
sticking around it it so it's like
slower than normal people figure it out
or the major tech companies have figured
out that tablet market is a lot like the
desktop and laptop market that you
really do not need to replace a tablet
after like five years or something maybe
Samsung was onto something by entering a
self-destruct mode back to the topic at
hand can tangle be used for mapping
applications uh that is definitely one
potential yeah always fellers one of the
I can't imagine that nothing at the top
of the list that would be really cool
too but that was actually one of the
points made in the story yeah where it's
like it's got like new GPS features on
it when we're comparing it to the
original GPS right I think one of the
things that I find kind of annoying when
using google maps is that when you when
you're doing it for like walking
directions as opposed to like driving
directions or something it's not as easy
to use is just not as seamless so that
would be kind of cool if they could just
use like 3d sensing technology to just
add the directions like directly onto
your phone so you just see an arrow
while looking at the real yeah maybe
would be cool if there was like a
crowdsource thing like that
like with ways mmm but you know like
people like taking scans of things like
throughout like basically like a like a
crowdsource like google street view yeah
like using like AR yeah that's an idea I
don't know you can have a lethal
obviously sound like people are
certainly interested in AR I think a
little bit more than VR potentially at
this point because like Pokemon go
showed that you're actually connect to
the real world I think like VRS got
great technology but at the same time
it's like I think it still got this like
connection whether it was like what are
you doing when you're just yeah anytime
I use a VR headset only office anytime I
use a VR headset in the office I take it
off and I feel like I just woke up from
a long nap and I'm like what is going on
here I just like year is it I just feel
disappointed in the real world and want
to go back really it's not gonna to go a
lawnmower man you should try it you
should try we have the new Playstation
one I played Valkyrie for a while it was
pretty fun so you should try that well
that's what I'm doing at work all day
today the ps4 I did that on friday so i
don't know if anybody on the chad has
tried the new Playstation one but i will
say i enjoyed it i thought about like
imagine that like in terms of like a are
though like compared like if you can do
something like that from your phone
totally yeah i guess that's the idea i
don't think that i don't think you could
play Valkyrie on your phone but in the
same something versal ray yeah uh
Michael comments i bought an ipad pro
9.7 inch head of two weeks and returned
it all it did was collect dust and in a
similar fashion swim but how good was it
at collecting dust it was so good it was
the most beautiful dust collector you've
ever seen he is also in the market for
replacing his uh 2014 macbook air
13-inch what do you think he should get
ah that's such a hard question aren't
you also in the market for replacing
your laptop yeah which is why i know
that's a hard question you know i
actually looked at the surface book for
a little while I feel like touch screens
are really interesting and they're just
it's just much more intuitive to use so
I'm personally looking at a
windows-based touchscreen
laptop at this point I would probably
say one of the best ones out there right
now is the dell XP 13 or 15 that one
gets a lot of really good ratings I wish
the HP Spectre had a touch screen I
don't think that it does yet but that's
also like a beautiful beautiful design
so those are two interesting ones also
the new macbook pro the 13 inch without
the touch bar I thought was certainly a
consideration comparable if you want to
if you want to jump it if you want to
stay in the Apple universe and you're
willing to spend fifteen hundred dollars
I think that if you have a macbook air
that's that's probably going to be the
closest thing that you can get to it but
joins a lot of money join debt dongle
life that is that is definitely a major
issue yeah for sure but hopefully that
was out fault yeah I would make the
argument that at this point you know the
laptop that you're getting should have
some kind of touch capability with it
whether it be a bar or the screen I
wasn't that's old i don't know how much
you I was moreso talking about the
screen I that like do you not like it's
been so long now that like laptops have
had touch screens that it's just I feel
like that should be a standard at this
point it is for the photos based ones
they suddenly are so but either way
Michael and I'm still doing research
myself so those were just a couple of
ideas that I had been considering so and
I would definitely say look at the
surface book because I definitely
thought that it had a lot of those check
marks in there so Sheamus self plug I
don't know what exactly is coming
through but I know dan ackerman in the
pc lab and working on some laptops here
coming up very soon he's got a pretty
stack schedule so there'll be some new
stuff to look at so keep an eye out for
him yeah definitely ask brian Tong from
Cena how to dongle that sounds like a
really bad dance craze like the next
Maharaja sounded dirty that Donald area
like like what we were talking about
earlier but six foot four six point four
inch dongle see all right now I'm
officially blushing welcome to the
dollar wall I'm fun and games I'm sorry
I'm so glad I went back on the bad guys
yeah do we have any more questions or
we're gonna wrap it I think it's about
time to wrap it thanks
everybody all right let's do it happy
Halloween everybody that was late i know
