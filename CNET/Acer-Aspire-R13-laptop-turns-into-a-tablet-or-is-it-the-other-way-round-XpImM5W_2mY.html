2014 in Berlin Germany and we're looking
at the Acer Aspire r-13 now this is a
new model that's blending some of the
ideas from their slicker s series and
the older R series that gives it the
convertible elements alongside that kind
of slicker s vibe so the R 13 here has a
screen that does rotate into a few
different positions they call it the the
easel stand and it basically means it's
quite a nice kind of system that just
lets you very comfortably and in a quite
stable way shift the screen in a lot of
different positions so it can kind of
step forward into a you know a nice
easel position for working with a pen
you can you know flip it backwards go go
flat into a tablet mode and you go
backwards in your presentation mode as
well so there's a lot of different ways
to use it they're offering it in a very
high spec level as well so while it's
starting prices are going to be a US
$8.99 in America and then euro $8.99 a
here in Europe with other prices to be
confirmed
soon it will be able to be Specht up all
the way to Intel Core i7 to eight gigs
of RAM and up to a terabyte of SSD
storage in raid 0 so they're really
offering some serious specs with this
device it's overall I think it's a very
premium feeling device from Acer and the
screen itself does feel nice it's
Gorilla Glass it has an ante fingerprint
coating a lot of nice features the
speaker system is a Dolby home theater
speaker system the speakers actually
shoot downwards underneath the the the
main body of the device and they've
pointed out that even if your so you're
viewing it in presentation mode it will
intelligently adjust the orientation of
your speaker sound to keep the right and
left channel in the right locations so
overall really nice looking device um
you've got yo USB 3 HDMI a lot of the
different ports that you care about SD
card slot all those kinds of elements
and the optional S Pen or S Pen rather
the the Acer active pen is what they're
calling it
and that lets you again duel
sort of fine work on the screen when
you're using in that forward easel mode
so we'll get to see a lot more specs
with this as we get hands-on soon but I
am Seamus burn from Aoife 2014 here in
Berlin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
