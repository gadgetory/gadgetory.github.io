Apple had hoped for and why the iPhone
10 could be coming back from the dead
we're back after a little break with a
brand new batch of Apple news and rumors
on the apple core
to say that apples had a rough start to
the holidays would be an understatement
there's been talk of production cuts on
the new iPhones weaker-than-expected
demands and a looming tariff threat now
before we even begin to go down that
road let me make a couple things clear
first off it seems like every year we'd
love to spell doom for Apple but
regardless of the headlines Apple will
still sell a lot of iPhones and they're
actually gonna make a lot of money off
these iPhones because now they cost more
but sales have failed to meet analysts
expectations so this in turn has
apparently forced Apple to cut back on
production orders for the iPhone 10 our
tennis and tennis max this in turn has
for suppliers to cut costs according to
a Bloomberg report Foxconn Apple's main
iPhone supplier is expected to cut
nearly three billion dollars from its
expenses for 2019 now that's almost half
of their yearly expenses and this is not
the first time Apple has had to cut
production orders at least according to
the rumors and it's not just Foxconn
that's affected camera lens supplier
larkin precision along with other
suppliers expect to see revenue dips
based on the slow demand according to a
digitized report and then there's the
tariff issue as a trade war with China
heats up president Donald Trump has
threatened to impose a ten percent
tariff on iPhones and MacBooks imported
from this country and while it may just
be a negotiation tactic if it were
actually to become a reality it could
cost Apple over a billion dollars in
earnings until that happens there is a
silver lining for consumers in all this
better deals on Apple devices in what
seems to be an attempt to boost demand
for its newer iPhone lineup Apple is
currently giving up to $100 more in
trade credit for older models now this
only applies if you happen to be
upgrading to the iPhone 10 our tennis or
10s plus and who knows how long it'll
last but hey it's a deal from Apple
nonetheless and those don't come very
often Apple is also apparently lowering
the price of the new iPhone 10 are in
Japan which is not common for new
devices users who sign on to a 24 month
contract with NTT DoCoMo
Japan's largest carrier could save up to
$100 on the cheaper iPhone model now the
same Wall Street Journal report also
states that Apple has been forced to
resurrect production of the iPhone 10
this to make up for the unused OLED
panels that it had already committed to
buying from Samsung for the newer iPhone
tennis and tennis plus models now with
production cuts to those newer models
it's having to make more of last year's
iPhone 10 to fill in the gap does this
mean Apple is gonna resurrect the iPhone
10 on the Apple Store and how much would
that cost we'll have to get back to you
on that one
but now let's move on to a little bit of
good news about the iPhone thanks to a
new Intel chip iPhones could be getting
5g support sooner than we had expected
now early rumors suggested that Apple
would be slow to the punch on 5g support
for its iPhones this after other phone
manufacturers have already started
implementing it into their designs now
Intel though just announced the new X mm
eight one six zero chip that can support
speeds of up to six times faster than
the latest LTE models available today
now it may be a bit late to put it into
the 2019 iPhones but definitely a
possibility for early 2020 which at this
point is almost a year away and that's
kind of insane we're gonna end on a high
note with the Apple watch
finally getting Spotify support to all
users
now let's taper down expectations a
little bit you're only gonna be getting
the basic playback controls such as play
pause back forward rewind ability to
collect your favorites and replay recent
tracks but it's promising it's a
promising start at least and as for the
future of the Apple watch we might be
getting a camera I will filed for a
patent for two cameras on the Apple
watch van which could be used for photos
videos and FaceTime now it's long been
rumored that Apple would support
FaceTime calls on the Apple watch but we
weren't quite sure what that would look
like whether that would be a camera on
the watch itself or on the band as the
patent suggests and now thank
the patent we're getting a clear picture
that's all I have for this week's show
but we're just weeks away until the end
of the year which is kind of crazy and I
want to start collecting your 2019 Apple
wishlist now this can include anything
from products services software updates
guys the limit you know the drill just
leave your answers on the comments
section below or hit me up on Twitter
and of course come back next week for
more apple core</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
