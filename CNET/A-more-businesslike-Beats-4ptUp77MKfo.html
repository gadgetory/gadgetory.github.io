for cnet.com and I'm here with the beats
by dre executive headphones these are a
noise cancelling model with a little bit
more of a business attitude and designed
to go up against something like the bose
qc15 headphones that said they still do
look like beats headphones but they're a
little bit trimmer they also have a
little bit more understated design a
little cleaner look to them and what I
like about them is they do seem to be
better built in previous beats
headphones they have a very solid feel
to them they have what seems to be a
sturdy metal headband they also full
flat and fit into their carrying case I
also like that they come with a magnetic
cover for the battery compartment these
do have to be turned on to be used what
small gripe is that if you leave them on
they do stay on so that's a bit of a
problem your battery will run out it
would be nice and beats had an automatic
turn off function as far as other
features go these have a detachable cord
and you have two cords to choose from
one that has an inline remote and
microphone and one that is just a
straight cord you will lose a little bit
of quality every time you do go with a
noise cancelling headphone there's a lot
of digital processing that goes along
with that the noise cancelling is
certainly decent with these the sound
quality is also good to very good it's
really a question of what you're
expecting out of beats headphones these
don't have as much bass as your typical
beats headphones I like that they have a
little bit more refined sound that's
that people have high expectations for
three hundred dollar headphones so you
have people all over the map on how they
feel about these headphones but all in
all I like the sound a little bit better
than what beats is typically known for
aside from that the real question is
should you buy these verses the bose
qc15 s which also retail for the same
price these are very comfortable they
may not be quite as comfortable as the
bows and the noise cancelling may not be
quite as good but it's really a question
of taste there's some people out there
that don't think the bows are that great
so it's a very difficult choice I would
lean slightly more towards the bows as a
safer choice they're slightly more
comfortable a little bit lighter but
these certainly aren't
Proactive pair of noise cancelling
headphones and yes they are expensive at
three hundred dollars i'm david cone and
these are the beats by dre executive
headphones thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
