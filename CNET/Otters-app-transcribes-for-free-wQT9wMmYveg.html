look at a free audio transcription app
called otter basically it takes a live
transcript of your conversation as it's
happening but then later it has some
artificial intelligence to make it
cleaner and easier to use this is
something that you think you would use
yeah sure yeah I mean I'm a reporter so
I do a lot of interviews so this would
probably be something that could be
really useful instead of just I don't
know like going through all the
transcriptions on my own right and I can
see there being a lot of uses for other
news cases like a student who wants to
get notes of her lecture if you're in a
meeting and nobody in the meeting want
to actually have to take the notes you
can get a transcript of the meeting to
you or if you're a video creator and you
want easy closed captions you can just
record while you're recording mm-hmm
okay John but what about privacy issues
well you know I asked the company about
this and they said that it's basically
the same privacy relationship that you'd
have with a Google Docs or Dropbox so
right now we have this live recording
going what we're gonna do now is stop it
and wait so after about 15 minutes half
an hour an hour it's pending on the
length of your recording the app will
stop showing you some flashing dots
indicating it's working on your
transcript and instead show you a green
checkmark saying that it's done at that
point you should have a pretty clean
transcript of your recording it'll
separate out different speakers and
identify the ones whose voice it knows
it'll be searchable not only inside that
transcript but across to your different
notes and you can also search by
automated key words that it generates
based on how often you say something
during the conversation
one cool feature is that if you replay
the audio the transcript will highlight
the words that are being spoken as you
hear them it's not perfect I said my
name during our conversation and it
identified me as John rather than Joan
but it's still better than a lot of
options out there and completely free</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
