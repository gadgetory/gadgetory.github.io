all new vector 150 sunset drive from OCC
now is only but have nothing to talk
about that's not because I've been
talking about so many SSD and run out of
things to talk about that's part of it
the main reason is because just last
year I review this vektor drive one of
the fastest drive up is Tam and the new
drive is just exactly the same as you
can see they share the same design the
same thickness and the same sata3 sickly
bit per second standard now in other
words this new drive here can work in
any place where a regular hard drive
like this one at the same standard is
being used and we make things a lot
faster and it also comes with this
desktop bracket here and I left school
to attach the drive to it and now it can
also fit easily in a desktop computer so
in other words you can use this new
drive here to replace any SATA hard
drive you are using at home and things
will be a lot faster but that's not new
because that's true for most SSDs now on
the inside the new vector 150 he has a
few thing different from his older
brother first it's actually use new
flash memory 19 nanometer as opposed to
the 25 nanometer use in the vector it
also support hardware encryption which
is very good for business but that's not
new because it's many others SSD also
support hardware inscription now in my
testing unfortunately the vector 150 is
not the same as the victor it is faster
in some tests but slower in the other
but you know is there a very fast onset
drive you can expect the sustained speed
of 240 megabyte per second when it does
both writing and reading at the same
time now that is very fast but then
again is not new because I've seen other
drive offering equally fast performance
so how about pricing maybe there's
something new there well no the drive
here is available in three capacity
120 gig to and 40 gig and for an 80 gigs
that caused hundred and thirty dollars
two and four dollars and five hundred
dollars respectively or about a little
bit more than a dollar per gigabyte in
fact cut expensive compared with other
drives now it does come included with
our Kunis 2013 one of the best backup
including software on the market for
windows of which the CD key I cannot
show you because it's not for everyone
so maybe the whole packet is not that
bad deal and there's one more thing this
cute little I heart my SSD sticker right
here but that's what I don't really love
my SSD I like them as friends now for
more and to say not so much more on this
Drive check out my full review said com
if you bid wondering why I've been able
to talk about nothing for the last few
minutes and make things so interesting
well that's because I'm don't know and
this is the vector 150 sort of state
drive from OCC</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
