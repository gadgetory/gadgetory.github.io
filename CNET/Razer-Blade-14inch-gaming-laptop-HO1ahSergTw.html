of the gaming world it's sophisticated
ly subdued design paired with its
high-end components make it a great
mainstream gaming laptop the updated
2017 model has Intel's latest generation
i7 processor improved graphics and
better battery life it also weighs a
little less than last year's model and
it has a cheaper starting price
the base model which comes with the full
HD screen and 256 gigabytes of
solid-state storage costs 1899 the VR
ready laptop can also be upgraded to a
greater storage capacity and a 4k screen
my favorite thing about the blade is its
elegantly restrained design in
comparison to current gaming laptop
aesthetics which are pretty bold with
alien or angular accents and glowing
lights the blade is simply sleek and
slim it resembles the old black MacBooks
but with the pop of color it has a
beautiful chroma key board that lights
up in a variety of colors like other
chroma keyboards you can customize it to
your heart's delight or just use a
preset unfortunately it's a fingerprint
magnet it's graphics card has 6
gigabytes of video RAM and it's the best
price versus performance card in the
current Nvidia lineup it's not the
geforce 1070 or 1080 GPU that serious
gamers will want but it gets the job
done the blade kept up with doom at high
frame rate settings with almost no
dropped frames even in chaotic
situations the blades aluminum chassis
does get hot easily when gaming but it
cools down pretty quickly after you're
done playing it also has two fans on the
bottom that can get pretty loud during
gameplay one big advantage of Intel's
latest processor is better battery life
the razor blades battery lasted eight
hours in 15 minutes in our CNET labs
battery testing up from 5 hours and 41
minutes in the previous model obviously
battery life when gaming is a lot
shorter the gorgeous Razer Blade lacks
the customization of a full sized gaming
laptop or desktop and it costs more than
other gaming laptops with similar specs
so it's hard to recommend for either
very serious or very
budget-minded gamers but its portability
and style our top priorities the razor
blade is a great option</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
