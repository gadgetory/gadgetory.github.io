a look at the HP spectre 13 X 2 now that
X 2 means unlike the regular Spectre 13
which was a 13-inch ultrabook we liked a
lot this is a hybrid so that means it
actually comes apart we've got the
laptop mode right here you put this
little switch right here over and then
BOOM look at that I've got a tablet and
what really separates this from a lot of
the other hybrids that we've seen is
that this guy is a 13 inch screen it's
very rare you see a 13 inch tablet or
even a 13 inch hybrid I really like the
idea of having a bigger screen in one of
these it's great for movie watching it's
great for presentations and it's big
enough that you can use it as your
full-time laptop all day every day you
can't really do that with one of those
you know a 10 inch or 11 inch hybrids
now I like that you have a full 1920 by
tangi screen here that's a small upgrade
over the base price but for I think an
extra $70 well worth it big keyboard
typical HP style that works well I
didn't love the touch pad that was a
little bit of a deal killer for me it
just was not sensitive enough it missed
enough taps and swipes so I got
frustrated using it I did like however
that unlike a lot of other hybrids you
get a decent amount of ports and
connections on here you've got two USB
in the base you've got an HDMI out in
the base and you've got a micro SD in
the screen and you've also got some
pretty handy media controls you've got
little volume control they fit right
under your fingers on the base of the
screen while you're holding it and that
makes a lot easier to let's say turn on
the volume while you're watching a movie
but you need to do something else a lot
of tablets and hybrids in particular
make that kind of hard to get to this
guy starts at 1099 we added a cup of
upgrades to get the high-res screen and
802 dot 11ac Wireless that brought us up
to just a little bit under 1200 bucks
still pretty reasonable Core i5 128 gig
SSD when you factor in that the spectres
are very well made and that you have
this pull apart nature to it it is a
hybrid and still did not love the touch
pad and the thing gets a little bit
top-heavy because all the components are
back here tilts back a little bit too
easily not the best weighted in laptop
mode you can however use pretty much all
day long if you use the one battery that
here and the second battery that's in
the base that's one of the great things
about hybrids you have this opportunity
to squeeze an extra battery in there I'm
done Akron and that is the HP Spectre 13
x2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
