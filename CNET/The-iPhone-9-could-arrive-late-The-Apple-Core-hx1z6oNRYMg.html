10 that has us questioning everything we
thought we knew about this phone and the
iPad pro prediction we're hoping will
not come true let's get to the core of
this week's Apple news and rumors all
right let's get down to business and get
this portion out of the way Apple has
just announced it's earning reports for
the third quarter of 2018 here's what
you need to know first up Apple makes a
lot of money so for the company to
increase revenue by 17% is a pretty big
deal next people still bought a ton of
iPhones even with that hefty price tag
on the iPhone 10 the company's still
managed to gross sales slightly but at a
higher price which means Apple made more
money per unit so there's that Apple
services aka App Store Apple music and
iCloud which make up a thinner slice of
the revenue pie compared to the iPhone
grew at a ridiculous rate 30% for the
second quarter in a row and there others
category so the Apple watch air pods etc
is also skyrocketing with a 37 percent
increase over the same period last year
Mac numbers were pretty much the only
ones that dip this quarter but that's
not stopping Apple they're on their way
to become the first trillion-dollar
company you surprise guys we have more
leaks but at least it seems like every
week they're getting better and better
and these latest dummy units from Ben
Gaskin would almost pass as the real
deal almost now the larger one as you
can see is probably the iPhone 10 plus
with that 6.5 inch OLED screen and dual
lens setup on the back similar to what
we find on the iPhone 10 just note that
it's not the three lenses as early
rumours had suggested the other one
would be the cheaper 6.1 inch model
we've been calling the iPhone 9 for now
with that LCD screen and single
rear-facing camera
now the 5.8 inch model seems to be
missing in action in these shots but as
far as we can tell most of what we've
seen in these images at least coincides
with previous leaks and rumors about the
next trio of iPhones
in fact they're getting so good that
it's easy to forget that until launch
date nothing is set in stone in fact I'm
actually still hoping that Apple pulls a
fast one and some of these rumors don't
end up being true and now there's
actually hope for that aside from the
fact that we haven't even been able to
agree on three names for these phones
now it seems like the iPhone 9 may have
even thinner bezels than its OLED
counterparts at least according to a new
report in Japanese site Miqo'te Carra
this contradicts what rumors and some
men get skin leaks have been showing us
for weeks and yes in theory LCD screens
can't get as close to the edge as OLED
screens but this would be no ordinary
LCD screen according to the makoto cairo
report apple is using a full active LCD
screen from japan display ink with this
technology Apple would be able to get
its bezels down 2.5 millimeters half the
size of the bezels on the current iPhone
1095 Mac also noted a report in the Wall
Street Journal from a year ago which
first suggested the change to full
active LCD screens yet another point for
that cheaper iPhone which even Apple is
expecting to be their best seller this
year based on their increase in their
order size but if this rumor does in
fact happen to pan out it comes with a
pretty hefty downside the report also
says that this new technology has cost
production issues that would delay the
phone until November so we'll have a
repeat of last year with the iPhone 10
except this year we might be waiting
even longer all right guys so what's it
gonna be thicker bezels arriving in
September or with slimmer bezels be
worth the wait
I'm kind of an instant gratification
kind of person so I really don't care
about the thicker bezels as long as I
can get my hands on it right away but
that's just me leave your comments on
the comment section below or on Twitter
but at least the good news is that we
have two opposing rumors and that's
exciting what sadly isn't a rumor is
that Apple and Qualcomm have decided to
part ways
this means the next batch of iPhones
could be slower than their Android
counterparts in previous years
Apple has used Qualcomm and Intel modems
in its iPhones but in light of recent
legal battles Apple has decided to ditch
welcome all together and go exclusively
with its competitors chips which we're
taking to mean Intel now speed tests
have shown that Qualcomm powered
smartphones are capable of faster
network speeds then devices running on
Intel processors so take that as you
will now the move could be temporary so
here's hoping they'll kiss and make up
by next year when Qualcomm rolls out its
5g chips two smartphones or else the
next iPhones could be left in the dust
okay but enough about the iPhone let's
talk about the other Apple product that
is rumored to be getting a refresh
before the end of the year that's the
iPad pro now rumor has it both the ten
point five and twelve point nine inch
models will be getting a full redesign
this year in line with the iPhone 10
design so that means slimmer bezels face
ID no home button and no headphone jack
face ID on the iPad would make a lot of
sense instead of the fingerprint scanner
but only if it supports both vertical
and horizontal unlock something we
thought we had found hidden in the iOS
12 beta but that might not be the case
according to that same report we talked
about in Mac o takara that smart
connector has changed positions in the
new iPads meaning the keyboard will be
attached to the bottom of the iPad near
where you plug in the Lightning port and
not the side this because Apple was not
able to figure out base ID support for
horizontal displays so you'll be writing
in vertical display now good luck with
that
that's it for our show but you can
always stay up to date on the latest

catch me next week with more apple core</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
