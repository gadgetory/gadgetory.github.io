baby Cadillac with a very simple mission
get out there and settle the score with
the 3-series and the c-class or don't
come home let's drive this 2013 ATS
all-wheel drive sedan and check the tech
an ATS has got pretty similar
proportions to the 3 series or a c-class
the look is like neither it's got none
of that swooping rounded stuff of the
three a little bit of a resemblance to a
C in the front but there's so much other
Cadillac DNA going on and I really like
how the shoulders flow down over its
hips as you look at it from front cross
section to my eye it's the most clean
honest and modern Cadillac out there it
doesn't have all that baroque excess you
still find in the Escalade nor does it
have that kind of dully machismo Tommy
Bahama look of the CTS and its other
siblings it's a clean honest urban
looking car
now the Cadillac design language is
carried over inside the vehicle but not
quite to the degree of excess you see in
some of their other cars which I kind of
like the way it's dialed back a little I
don't get quite so many of these sort of
trapezoidal shapes the steering wheel is
very Cadillac the crest still is going
to put some people off as fuddy-duddy
the main effect of course is this guy
right here see what happened when I did
that look pull my hands away and the
Cadillac Q user experience goes to a
relatively clean screen after a few
moments but as I approach the screen
other options come up on the top and
bottom ribbon that's one of the keys to
what they do here proximity sensing to
keep things clean when you don't need to
have additional details up there
navigation is not in every Q head unit
just because you have this interface
doesn't mean you have nav bear that in
mind it's basically an $800 differential
to get it on top of Q they rave a lot
about how this Navigator faces like a
tablet you can pinch and zoom and they
wish the response is so much more poor
than on even a cheap tablet they
shouldn't make that comparison till
they've got more horsepower behind it
they rave about natural voice command
everybody does let's see if they're
serious say a command or they help
address say the address in California or
say the command change state of your ad
1000 Van Ness Avenue San Francisco
California 1 0 0 0 then Ness Avenue San
Francisco California is that correct
damn right it is now let's go to our
audio sources that's a key part of this
thing notice you've got audio and
Pandora both surfaced here I always find
that kind of dopey it's like just put
all the audio together but a lot of
systems do that under media you're going
to find your fun stuff you can get your
disc which is over here in the glovebox
you've got an optical drive there my
iPod hooks up through a USB here or
through a USB here under this kind of
weird little lift up deal I put a blue
light on it though so it's easy to find
that's nice streaming of course via my
smart phone same way I do my calling and
do my contacts integration we've got the
fancy Bose system in this guy you can
Center on driver rear seat Center
point which is their DSP setting you've
got pretty basic tone controls beyond
that notice I can drag these presets up
and down if I want to see a bunch of
them or just one ribbon at a time or
none at all similar flexibility goes for
this little display here in the
speedometer using this rocker switch on
the wheel I can either expand my fuel
information there or put different
information in that window go to the
middle and there I can show my phone
settings go after navigation on the left
i can show my digital speedo expand that
or my odometers as well as fuel range
now because we've got the v6 we'll talk
about in a minute one choice only on the
gearbox automatic transmission right
here shiftable gate on the left you
probably saw the paddles on the wheel
hard to miss them it's a Cadillac
they're chrome and they're big and
they're on the wheel so they're always
in the wrong place when you want them
now when and if you get the hood up on
this car we had three smart guys work on
it for like five minutes then the three
of us for ten more there we go well
cheap this little sheet metal lever ever
note the Cadillac here's the big motor
that they sent us 3.6 liter direct
injection v6 does some good numbers 321
horse 274 foot-pounds of torque moves
this 3,300 pound sedan to 16 about five
three five four we have the all-wheel
drive here by the way
mpg is 20 to 28 I mean not bad all
things given but that's where the other
two smaller engines intrigue me more
there's a two and a half liter for the
bore for why bother the middle engines
the cool one a 2-liter four with a twin
scroll turbo and direct injection gets a
just right 272 horse and 260 foot-pounds
of torque and delivers a full 30 Highway
mpg plus you can get that guy with a
six-speed manual like the other little
motor you can't in this guy
this is a great engine it's a lot of
engine a 3.6 v6 in this car is plenty of
power and the power comes on just
beautifully the problem is the
transmission gets in the way remember
automatic only on the three six v6 and
that's too bad because in any of the
automatic modes it's a bore it falls on
its face it misses shifts it hunts too
high too often and it pisses me off what
you can do of course is knocking into
manual mode shift it yourself and it
basically gets out of the way at that
point the shifts are pretty tight when
you're doing them great exhaust note and
I like the combination in this car of
handling and compliance and then a great
job dialing in comfortable ride which
you've got to have in a Cadillac and
good handling without being punishingly
harsh that keeps it upright in turns and
I can drive this little car all day it
doesn't feel as heavy as a CTS I didn't
even bother to compare the weights I'm
sure there's a couple hundred three
hundred pounds difference between them
there's a nine inch difference I can
tell you that this car is significantly
shorter and it feels more sprightly and
joyous bottom line the ATS is a success
with this engine but you got to get
around the gearbox that's why I'm so
intrigued by that 2-liter di turbo form
and I can't wait to drive one of those
to compare this price this ATS I'm
talking about the v6 in this particular
case 4200 90 is your basic v6 but you
got to add about 5500 on top of that to
go CNET style that means you get to what
they call the premium level that rolls
in navigation surround sound and a
variety of nice days including magnetic
ride control suspension but how's the
80s going to do in general I think we've
got a watch here is doesn't have enough
to pry people away from outstanding
German sedans
if you equal someone who's already got a
big lead in front you that may not be
enough this car has to play on a few
coins first of all better value second
of all by American third a different
look that I finally think Cadillac can
say is actually better
