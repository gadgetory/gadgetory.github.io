has it the show that rounds up the
week's biggest tech rumors and you can
vote on what you think about the rumors
too in the interactive player if you're
watching on cnet if it's ever slow week
in rumor land I can always rely on Apple
to make things interesting and LG and
sony might have some tricks up their
sleeves so let's get started first up LG
Electronics has filed for a series of
trademarks that may point to a tablet
smart watch and other devices according
to a report from pocket droid the g pad
G watch G glass G link g band and the G
hub are among the trademark names so G
pad would likely be a tablet g band
could be an activity monitor and G watch
would be you guessed it a SmartWatch so
trademark filings don't necessarily mean
that all of these products are in the
works of course but come on I'm sure LG
is working on a SmartWatch and tablet
and all those other things everybody
else is next according to the blog sony
alpha sony is reportedly working on a
lens attachment for your mobile device
the lens would have a built-in sensor
battery and memory so it could mount
onto a smartphone or be used on its own
it would send photos to your smartphone
or tablet through Wi-Fi NFC even further
the lens would supposedly employ the
same sensor and Zeiss lens found on
Sony's DSC rx100 em to digital camera
which means it's awesome smartphones
with huge camera sensors is nothing to
scoff at at least not out loud I'm
looking at you nokia 1020 with your 41
megapixel shooter but that's already
built into your phone if you have to
schlep around a separate attachment when
you just slept around you're already
awesome camera the sony alpha blog says
that this rumor is almost certain to
come true but judging by the number of
exclamation points that they use on
their site i'd argue that it probably
won't and finally according to The Wall
Street Journal Apple has been testing
iPad screens in recent months that
measure almost 13 inches diagonally and
iphone screens larger than their current
4 inch size
this seems to follow a report from
Reuters last month which said that Apple
was considering the introduction of at
least two bigger iPhones next year one
with a 4.7 inch screen and the other a
5.7 inch or I don't know about you guys
but I think that the iphone screen is
big enough as it is I have a hard time
fitting it into my pocket of course this
would put the phone in direct
competition with that big e galaxy note
2 and even the galaxy s4 is that
something you'd be into I don't think my
pant pockets could handle it what do you
guys think is that while working on an
even bigger iphone and ipad don't forget
to vote and leave a comment and I'll ask
the cnet council what it thinks the
scene that council is composed of five
editors who cast their votes anonymously
their opinions are not an endorsement by
cnet or CBS interactive obviously
because these are rumors folks and the
cnet council's verdict is yes four out
of five editors think that Apple is
working on bigger screens for the iPhone
and the iPad one editor says that just
because they're working on it however
doesn't mean it's going to come out
anytime soon that's our show everybody
please share your rumors at rumor has it
at cnet com or call us at 1 800 750 cnet
and tweet us and tune in next week for
more tech rumors
