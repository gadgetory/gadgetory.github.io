over I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update google is known for its
ambitious projects like Google glass
self-driving cars or finding ways to
prolong life with Calico but its latest
mission isn't so far-fetched as curing
death Google is building a new
generation of robots to replace human
workers in factories google has acquired
seven robotics companies recently to get
a head start on this goal of becoming a
new leader in manufacturing and these
robots are humanoid with arms and faces
and some of them can walk the head of
this robotics project was previously in
charge of Android he called it a
moonshot vision and it could take a
decade to build out so this week we
learned that Amazon is working on flying
drones and Google is building a fleet of
humanoid robots so I guess we won't have
to wait too long for the Machine
uprising against mankind if you're
getting bored with today's smartphones
and you think they're all starting to
look alike well there's a new phone out
that will make you do a double-take with
its double screens the yotaphone is an
Android phone made in Russia it has a
regular LCD screen on the front and
there's an e-ink screen on the back it's
the same screen you see in Erie ders
like the Kindle the point of having an
e-ink screen on the back is that it
helps your battery lasts for days you
don't have to keep turning on the screen
to check the time or see if you missed
any messages it'll all just be displayed
always on that e-ink side for a quick
glance you can put all sorts of things
on that black and white screen when
you're low on battery just save your
directions on a map of course you could
do some reading and you can turn a
selfie into an epic wallpaper for all to
see the yotaphone is on sale now in
Russia Germany Austria and Spain it's
coming to the UK next year but no word
on the u.s. if it takes off it certainly
could bring some fresh concepts to the
smartphone industry chromecast the
streaming media stick from google that
only costs thirty-five dollars now has
added gaming to the list of things
can do owners can play tic-tac-toe all
you need to do is download the game on
an Android or iOS device and the
chromecast will stream it to the
television I know tic-tac-toe isn't
going to wow anyone but it is a start
maybe other developers will build games
that can work on the chromecast the hdmi
stick also streams netflix youtube HBO
Go Hulu Plus and Pandora that's your
tech news update you can find more
details at cnet com / update and be sure
to follow along on Twitter for the
latest from our studios in New York I'm
