brainchild pun intended from chaotic
moon labs the innovative research and
development studio based in Austin Texas
it is quite literally a mind-controlled
skateboard and it turns out the mind is
sometimes hard to control you stepped on
the switch and you broke it so it was
the safety switch was disabled and as
you were as you were thinking as you
were running the board was racing back
along the side board of imagination uses
an emotive headset and it scans your
brain and this is gonna be a little cold
and it might feel slightly strange
that's awful
yeah it's freezing all right it's
essentially just an EEG and we convert
your brainwaves into commands for the
board specifically the reason we call it
the board of imagination is you imagine
where you want to go and so we've mapped
and modeled that over a bunch of
different people and written some
algorithms it kind of normalizes all
that out so it works for almost anyone I
can't believe they can see my thoughts
on there
it's got 36 volts of power and it has a
Samsung Windows 8 tablet you can imagine
going there and imagine how fast you
want to go there and you're going to
take off so if you think about it and it
doesn't go like just keep thinking about
it and then like you go with it have you
ever been thinking you know you're
running you can't just when it pops up
you can't just jump them in the end
otherwise you scrape your DS across the
ground if they pass you have to let it
take you
oh I thought about stopping I hope now I
thought about going mm-hmm use the Force
chaotic mood most recently debuted their
Kinect controlled Board of Awesomeness
at CES 2012 in Las Vegas and they used
that technology to develop a self-guided
shopping cart that can follow shoppers
around stores and even electronically
scan items lab general manager Worley
won't say what they're working on with
the board of imagination technology but
it has amazing implications for the
disabled or motion impaired but if you
implement this in wheelchairs or
something like that is it just gonna be
a matter of training for people it could
be we've actually found a way to use eye
movement and head movement and several
other things with similar systems so we
can probably be implementing several
alternates that people can try out what
works best for them and what's easiest
and the least effort for people in that
situation
with chaotic mood labs in Austin Texas
