appliances and right now we're taking an
up-close look at the nitro brew so what
is the Nitro brooms essentially it's a
kit that is designed to convert any
beverage that you have on hand like a
beer or even cold root coffee into
something that you'd get out of a
nitrous tap something to find it at your
cafe or at your local pub you've got a
kettle here which is where you put your
beverages to be infused with nitrogen
under pressure this crazy contraption
right here is an air compressor what it
does is compress air and pushes it to
this charging block here which has a
little valve on the front which will
push compressed air into the kettle and
it will all pressurize there and you
shake the hell out of it really or just
shake it a whole lot and essentially
you're gonna get this very bubbly and
you know rich and creamy solution filled
with little tiny bubbles
that's what lends it this very creamy
rich head and very very nice and silky
smooth taste that you would say get from
a pint of Guinness or a cream ale at
your local pub the nitro brew costs five
hundred dollars that's a lot of money to
drop in one place it's also really
quirky and hard to use you have to know
how to set this air compressor properly
and you don't always get a tight seal
inside this kettle you have to fiddle
with it to kind of find the sweet spot
you know if you do it wrong you could
spray a whole bunch of your potential
customers or people at home with the
liquid you're trying to pressurize so
that's something that you don't want to
do either I also have to stress that
making each nitro brewed beverage
definitely takes some elbow grease you
have to take this container and really
shake it like a cocktail just to mix all
the nitrogen and depressed air all and
into that liquid to get the desired
effect that you're looking for so maybe
you'll burn a little more calories but
it's definitely a lot of work
