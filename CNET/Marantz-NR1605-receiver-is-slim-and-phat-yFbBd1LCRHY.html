amps have taught us in the last few
years it's at home theatre components no
longer have to be bloody huge hi I'm ty
Pendlebury and while the Moran's in our
16:05 isn't a digital amp its Class A B
for those playing at home it takes the
same lesson to heart this is a compact
7.1 channel receiver which packs in 50
watts per channel and still has room for
seven HDMI inputs which support 4k video
it almost goes without saying that as a
modern receiver it is equipped with both
bluetooth and Wi-Fi with support for
Spotify and Pandora the look is
distinctly Marantz though with these
resin corners and it actually has a much
larger display than the more expensive
and bigger sr5 double on EIN apart from
Dolby Atmos there isn't much the NR
16:05 can't decode as it supports all
other typical standards despite its
features when you're looking at a $700
receiver you'd expect sound quality to
be paramount and this is definitely the
case with the marantz it may not power a
dedicated home cinema room but it will
able erock your typical living room
music and movies alike sound great and
even the Bluetooth receiver is good well
if you want more power oh don't you to
get the sr5 double O 9 but if you favor
compactness and the same features the NR
1605 is a good buy this is ty Pendlebury
