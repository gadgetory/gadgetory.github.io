the Apple buy for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple we actually
have some legitimate iPhone 6 news not
like those made up LeBron to Cleveland
rumors don't expect revamped max anytime
soon and Apple has a job opening we can
all qualify for well almost all of us so
let's get to the show and new videos of
factory-line parts acquired by Sonny
Dickson's are showing us just how
unbreakable and unscratched will the new
sapphire based iPhone 6 front panel is
Dixon is pretty kind with it with his
been test
but then YouTube rockstar marques
Brownlee decides to get real he starts
scratching it with a scratch test with
his keys then takes it up a notch by
trying to scratch it vigorously with a
knife and even stabs it hard there's
still not a single blemish he bends it
even under more extreme conditions but
nada
now these are the only two known
sapphire front panels that have leaked
out sunny Dixon has a solid reputation
of getting these parts in the past and
the clarity of this panel is really
crystal clear it also might confirm one
unknown this is a 4.7 inch panel rumors
had said only the larger 5.5 inch iPhone
6 would get the sapphire display but
this part would suggest otherwise and
something this light really can't be
tested for corner drops or legit shatter
test so we'll continue waiting but the
panel looks impressive more parts this
time a hands-on with a rumored 4.7 inch
rear shell for the iPhone 6 thanks to
moscow-based felled and Volk this is the
first to showcase the cutout for the
Apple logo a slot for the SIM card tray
and two screws near the Lightning port
opening on the bottom and the number one
request everyone is asking for with the
iPhone is better battery life but
according to Chinese media reports we
may be disappointed with a lower than
expected battery capacity that will only
give a slight boost compared to the
iPhone 5s
now that's due to the rumored focus on a
slimmer design with an 1800 milliampere
hours battery for the 4.7 inch phone and
a 2500 milliamp Peters hour battery for
the 5.5 inch one now in comparison
Samsung's Galaxy s5 sports a 2,800
milliampere
battery for their 5.1 inch display so
would you guys rather have a slimmer
iPhone or one that has way more battery
life we know software optimization is
part of it but when all is said and done
Samsung's full advertising assault
calling the iPhone users uh wall huggers
might still be just as accurate when
even the iPhone 6 comes out denied the
freedom to enjoy even the most basic
things like grabbing a drink or sharing
a laugh with your co-workers or sitting
with someone you know Zen or iPhones
coming out soon open its a bitter
battery I can tell you that I'm that
person at the airport all the time but I
don't like hugging walls
I prefer huggy new all right
also Apple seriously needs to step up
their advertising game because they have
been getting a bad apple beatdown by
Sammy over the past two years all right
I know a lot of us are looking to get a
Mac with Intel's next-gen Broadwell
chipset but Chinese site VR zone reports
that production will not start until
later in the year
pushing out Mac's that would use those
chips to mid 2015 it was expected to
ramp up in July in August but that's
just not the case anymore
the report says new MacBook Airs and
13-inch MacBook Pros won't be ready to
ship with Broadwell until February 2015
and the larger 15-inch MacBook Pro and
IMAX won't be shipping until July 2015
at the earliest bottom-line Rodwell
chips and Apple products won't appear
until 2015 and that's been confirmed to
seen it as well all right let's take a
break and check out the app of the week
this one is for all the sports fans out
there and you've got to check out the
120 sports app which is more than just
highlights they present two-minute clips
really made for the internet generation
of the biggest stories and highlights
you can read articles that complement
the videos and see related tweets as
well it's a real clean interface and all
the major sport leagues like the NBA MLB
NHL and more except the NFL are behind
it right now they have live streams in a
casual discussion it's a one-of-a-kind
platform right now and it's definitely
worth checking out for free but you
might not want to watch it if you want
to stay away from stories about the
brazilian waxing and that's the World
Cup game I'm talking about all right iOS
8 gets its third beta release there's
new iCloud drive options and settings to
sort everything and access them through
iOS OS 10 Yosemite Windows machines or
the web there's a toggle to take
advantage of the handoff feature a
revamped weather app with more details
there's a new time indicator before your
recently deleted photos are permanently
removed and t-mobile users can take
advantage of Wi-Fi calling over the data
network right now plus Apple's health
app now has access to the iPhones m7
motion coprocessor so it can track your
steps taken and that data is displayed
as far back as a week for you there's
also a new caffeine section to track how
many Red Bulls you drink a day now this
is the first year I really haven't
installed it on my primary device
because I'm not willing to screw with
some key apps that stop working the past
two years and plenty of people have
complained how it's not ready for
primetime use because maybe it's a beta
on the other hand I've always
partitioned my hard drive to use the
latest OS 10 Developer Preview and Apple
released the third iteration recently
dark mode is officially available as an
option for the OS which is really cool
System Preferences mail and cloud
preferences have received some interface
tweaks and there's an updated QuickTime
icon now a lot of you asked me when the
beta version will be available to the
public
Apple still says summer but it hasn't
dropped just yet and finally are you
looking to work at Apple but you don't
think you have the right skills
well that might change after a recent
job posting from Cupertino was posted
for an eye cup technician and no that is
not for a new
wearable from the bag a this is for a
dedicated job to operate and maintain
the barista coffee machines key
qualifications include prior work with
coffee machines being able to speak
clearly and listen attentively and some
computer skills
I only qualify for one of those all
right guys that's gonna do it for this
week's show we're still working on and
asking me anything show so send us your
emails to the Apple bita cnet.com or
tweet me at Brian Tong and you can be
featured in our Apple biters Q&amp;amp;A where
again you can ask me anything alright
thanks so much for watching and we'll
catch you all next time for another bite
of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
