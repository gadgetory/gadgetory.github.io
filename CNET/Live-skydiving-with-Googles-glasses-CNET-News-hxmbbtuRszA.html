you it's a little bit time-sensitive so
I apologize for interrupting you've seen
some really compelling demos here they
were slick they were robust this is
gonna be nothing like that
this can go wrong at about 500 different
ways so tell me now who wants to see a
demo of glass so the unit I actually
really want to show you I went to a
friend and and he's gonna be here
momentarily
he's actually pretty close by he's just
about a mile overhead right now those
buddies hey we're just down here in
Moscone I got a few thousand people here
I was hoping to to maybe get that unit I
let you down here and I thought maybe
you guys could show us a fun time on the
way down yeah you can hear me down there
I've been listening to your speech
through the Hangout it's pretty cool all
right this thing actually all right I
see the roof of Moscone there so if you
guys can you know be safe but get it
down here in a hurry for us we'd love to
watch that okay yeah you'll have to
stand by we've got our ring suits so
we've got a pretty good range it's kind
of interesting people have watched us
fly and many times before but I don't
think that the world's ever tagged a
long live for arrived I mean where
nobody really knows the outcome of this
jump
we're feeling really common
well we're we're for you what do you
guys think should they go for it about
one minute for ego maybe you got to
entertain the crowd a little now let's
leave you down it looks like a long way
down sideways it's tough yeah yeah so
this is one of the things as we've been
experimenting with glass just the
ability to really share and we've posted
some pictures but as we start to
experiment being able to share what
you're seeing live is really amazing and
you know we're not we don't know what's
gonna happen here I you know these guys
are all really good they're trained and
have great contents but this is all
right doors open doors open all right
happy flight
you know
nice and close in there hey they've got
to get the right place so they can hit
the roof I'm gonna record take a few
pictures to record this for posterity
and they're flying look at that look at
that you can see Moscone right below
there live hangout through Google glass
the four skydivers and at the under
canopy chutes are open
okay where's Nick Nick hey look this is
a hangout on air
so it's a little bit tricky landing on a
building as you might imagine I know if
you ever tried this kind of thing before
but you could you can see all their
perspectives now they're gonna have to
line up one after another to get down to
the roof here it's a little bit of it's
a pretty big roof back choice which is
great for their landing and you can see
there's there's a little yellow arrow
that they're aiming for you know it's
very exciting
hopefully they they land it all right
and they're coming in
first ones coming in all right
so hey folks thank you whoo-hoo okay so
the roof is a little bit big there so it
would take a while to run down the
length of it so you got actually a few
bikers up there for this eventuality we
got them wearing glass too and there's a
little package let's see if we can see
if we can get it here in the hurry all
right here we go first-person view of
glass here the bikers
yeah I come down
and you know there's only one good way
down the side of a building it's pretty
high up there if you haven't been up
there before don't try this at home kids
these are trained professionals all
right no no okay
close call sorry about that so this is
pretty wild I did never seen that
perspective before and I'm really
looking forward to sorry we got a couple
more bikes a little bit of a long way Oh
Jess
don't run anybody over
all right please stay in your seats
folks don't get into the aisles please
keep the aisles fair
here they come up
yeah
