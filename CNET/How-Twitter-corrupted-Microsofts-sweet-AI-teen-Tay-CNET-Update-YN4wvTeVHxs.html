chatbot join Twitter it only ends in
disaster I'm Bridget Carey this is your
CNET update
so in the last seen at updates show I
reported on a new artificially
intelligent creation from Microsoft a
chat bot named Tay she was designed to
speak like a teenager and learn from how
other young adults talk by interacting
online but in a matter of hours Tay went
from a sweet and sassy online teen full
of memes and emoji dreams and was
corrupted into a Hitler supporting
sexbot twitter users trolled her by
sending her racist and misogynistic
comments with foul language and they
also fed her plenty of political
propaganda about presidential candidates
Ted Cruz and Donald Trump so in her
learning process she quickly started
spewing it all back out Microsoft turned
off the chat BOTS and deleted offensive
posts and they're now making adjustments
if only it were that easy to adjust the
rest of humanity online if it took less
than a day for a computer AI to learn
this is how we talk we should not be
leading computers learn from the
internet or what if some day an alien
race observes us by looking at our
online conversations yeah Twitter's
going to be the reason our planet's
blown up so on a lighter note let's talk
about video games Sony announced it will
be making PlayStation games for iOS and
Android app stores and it will use the
characters from existing PlayStation
games but it's only for mobile devices
in Japan and Asia for now it's similar
to Nintendo strategy Nintendo is also
making games for smartphones but so far
it only released a social game called
miitomo in Japan and that will expand to
more countries soon also on the topic of
mobile Apple pay could be expanding to
websites later this year in time for
holiday shopping according to a report
from recode citing anonymous sources
Apple is working on plans to let people
shop on mobile websites by using their
fingerprint to validate a purchase on
the phone right now Apple pay is used
inside of apps but not on the web with
Safari that does it for this tech news
roundup but there's always more to
update your life on CNET comm from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
