the Apple bite for everything good a bad
inside the world of Apple let's get to
it and the whole pod reviews are in and
the reviews are very positive when
talking about the sound quality it's
exactly what Apple said they were going
to do and they delivered it with C nuts
Megan will Orton calling it sound
outstanding across all genres of music
now the home pod also easily outperforms
the echo Google home the Google Max and
Sonos one but like we expected it's
still the dumbest smart speaker like
Siri on the home pod can't even do the
same things as Siri on your iPhone and
you still can't set multiple timers so
that's a deal-breaker for a home chef
like me yeah I know it's still extremely
limited but this might as well be a
product made exclusively for Apple's
ecosystem there is no Bluetooth music
streaming support whatsoever from any
non iPhone nada again overall reviews
are very high on its sound quality just
like we thought it would be but that's
about it
and I'll be dropping my full in-depth
review next week because again I buy my
own stuff now we have also learned that
stereo sound with two home pods will be
officially called full room and it
better be full room if you're dropping
$700 on that you heard now you'll also
be able to select the left channel
speaker from the right and according to
TechCrunch it will be coming soon
even before airplay - and Apple's
promised multi room capabilities all
right an iPhone news recode reports
Apple is considering offering rebates to
customers who previously purchased full
priced iPhone batteries before Apple
revealed it was slowing down older
devices Apple says we are exploring this
and we'll update you accordingly so
we'll wait and see the big a also
dropped the second betas for Mac OS High
Sierra TV OS 11.3 and the second beta as
well for iOS eleven point three this new
iOS beta introduces the battery health
feature
for the first time it tells you the
maximum capacity of your battery and
whether or not it's operating at peak
capacity now if your battery is
operating at full capacity you won't
have the option to turn off the
throttling feature that causes degraded
batteries to run more slowly now Apple
also says the iPhone
iPhone 8 plus an iPhone 10 use a more
advanced hardware in software design and
uses a different performance management
system that will be less noticeable on
these three iPhones and this story is
something that we've got to keep an eye
on the Financial Times is highlighting a
growing issue with some iPhone 10 users
that say they're unable to answer phone
calls with their 10 because the display
won't wake up when it's ringing and they
can't access the accept and the client
buttons it's unclear if it's software or
hardware related but restoring the phone
hasn't made a difference and then a
follow up to Apple's earnings report
from last week research firm Kanellis
estimates Apple watch shipments topped
an all-time high of 18 million units in
2017 Apple never reveals sales numbers
of their own unless they're worth
bragging about
but CEO Tim Cook said Apple watch had
over a 50 percent growth in units and
revenue and that's what happens when you
finally get a product right with great
hardware and software you know I'm all
in on the series 3 and speaking of great
software you don't have to wait for
Apple to release a podcast app of their
own if you're like me and you want to
listen a podcast directly on your Apple
watch series 3 now check this out
it's called outcast for Apple watch
that's a $0.99 standalone app just for
the watch and allows you to directly
download your favorite podcast over
Wi-Fi or LTE to your series 3 Apple
watch and take them with you on the go
I'm using it all the time and we're
gonna break it down for you in a
follow-up video but check it out right
now if this is something you're into and
in iPad news and another follow up from
their earnings last week research firm
IDC says Apple's iPad is still the most
popular tablet and outsold Samsung and
Amazon combined last year that's just
beast Apple sold a total of 40 3.8
million iPads last year while Samsung
shipped 24 point 9 million tablets and
Amazon ship sixteen point seven million
total that up and the iPad bested them
by 2.2 million see being a mathlete is
actually cool and that's a good apple
yeah now we're expecting this new iPad
pro sometime this year with slimmer
bezels and face ID but what about the
Apple pencil we know it's going to get
some new software features but a new
filed apple patent describes an Apple
pencil like device with four sensors and
some
a motion and orientation sensor that's
external to this stylus and could allow
it to draw on any flat surface
translation for my mom the Apple pencil
could be used without a screen oh wow
Brian that's a good yeah sorry ma this
might not even happen yet because it's a
patent but yeah it's cool all right
that's gonna do it for this week you can
email me at the Apple byte @c Netcom or
tweet me at Brian Tong but I probably
won't respond because I'm playing Shadow
of the Colossus ps4 a remake so I'll try
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
y'all next time for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
