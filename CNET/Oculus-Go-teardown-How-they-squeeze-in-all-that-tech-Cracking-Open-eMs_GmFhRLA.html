cracking open where we take apart two
latest technology and show you what's
inside I'm Bill Detweiler and as you can
see I'm wearing something on my head and
I'm here with CNET's Aaron Carson what
do I have here and what is this thing
this is an oculus go what's unique about
the oculus go you know we it's a VR
headset obviously what makes it cool and
why am I gonna take it apart yeah so you
might have run into VR headsets in the
past few years but this one is different
because everything the processor all the
sensors are contained within this all
right so everything like the PlayStation
VR the oculus rift the HTC vive they
have cables right to connect them to
your Playstation or a computer or and so
this one's completely self-contained
kind of like when you have the ones that
you put your phone on like the Samsung
gear VR things like that
but this one you don't need a phone for
right and that's the exciting part okay
you don't need anything else to use this
so that's why we thought it would be
cool to take it apart right it is to see
what's inside this to see the hardware
that oculus put inside and to see how it
how it works
so we'll start I guess there's this
little phone thing here kind of looks
like a masquerade ball mask right you
know for a fancy ball it's kind of
comfortable you know you tested this out
a lot what did you think while I'm
taking this apart as far as the comfort
goes compared to other ones yeah so one
thing that's been really nice over the
years is that VR headsets are getting
more and more comfortable um you see
this nice plush padding this is not how
it used to be okay oh you know once upon
a time you would have just sort of like
a little little rim of foam and that was
the best you could hope for but yes I've
been playing around with this for about
a week or so and it's been a good time
so far I have to say and so we've taken
the we've taken the cushion off and it
looks like inside here what we see is a
bunch
of standard Phillips screws so that's
nice I like when we don't have to have
special screwdrivers to remove them this
is just a triple zero screwdriver so
it's pretty small I mean it comes in a
specialty screwdriver set usually you
may not find it at your average hardware
store but you can find them online
everywhere a part of electronics tools
we're gonna keep removing it's actually
you might be a little easier let's take
off the strap here now what did you
think about the comfort of the head
strap compared to some of the other ones
that you've used it took a little
finesse adjusting it but something that
I do like is you actually have the
option of taking that top head strap
okay off just in case it's too much or
if you're like you're me and you have a
lot of hair okay so you can wear me just
just the sides okay it doesn't work as
well like that does it stay on your head
when you're using it it does okay right
you know you can you can kind of adjust
the straps just by pulling and
tightening on the sides or loosening so
you don't even really have to take it
off to adjust you can just be in the
midst of doing whatever it is you want
to do in VR and make sure that it fits
comfortably that's good that's really
kind of cool and it has a controller
with it there right a wireless
controller and how does that work so
this is basically just a standard
controller you've got a touchpad you've
got a trigger kind of on the butt bottom
and a few buttons um you know not not
too much to write home about
but it is nice to have the option of
having something in your hand you can
use the lanyard to make sure that you
don't accidentally like fling the
controller into a wall or something
which you would be surprised how often
that happens so we've also popped out
these little plastics or Eyring 's again
if you wear them they help the screen
conform to your eyes here and so you
know I can look like Jack Sparrow here
with too much eye makeup on here now
that we have those removed it looks like
I think and we have the screws removed
that we can pop the outer shell away
from this and maybe lift off this back
plastic piece here it's fairly light
what did you think about the weight I'm
surprised how light it is well that's a
really kind
important aspect of this is that some of
the older VR headsets like we were
talking about they were also a heavier
and it just has this way of pulling down
in your face but this is one is a little
easier to manage you're still gonna get
the lines like the red marks on your
face if you've you know had had the the
headset on for you know an hour or two
but it but yeah you definitely don't
have that feeling of like oh this is
just okay so we kind of popped this
loose it there's some plastic snaps that
are in here I want to try and do this
pretty gingerly here move it you know
whenever we're taking things apart we
always try to take things apart not
destroy them and in a way that we can
put them back together and if there is a
problem with this it does look like you
know if the battery what it has a
battery in it right yeah you can charge
it and you're gonna get about two two
and a half hours of charge out of it if
the battery were to start to run down
and not hold a charge or you know
degrade over time not hold a charge it
looks like it wouldn't be too difficult
or out of the realm of possibility to
take this thing apart and put a new
battery in it I'll see if I can turn
this over here so we have the this
little plastic cover here off now see if
I can't we can't get a shot inside there
so we can see my two lenses that cover
the screens you put up to your eye you
can see some of the some of the other
components still seem to be hidden
behind this black plastic housing again
more Phillips screws inside we're gonna
keep keep going oh and you were telling
you something before we started and we
can kind of start to see them inside the
speaker's right so tell me a little bit
about the speakers the speakers are here
on each side here and here tell me a
little bit about those speakers and how
they work
yeah so this is kind of a feature of
this headset that I was particularly
impressed with you have built-in
speakers and the sound kind of comes
through these hollow little straps on
the side and kind of like eyeglasses
like you have a repair of
right hard to go over your ears all
right so you know you do have the option
of using headphones but in the time that
I was using I really didn't feel like I
had to this sound was pretty immersive
and it's coming out right by your ears
anyways so cool there's a lot more
screws in here so you know why I remove
all the little screws tell us what your
favorite experience was what were some
of the ones that really stood out to me
yeah so if there's a ton there's more
than a thousand they say in the oculus
store so there's a lot that's been out
there for the past several years you
know one that I found absolutely
charming
and it's not new but it's called bait
and it's just it's a fishing game okay
it gives you all these really serene
little lakes one is kind of like a nice
tropical island the other one is sort of
just like interesting swamp and you can
just kind of sit there with your VR
headset on and and fish like cats the
line and all that and it's just like it
was weirdly soothing and then there's a
you know there's another free app that I
was kind of checking out called pet lab
okay which it it almost feels like a
little bit of a riff on the Harry Potter
world where you're in some kind of
magical universe and you can create
these little alien fuzzballs than aliens
there's they're just little monsters
that are that are very cute the thing
that we do find a lot is that a lot of
these games and apps are cool and
they're fun but don't necessarily have
like a long shelf life you might feel
like an allergy yeah you might not play
it like a third time or a fourth time
okay all right once we go inside here
there are a lot of little screws that we
can remove and we have to say if you
went on the online
there was acts of Palmer Luckey actually
went out and posted a teardown of this a
few weeks ago when it first came out
however it didn't actually show how they
took it apart they just showed it all in
pieces which is pretty cool in and of
itself but so we wanted to do this to
show everybody how we can take it apart
so I've removed all of the screws that I
can see inside here except for the
holding the speakers on the side of the
housing here and now I think I can't
pull anything out this way so I think
what we need to do is flip it over here
to the front and we're gonna try and pop
loose some of the plastic tabs maybe
that are right here along the side so
hopefully we can do that and not break
anything up there we go yeah this will
pop loose now that we have the screws
loose we and that's something we always
try to do you know is with these take
these apart in a way that lets us put
them back together and have them
function so sometimes that means and
I've never taken this apart before and
so that means kind of learning as we go
and being gentle as we can and not sort
of forcing things talked a little bit
about the simulator sickness because I
know you've done a lot of you've written
a lot about that
what do you simulator sickness how does
it affect people I mean it's kind of
like you know if you've been to a 3d
movie what happens but what does it
really do here sure so you know it's
basically this idea that your brain and
your body are kind of out of sync you
know there's this thing called lag
that's tied to low refresh rates which
is basically like how many images you're
we're seeing in the you know seconds and
it's it's really disconcerting if for
example you turn your head and the world
you're looking at doesn't come with you
and so so your brain interprets that's
odd disconnect as you have been poisoned
right that's what you were telling me
once it was it's actually a response to
you being poisoned ooh
and and just that right at just the
right moment we were able to pop loose
the front cover here which looks like it
actually holds this is pretty
interesting the heat sink so remember
you were talking about the phones
getting really hot it looks like the
heat sink for this is actually because
you can see these little little tube
here the heat sink and you can see a
little the thermal you know thermal not
paste these days but thermal pads here
that touch against the processors we'll
look at some of these chips a little bit
later but we can actually see that
here to help prevent that from getting
hot right like you're accountable
alright so inside here we can see the
main circuit board here we can also see
some of these little foldable flexible
cables that run from the circuit board
back probably to the LCD displays that
are behind that so we're gonna keep
going I'm gonna go ahead and try to
remove the screws that hold the circuit
board onto this plastic brain here and
see if we can't get that out there are a
lot of screws in here there are a lot of
cables and connectors attached to the
circuit board so I'm gonna go ahead and
disconnect all of those very gently
these foldable flexible or folding
flexible cables are really sort of thin
we don't want to damage those we can see
cables here for the speakers I don't
want to damage those I don't know if
they will come out I think we have a
connector here maybe for the battery Oh
actually this is for the battery there
actually and we can remove oh there we
go yeah great so these are little metal
covers that are covering up some of the
other connectors here we're gonna put
those to side here we have a large
battery cell I believe so let's see if
this we can pull this out so you can see
if I can separate it here it's probably
a little bit of adhesive in here usually
they are and it's got a little adhesive
but can be stubborn yeah just a little
bit not too bad there we go so you can
see the adhesive right here here we have
this is a lithium ion battery cell and I
think it is a what is this it's a pretty
good sized cell to 2600 milliamp hour
nine point three six watt hour battery
so it's pretty good size matter much
bigger than a smart phone much bigger
than you would find in a you know we
usually in a portable device maybe more
so like a laptop or something like that
with that out of there and that comes
out of the back here we're gonna go
ahead and disconnect this cable here
these this is an antenna cable it goes
behind there I'll go ahead and pop this
loose from the system board again being
very careful here not to break it but
still let other people kind of see there
are these little caches there we go now
we have the antenna cable loose for the
wireless system and the wireless antenna
here and then we have another antenna
cable there alright so the only thing
holding us in or I think the connector
cable on the top which I believe is a
little IR it looks like there's a little
IR sensor here that detects when it's
actually attached to to your head or on
your head which is handy and so we're
gonna disconnect that being very gentle
here again using a pair of little ESD
safe electrostatic discharge safe
tweezers we've got that done there and
now the only thing that we have
connecting us are the speaker cables and
again we're gonna try and be really
careful there we go I got one connector
pulled out really careful here pull that
out alright boom and we have it so we
have the circuit board for the oculus Go
VR and then here we have attached this
plastic inner frame right here we also
have the LCD the screens would be behind
here we'll see if we can't get those out
in a minute and then the lenses and the
other plastic here so it's very
componentized so I like that the
speakers obviously we talked about are
here and here and they go through these
hollow tubes kind of show this to the
camera here there are these holes and
that we talked about that a little bit
earlier we'll see if we can't remove
those too but for now I want to spend
some time on the circuit board
and sort of look at some of the the
chips that are actually on the circuit
board here I think let's see if we can
remove them I don't know how many of
these shields were going to be able to
remove we're gonna try it if they're not
soldered in place that's always
frustrating when they're soldered in
place and it makes it you know almost
them it makes it difficult to remove
them if not impossible without damaging
the component
there's still a little bit of metal
shielding but we can see the a couple of
the main chips the oculus this is a it
comes in two versions right this is a 64
gig version which is the storage it also
comes in a 32 32 okay
and so there's minimal price difference
I think between the two so if you're
gonna get one just just get the 64 if
you can find it and you can see the
storage chip right here this looks like
it's an SK Hynix chip for the 64 gig
storage chip you can also see the
processor down here now this processor
it's actually a Snapdragon 820 one
processor so that was the same processor
that was using the first Google pixel
phone so it's kind of interesting to the
trivia they're really interesting though
to see everything that's on the board
here and now this does have both Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth it does not have good okay
no Bluetooth okay so it is Wi-Fi no
Bluetooth there so let's see if we can't
get a few more components out of this so
so tell me a little bit about the future
of VR I mean where do we think we're
gonna be in one year what do we think
we're gonna be in five years is it gonna
be one of the sort of the dominant forms
of gaming of entertainment it is just
still so hard to say sometimes you know
like we were talking a little bit
adoption can be tricky you know this is
something that perhaps is really
appealing for folks who are you know
will get here a little more technical
but you know it's kind of hard to get a
grasp on how far we are from say like
every household having a virtual reality
headset and I think part of that is you
know we still really need to find that
just dynamite use case for why you
absolutely have to have virtual reality
alright so it still needs a killer app
it does alright so with we removed a
couple or more few more screws and we
can now lift out what is the display
assembly and the lenses here for the the
displays I don't see a good way now this
is something we find inside these
devices - I don't see a good way
to actually remove the displays from
this assembly it appears that it could
be that there is a way to get these
apart it could be physical connections
I'll do okay I'll try here so yeah we
can lift the we can separate that and we
do see our display here this would be
the LCD screen and as opposed to two
small screens one large screen here and
there are these small tabs on either
side right here and they're adhesive
they're basically tabs attached to an
adhesive that runs probably the
perimeter of this or around certain
parts of this I could pull these out and
I think the screen would come right out
the or the LCD would come right out and
have no problems problem is I'm not sure
I could buy new adhesive that would
match the correctly to put it back in I
could I get some other adhesive put it
back in sure I could do that but I'm
gonna leave it in there for now there's
nothing really to see on the other side
of this except for the LCD and I want to
put this back together again
so we're gonna leave this intact and
what we're gonna do is we're gonna turn
our attention running out of space here
we're gonna turn our attention back to
the frame here and I'm gonna remove the
two speakers so that we can see how they
how they transmit the sound through
these little hollow tube and then we'll
be almost up we can also see attach to
this these are the Wi-Fi antennas here
on either side so there's one here and
there's one here and these are the
speakers so so I've removed the screws
it looks like these little plastic
pieces connect on here we're gonna see
if I can pop it loose up breaking it and
there we go we can pop that loose right
like that and so you can kind of see the
hollow this hollow tube here and then we
can see our little speakers right like
this right here umm well I think that
about does it
I mean there's not much else for us to
really take apart on the device I think
it's really cool to see how they've
managed to put everything into the
headset I mean they're basically what
they've done is as opposed to taking
your cell phone and sticking it on the
front
of your oven just a set of goggles a
plastic head said they've taken those
same components and they built them into
the goggles and done it at a really
affordable price point so that does it
