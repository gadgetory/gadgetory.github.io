you could reduce the time it takes to
charge your smartphone simply by
enabling airplane mode this will turn
off all the radios in your device and
should speed up charging times but what
kind of improvements are we talking
about I am Dan Graziano and in today's
how-to we're going to see just how much
time you can save by charging your phone
in airplane mode charging times will
vary based on the size your battery the
charger you're using and even the cable
for this test I will be using my Nexus 5
smartphone which has been drained to 1%
battery and this charger that outputs 2
amps at 5 volts to keep things
consistent I will be using the same
exact phone the same charger and the
cable for both tests so let's get
started
well there you have it as you saw
enabling airplane mode resulted in a
charging time that was four minutes
faster than when you charge your phone
normally but the question remains is it
worth it in my opinion no it's not
when airplane mode is enabled you can't
use the internet or receive calls or
text messages essentially you are
sending your phone back to the Stone Age
I did find an earlier test though one in
which they use a less powerful charger
and only charge the phone to 50% that
airplane mode gave me a charging time
that was 12 minutes faster so the debate
continues as I mentioned charging times
will vary based on the size your battery
its health the charger you use and even
the cable for more tips and tricks like
this be sure to visit how to adapt

Twitter with any questions or comments
