and right now I'm at CES 2014 in Las
Vegas with a series of power chargers
from vente the first thing we're going
to start with is the dashboard of hard
to 240 this is a car charger that has to
2.4 million after our outputs so you can
charge two devices at the same time
the second one is the power dash r900
this has a 9000 milliampere battery
inside and it retains his charge so it's
a car charger and a backup battery
charger as well so you could juice up
your mobile device when you're in a
pinch it also has an on/off switch so it
doesn't perpetually keep charging your
phone next up we have the power cells
6000 plug it's a wall charger as well as
a backup battery you can see it has
prong-set flip out and it has two
outputs here one has a 1 amp and the
other has a 2.1 amp output lastly we
have the utility charger this is a 211
car charger and wall charger as you can
see here net folds out and plugs and
measly when you're on the go it doesn't
retain a charge but it does include 2 1
amp output now if you're interested
these chargers are available online now
and they range from a price from about
$35 to about eighty dollars again I'm
Lynn from FEMA and you've been checking
out power chargers from fences</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
