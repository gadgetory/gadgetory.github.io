beginning many many years ago 20 years
ago the first warcraft game came out
orcs and humans and it was all and that
was really the story of the first
contact between the orcs which were
these giant massive creatures and that
left their homeworld because it was
dying and they had to find a new place
to live and they invaded this world of
Azeroth which is where our film takes
place and it's really about the conflict
of those two of those two cultures sort
of finding themselves in the same place
hey I mean I've played these games for a
long time so I thought if there was any
way that in places where hopefully it
doesn't pull the audience out I could I
could reference sort of reference those
things I thought it would be a fun thing
to do so whether it's sort of Sergio
Leone shots during some of the jewels
sort of one-on-one jewels in there in
the film or the oh yeah there's they're
sort of more the RTS sort of isometric
view camera yeah we try to put them in
there
yes there was absolutely something I
wanted to show but even I knew that it
wasn't appropriate because of the
specific time frame in the Warcraft
story that we were looking at but there
are these creatures called Turin which
you may know about which are basically
mine at all
they're just giant all men and women
bull men and bull women I would have
loved to have put those characters into
the film but you know I think if we get
the chance to make one or two more I
know how I can sneak them into a sequel
they'd be a lot of fun to bring a movie
well not to get too spoilery but at the
end of our movie we have you know we
still have a few characters we can we
lose a few characters along the way
but we still have a few characters that
we bring through with us but then
there's also kind of an upcoming
generation and I would certainly want to
have a an amount of focus on those on
those youngsters as they get older what
I certainly thinking on a genre level
yeah I mean you just have to look at how
incredibly successful comic book movies
have become and and the fact that Star
Wars is having this amazing resurgence
as they're kind of bringing in all of
these mutant all this new blood to her
to work on their movies and I think the
transition of games into movies is
something that's had kind of a rough a
rough a rough history but but maybe you
know maybe we're starting to get there
with with hopefully films like Warcraft
I don't know assassin's creed's coming
out later on as well
I think in the past it has been a tricky
thing to do I think it's become much
easier now because they're able to do it
within the environments that you're
shooting in so I think you know Planet
of the Apes was one of the ones that
first kind of cracked that technology
and fortunately we were able to build on
top of that so we were actually
physically building all of these
beautiful beautiful film sets so that we
had all of this stuff in camera and then
we would have Toby in his sofa pajamas
with his balls on and his funny helmet
we would have him in all of the other
Orca characters in those live-action
environments so we would be moving the
camera and capturing the live-action
elements in the background and then
knowing that we were going to be able to
replace him with our all characters
after the fact
I mean it's been fantastic I mean I
think you know it's weird for me because
I I'm you know I'm so UK and u.s.
centric as far as the movies I see and
where I see them and with this film
we've been opening it we opened up in
France first and then in the Philippines
in Belgium and I think Russia is now
open
Indonesia and it's kind of slowly sort
of patchwork moving its way across the
world so every day new countries are
getting it and I'm getting a southern
barrage of different languages as people
say that they love the film but there
are Warcraft fans everywhere I think
that's one of the things that I've
learned from this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
