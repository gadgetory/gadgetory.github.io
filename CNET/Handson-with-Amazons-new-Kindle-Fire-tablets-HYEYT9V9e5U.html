com and i'm here at amazon's offices in
seattle with their new tablets amazon
has introduced three new tablet ease are
all third generation kindle fire tablets
for starters you have the now
entry-level kindle fire HD that is a
hundred and thirty nine dollars it is
basically the same model as last year
with a new design but same processor and
same screen now there are two new kindle
fire HD X's a seven inch model and an
8.9 inch model that HDX refers to the
display they're both higher resolution
displays on the 7-inch and say 1920 x
1200 display and on the step-up 8.9 it
is 2560 by 1600 and they both have high
ppi counts on the 7-inch 323 and on the
8.9 it's 339 ppi some other key features
to talk about on the HDX models these
are the first models to have the new
Snapdragon 800 processor that's a
quad-core processor runs at 2.2
gigahertz us a very fast processor the
8.9 inch model is only 13 point 2 ounces
so it's a thinner tablet that model has
a rear facing camera as well as a front
facing camera all the new tablets run
the new fire OS 3.0 that's based on
Android jelly bean but it's obviously a
highly customized OS amazon is also
highlighting its new Mayday feature it's
really a unique feature allows you to
tap on the Mayday button and be
connected with a customer service
representative if you have a good Wi-Fi
connection it'll be a video connection
and that person will be able to help you
with your device actually walk you
through some of the features and allow
you to set up certain things you might
not be able to set up another new
feature is prime instant video downloads
if you are a prime member you will now
be able to download certain episodes you
can take them on a plane while you're on
the go you don't have to stream
everything now there is a
ray for music as you're playing a song
you will see lyrics scroll across the
right side of the screen as you're
playing that song now in case you're
wondering how fast that Snapdragon 800
processor is Amazon is saying that it's
3x the CPU performance and 4x the
graphics performance so obviously you
can play some graphically intensive
games on this tablet without a problem a
lot smoother experience overall very
responsive so a big upgrade in terms of
responsiveness and from a UI standpoint
amazon with its earlier OS had a
carousel view that was the main view but
now there is a gridview a lot of people
have been asking for that grid view from
the front anyway the devices kind of
look like last year's models however
when you turn around you notice that
they do have beveled edges the 8.9 is a
lot thinner and there are hard buttons
on the back you have von control on the
back of the device and a power button
these do seem to be well thought out and
well placed i'm david carr nguoi and
those are the new kindle fire tablets
from amazon thanks for watching
