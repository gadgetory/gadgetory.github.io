Mobile World Congress in Barcelona
taking a look at an ice caning security
system so this system is called I prints
by a company called I verify and how it
works is your phone will use its
front-facing camera to take a scan of
the veins in the corner of your eye
it needs a two megapixel front-facing
camera that's the minimum resolution to
get a good enough picture of your eye
once it's got that picture it then saves
it so that if an imposter tries to pinch
your phone and take a look at your
precious documents they won't be able to
get access to them because their eyes
don't match if your phone doesn't have a
good enough front-facing camera then
help is at hand because the app can also
use a rear facing camera and gives you
audio instructions telling you to look
up and to the left or up and to the
right
the technology is quite clever it seems
a little bit more hard to fool in
something like Google's face unlock
which you can Fox just by using a
picture of someone's face this is still
in development though eyeverify is going
to be trying it to companies like app
developers or phone manufacturers to
implement in their software or hardware
so hopefully we'll see it cropping up
somewhere soon on the west or a foresee
net and this is eyeverify eye prints</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
