soccer ball-sized robots that fly freely
in space wondering why they look
familiar one of the inspirations for
this was the the lightsaber trainer
droid from Star Wars remember luke
skywalker and the Millennium Falcon
trained with it spheres which stands for
synchronized position hold engage
reorient experimental satellites are a
type of nanosatellite basically a
miniature satellite powering these
extraterrestrial robots is a device well
known to Earthlings a smartphone the
google nexus s we needed to have cameras
gyroscopes it'd be nice if it had a
screen we wanted Wi-Fi capability which
the sphere didn't actually have and as
we laid up all of these requirements we
realized very quickly that the
smartphone might be a good way to go why
build all that technology from scratch
when you can buy it at a relatively
cheaper price off the shelf with budgets
being constantly under pressure to do
more with less we can build launch fly
test and then do it again actually you
know months later using small spacecraft
and that helps us to advance technology
we hope a lot more quickly spheres are
controlled remotely from space or ground
control three are already in use on the
International Space Station when the
computer decides to open one of these
thrusters than co2 gas is expelled and
it's the combination of those different
thrusters that allows it to move around
on station NASA Ames researchers have
embedded smartphones in another
nanosatellite about the size of a tissue
box phonesat we've actually removed the
batteries you can't put your simple
rechargeable lithium-ion battery up in
space and expect it to last for a long
time so we've replaced that with an
nickel-cadmium batteries and a big power
pack that can last a long time these
nano satellites are modular so NASA can
launch them in groups of 38 or one day
even hundreds if one of them breaks you
just add a new one you still have the
functionality of the whole the whole
system phone sets inaugural launch is
set for late April nASA says it wants to
prove the technology's capabilities it's
going to do it's basic Sputnik moma
where it's going to go beep beep you
know tell us it I'm here I'm Allah give
us what we call housekeeping data says
I'm this hot on this cold I'm pointed
this way here's the magnetic field these
nano satellites have great potential for
moon exploration or to test technologies
for spaceflight they may also eliminate
the need for flight crew to perform
risky spacewalks to be used to go
outside of a vehicle like space station
and to fly around it to do inspections
looking for damage or other things that
the ground controllers just can't see
with from the ground the stuff of sci fi
minus the lightsaber training in
Mountain View California I'm Sumi das
