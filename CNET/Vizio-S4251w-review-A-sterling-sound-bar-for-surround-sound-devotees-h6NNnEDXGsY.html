we're gonna take a look at the Vizio s
42:51 W this is Vizio 's 5.1 sound bar
system which includes a sound bar a
wireless subwoofer and two rear channel
speakers for a straight price of around
three hundred and thirty dollars the
rear speakers are really what separates
the Vizio from every other sound bar on
the market the design is actually really
smart the speakers connect to the
wireless subwoofer which you can place
in the back of your living room so you
don't have to run wires from the front
to the back of your living room that
means you have a lot less clutter and
you still get to enjoy the benefits of
true rear speakers the sound bar itself
has a really nice understated design
it's pretty much all speaker grille from
the front except for a small row of LED
lights that give you some visual
feedback so you know how loud the volume
is set it's not a particularly thin
sound bar at 3.15 inches but it gives
the system a substantial feel that's
missing from a lot of budget sound bars
the only issue with Vizio s design is
that it might block your TV's remote
sensor if you place it in front of your
TV that means you'll be angling your
TV's remote over the sound bar every
time you need to change your TV's inputs
now it won't be a problem on every TV
but it was an issue on the TV in CNET's
lab and the Vizio doesn't have a remote
signal pass-through feature like some
competing sound bars such as the Sony
HTC T 260 the remote that controls the
vizio is pretty cool it has a great
minimalist design plus there's a
built-in display so you don't have to
squint across the room to look at the
sound bars menus it's a neat design and
it's miles better than the remotes that
come with other sound bars inputs on the
back of basic there's optical coaxial
mini Jack and analog and that's going to
be plenty of inputs if you connect all
your devices directly to the TV they
connect your TV's audio output to the
sound bar which is what the manual
suggests the vizio also has built-in
bluetooth which is pretty much a
must-have feature for sound bars this
year bluetooth is the easiest way to
wirelessly stream music from the
vast majority of smartphones and tablets
and it works with any app so you can
load up Pandora on your phone and stream
it right to your sound bar for sound
quality the Vizio is able to deliver a
home theater experience that other
budget sound bars just aren't capable of
the rear channels really make a huge
difference especially on movies coming
closer to the sound of an AV receiver in
5.1 channel speaker system than any
other sound bar we've tested overall it
sounded better than the competing Sony
HTC t2 60 and it was neck-and-neck with
the much larger sharp htsb 60 it's the
most convincing home theater sound we've
heard from a soundbar at this price the
one catch is that in most setups you're
not going to quite get the full effect
of that surround sound that's because a
majority of TVs downconvert incoming
audio signals to stereo so if you use
your TV to switch between devices the
Vizio won't get a true Dolby Digital or
DTS signal now the Vizio still creates a
fake surround mix from any stereo signal
and in most cases it sounds pretty good
but if you're a stickler for a true
surround mix you may feel a little let
down by the Vizio but overall that's a
minor flaw and what's an overall
excellent sound bar system it's not
gonna work in every living room
environment but if you really want to
get that true surround sound experience
from a sound bar the Vizio s 42 51 W is
an excellent performer with the solid
feature set and it's hard to complain
with a $330 price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
