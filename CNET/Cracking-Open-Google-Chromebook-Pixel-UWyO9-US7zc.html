HP the Google design pixel has both
high-end hardware and a high-end price
tag but is it built like a premium
laptop or a low-end netbook let's find
out I'm Bill Detweiler and this is
cracking open with pricing that starts
at twelve hundred and ninety nine
dollars us the pixel costs five times
more than the top-selling $249 Samsung
Chromebook why the huge difference
Hardware the base model pixel has a 1.8
gigahertz dual core Intel Core i5
processor intel HD 4000 graphics four
gigs of ddr3 RAM 32 gigs of local
storage and a touch sensitive screen
that has more pixels per inch than even
the MacBook Pros Retina display and not
only is the pixel the best-equipped
Chromebook on the market its thin
profile and sleek design make it the
best-looking but that's all on the
outside I'm more interested on how this
machine is put together so let's get
cracking luckily opening the pixel isn't
too difficult first remove the four
rubber feet that are held to the bottom
cover with a little adhesive then remove
the screws underneath next we need to
pop loose two metal Clips one on each
side that hold the cover in place and
finally lift it off the pixels internal
hardware layout isn't quite as clean as
the MacBook Airs but it's not bad the 59
watt hour battery is located at the
front of the case with speakers on
either side the motherboard and cooling
assembly run along the back and most
components like the RAM and SSD are
soldered to the motherboard our work
inside the pixel begins by disconnecting
and removing the battery the speakers
come out next followed by an empty
circuit board that serves as a
placeholder for an LTE card which is
available on the more expensive pixel
the fan and cooling assembly are next to
go and after the task
a bunch of cables and removing a few
screws the motherboard also comes out if
you wanted to separate the lid and
screen from the case you could by
removing these screws likewise the SD
card reader and SIM card slot if your
machine has one this machine doesn't can
easily be removed as there isn't really
anything special for me to show you by
removing these parts I'm going to leave
them in place overall the Chromebook
pixel is built just as well as other
high-end ultra-thin machines and
cracking it open wasn't difficult but
like many laptops these days there
really isn't much you can do once you
get inside nearly everything is soldered
to the motherboard and there really
isn't anything to upgrade as for whether
the pixel is right for you that's a
tough question it certainly has the
hardware of a high-end laptop but other
than the touchscreen I'm not really sure
how much that hardware improves the user
experience if the point of Google's
Chrome OS is to have the cloud be your
hard drive and handle the heavy lifting
for most tasks do you really need $1,300
worth of hardware I think the jury is
still out on that now for more
information on the pixel including
real-world tests check out Seth
Rosenblatt's
