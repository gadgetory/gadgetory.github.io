Carey and this is your cnet update sony
announced that its playstation 4 game
console will be arriving november 15th
in the u.s. followed by a european
launch date of november 29th the news
comes out of the gamescom gaming
conference in Germany where it was also
announced that the PlayStation Vita now
is fifty dollars cheaper with a price
tag of two hundred dollars and Microsoft
announced 23 games will be available
when the xbox one launches in November
including battlefield 4 and call of duty
ghosts keep in mind you won't be able to
play xbox 360 discs in the Xbox one so
if you're planning on getting the new
system you might want to take advantage
of an Amazon promotion going on right
now if you trade in certain xbox 360
games to Amazon the company will give
you fifty dollars for the used game as
long as you put that money to buying the
same game on the xbox one for ten
dollars more but you can only do it once
so better be an old game that you really
like to play after three years we have a
new tivo and it's called the romeo yeah
they gave it a tragic name and spelling
but it does have some cool advanced
features like being able to send
recorded shows two other rooms without
buying an additional DVR the romeo boxes
let you tap into many online video
options like Netflix and YouTube without
switching the TV input it also works
like a chromecast the cast button on
netflix and youtube apps will play a
video from your smartphone to the TV and
of course there are many tuners tons of
storage for recording shows and faster
processors for navigating and launching
the apps there are three models it
starts at two hundred dollars but with
tivo you still need to sign up for the
service it's fifteen dollars a month or
five hundred dollars for life but you
can read the full review at cnet com
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is changing its mind and
announced it will still make color nook
tablets the strategy reversal was just
announced by the president of barnes &amp;amp;
noble and he said a new nook will be
coming out in time for the holidays I
got a few app updates for you to check
out youtube is changing the look of its
app and it added
picture-in-picture option so you can
shrink a video to be smaller in the
lower right corner while you browse for
other videos to watch you can also
browse and play video playlists which is
handy if you like to use YouTube for
listening to music google bought the
traffic app waze and now the two are
combining information if you use Google
Maps for Mobile on Android and iOS
you'll see real-time traffic incident
reports from ways users and the Waze app
has been updated to include Google
search and the ways map editor includes
Google Street View and satellite imagery
that your tech news update agreed upon
