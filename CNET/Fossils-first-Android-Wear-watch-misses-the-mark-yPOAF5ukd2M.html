fossils first android wear watch it can
display notifications from your iphone
or android device and also provide
personalized google now cards with
information on your commute the weather
your favorite sports team and more the
watch is very big the stainless steel
case measures 46 millimeters but it
looks and feels great overall the
founder is quite beautiful well at least
until you look at the screen the despite
isn't as crisp as I would like and
images and text look pixelated it's also
not a complete circle at the bottom sits
this unsightly black bar just like on
the Moto 360 this is where the ambient
light sensor is located the sensor can
automatically set display brightness and
while it's convenient I much rather have
a fully circular display unlike most
Android wear watches the founder is
powered by an Intel processor which is
paired with 1 gigabyte of RAM but
performance wasn't always smooth I
definitely noticed some lag when swiping
through different screens other specs
include 4 gigabytes of storage for music
and apps Wi-Fi to function when your
phone is left behind and both an
accelerometer and gyroscope for tracking
steps in distance but there's no optical
heart rate sensor or GPS this is a
fashion watch not a sport one what
really disappointed me was battery life
the founder lasted only 24 hours which
is worse than both the Moto 360 and the
Huawei watch also to charge it you have
to use this big and clunky wireless
charging pad if I didn't know any better
I would have thrown it out with the Box
aside from a handful of custom watch
faces none of which are very memorable
fossile didn't include any special apps
or features to help the watch stand out
it's just running plain old Android wear
the fossil queue is available now for
$275 with a leather strap or $295 with
the metal band it's a bit cheaper than
some of the competition but I can't
recommend it
iPhone owners are better off with an
Apple watch and Android users should
check out the Samsung gear s2 Huawei
watch or the Moto 360 for more
