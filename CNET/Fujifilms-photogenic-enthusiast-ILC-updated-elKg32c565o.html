predecessor the fujifilm xe2 delivers
pretty excellent photo quality the
camera incorporates the company's aps-c
sized x-trans CMOS to sensor which uses
a non-standard color filter array layout
so that it can drop the softening
anti-aliasing filter and combined with
really good jpeg processing it delivers
excellent photos as high as ISO 3200 and
really usable ones through iso 6400 plus
if you shoot black and white you can go
throughout the range up to 25600 the
camera has great dynamic range in good
color too though on its defaults it
compresses shadow areas in a way the XE
one doesn't the flip side however is
relatively poor video quality with a lot
of edge artifacts and more a but the
anti-aliasing filter usually deals with
the camera has a really nice design with
a great electronic viewfinder updated
from the XE one and photographer
friendly physical controls while I wish
the LCD could tilt articulate and it
still really isn't visible in direct
sunlight the VF is probably a solid
trade off the camera has more analog
field and similarly priced models with a
manual shutter speed dial exposure
compensation dial in a kit lens that has
a manual aperture ring as physical
controls for all frequently needed
settings plus two programmable function
buttons and a threaded remote socket in
the shutter the surprisingly good on
camera flash can be tilted back to
bounce or to reduce intensity the grips
a lot shallower than I like but it's not
bad and the thumb rest provides
sufficient leverage for single-handed
shooting the one design drawback for
tripod users is the location of the
socket it's right next to the battery
and card compartment its feature set is
pretty unremarkable though there's
almost everything here that most serious
photographers might want it just like
spells like GPS expansive bracketing
controls time lapse and so on as a
caveat I'm not a big fan of split image
viewfinders so i can't really appreciate
the digital version that fujifilm is
incorporated here and the one
significant new feature Wi-Fi has pretty
middling features
it has connectivity problems especially
with iOS devices its performance is
better than before but still lags its
competitors for single shot auto focus
though it's more than acceptable if
you're looking for great photo quality
with a moderately analog like shooting
experience the xc2 is it it's just not
the most well-rounded version of its
cohort I'm Lori drunen and this is the
fujifilm XE to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
