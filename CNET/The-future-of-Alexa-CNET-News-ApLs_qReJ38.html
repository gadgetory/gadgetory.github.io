play music and it started to play music
that wow moment came actually very early
in in our development the ability to see
what the interaction would feel like to
be able to ask for something with voice
in a hands-free way and have have the
result taken without you having to touch
a screen was an amazing moment actually
voice computing is taking over and Alexa
is a big reason why I got a rare
opportunity to visit Amazon's
headquarters in Seattle to talk to some
of the execs figuring out how to make
Amazon's voices system smarter more
conversational and ultimately more like
a person we've really done more in the
personality space based off of customer
demands so for customers who really lean
into this kind of interaction we wanted
to make sure that we were giving them a
delightful response we want to bring the
same simplicity we afford in control
today to things like discovering what
products work with Alexa purchasing
those products setting up those products
and then using those products so I think
you'll see us work hard on simplicity
but I think about that voice controlled
environment being being prevalent
everywhere and available to everyone so
when you go to your hotel room you'll
use voice to control everything that's
going on in your hotel room and
hopefully it'll be personalized and know
you similarly in the workplace in public
places and in restaurants in cars voice
will become the predominant way that we
interface with a lot of technology it
won't replace screens it won't you know
it won't replace a lot of things you do
analog today but it will certainly
complement them and I think be present
everywhere in terms of the smart home
Alexa will sort of become fabric in the
home I think that the other side of that
equation is extending control than many
more products I don't think you have to
go ten years in the future to see the
voice controlled self-driving cars you
know everything else Amazon may have big
plans for Alexa but those come with big
challenges to the echoes microphones
which are always listening for the wake
word Alexa have made some people worried
about privacy Plus Amazon faces
increased competition from the Google
home app
and a smart speaker planned from Samsung
so it's still new it's still ambiguous
it's still exciting there are still
myriad challenges that on the surface
you know we don't know how to solve yet
I think there's a lot of work left to be
done here I think this is just the
beginning of an entire industry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
