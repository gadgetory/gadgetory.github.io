the show about DIY tech and how to's I'm
dong bell and i'm sharing back in this
week it's all about the smart home
wireless connections that allow us to
control our appliances lights and other
comforts of home from just about
anywhere it offers a lot of convenience
and there's also some pretty cool tech
involved we're gonna start off with a
DIY trick on how to control things
around your home using your smartphone
let's check it out this DIY is all about
taking an otherwise boring piece of
furniture and making it a whole lot
smarter we're making a smart night stand
with built-in power wireless charging
and NFC and that NFC or near field
communication will allow me to tap my
phone to the nightstand and
automatically turn on my philips hue
light bulbs so i chose this night stand
because it's super affordable i think i
paid like 30 bucks for it and it's just
the right size and build for this
project but one thing i did modify was
the table top it had a metal top and i
swapped in a wooden top but the first
thing we want to do is install this
built-in power so i've got this power
strip which is awesome because it's got
your regular plugs but also two USB
ports since the drawer is made of metal
the easiest waited here this thing is
with magnets
and these should set in about 10 minutes
and we should be good to go now we want
to add wireless charging what I've got
here is a nokia wireless charger and the
nexus 5 so what i want to do is mount
this charger right underneath the
surface and because this tabletop is so
thin it's still going to be able to
charge the phone we indicator light
should turn on and then boom our phone
is charging okay now let's get to the
brains of this nightstand we're adding
NFC so I've got this NFC tag and what
we're going to do is adhere it to the
bottom underneath the table top so that
when I tap this tag it turns on my
philips two light bulbs now the Philips
hue app on its own can't do this so I've
downloaded a third-party app called
lampshade dot IO and what that lets me
do is write a tag that completes that
action so a launch lampshade NFC turn on
our light bulbs then I'll hold the tag
to the back of the phone it detects it
hit right to tag and our tag is safe so
this will go right underneath the table
top
okey doke so our smart nightstand is
complete let's put this guy in place and
take it for a spin so we will tap our
NFC tag lights turn on and then set it
over our wireless charger and get this
thing dream stuff and our smart
nightstand is complete now this thing
really works because of these Philips
hue light bulbs they're smart Wi-Fi
connected bulb so when we tap that NFC
tag it pings the Wi-Fi network and tells
them to turn on in that app that we use
we've even got options for random so hit
the random button and you never know
what color you're gonna get these lights
are awesome you can even program those
NFC tags to automatically launch an
alarm clock a music playlist there are
so many customization options there that
sounds like it's a worthwhile investment
in some NFC tags sure is alright we're
going to a quick break but then we're
talking about new tech gadgets that
alert you about what's going on at your
house even when you're not there that's
right I'm gonna show you how to use
sensors around your home to monitor
light motion sound and all that's gonna
communicate directly with your
smartphone that's coming up next
you
welcome back we've been talking about
the connected home and in this next how
to returning your ordinary appliances
into smart appliances with high-tech
sensors that are also affordable you
think of the home of the future and you
think of the fully automated home of the
Jetsons well we're not there yet but we
can make our home a little smarter with
some inexpensive sensors right here I've
got the quirky spotter a fifty-dollar
sensor and a little more expensive over
here are the twine little geeky or two
but both of these are essentially doing
the same thing they're going to measure
light sound vibration and temperature
and communicate that information to your
phone so first up we're going to show
you how to use the quirky spotter to
accomplish one of the most loathsome and
common things in your home the laundry
now the first thing we're going to do is
program our spotter it sounds like it's
complicated but they've made it pretty
easy there's an app we need to install
called the wink app open that thing up
you're going to tell it your Wi-Fi login
and password and then it's a little bit
of magic happens where it communicates
that password information to the spotter
by blinking on the device itself let's
go to a countdown start the countdown
I'm gonna hold the screen over the
spotter there it goes
hey successfully connected that's what
we wanted success alright the next
screen we see here is a screen that
shows off the four different sensors
that are built into the spotter
temperature light sound and motion now
for being all to detecting the dryers
now I'm gonna make use of its motion
detector i'm going to set up a new
trigger i'm going to say that when it
detects that movement is stopped it's
going to send me a notification now hit
done save says give the spotter a double
tap ok put that guy up on the dryer
let's give it a test slow this thing up
some laundry alright everything's
rumbling around drying my towels now
hopefully if everything is working right
it's going to text me when everything's
done
and there I go says that the motion has
stopped my laundry is done Oh towels
life just got a little smarter all right
for something with a little added
flexibility little geek out capability
we've got the twine now twine is more
expensive is $125 instead of fifty
dollars for the spotter but with that
you get a lot of addons you can do in
this case I've i purchased the add-on
moisture sensor and I'm here in the
basement so what I'm going to do is
going to have this program so that it
can detect water in my basement before
the whole thing floods now to set that
up I'm going to go to the twine website
and create a rule set to tell this thing
that whenever it detects water to email
me right away all right so setting up a
rule is pretty basic here we're going to
set up so when it detects moisture in my
basement then I'm gonna have an email me
and here I can make my message I can
customize that I can customize the
subject line message is your basement is
and I can even fill in the automatic
condition of it being wet or dry and
I'll let me know it saved to twine gonna
ask me to turn it over here it goes so
now the information is being transmitted
over to the twine and then we'll get to
test it out
alright all done now let's give a test
now I need to do is dip this down into
the water I can't even see from the
sensor itself here that it is getting a
message it's probably going to turn this
up into an email let's check that out
checking for mail email message from my
twine saying your basement is wet I now
have an automatic sensor looking out for
my basement moisture so there you go
those are two ways to add relatively
inexpensive sensors to your home to get
you a little closer to that smart home
Jetsons future you know what else is
cool about the twine it can tweet what
they would have thought well we've shown
you some innovative and inspiring ways
to integrate technology into your home
but up next we're gonna get really
techie we're going to show you the ins
and outs of what really makes this stuff
tick
hey everyone welcome to the breakdown
i'm eric franklin and this is where we
explain the details behind your
technology now you may have seen the
letters NFC on some of your electronics
devices and maybe you know what that is
and maybe you don't but today I'm gonna
explain it all to you NFC is near field
communication it's a communication
standard for transmitting data to the
compatible devices it starts when device
one creates an electromagnetic field in
order to communicate with device number
two however in order to make that
connection the two devices have to be
very close to each other they have to be
within a few centimeters or very near
the reason behind that is because NFC
uses very short radio waves to make the
connection and by using short radio
waves instead of long radio waves used
by both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi NFC requires
much less power to make a connection so
now you know whether or not you have NFC
but what's it going to do for you what
are the practical applications of the
technology well there are three that you
should know about the first one is
peer-to-peer now this occurs when you
have to power devices both with NFC you
want to share data between them let's
say a photo so I have a nice photo of
tech shop right here I want to get this
phone close to the phone with the photo
make the connection tap the send and now
it's sending now this is using Android
Beam which uses NFC to establish the
initial connection then it switches to
bluetooth in order to make you actual
transfer
and now it's received and there's a
photo that i just sent pretty cool stuff
the second is one-way communication used
by advertisers a lot the NFC tag is
programmed with the data the
manufacturer wants to share without a
really cool thing about that set the NFC
tag doesn't run his own power it simply
waits for an NFC device to get close to
it that device creates an
electromagnetic field which powers the
NFC tag with enough juice to share the
data it's really crazy but really cool
and finally mobile payments for instance
Google Wallet allows you to use your
smartphone instead of your credit card
to make purchases at a store you simply
tap and pay and the appropriate amounts
adduct it from whichever credit card you
have set up right now only a few
retailers are using this technology but
hopefully we'll see more soon that's it
for this week's show thanks so much for
watching if you have any ideas for us or
any feedback you can reach us online i'm
at donald on twitter and i'm at sharing
back hit us up we'll see you next time
