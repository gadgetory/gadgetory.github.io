just want to know some simple audio
editing tricks stick around I my as
actor and today I'm gonna show you how
to edit your podcast I'm gonna assume
you've got a couple of things already an
audio file of your show and the free
audio editing application called
audacity now we've got a fantastic
recording I did earlier today hey
welcome to my exciting brand-new show I
don't have a title for it so we're just
going to continue talking audacity shows
your audio in waveforms when you're
editing you're going to have to listen
to your whole show a number of times so
get comfortable with your recorded voice
trust me
it's not so bad anyhow as you're going
through your show find the areas you
want to snip out things like table hits
or the word um so I'm looking at my
audio file here I'm gonna play back some
of the audio you know a show where I
don't really know there's the dreaded um
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna select
the UM right here
and I'm gonna hit delete I'm gonna go
back a few seconds to hear if it sounds
natural or not between the things I was
saying alighting on a show where I don't
really know what sort of works but let's
talk about it in audio anyway make sure
you save frequently I'm gonna hit save
now repeat this process until you're
satisfied
now you'll export your audio by going to
file then export then give your file a
name now we're gonna need another piece
of software called level ater be
forewarned that this application is no
longer supportive as of 2012 but a quick
web search will bring you to an
archive.org site that still hosts the
application so why am I suggesting if
it's so old because it automatically
will level out your audio file so if you
were off mic or whispering the audio
levels would be brought up to suitable
volumes so the audience can hear you to
use the level ater take that exported
file you made and just drag and drop it
on top of the level ater window level
later we'll make a new file and place it
in the same directory as your source
file you could be done here but let's
get some intro music please do not just
clip out a piece of your favorite song
and use it as your theme without
permission you can get your whole
episode taken down instead I suggest
doing a search for Creative Commons
music or checking out a repository of
Korea
Camas music like at vimeo we've already
downloaded our intro song and clipped it
to a suitable length don't make your
intro music beyond 30 seconds please the
audience wants to hear from you
let's open up audacity again and place
our intro music along with our level
ater output file since we don't want the
music and our show to take up the same
space use the time shift tool that's the
one that's like a double arrow then drag
your show audio near the end of the
music I'd like to have a cool fade-out
of the music while my show starts so
here's how you do that select the
portion of music you want to fade out
then choose effect then fade out you'll
see the waveform changed to match hey
welcome to my exciting brand new show I
don't have a title for it so we're just
going to continue talking listen to your
edit and if you like your work hit
export now you've got an uncompressed
edited version of your show there are a
lot more steps from here before we can
post this amazing show online and we'll
have a follow-up for that soon Amaya's
