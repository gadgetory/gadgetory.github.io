first-time parent to reduce you to a
bundle of nerves but a new smarter baby
monitor could help it's the first baby
monitor that not only monitors the child
in the environment but actually learns
and predicts there are sleep patterns
the 250 dollar sprout wing consists of a
wearable device a charger and a nap
together they do more than simply
broadcast your baby's cries it tracks
heart rate skin temperature motion
sleeping position the device charges
wirelessly when placed in the smart
charger which is also stuffed with
sensors mr.zhou rooms temperature noise

humidity by keeping tabs on both the
baby's room and the baby or babies if
you have multiples sprouting helps
parents abide by a basic tenant never
wake a sleeping baby it can tell you if
it gets too loud in the baby's room so
if you're if you're entertaining you
have people over and you're getting kind

wakes up parents can even monitor
infants remotely using the app so it'll
say they're awake and fussy or weak and
angry or awake and quiet there are no
video feeds but it will get to know your
baby we use the latest machine learning
technologies and as it grows and
develops a baby sleep patterns change
with our model we're able to determine
in advance when we think they're going
to awaken but the longer that it's used
the more accurate it's going to be and
