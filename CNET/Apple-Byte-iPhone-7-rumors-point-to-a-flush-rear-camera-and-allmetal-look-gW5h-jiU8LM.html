everything good and bad inside Apple the
iphone rumors keep on coming with the
latest from mac rumors that claims the
new iphone 7 will look very similar to
the iphone 6 and 6s wow what a surprise
but the rear camera will now be flush
with the rear casing thanks to a thinner
camera module like this render the
report also says Apple will remove the
rear antenna bands on the phone allowing
for a cleaner all-metal look while the
antenna bands on the side and the top
will remain hopefully it doesn't look
like that render now we also talked
about the iphones rumored dual lens
camera last week but sony's CFO recently
added a little fuel to the fire during
their earnings report saying that it's
dual lens camera platform will be
featured in smartphones from major
players in 2016 tony's camera tech is
already used by smartphone makers such
as they need a apple now sony also
believes 2017 will be the year the dual
lens camera platform really takes off
due to the current slowdown in high-end
phone sales which impacts demand and
production digit times reports a large
in technology and japan and china based
camera lens makers have sent dual lens
camera samples for Apple to test for the
potential inclusion in its next iPhone
large n currently supplies apple with
sixty percent of their smartphone
cameras so you might be just happy with
the camera I own right now but want
something else from your phone well
according to Bloomberg the big a is
developing extended range wireless
charging for the iPhone with the hopes
to bring it to market as soon as 2017
the goal is to have a range that goes
beyond just using a charging mat and
they're trying to overcome the loss of
power over longer distances a 2010 apple
patent application revealed a concept
with an iMac as the central hub for
charging devices at a distance of one
meter away using a technique called near
field magnetic resonance another apple
patent application featured aluminum
phone casings that allow radio waves to
pass through them and would help
minimize interference with things like a
phone signal all of this sounds nice but
I'm still just waiting for an iphone
with significantly better battery life
I think you are too alright 9to5 mac
reports Apple is now eyeballing Tuesday
March the 15th for the unveiling of the
ipad air three iPhone 5se and new Apple
watch bands that date is still subject
to change but what probably is it the
rumor design for the ipad air three a
new drawing of the unannounced ipad air
three on engadget points the design that
will fall in line with rumors including
quad speakers like the ipad pro a smart
connector on its side for accessories
like a smart keyboard and an extra hole
below the camera for all of you budding
tablet photographers pretty much only
moms and dads based on what I've seen in
public now the drawing shows the new
iPad will be 0 point 0 5 millimeters
thinner and point 1 millimeters wider
than the previous ipad air and is
rumored to also bring apple pencil
support which i've only used for adult
coloring books recently and no it's not
what you perverts are thinking they
actually look more like this mmm hey
guys see i just need to finish the
periwinkle highlights but still more
depressing chinese website Alibaba is
already producing ipad cases based on
these designs all but confirming that
it's time that i once and for all except
the ipad camera revolution is here to
stay and that's a bad apple alright the
iPhone 5se still looks like the name
Apple will be using it's going to be
part of marches event and I came up with
a few names for last week like I really
do like the iPhone single si but I
figured to ask you the Apple biters on
Twitter what you think the SE in the
iPhone 5se could stand for mu hyman went
with the iphone 5 same edition Nixon
called it superiorly excellent fanboy
alert co bond urbina said shut up and
take everything i own capitalizing just
the s &amp;amp; E so that doesn't count on
dredge kozak gets classy with the
addition josh homme thinks it stands for
scam everyone and Curtis Martin called
it the iphone 5 sexual emoji car
I'm pretty sure that's it all right
that's going to do it for this week you
can email us at the Applewhite at cnet
com or tweet me at brian Tong thanks for
watching we'll catch y'all next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
