and it's time to get loaded if you enjoy
renting dvds in the mail through netflix
the CEO thinks you're a dying breed in
an earnings call netflix CEO Reed
Hastings said boldly that Netflix
doesn't see a future in DVD rentals and
that it expects DVD subscribers to
decline steadily every quarter forever
this of course is coming from a CEO who
not long ago was going to cast off DVD
rentals in a separate company called
quick stir but streaming on netflix
doesn't have nearly as many titles as
the DVD library choices Hastings also
said Netflix is no longer planning a
video game rental service to go along
with its DVD subscription service that's
something that company said it was going
to offer with quick stir back in
September a new bill submitted to
Hawaii's legislature will surely shake
up privacy advocates the House bill aims
to require internet providers to keep
track of every website of resident
visits the measure says internet
destination history information and
subscriber info like names and addresses
must be saved for two years the wording
is broad and does not specify consumer
protections such as if an internet
provider can sell this information or
even if a court order is required before
obtaining the information you may come
across webOS again in the fall
hewlett-packard started the ball rolling
on making the webOS mobile operating
system which it acquired from Palm to be
free and open for any programmer to use
a developer tool was released to make
webOS work across multiple mobile
devices and the fully open webOS will be
available in September 18c end of the
year with a 6.7 billion dollar loss
mostly due to the breakup fee it was
required to pay after giving up on plans
to buy t-mobile the loss was also in
part due to costs associated with
employee pension benefits but AT&amp;amp;T did
see a revenue increase of three point
six percent to 32 billion earlier this
week verizon reported a two billion
dollar loss due to a change in its
pension accounting but also was hurt by
higher iPhone costs a new application
that uses Spotify as API is mimicking
Pandora's streaming radio sir
Spotify launched an API for mobile
developers to create apps that integrate
Spotify as music service and one such
new app is called spot on radio and
available as a free app for iOS devices
it taps into the 15 million tracks on
Spotify library and lets users stream
personal radio stations like and dislike
songs and share music with friends if
you want to sync stations across devices
you'll need a spotify account for ten
dollars a month spot on is not
affiliated with spotify but it is the
first spotify app that goes beyond the
desktop experience those are your
