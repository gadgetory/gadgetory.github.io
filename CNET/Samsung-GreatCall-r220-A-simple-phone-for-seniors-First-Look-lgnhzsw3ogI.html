cnet bringing you guys the Samsung great
call r220 aka the jitterbug plus with
its huge keypads that light up
user-friendly interface and simple
clamshell design the jitterbug plus was
built for seniors on the front here
above the outside display is a 1.3
megapixel camera when you sign up for a
jitterbug plus you can tie in your
Facebook shutterfly or picasa account so
your pictures can automatically upload
to these sites the plus is Bluetooth
enabled and has five hours of reported
top time it also has a swanky non
graphic calendar application that makes
you scroll through individual days now
great call has tied a lot of emergency
and wellness services with this handset
like its five-star urgent response when
you're in an emergency situation or feel
a little bit unsafe like say while
walking to your car at night you can
call a five-star agent who is available
24 7 if you're thinking about getting
this phone for your parents you could
sign them up to access great calls live
registered nurse hotline or they could
get automated calls asking how they're
sleeping and if they're eating well but
you should call your parents and do it
yourself I'm sure they'd appreciate it
more the Hansa is going for a hundred
and nineteen dollars though you can get
it for ninety-nine dollars during its
limited time introductory offer there is
no contract but if you want the services
i just mentioned those can cost you
anywhere between four to ten dollars
extra a month great calls unlimited talk
text and service plan costs eighty
dollars a month and if you don't want
that every text will cost you ten cents
and even voicemail is an extra three
dollars a month again i'm lyn bringing
you guys the jitterbug plus
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
