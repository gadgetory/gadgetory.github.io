working on ways to reduce fatal
accidents but you won't believe its
latest idea for saving pedestrian lives
the company proposes covering the car
hood in a sticky coating so the people
you hit will stick instead of bouncing
off yes this is a real patent that
Google submitted and the idea is that
you'll be less injured by sticking
rather than bouncing off and hitting the
pavement Google suggests this would be
good for a self-driving car but I
suppose it could work for any car and
what do you think happens next do you
just keep rolling with them on the front
to the hospital this would have to be so
sticky for it to work so wouldn't there
be other things that get stuck to the
front over time bugs bags small animals
well the patent suggests that your car
hood would not look so gross because
there would be another coating on top of
this human flypaper so the sticky stuff
would only be exposed upon impact of an
accident isn't it comforting that Google
has a team of the greatest engineering
minds assigned to solve these sticky
challenges meanwhile there's another
tech company making strides in our
autonomous vehicle future for the first
time uber released a photo of its
self-driving car being tested in
Pittsburgh it's a hybrid for infusion
there will still be someone in the
driver's seat monitoring the tests the
car has a variety of sensors such as
radars laser scanners and
high-resolution cameras to map out its
surroundings that's it for this tech
