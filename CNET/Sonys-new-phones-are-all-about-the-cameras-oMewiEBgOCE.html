the xperia x1 the exit 1 compact and the
X a oneplus but the Xperia exit 1 is all
about the camera tricks the most
exciting is the 3d scanning mode line up
your subjects face in a guide lines and
by moving the phone steadily around them
you can build up a full a 3d image of
their head it actually seems to work
really well in our testing time you can
set that 3d head as a live wallpaper for
your phone put the face into augmented
reality avatars or even send it to a 3d
printing service or your own printer if
you want a physical copy of their head
on your desk that is there's also a
great burst mode which shoots full res
photos at 10 frames a second and tracks
the focus of an object at the same time
as a person gets closer the auto focus
will shift to make sure they remain in
sharp focus finally the new face
detection aims to automatically snap a
shot of your friend smile before you
miss it and they start frowning again
you can then choose between the shot you
took yourself or the shot where the
phone thinks looks better the phone has
plenty of bragging rights beyond the
camera including a top-end Qualcomm 835
processor a waterproof design and the
latest Android software a 5.2 inch
display it has a full HD resolution the
ex-head one is joined by the XL one
compacts it has the same camera and
internal specs as its Big Brother but a
smaller 4.6 inch full HD display then
there's also the XA one plus a mid-range
phone with a large 5.5 inch full HD
screen a 23 megapixel camera and a
capacious 3430
milliamp an hour battery that Sony says
will easily get you through a full day
of use there's no price yet for any of
the three phones the sony says they'll
be going on sale globally from September</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
