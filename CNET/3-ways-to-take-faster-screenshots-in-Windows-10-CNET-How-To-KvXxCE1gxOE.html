windows is simple there's a button
dedicated to this on almost every
keyboard called the Print Screen key
pressing this key captures the entire
screen or multiple screens if you have
more than one monitor and it copies it
to the clipboard while this method works
it's the old-school way it requires you
to pace the screen capture into paint
just to save it fortunately there are
easier and faster ways to grab your
screen and windows here's how a new
screen capture hotkey combination was
introduced with Windows 10 holding the
Windows key and pressing the Print
Screen button will instantly save a
screenshot as an image you can find
these screen captures under this PC
slash pictures / screenshots the problem
is this still captures the entire
display including a second screen if you
have one if you want to capture just a
single open window without everything
else
hold alt while pressing the Print Screen
button this captures just the current
active window sadly with this hotkey you
will still need to paste the capture
into paint to save it but of course
there's a workaround if you use
Microsoft's onedrive which comes
pre-installed you can opt to have all
screen captures saved to your cloud
storage automatically and onedrive you
can find this under settings autosave
and then check the box beside
automatically save screenshots I capture
to onedrive you can find all screen
captures under onedrive slash pictures /
screenshots Dropbox for windows also has
a similar feature if you prefer it
instead windows also comes with a fairly
robust screen capture tool installed
it's called the snipping tool and it's
your best bet if you need more precise
screen captures click the start button
start typing snipping tool and click on
the app to open it with snipping tool
you can capture an active window entire
screens precise rectangles or use a
free-form select tool you can capture
screenshots on a delay and annotate them
within the snipping tool as well just
click save when you're finished to
export the capture for other Windows
