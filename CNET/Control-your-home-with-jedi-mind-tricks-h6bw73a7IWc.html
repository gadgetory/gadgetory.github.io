future of toggling complex systems of
devices like your home theater setup and
your smart home system is with gestures
at least that's what the hundred $50
single cue would have you believe if
this device sounds familiar it's because
we looked at it a few years back but
this is generation two with a greater
focus on overall smart home control
here's how it works
you set it up by your TV then integrate
it using the app with devices around
your house I set it up with Alexa this
vizio tv our Apple TV streaming device
and Philips you then it tracks your
gestures with this camera and shows you
its menu via this screen I was skeptical
of the gesture control at first but it
works relatively well with only
occasional hiccups and controlling your
devices with gestures actually feels
pretty damn cool as a practical remote
though the single cue is lackluster
here's what I mean the first issue is
you have to be seated in the same spot
while using the single cue that means
you don't have the same control if
you're on the other side of the couch or
just lounging second the single cue only
tracks a select few gestures which can't
be customized that means if you want to
move your selector on the Apple TV for
instance you don't actually swipe left
or right you have to find the left or
right button on the single cue menu and
click it single cue does have a couple
direct control motions like putting your
finger over your lips to mute the TV or
holding up your hand deposit but
otherwise it feels pretty inefficient
when compared to better universal
remotes like say harmonies I was
surprised that the biggest problem with
single cue wasn't its innovative gesture
tracking but rather a convoluted menu
system in an age of tablets and
touchscreens I expected these gestures
to feel way more natural if you want a
solid universal remote the second gen
single cue won't be your best bet but
maybe by generation three or four it
will be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
