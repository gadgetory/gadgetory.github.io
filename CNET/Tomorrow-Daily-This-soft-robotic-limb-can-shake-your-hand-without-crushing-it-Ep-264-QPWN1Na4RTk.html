talk-show in the known universe yes talk
shows have one more person we know
that's big bill I'm looking right at it
looks pretty awesome it's coming along
soon soon let's hit the headlines our
first story today on tomorrow dailies a
subject we love to talk about 3d printed
prosthetics and this time around this
robotic hand can give you a handshake
rob Scharf is a Delft University of
Technology graduate with an interesting
new project a soft hand that has the
ability to gauge the grip of the person
shaking it and adjust itself accordingly
this prosthetic was a product of his
soft robotics research project which
aims to find ways to integrate robots
with tactile materials so that robot
human interactions are more natural and
comfortable to people so how does it
work air chambers inside the hands palm
transfer air to the fingers in the
robotic hand when it gets squeezed so
when a person reaches out and shakes
that robotic hand the grip increases or
decreases depending on how hard or soft
that handshake is it's currently a
prototype but skarf thinks that this can
be used beyond simple prosthetics you
can use it in orthotics or maybe even
physical therapy just pretty amazing all
things considered
okay so robotics in physical therapy
means doctors and speaking of doctors we
have to talk about this kind of cool
wearable that might change the way
doctors do surgery and it's not Google
glass this is vivvy and it's a simple
plastic device that can be clipped onto
a headband it has one single goal which
is to deliver crucial easy to reference
information about a patient's vital
signs on a doctor's operating table it
was developed by method a company
started by two anesthetists who felt
that other wearables were either too
cumbersome or too complicated for the
task they thought about using existing
wearables like Google glass but the
voice commands and swiping to navigate
doesn't quite translate well to
operating rooms which can be messy
sometimes and noisy plus a lot of
doctors already wear glasses or
protective gear over their eyes during
operations
vivy they say offers only the core data
doctor needs and can
a notification device if vitals change
suddenly method says the smartphone app
will allow doctors to choose which
patient vitals they need to keep an eye
on and we'll keep doctors eyes on the
patient instead of constantly looking
away during a procedure
vivy isn't exactly trying to redefine
the wearable space but that's okay they
really just want to offer a companion
device for doctors to use during surgery
they also think they might be able to
use it for things like cyclists and
runners who want to check their vitals
while they're on the go all right our
last story today has nothing to do with
future technology but honestly was just
so cool I couldn't not share it with you
let's talk about this lego combination
safe jason a'lamin from jkbrickworks.com
nation safe out of Legos it's a three
combo lock and a tour of the inside of
the creation shows the mechanisms and
how he got them to work the way he put
together the safe makes it pretty tough
to disassemble but the area for keeping
values is also pretty small it only
holds a few of Allemands gold bars
I mean bricks if you forget your
combination or if you are the worst cat
burglar in the world you can break the
safe by forcefully chucking it into the
ground but you'll probably break some
pieces in the process brick works has
the full build up on their site right
now so you can get to work right away if
you need to lock up your smallest
valuables alright those are our
headlines let's move on to crowdfunding
scanners that can create super accurate
high quality resolution 3d models can be
pretty expensive I mean we're talking
around at least $10,000 but II auro-3d
wants to change that your 3d scanner is
a small portable scanner that's powered
by your Android or iOS smartphone they
say their scans are precise to sub 100
microns with a resolution of up to 8
million vertices that's no small feat
considering how tiny the device itself
is the app is meant to be easy to use
and models can be stored in the cloud
with Dropbox integration built-in uses a
green laser for scanning as opposed to
the standard red laser that you might
have seen before and doesn't require a
turntable to 3d scan an object although
you can add that in the campaign if you
would like one they wanted $80,000 for
the campaign and the auro-3d has blown
right past that goal with over four
hundred and thirty thousand dollars
raised as of right now with just 23 days
left in the campaign and the price well
wildly reasonable at just two hundred
and twenty nine bucks which is the
earlybird backer level currently
available and once it hits retail they
expect to sell your 3d for $330 so it's
a nice savings and honestly I feel like
I kind of want to back this even though
I have no idea what I would use it for
but you know I guess that's the mark of
a really good crowdfunding campaign all
right guys that's it for back at our
Hackett let's check out your pretty
pretty pictures
today's phone tag refer is Ingo who took
this with his galaxy s5 he wrote to us
and he said hey guys I just wanted to
share a photo I took with my galaxy s5 I
took this picture while taking family on
a tour of the San Francisco Golden Gate
Bridge which is immersed like it is most
days by Carl the fog you have my
permission to use the photo looking
forward to the new set and stories best
and go and go this picture is amazing it
kind of reminds me of a little you I
mean the fogs they'll Silent Hill is
just sort of creepy it kind of fits in
with fall it's super good and
appropriate for this time of year if you
guys want to submit your photogra fee to
be considered to be featured in photogra
for the day you can email us tomorrow at
cnet.com send us your picture send us
your name give us permission to use your
picture and also tell us a little story
about your photo because we love stories
it guys on find us online we're tomorrow
daily.com if you'd like to share the
show with a friend enemy or frenemy
either way we appreciate it and of
course you can find us on social media
at tomorrow daily on places like
Facebook and Twitter and I am Ashley
Escada on Twitter and producer Logan is
at Logan Moy well back tomorrow with
Brandi Doggett of weird science back
means science fiction but until then
vegan humans see you guys next time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
