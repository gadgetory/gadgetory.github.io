cnet.com we're here today with Bonnie
cha our cell phone expert senior editor
and today we're talking about AT&amp;amp;T and
the announcement they made that they've
fully upgraded their 3G service here in
New York City
and while it's tough to judge and
measure that claim we decided to put all
the cellphone carriers up against one
another starting right here at our CNET
Labs here in New York so Bonnie how
exactly are we conducting these
experiments here today so we've
downloaded the speedtest.net app to four
devices the Nexus One for t-mobile that
Apple iPhone 4 for 18 T got it on the
Evo 4G for Sprint as well as the joint X
for Verizon and we're gonna conduct
three tests at each location and take an
average obviously there are a lot of
variables that go into these fita so I'm
just gonna give it a shot and see what
we get so shall we start let's do it
Bonnie what were the results again I'd
like to reiterate this isn't formal
scientific testing but looks like from
the test here that 18t had the fastest
upload and download speeds interestingly
a Verizon and t-mobile around the same
but t-mobile was running on edge so it's
pretty interesting result cool all right
we're going to brave the heat and
venture outside our next stop Columbus
Circle
so Bonnie there's a lot of people here
what do you think is going to happen in
our speed test well it should be
interesting to watch but you know with
more people I'm sure a lot of people are
on their cell phones so data speeds
might be slower but we'll have to check
it out all right let's see what we get
here at Columbus Circle okay so we
average the three tests and t-mobile had
the fastest download speeds which
actually doesn't surprise me because
I've gotten grade 3G speeds with
t-mobile here in New York sprint and
came in last that is a bummer for me
because I have an Evo but alright but
you know just informal testing here sure
and Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T were similar in as
far as download speeds but the upload
speeds for 18 T were a little on the
floor side you know we've had that issue
this week we've heard about it so it's
apparently a software issue so hopefully
we'll see it fixed soon
all right our latest trip brings us to
Times Square in New York City
Bonnie Chow what do you think's going on
here so many people so much traffic what
can we expect well yeah a lot more
people than Columbus Circle I think
that's going to put more of a strain on
the network so I'm expecting some slower
data speeds here but let's see who can
handle the heat we're done spinning here
in Times Square in New York City finally
shall we have our results what did they
say we got some mixed results this time
chima was still in first place was the
fastest download and upload speeds
sprint actually came in second so
they're coming on up Verizon came in
last in 83rd all right we're here at our
final location for testing Union Square
well actually this is the location I was
most interested in because when we
posted that ATT story we've got a few
complaints from readers saying the Union
Square area was the worst in reception
so 18t came in third wasn't the worst
sprint was the worst you know I'm really
upset about everywhere we go except for
Times Square Sprint performed terribly
sorry about that it's okay it's not your
fault it's not your network you know
again these are informal tests a lot of
variables happening as far as first
t-mobile still comes in first and
Verizon came in second I think I think
you know we learned a lot and I think
surprisingly t-mobile having by far the
best performance scores is there
anything else that contributes to them
again it could like we said it could be
the number of subscribers but you know
t-mobile just hasn't really advertised
there 3G network as much as the other so
people might not be aware about how fast
this network is um what else did we
learn today really I feel like you
regardless where you go in Manhattan
your results are gonna vary you know we
got ups we got downs different locations
changed is there anything else we could
sort of conclude after all this I mean
the mixed results you know there's so
many variables it could be your location
there's a time of day you know
so you know just if you're looking for a
carrier talk with other people to see
what their experiences and choose from
there I decide from there well thank you
Bonnie cha our cell phone expert senior
editor here at Zenith accom we've braved
the heat we've jumped all over Manhattan
testing the various cell phone providers
and their data speeds I'm Jeff Bakalar
for cnet.com as well thank you so much
for watching we'll see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
