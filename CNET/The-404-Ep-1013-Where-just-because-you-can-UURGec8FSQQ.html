time on Sina TV I'm Jeff Bakalar I'm
Marco saya and I'm trusting you this is
the show where just because you can does
not mean you should it's a good rule if
it's a good rule of thumb and we'll
explain while why we are trying to
convey that very important message mark
let's say on the show it's been so long
i did i'm so freaking thank you I've had
a I guess the reason why I've been
avoiding the shows I've had a bad hair
half year mark you're telling me is your
hair it's good bit of a bad hair day
it's been a bad hair half a year I
understand why you think your hair is
preventing you a personal being silly
first of a lovely hair um but I think
the reason it got me motivated come on
the show was someone sent you an email
that was super flattering for me yes um
comparing me to the major Sheppard
commander shepard for a mass effect yeah
now I'm kind of falling into fem shep
territory now I'm pretty sure my hair
style is one of the customizable email
it does their choices you know when you
scroll down it's like you know pompadour
and it says lobby area it says Allah
says it's this mark what the photo of
mark wait uh I just looked up commander
shepard having no knowledge of mass
effect that is african-american man just
showed up no no that's what you look
like it's not that is a lot Commander
Shepard is not the default commander
shepard that is a customized no okay all
right did you check our email oh wow you
do sort of look like this guy how is
that actually modeled let's say I mean
line of the real model they made
commander shepard off Wow look like the
virtual version it's a good-looking man
by the way I'm very good i don't see the
similarity whatsoever but also you'll
take it commander shakes a babe man he's
a total dude magnet this is great i love
oh yeah i do prefer to my fur to myself
is femshep so I'm Shep means female
yeah that's actually why I grew out my
hair just to look like the female
version of shepherd so when the game
came out I guess you're playing a lot of
mass effect 3 then I am you finished it
I didn't finish it yet
just cuz i started a little late have
you heard about what's happened we're
not gonna give away the ending on yeah
you don't know about the end yeah I've
heard things and uh yeah the Nerds over
volga because the second was so amazing
yet the size of the second one the third
one would not right which is that level
of epicness what you so amazing but you
have many times but you haven't finished
the third one yet you can't you can't
tell but um I don't know one of the
things that I appreciate is how the way
you play the second game like I saved
all my characters that everyone's
loyalty yeah I did not save the crew but
um it's cool like when you meet up with
well actually I don't don't give
anything away know how the air time did
you guys need it back up here and tell
me about what the Carver chicken the
ending to man 3 is we're not going to
talk about the actual ending but to say
what people are complaining what Mark is
talking about is in mass effect 2 yeah
the whole game you're sort of like
trying to keep your squadmates alive
okay alright and if you keep them alive
and you transfer your profile from two
to three you keep those characters and
everything else and all the decisions
that you made that affected the
characters and that game carry over onto
the third game just like with the first
game right um so you have to like keep
that in mind while you know sort of that
word was right and that's we're talking
about with like decisions and characters
getting right uh you know transformed
over to the third one and now the
problem with the third one is that
there's an ending the third one ends
with a an ending that a lot of people or
it feels all the Internet's on fire
about it they don't peep the the nurse
the nerds don't like it yeah babies it's
just like guess what you can't have your
cake and eat it too the game's awesome
just you don't like the ending yes like
tough crap correct me if i'm wrong i
thought that games nowadays have
multiple endings right it's not just one
yeah what's going but there's like the
main ending but there's little little
side sings and happy and that yeah you
know don't affect the ending ending but
you know and this is it and this is
basically the end of the trilogy mass
effect 3 marks the end they're gonna
have to another one but such a
successful except no way that they're
going to not want to milk more money out
of that someone's telling he says it's a
good game too it really is and in my
opinion it's probably the best like
space sci-fi sort of universe right oh
yeah I think I liked it better than I'm
gonna say Star Wars oh yeah you know
do you guys think that very well photos
you guys think that players have a right
to petition and bother a company like I
was reading an article online about this
earlier and I guess 13,000 people have
like the facebook page that that amazing
that's demanding that Bioware changed
the ending just because a couple nerds
don't I don't have to say to those 13th
to get a f'in lion series you're not
going to be petitioning a director
because you don't like the way that
transformers ended although maybe you
would have the right to do that I mean I
respect that they're so passionate and I
think bioware should be flattered that
they have such a passionate fans of
course but uh but don't you dare go
outside and play kickball yeah don't you
dare even entertain the idea of changing
this ending yet where's your artistic
integrity all right audacity speaking of
revolting against creation of the
creation of art and I think if there's
one thing that we really should all band
together and I'm looking at everyone in
this room as well as you on the internet
we need to come together and stand tall
against Michael Bay because he is
single-handedly raping our childhood
yeah I said it again he is raping our
childhood he plans to make a Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles reboot not a bad
idea not a bit i would take a number for
ya if you want we can just cancel
turtles in time and you just go on go
back two three well no I don't mind
casey michael bay's okay but not when
he's telling me that he's gonna make
these ninja turtles aliens yeah so that
I guess he announced over the weekend
that this reboot instead of actually
having them mutate from turtles and the
ooze into big turtles right which is why
these visitors from from outer space so
I reimagine reimagining of the origin of
writers write which is completely not
which doesn't make sense because they
call the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
not the teenage alien right and if you
do a its tenth and that sounds too much
like taint okay so get the hell oh god
why why why reason more than any other
okay it's true if there's one reason why
does hollywood give michael bay a blank
check and just say hey you want to ruin
you want to ruin something it's gonna be
explosions in the movie but why is this
okay watch you know like didn't
Hollywood's not stupid they know about
the Internet I mean they only know about
maybe the piracy on the internet but
they know that the people are going to
be upset about this just play devil's
advocate maybe Michael Bay is catering
to a new batch of kids age of course
didn't grow up with it they're not going
to have that much of attachment they're
not gonna care at the end of the day
though that new Ninja Turtle universe
the ones but they don't have pupils
right you've seen that right yes there
are still they still battle shredder and
they still right can't come from ooze
right you know they owe their roots to
use and I think there's a way to create
a movie that doesn't change the story
and piss off a lot of people like you
can still do it and not yeah he's
claiming that i er adds realism to it
because aliens for the alien know what
and on the planet and kung fu fight Mr
shredder shredders an integral part of
that story ready like raise the turtles
without getting too nerdy you know like
you train them in the ninja arts but
with that he's a mutation himself I
wonder if they're gonna make him into an
alien as we turn my splinter I'm sorry
Richard Linda yes I look at the ramen
Wikipedia ninja turtle or we're gonna
show me because moving to in the second
movie super-stretch super shredder for
any more data series he was never his
never immune right here's another easy
from Japan is the origin is is is the
only sort of tablets we have from the
cartoon or is there sort of like comic
uh origin order i'm sure there is you
think it all like some bond was it sabon
entertainment yeah yeah yeahs first so
it was a comic for the first yeah yeah
yeah and I that's where we need to get
down to yeah cuz i'm sure the comic book
people are like you dumbasses that you
don't even know even know it yeah they
were either end yeah i want to go way
back if someone knows give us a call
because we are not simply an olympus co
yeah we're going to yum in the cartoon
no splinter was a mutant right yes but
then in the movie no he was he had
wasn't he was a person who changed in
knowing the cartoon he was a person who
changed into our union you saw it in
title screen no no no shredder kept a
rat as a pet yeah that was what happen
who vie he's talking about the card by
cartoon Barry was
human was human he was even wearing that
rope to hold splintered up in the
process of the mutation that what kind
of like I'm learning so much today so
you're saying splinter in the cartoon
was in fact a human at one point yes
that's a little earlier today he was a
baby right rat right so they change that
they're probably pissed in the eighties
too they probably were I think
everyone's got dories we really gotta
get our stuff together what if they
brought Kato back you help is like 20
years later still delivering pizzas yeah
I got a second third he's like 56 then
yeah Ernie raised yeah you uh what about
our good pal um Casey Jones that's right
he'll come back in my Michael Bay movie
is some sort of transformer you must
love that guy cuz he was all about the
hawk it was cool I had I had an affinity
for sure anyway uh so that is one way to
ruin a movie but perhaps maybe we're all
coming around on the concept of a second
Beetlejuice movie yeah Beetlejuice
exactly we've talked about this before
and apparently things are in motion to
get a second Beetlejuice film off the
ground it'll actually supposed to be set
26 years after the original so it will
sort of stay in line with the current
timeline yeah and believe it or not Tim
Burton and Michael Keaton seem to be on
board about this and they're not about
doing a reboot this is actually
supposedly a true seagull with the
writer Seth grahame-smith yeah uh
wielding the pen he actually wrote Tim
Burton's new film Dark Shadows have you
guys seen the trailer for that kind of
into that have you did you watch the
actual old Dark Shadows not watch it oh
it's a i did not know it's a remake oh
it was this old sci-fi werewolf vampire
drama it was like it was like a soap
opera okay this so itself seriously yeah
I remember yeah my grandma used to watch
it so what time period it was oh man
it's old um I can't give you an accurate
time frame but um yeah if you see the
trailer it's completely different they
like totally camped it up yeah it is not
serious at all yeah the the Nutri imeem
there's something about it is you go on
you too
and check out the the old one cuz it's
the cool thing about Dark Shadows as if
it feels like his first sort of uh
effort towards a comedy since like
Edward Scissorhands enemy like it's got
that vibe to it and I'm excited about
that arm but a second be lidge's i mean
i don't know i think the part of the
original Betelgeuse is charm was that
they didn't know what they were doing
was going to become this huge sort of
cult classic right arm and now you know
with I don't know there's something
about the bad special effects or
something about you know that make up
that it aesthetic that is going to be
lost if they do in fact do a sequel if
they do I don't want it to be a charlie
and the chocolate factory where it's all
like incoherent CG and just nonsense
yeah I mean I hope that doesn't happen
why worry about I guess the screenwriter
was saying that it's going to be 26
years in the future but things won't
have changed for Beetlejuice himself
right look it's time for him is very
small exactly real-life sure maybe
they'll keep the same look because not
much time is james frain i would love to
bring back the deep the dietz's you know
Catherine O'Hara and Jeff Jones and
Lydia are pretty amazing they're just an
amazing family I i assume Helena Bonham
Carter Carter will be in the movie
she'll be like she man she don't have to
worry about work ever ever well she's
also married to Temple of course that's
why yeah I feel like she should totally
be Lydia's aunt or something yeah I mean
like that would just be marvelous so
there you have it possibly a backed-up
act a beetle juicy to be told ya and I
don't know a lot of weird movie news
this weekend yeah i don't know how i
feel about well I mean is it better than
not having one do you feel like it would
ruin the original no you can't ruin or
your original source because it's not a
reboot it's just going to be a sequel
which i think is the best news to come
out of this entire story so I don't know
it'll be interesting to see um alright
we gotta at some point here talk about
something to do with tech and this is
what I'm interested in this morning the
FAA says it has will finally reconsider
revising its list of approved
electronics on flights so the the
situation
that exists now is that you can't have
anything with an on switch like I'm
swing with an on to it yeah even though
phones have airplane mode which is now
turn it off I'm like but look the little
airplane icon I want before you just you
don't turn it off you know yeah you just
put it in airplane you know I don't even
put in an airplane I don't probably like
texting and on the internet until you're
like a thousand feet in the air it
really is that bet you you are hi i'm
texting all the way until we reach
cruising altitude and then my signal is
drag your signal would last they
wouldn't Bob so what about this new
revision to the to the appropriate
electronics list uh well okay so it's
been about 15 years as they've updated
this list that's a while which is a
really long time few things have come
out in 15 years coupled advisors have
come out yeah so I guess now they're
finally deciding that hey maybe we
should take a look at this list and I
guess the problem though was that the
rules in order for them to be changed
they have to test every single advice
from a device to make sure that they
don't interfere with navigation
equipment when the shifting had to be
crazy too yeah I can't just be one
iphone they would literally have to test
every version of the iphone that they
would prove to be on this list so that's
why it's a huge heap of stuff but now
they're finally realizing it's worth it
plus I was thinking about this like if
they're going to offer Wi-Fi connections
on planes that seems kind of a like a
disconnect there right like yeah not
sure on your device yet they still offer
Wi-Fi I think they don't they don't
start that until here yeah that's just
the taking off on that and the messaging
to me yeah the Wi-Fi is attached to a
certain sort of a height measure you
know whatever they what do they call
that thing the thing that measures your
height altitude yeah altitude mother
tautomer optical yeah it's an alt hatem
a daughter okay the money I don't think
you can use Wi-Fi in airplane mode can
you no no that's a problem because ray I
can't use your phone even if you have
Wi-Fi on the plane look at Richard's
coming up with a huge paradox yeah on
the plane you're right and I thought the
Mythbusters actually you know applied
this they said they had all these
devising Nate that and apparently it's
not it did nothing interferes with
flying yeah does that have to do with
the volume of devices that are on there
in take off like if one person even if
it has a phone a little matter but if 15
people do then yeah it'll translate 300
gonna say but is there a minimum amount
of devices no see I I don't think it has
anything to do this think about it if it
really did right and if they were really
absolutely positively convinced that
wireless connectivity can interfere with
air travel you check them out the door
yeah they wouldn't even let you on the
plane with them get frisked exactly
they'd be like up throat you know get it
out of here well I think what um is kind
of a big deal about the testing with
this is that they're going to have to
you know these are going to test it on
empty flights so all these airplanes are
going to be flying around the air which
is nothing of every month yeah it's like
Oh what if light is that oh that's the
ipad right okay no I first the first
look the first kindle yeah yeah a kindle
should not be needed to turn off number
one I can't turn off all that well those
are the things that they're that they're
trying to allow people 60 poorly readers
and the tablets do you know what was
around 15 years ago nothing there was
nothing a discman that was the biggest
threat to air travel yeah I mean is it
that big of a deal though if you do have
to turn your you're like me person do I
care no but you don't do what I was
trying to do it but when I was coming
back from Dominican Republic we were at
like 10 minutes left in horrible bosses
and she made me turn off the ipad I said
look it's a definitely gonna end soon
look there's on she didn't care yeah
you're one of those miners yeah that
that makes the poor stewardess like go
back and get drunk in the back of the
plane try what do you mean what are you
talking about my talking about who's
that guy the the jetblue yeah you create
those people you know come on me because
with because I'm me and Richard on the
way to South by we had one of those
people behind us and I the the flight
attendants have it rough man they do
they may not have it easy sir calm down
it's the guy was being a jerk oh I'm not
a jerk too oh no I'm not I'm just
teasing ya know you are a very very
wonderful person and I think I'm in love
with you I'll do you right now it all
comes out right now like a troll oh man
that's pretty good uh speaking of iPads
on planes and the new iPad apparently is
causing quite the confusion against the
layperson
apparently gizmodo's finding out along
with another site here The Next Web the
next web that the average consumer
cannot tell the difference between an
ipad 2 and the new ipad they're like it
feels lighter than the stand it's a
hider yeah so people actually cat yeah
crazy i'm only anecdotal but there's a
video that both the next web.com and
gizmodo put up where it just brought two
ipads out to like a Pepsi challenge kind
of thing didn't tell them which one was
which and they had them guess which was
the new one which one was the old one
some people actually said the new one
was a heavier hmm ng little heavier they
said they liked the screen of the second
one better than the third video well the
reddest ones you know it's funny because
I'm we video looks better well no I'm
just I'm just imitating oh the video
looks so much better on the new one yeah
new sure but um we were we were standing
in line um ipod ipad launch gay on
friday when we were interviewing people
and that's what everyone was saying
they're like i'm very excited about this
new screen yeah videos gonna write
amazing share my head I'm like you don't
be able to tell the difference yeah that
one and then like give yourself an hour
and then looked at the other one I mean
you probably I think with you probably
you're probably what it was like it yeah
yeah but I don't think it makes a world
of difference I mean if you if you tell
some sorry I keep in touch okay sorry go
on I was gonna say I think the text the
where that you know where that works
where it looks just as good as print I
think there's a difference there so I
haven't seen a new eye pea do we have
one in the office yeah we cannot have it
can I have it I'm I check it out be it
also because i really wanna check that i
also wanna check out how crisp a comic
book would look on it you think you look
crisper all wrong if anyone have any one
new ipad out there is reading comic
books in detail no I don't want you to
send it your dad they can look at the
black box and never returned it just
tell i well i'm curious cuz that would
literally be the only reason why i right
well you could tell a big difference
between iphone 3gs and iphone 4 is when
they added that render display right
like i think i probably would be able to
tell we should test business i really
want to be I was like an emperor's new
clothes type deal yeah oh my god such
crazy improvement I want to do that you
know you shuffling behind your back and
go okay which one's into it
you're like I don't know and if it's
wrong to smash in the fridge break it
right in their face that's interesting I
think it's very funny that the common
person cannot like a testament to their
marketing well well in what regard in
the way that I think they've fooled so
many people just thinking that the
because of You Reena revolutionary yeah
but they don't actually need it if I it
is a little concerning that the average
consumer cannot I mean this is a totally
unscientific demonstration here well
also i feel like if you're someone's
gonna get a camera out and be like what
do you think of this you're gonna feel
pressured to be like oh really you're
not gonna be like well if anything that
gives you like that first knee-jerk
reaction where you're like okay you know
is true you know I see both it's a much
more maybe possibly organic impression
rather than having time to choose
between I think I think at the also says
I think it's also like a good thing it's
also like wow these things are so cool
again with that people just can't or you
could say that do they need to release
them every year you know like just the
fact that the second so much same as the
third I mean but you know you should
have had the camera application of that
would that work yeah but then you go to
the apple store at six in the morning
and the people are lined around the
block and you're like yes they do yeah
cuz people will buy them they will I'm
curious to hear from our listeners and
viewers who has upgraded whether you
came from nothing ipad 1 or ipad 2 i'd
like to know that and I'm over the name
too I think it's okay oh you like it now
I don't like it I just understand
they're doing the same thing like the
macbooks do yeah you know that on that
first day it was be I was mad because
that and the iphone are the only two
products that have a sort of
ever-evolving nomenclature right i mean
yeah either way I'm okay with it I want
to talk about this unbelievable spring
break stat yeah okay Justin yeah I want
you to tell me all about this because I
know you really spent many a spring
break in Daytona Beach plenty with your
shirt off the Jersey Shore is always
where I'm at around this time of year
there was an article in the new york
times today that i thought was really
really interesting and they're basically
saying that today's Spring Breakers
they've become a little bit more tame
this is a like you know according to
people that work at the Spring Break
locations like in key west for example
they're saying that it's a lot more tame
now that people have a fear of betrayal
from videos popping up on facebook and
photos popping up on flickr now that
there's so many devices around I could
take pictures and record what happened
and tag the crappy exactly and I think
it also has to do with employers
checking facebook profiles and looking
at your online presence it's and also
yeah I wonder if it has something I mean
I'm sure it has something to do with the
fact that MTV does not embrace the
spring break culture like they once did
or do then quickly maybe I'm just out of
touch and I don't think you're out of
touch because they still just like the
spring break runway models I'm pretty
sure they still do it now everyone just
wears masks though could you imagine an
entire spring-break where everyone's
wearing like the anonymous mask and so
God look like girls gone wild thing
that's that's gone that's done yeah
they've got maybe that was like a
phenomenon spray zero can't do it
anymore but aspire to achieve that yeah
they're at a same thing with Mardi Gras
I'm sure there's a lot less boob show
it's from beads and whatnot because
we're all that quick flash I know you
can open on the phone in like three
seconds and take a picture now yeah
especially with this swype to camera
feature yeah so thanks Apple you're
quite welcome it's amazing the very
thing that has brought all these people
together ironic is now the cause of
their undoing yeah this is amazing happy
day I'll came back uh yeah this is
really cool this is sort of like an Abed
piece out of the New York Times and I
guess it sort of makes sense i mean you
would I guess lutely makes it I guess
they like the positive takeaway is that
people are actually becoming why where
and perhaps responsible for their
actions you know thinking about the
consequences yeah like oh man if I
actually you know if I get naked I'm not
going to get a picture and that tag me
and I won't ever get a job and i'll be
on what reddit yeah beyond ready in 45
seconds uh this is uh this is or is
actually confusing atari everyone knows
they're offering a hundred thousand
dollars and a contest for somebody come
up with a new version of pong for iOS
platform uh okay wouldn't it only cost
them like twenty-five hundred dollars to
make a version of pond and would they
make any money off offering this online
I'm is already games that exist in the
itunes store if you made it online
multiplayer and you charged a dollar you
sure 99 cents yeah I think that's good i
think that's a good I can see anyone
being like well I can either play like
draw something with all my friends or
play pong for half an hour yeah such a
simple game where anyone can do yeah
yeah I don't know anyway the top prizes
are cash uh and then a revenue-sharing
agreement so if you do win you have the
opportunity to possibly make more money
based on revenue sharing which is pretty
interesting um do you remember the last
pong reboot I maybe wasn't the last one
but it wasn't the Penguins no no there's
Ataris yeah it was Atari and it was I
think it was on the PlayStation remember
me my sister got it's like a
downloadable game no no no Zach was an
official game Wow yeah I think it was
just called pong that's where penguins
in it huh yeah what was that one pong

Player to Player it was like a single
player thing and there was like one
paddle that would go across the bottom
and you could hit oh that's not a calm
like brick as annoyed is that are yeah

you gotta drag your finger all around
yeah and everyone's playing it's all the
rage these days this week plant and you
gotta do it man we gotta play yeah as
your vocabulary increase know that's
what the one thing I'm finding out is
that it
not improve my vocabulary at all right
it's actually teaching me words that is
my words and all small yet so no like
the best word you can do is like threads
yeah or something like that yeah I'm all
those people when I play those games in
like tan tan what is tape what is
tan-tan I'm like I'm Danielle attend my
god yeah but I have mental part it's a
pretty simple word to forget the meeting

something yeah but you figure that it
happens to me minute it's happened to me
a minute i'm playing that i'm also
playing uh draw something draw something
I've kind of got addicted to myself I
don't know though like are you good are
you good no I'm terrible I'm also
tempted to buy a skylit and cheat no
like that cheating is it's not cheating
if you use as cheating is when you write
out the word right that's cheating do
you play well I draw something more I do
not do you know about it I do yeah what
about Richard us are playing y'all gotta
play we got to get on some sort of
four-way thing here is it work yeah I
mean I think we would also really dirty
stone right yeah it's only what i wanna
i made that offer a game yeah but i like
that you can choose which word you want
to draw right it's not just uh you know
you're given a thing and that's it's not
like charades Ernie exactly you have a
choice easy medium or hard I would
assume that ye I don't know if for some
reason I would seem that both of you
would be good artist I don't know if
that's because you are into comic books
like I am but when I was I mean I'm I'm
a big comic book person and I've been
drawing since let me be the first to
tell you that I'm tear you're not you're
not yeah I i thought i would be when i
was young i was like oh I'll just get
better when I'm older yeah then I you
stayed the same inability if anything it
got worse this man oh man I can't draw
from crap I still do like the muscles
that look like clouds you know like
vertical hills I do that I actually I
took um a cartoon cartoon drawing class
when I was a little cuz I was a pretty
good drawer and they started doing like
you know where you shade that like you
draw the head out and then you draw the
torso huh I was like this is too much
work that's not a draw is one big mass
into I left I didn't last one class I
I'm me I'm all about the birds in the
sky little M's yes yeah in a house with
the curly q ya know convey that chimneys
always spitting out curly smoke I don't
know why but it is it's only and you
only live in one floor house I like to
do my signature and then
at the end turn into a house with man i
do that's my signature my chase it's
pretty good I want to change gears real
quick okay okay I want to talk about
this for a little bit here is a very
interesting article from all things D
talking about how Twitter and Facebook
are the new news platforms now this is
not news to anybody Twitter and Facebook
have become our go-to news source I feel
like whenever i watch CNN it's just
reporting to me what I knew 20 minutes
ago when I found out on Twitter yeah
even like even like ESPN all these
sporting all they do is report tweets
from athletes and stuff it's kind of
crazy so what this uh I bet is talking
about is how they are becoming
tomorrow's news service but do you guys
think that it's okay to rely on things
like Twitter and Facebook for the news
what do you think do you think it's ok
to do something like that I feel like
half the time it's um well I mean I
guess it's it's based off of well you're
saying facebook and twitter hmm so i
guess most the facebooks news i guess is
well either tied to twitter or based off
tweets yeah um I don't know its engine I
mean I even even seen it i guess like we
all go off of it in some way for sure
but um that's a good question man I
don't know I don't know why kidding I
can't tell if it's a good or bad thing I
think uh because if you look at trending
topics on Twitter I know it's both but I
can't I can't readily come up with the
reasons right now well I'm just saying
if you look at the trending topics on
Twitter it's very disturbing trending
tiles are stupid yeah they're each and
it just really shows you how pervasive
and accessible twitter has become
because they've let all the morons on
and if you haven't hid ninety percent of
the people on your facebook wall then
that's you know then that's the same
case with what's in your facebook for
sure yeah that's the thing you are
curating your news wen zhang that yeah
responsible for where you're getting
your news from and you're like I'm not
into sports I'm gonna I'm gonna make
sure that Jeff's facebook updates don't
get exactly well but you're into video
game so then I'm like well I guess I'll
keep them yeah well you know what is
in bed here interesting in this article
it says just nine percent of american
adults frequently get their news from
their paths that the two services and
those who do end up getting it from much
more frequently from than facebook then
on twitter sensing they're getting the
news more on facebook then twitter
that's according to this new survey from
the pew research center and its project
for Excellence in Journalism yeah i'm
i'm surprised by that i would think
people get their news more out of
Twitter than they do facebook but this
article saying otherwise well i guess
because you know Facebook can can push
all that stuff on to for sure can push
all the tweets on to their then you know
just I guess skipping a step in some way
yeah Justin are you okay with getting
your news out of facebook and twitter
anyway no because I don't subscribe to
I'm afraid that any article that I read
on facebook will automatically have
published my news feed so I keep all
that stuff off of facebook I mostly get
my news from news aggregators online but
is in Twitter and aggregator like if you
follow CNN and you follow world breaking
news and you follow all these other
handles right that's an aggravator say I
just don't like the Twitter layout okay
you don't like 140 characters right i
don't like hundred forty characters
that's like oh sorry i'll go if you
drink it for one of those people that
that bothers you you would already be
the type like me and i'm sure you guys
has all these separate folders like a
twitter folder yeah your google reader
that you don't have no it's like you're
a big google reader guy yeah yeah you're
hard but it's one of those things like I
read the same type of news and I have to
force myself to bring outside outside uh
you know sources sources into the
folders and i'm so used to reading
because otherwise i won't go see you
know i won't seek them out right it's
like you know people that are watch fox
or you know mostly conservative people
watch out you it's the same thing like
you're not going to watch fox if you
watch available it's a curation sort of
preference again but you you go on
Twitter a lot though don't you i do you
know what like you read twitter more
than you tweet right yeah i do and i use
twitter just for like a link blasting
type thing yeah they're normally do
social commentary but would you like
there's just too many sources that i get
my news from yeah that's like for me a
huge problem like it's always on google
reader or i have aggregators up or i
have like bookmarks in my like bookmarks
folder that I'm all
clicking sure I'm really disorder you
want something funny though is I feel
like seventy percent of the time I read
articles in my head I'm always like I
think Justin would appreciate this I
don't know why what blogs are you
reading though no detectable just quirky
stuff yeah yeah it's like eyeliner every
time I read I'm like maybe also mr.
Justin but you're never I don't know but
he's never around send that to media I
just say to you so but the love I feel
burned cuz you don't listen to my music
collection oh that's right i sent to my
heart sent me a tour you yeah when I
when I am I get my tonsils removed yes I
was feeling pretty good so I said to
miss long email about which songs to
listen to in which order which I never
do because you know me I like you're
terrible terrible that's with
communication yeah but um yeah I went
out on a limb and I feel burned I want
you to get on to it are you you're
secretly on Twitter uh I had an account
way back man I would be I don't on I
think we should get our listeners behind
that and get you involved on Twitter a
little more I would love just be stupid
now I wouldn't man perverted I'm gonna
read it it would be perverted all that
but that's part of the fun I thought
you'd when you read like trending topics
aren't you ever blown away at like the
crap that winds up getting up there yeah
I'm always pretty surprised although I
hardly ever look at the training topics
thing what kind of stuff have you seen I
don't know every other day it's some
fake celebrity death something you know
like uh this in that god is great yeah I
just don't I just don't understand how I
thought like there was a wisdom of
crowds yeah and it's just like oh no the
celebrity that's not really good is it
blows my mind speaking of the 24 hour
news cycle I was watching the HBO movie
game change have you heard about this
it's basically file it's basically
telling the story of John McCain's his
campaigns oh yeah decision to choose
Sarah Palin as vice probably watch this
I did oh it's pretty good it's pretty
good I don't know how accurate it is I
hope it's not as accurate as it sort of
portrays but man oh man was that a crazy
sir they talked all about the Twitter
and the youtubes and the facebooks and
stuff like that and how that really does
dictate where the momentum shifts in any
sort of political race right real man
I remember when she was first announced
yeah and I went on Facebook and Twitter
and everyone was like she's gonna win
yeah and did that was like that even
knows who she is i remember at that time
for some reason it stood out to me and
everyone was like everyone's just
freaking out because she made that like
lipstick pitbull calm rivals like she's
gonna win which which they're leaking
out with the film claims was add lived
so there's like interesting stories
about that uh what the craziest thing
was like how uh-uh McCain's top advisor
was trying to explain to him how it
doesn't matter what happened three days
ago because the new cycle refresh is a
quick that's only about what just
happened what's about to happen and
that's it and things move so quickly if
you screw up make more news pass it's
like it's like being a playoff team in a
sport if you're hot you're gonna win you
know and that's really how it works it's
very very strange and bizarre um I want
to get out of here we got to end a
little early other shows are coming in
