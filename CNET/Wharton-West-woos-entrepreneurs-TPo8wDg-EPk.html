Pennsylvania's San Francisco campus has
been turning out MBAs for a decade but
in order to attract Silicon Valley's
elite the university is giving itself a
facelift so we're here in the historic
Hills brothers Plaza we are we've just
taken over the space in December so here
we have our dining room which houses
just over 100 of our current students
which we bring in every weekend for the
MBA program for executives and the
curriculum has entrepreneurial
flavorings we do a number of workshops
for entrepreneurs and we draw folks who
have been successful from different
parts of entrepreneurial ventures and
also invite venture capitalists and
folks from private equity and it folks
who have had successful startups into
our space but there are challenges to
deepening your roots in the competitive
valley environment opening on the west
coast Wharton is basically in the
backyard of Stanford and Berkeley which
are sort of the two incumbent MBA brands
at least on the west coast so some of
the challenges that Wharton is facing
and probably face for a you know some
more time around brand image and getting
more people to know about Wharton as a
West Coast Business School Wharton
unlike Stanford offers an Executive MBA
that's designed for working students
with classes occurring on the weekends
with total two year tuition at almost
one hundred and seventy four thousand
dollars the school is banking on the
Wharton brand and the wow factor we have
state-of-the-art technology within the
classroom again using natural light
including our skylights to help balance
the use of energy in the classroom for
students the move from the old location
was a welcome one it's a much bigger
space and there's a lot of open areas
which really facilitates discussions and
faculty members to who fly out from the
east coast campus to teach a wharton
west are betting the b-school can
capture a new wave of MBAs there was
quite an entrepreneurial spirit that's
really picked up and I think one thing
that happened a couple of years ago with
the big collapse and finance is a lot of
those very very good students who might
have gone to a Mackenzie or Goldman
Sachs now are getting more excited about
starting their own companies I'm Sumi
