stand at Mobile World Congress 2013
we're taking a look at the Nokia 105 you
would have a tough time finding a phone
more basic than Nokia's 105 it's got a
1.4 five-inch screen obviously that's
not a touchscreen it's only just a
little bit bigger than my thumbnail if I
hold that over you can see but on the
plus side it's going to be extremely
cheap nokia tells me this phone will
cost not very much over 15 euros so you
really really do not have to splash the
cash to get your hands on this if you
take a look at the top you can see it's
got a flashlight
which is a quite a nice feature though
there is no camera unfortunately it's
got a dust dust proof keys here so
hopefully that should keep out things
like sand if you're headed to the beach
and it comes with a couple of features
namely some pre-loaded games and a
speaking clock it feels very light and I
quite like the colorful stars of this
blue one if that's a little bit too
jazzy for your liking though you can get
it in a more demure black so obviously
this phone is extremely basic but if you
know someone who doesn't really like
using smart phones and really just wants
to send text messages this might be a
good bet to buy them as a fairly cheap
Christmas present you might also want to
pick this up as a cheap second phone if
you're headed for a night out and a
worried about losing your pricey mobile
it's going to be coming out between
April and June on the west way and this
is the Nokia 105</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
