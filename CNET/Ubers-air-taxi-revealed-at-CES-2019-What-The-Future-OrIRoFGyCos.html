Expo Center I'm Ashley sceva and I
forgot my glasses in my hotel room the
only way I could read this teleprompter
but I will take them off now because we
can go to this camera if you follow us
on YouTube you may have seen one of our
newest shows what the future and the
Altman right here host the show and
joins us today for a look at what's
making us say WTF basically what I'm
looking up are those stories and
products that like you look at and you
just say like wow like we're this is the
future's here we're here right now and
it blows your mind right right okay
Andy hit us with it what do you got WTF
all right well if you walk the North
Hall at all this year at CES there's no
way you're gonna miss this this is the
belle Nexus it's a hybrid electric air
taxi this thing is mind-blowing when you
see it it's just a concept right now but
Bell says that this is gonna have a top
speed about a hundred and fifty miles
per hour right Wow that's in the air and
I like a range of about 150 miles seats
for people right now plus the pilot but
the plan is that this is eventually
gonna operate autonomously
so imagine calling your shared ride you
know on your phone this thing comes and
picks you up no pilot it just takes your
destination I love it I want it I'm
gonna have it yeah no awkward
conversation with uber driver perfect
so Bell hopes to start test flights in
2020 and right yeah that's really soon
and the interesting thing is Bell is
actually an aircraft manufacturing
partner of uber right so Dave and uber
has been saying that in the next two
years they want to launch this network
of air taxis flying air taxis which is
also soon so you could be looking right
now this could be a Burres first flying
taxi I mean it's a really cool looking
flying taxi if you're gonna fly in a
flying taxi I'd want to fly away I don't
want to see that often pop up next to go
Brad yeah definitely the uber X option I
want to see the top now obviously
there's a lot of regulatory questions
nobody knows what's gonna be legal
particularly in two years but but that's
the thing that's really turning heads so
far on this show my head
I mean you're at your door blending but
I'm just looking past you right at it
and I'm just like wow I want it that's
so cool
yeah that's amazing okay what do you got
next all right so you know I spent most
of my time at seeing that working on our
social videos so this is the product
that has been blowing up on social media
for us
this is LG's rollable TV now yeah you've
probably seen it we saw this last year
it was a prototype now LG says this
thing is actually ready to go into
market this year it's real happening you
can buy it this year it's real and it's
spectacular it's amazing it's amazing
David Katz Meyer saw it he said it was
one of the coolest TVs he's ever seen
so this is the right right yes tough
critic so this is a 65 inch flexible
OLED screen you can you can see it it
rolls up like a poster which is just
mind-blowing I think that that's that's
amazing that's amazing
it's amazing right so imagine if you're
if you you have this mind-blowing view
in your apartment if you make more money
than I do except I could see that you
have this mind-blowing view this thing
is only got up left review when you're
using the TV perfect right it's amazing
fantastic so LG hasn't said what the
price is gonna be but yeah I matter it's
gonna be pretty expensive you have to
ask but if it's only if you can afford
the view like that you can probably you
can probably afford the TV I agree all
right so the last thing we got if you
head over to BMW set up in the parking
lot you're gonna see cincy something
that's really mine okay okay so this is
I mean just look at that that is BMWs
riderless motorcycle every time I see
that reminded of that terrible Christian
Bale Terminator movie with motorcycles
that it basically it looks like that so
this thing can do pretty much everything
on its own it can stop it can start it
can make turns and you can even operate
the clutch and shift gears as Tim
Stevens said in the tweets the other day
it it will take epic road trips without
you and I have adventures while you're
at home working why do you need a writer
yeah so now this isn't something that
you're gonna be able to buy this isn't
going into production okay these rolling
around having
their own cross-country stories together
obably not and I really I can't think of
a whole lot of use for this for the
consumer the biker they develop this
though to develop better safety systems
and collect the user to collect letter
data to see how how bikes actually
operate right so think features that
like exist already on cars right now
something more safe yeah Lane Assist
automatics making things like that make
sense right yeah so but nothing else
it's just mind-blowing to see I can't
get enough of that video well the future
is certainly here at CES 2019 and we
actually have some guests coming up on
stage to show us one more product that
we're really excited about yes I'm
really excited to see this Jeremy do you
want to join us on stage this is the
Jarvis smart motorcycle helmet and
Jeremy Lou has come on stage to talk
about it thank you so much for joining
us
so these are two different helmets is
that correct
oh yes we are actually on Kickstarter
right now we have two one is a basic
motor and one is it was the SAR that's
it was a head-up display okay so can you
can you tell us a little bit the
difference between those two all right
the one with the head-up display has all
the food integrator a lesser and also of
course okay Google Siri and we have
building more than 30 voice commands
that can respond back to the riders
immediately with the weather is 20 miles
up you could say is like what's the
weather exactly if you want to know the
traffic conditions you can ask ELISA you
cannot syria get out of school go about
it and that's something I mean obviously
you're writing a motorcycle you can't
just pull out your cell phone right and
the most important things in about a
hammer is we have a lot of the sensors
inside and we have our own algorithms
that I can detect whether the riders is
having esident or not right normally
they have these kind of things on the
cell phone but it's not x-ray as like as
the as the accident is happening exactly
right okay okay and go up to a curation
rate up to like 99.9 percent
all right show you not be a false alarm
right what's that
so the rider can feel somewhat safer
exactly exactly they know it's a movi
come to up to safely heads up and heads
up display has a rear view as well has a
rear view so you can trigger my voice
come in has a rear view so the head of a
is retractable you can have the header
display and ask for the rear view camera
by voice command when you need it
hey show me behind the mic yes exactly
Wow and then that's the camera right
there at the bottom of the base of the
helmet yes yes oh wow that's amazing so
can we see me the heads up display in
action can we see that work do we need
that that's super cool did we catch I
don't know if they could see that how
that this flame that's super cool so
it's called Darvish so where do the
names I ever I know I hear that they
keep making Iron Man I keep making
Jarvis right is that right let me tell a
story when we start a company we're ODMs
so we build a tree smart hammers for
European companies and in year 2016 we
were inspired by by a NASA actually we
want to create a space helmet but at the
end we found out that it is almost
impossible to make them facial returns
by selling only a few space hammer to
NASA so we come out a few thoughts in
couple of few thoughts of our ideas into
motorcycles Muhammad because we came
from Taiwan there's a lot of motorcycles
scooters around and this is how the Java
chasse are come from there anything
going forward now that you have these
two helmets what's what's next for Gen 3
that you're hoping to incorporate that
maybe wasn't possible this time around
or maybe that the technology hasn't
quite caught up with what you'd like to
do ultimately we would like to combine
the AR who is the VR but our VR
technology is like a flex film type they
are VR that is it incorporate our under
the chin bar so the riders would not
would
we're not focused too much on the BSI I
rely on the AR for the ten by ten
directions but for the VR it can has a
lot of like a life support indications
on the other side so tell us a little
bit about a few only have time for this
last bit but tell us a little bit about
how people can learn more about Jarvis
and what's what's the cost here how much
am I gonna pay for this I got my
motorcycle I'm ready for an AR head said
what's what about it right now a
Kickstarter campaign so this hammer here
that in Tahoe would cost less than 900
ours is night and our 899 for the entire
helmet okay I have no frame of reference
I don't know what a motorcycle helmet
cost but it doesn't compare and contrast
notes with Tim Stevens who rides bikes
that's the guy so and it's on
Kickstarter you guys are saying since
the campaign is happening right now is
that good exactly as soon we're going to
in Diego going demand awesome well
that's really cool thank you so much for
joining us and telling us about Jarmusch
that was really that was super cool and
love that you guys are doing this thank
you I hope it really helps writers on on
the roads be a little bit safer thank
you so much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
