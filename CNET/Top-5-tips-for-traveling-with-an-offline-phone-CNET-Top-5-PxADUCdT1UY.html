internet connection while traveling here
are the top five tips for traveling with
an offline phone at number five download
video if you've got Amazon Prime did you
know that you can download video to your
iPhone yep it's true if you're paying
for YouTube red you can also save videos
for offline viewing if you watch boudu
or iTunes stuff download away even if
you have Wi-Fi up in the air don't count
on it to be able to handle video
streaming at number four download audio
if you subscribe to a streaming audio
service like Spotify or Apple music make
sure your favorite playlists are
available offline the same tip holds
true for audiobooks and podcasts
download as much as you can don't skimp
on the music though it's really hard to
drown out a crying baby with NPR at
number three get something to read
ebooks are usually tiny files so you can
probably download them while you're
waiting at security for stuff you've
found online that you want to read later
I suggest pockets you can bookmark
things to read and have them available
without an internet connection later at
number two headphones are your friend
I'm not the Mosin guy so I need
headphones to drown out lots of sounds
here's something I've learned over time
carry more than one pair of headphones
maybe one of your favorite pairs and
another that can't lose any parts you
ever pull out a pair of headphones and
find that little plastic tip missing
never do that on a plane I have before
we get to number one here are some bonus
tips put your phone in airplane mode to
see what you can and can't do then
figure out a plan also do your research
on airlines that offer in-flight Wi-Fi
and pricing and that number one have
something for power all the tips we
talked about are worthless if your phone
is dead
invest in a battery pack for long trips
make sure you've got any cables you
might need the longer the cable the
better you never know when you have to
snake a USB cable passenger seat because
the USB port is broken at yours you want
