is a look at the nikon coolpix p5 20 the
company's top full-size mega zoom it's a
42 X zoom lens was once the longest
available when it debuted on the P 510
however canon fuji film and sony now
have 50x zooms in their lineup so if you
must have the longest lens available
this isn't for you that said the 24 -
1000 millimeter zoom is plenty of range
and I doubt you'll be kicking yourself
for not going with another model well
not for the zoom at least the camera
doesn't have some higher-end features
like a hot shoe or mic input or raw
capture and you have to have some
patience when it comes to focusing with
the lens zoomed in also Nikon removed
the button for switching between the
electronic viewfinder and the flip out
LCD so you now have to flip over the
screen and close it to turn on the EVF
if none of those things bug you though
this is a pretty nice camera with a lot
of shooting options and some excellent
photo quality even in low-light as long
as you don't need to enlarge photos to
its full 18 megapixel resolution plus it
has built-in GPS and you can add a Wi-Fi
adapter so you can wirelessly connect to
iOS or Android devices for viewing or
sharing your photos all in all a very
good package if you're looking for more
a point-and-shoot experience than a
digital SLR I'm Josh Goldman and that's
that icon who picks p5 20</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
