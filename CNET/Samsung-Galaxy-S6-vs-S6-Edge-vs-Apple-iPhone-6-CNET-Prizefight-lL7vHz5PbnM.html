and get ready for the Battle of the
sixes it's a prize fight put out between
the Samsung Galaxy s6 the galaxy s6 edge
and the iPhone 6 it's six six six who
the Beast of this battle our judges for
this fight are senior editor Jessica the
people's Delacorte associate editor Lynn
who la la la you know who really a big
tome will take all three judges scores
and average them out to the nearest
tenth each round the final prize fight
score will be an average of all rounds
using the same system let's get it on
round one is design
taking a page from Apple Samsung brings
their first-ever all metal and glass
body and the result is the best-looking
galaxy phone we've ever seen that six
edge takes it one step further with a
screen that goes to the edges it's new
curves create some glitters that might
be distracting it's sharper on the edges
but it's also easier to grip the iPhone
6 is still the sleekest of the bunch
with the tightest design you'll find on
a phone but it's aluminum surface makes
it a lot more slippery to hold without a
case we're giving the galaxy s6 and the
iPhone 6 a 4.5 but the edge stands out
with a 4.8 and a design we've never seen
and we love it next round is navigation
user interface
less TouchWiz is more when it comes to
the new Galaxy s6 and s6 edge the
overall OS design is cleaner and flatter
you'll see more of the material design
influences when you're flipping through
apps and you'll still get the same level
of Android customization and settings
it's the best TouchWiz to date but they
can still do more to tone it down and
let's not forget about double tapping
the home button to get to the camera in
addition the s6 edge gives you quick
access to your favorite contacts with a
swipe and notifications on the edge but
that's about it now iOS is still the
easiest to pick up and play and that
can't be understated it has the flattest
and simplest look between the phones and
if you're in the ecosystem it's seamless
this one comes down to the user and its
features versus simplicity but all
phones end up in a three-way tie at four
point two points of peace round three is
features the s6 and s6 edge are packed
with everything from a new fingerprint
scanner that's more reliable a
higher-end 64-bit Exynos octa-core
processor a larger 5.1 inch screen with
a higher resolution and Samsung pay will
handle mobile payments in the future yes
they've sacrificed a removable battery
and expandable memory for their best
designed phone to date that also has
wireless charging software features like
Google now split screen mode and
gestures now the edge adds a few more
functions on top of all this and clearly
these phones are stacked now we'll wait
and see what Apple does next but from a
feature and hardware standpoint it's no
chump but other than Apple pay which has
been the most successful mobile payment
platform to date
it pretty much trails behind the new
Galaxy s6 the iPhone gets a 4.2 the
galaxy s6 gets a 4.5 and the s6 edge
gets a little more with a 4.7 chapter
averaging three rounds it's the edge
with the lead
for his camera cameras count when it
comes to phones in the s6 and s6 edge
both bring a 16 megapixel rear camera
with optical image stabilization and 4k
video capture
you also get shooting modes galore but
the proof is in the pudding and the s6
and s6 edge took pictures that were
sharper and had a little more pop with
vibrant colors that weren't
oversaturated now the iPhones 8
megapixel rear camera still can't be
beat for its color accuracy and white
balance we like its easy interface for
switching between modes and it also
performs better in low light and night
shots but when you look at both of the
results side by side we prefer the
images of the galaxy s6 and s6 edge and
the iPhones 1.2 megapixel front-facing
camera can't even compete with the
galaxy's 5 megapixel wide-angle lens
s6 and s6 edge both get a 4.8 and the
iPhone 6 gets a 4.5 next round is for
both of these phones are snappy
performers and we didn't see any major
issues the real difference maker here is
battery life based on our scene a
battery video drain test and the s6
clocked in at a respectable twelve point
four hours the edge kicks it up a notch
with a 13 and a half battery life while
the iPhone 6 came in at a good but not
great ten point six hours of juice the
s6 edge takes this round with the 4.3
and the final round that decides it all
is valued
the entry-level 32gig Galaxy s6 is
pretty much the same price as the 16 gig
iPhone 6 at $1.99 with a two-year
contract buying it off contract could
cost more or less depending on carrier
now the s6 edge is asking for a higher
price at $100 more but you'll need to
decide if it's worth that much we lean
towards not really now the one big thing
the iPhone 6 has going for it is it's
ridiculous resale value that holds
overtime and makes it a worthy
investment so we're giving both the S 6
and the iPhone 6 a 4.5 and the s6 edge
gets a 4 so let's average out all six
rounds and in a triple threat match like
this it's clear the iPhone 6 is still
worthy but it's now behind the first
great phone of 2015 with the galaxy s6
and s6 edge the iPhone gets a 4.3 the
epic gets a 4.5 and the s6 edge also
gets up 4.5 but we're not leaving
without a winner and when we break it
down to hundreds of a point the s6 edge
lives up to its name and just edges out
the s6 for point four six to four point
four five and is your prize fight winner
I Bryant on thanks for watching I will
catch you all next time for another
prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
