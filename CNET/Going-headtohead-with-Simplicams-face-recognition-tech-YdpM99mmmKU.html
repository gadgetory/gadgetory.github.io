appliances here with an updated review
of the arcsoft simply cam now when i
first reviewed this one hundred and
fifty dollar security camera i really
liked it it has to a talk night vision
720p 107 degree field of view a lot of
good stuff but i didn't receive email
alerts and the setup was a little bit
wonky it took a lot longer than it
should have basically but they are now
back with a software app update that has
improved some of those things the setup
is now simpler and i received email and
push alerts so that's the good news the
other thing they added is face
recognition so this is really a new
thing for the DIY security camera field
setting up facial recognition is really
simple basically you just plop down in
front of the camera and the app guide
you through the process the whole thing
takes just a couple of minutes so once
you've scanned in your friends family
members dog walker anyone who will be
coming into your house who you expect to
come into your house you can set custom
alert so if you don't want to see
footage of yourself or your kids walking
around in from the camera you can do
that but if you do want footage of your
house cleaner or your dog walker you can
set that too but then if it detects an
unrecognized face that's something that
wasn't scanned into the system you can
obviously set that to send you an alert
right away to find out if it was a
burglar or someone else that you didn't
expect to see the problem is that it is
in beta form right now and it doesn't
work all that well now sometimes it will
get it right but other times it'll say
that I'm an unrecognized face even
though I'm skin into the system now I
scan myself and three other folks from
the office into the system and it got it
right sometimes and got it wrong some
other time so I wouldn't rely on this
one hundred percent if you want to
identify an unrecognized person but it
is still in beta form and simply cam
actually encourages people to provide
feedback so they can
the system which is the good news thank
you for checking out this updated video
review of the arc sauce simply can be
sure to check out the rest of our
coverage on cnet com and I am mega
willerton forcing them apart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
