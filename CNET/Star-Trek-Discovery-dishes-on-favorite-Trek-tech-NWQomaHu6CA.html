would you do it do you think it is
transporter technology right I mean I
think that that stuff there is a little
bit the holy grail of the next iteration
of how the world changes with technology
or an iteration that would be
extraordinaire alene paradigm shifting
if there was no travel time and we
started the original Star Trek and its
other shows have been so influential on
actual tech what you think is next what
what do you actually think we'll see
inspire from Star Trek I think that what
we're looking to next in it you know and
I think it's actually interestingly
enough if you were to find its etiology
and Star Trek it would be the Borg in
the next generation I think that the
ability to sort of download information
without connectivity but directly into
our brain feels like it's not that far
off I also think that there's a
component of transporter technology
which is the idea of storage of hand
grams you know and I think the idea that
if we stored I think we're getting the
place where maybe we can store what we
think of as the mind of the soul so I
think that it's about information
exchange storage and handing off well I
really I've always liked the holodecks
um I just think it's it's it's the
possibilities are endless and
I love that it's it's you get to kind of
choose your adventure but also that
there's it feels like a real risk
involved I love that there's a real
visceral quality to it and it's not just
a visual sensation so if you had access
to a holodeck today what would you do
with them I think I would you know what
I think I would do I've always wanted to
you know take trips around the world but
I think I would probably get a sampling
of a lot of different places and see
which one's in the holodeck I liked and
then I'm like okay so I really want to
spend a month here that's my that's my
but that way I could save money and then
just go to the places I know I really
respond to for me I'm a big foodie I'd
have to have the replicator that makes
whatever food you want whenever you want
it I mean us I think that's the most
exciting one probably a curry like my
auntie's curry I love I'll have a good
old-fashioned Indian curry like
Pakistani style Indian style you know
rich spicy I really love a transporter
pad that'd be pretty spectacular I mean
it's a very tough question to answer
because you kind of want all of it to be
able to be anywhere you want that bass
would be pretty incredible you had that
teleporter pad now where would you go
Wow
I just like to not sit in traffic to be
honest with you oh well I think my
answer was the transporter right because
I mean he doesn't want to just be more
were to Paris because you need a
croissant or something you know what I
mean but you know just the idea of for
instance this is here's a good example I
was supposed to be getting an award in
Los Angeles this evening and it would
have been nice to like beam over there
and make an acceptance speech as opposed
to the video that I put out just gave
them so that would have been good yeah I
mean I think that the tricorder is
really interesting and apparently they
actually are developing something that's
pretty close to it that there was some
kind of breakthrough recently I don't
know exactly what it can scan but the
fact that you could go boo boo do you do
voodoo and like find out all sorts of
information about your environment or
things or people around you or yourself
if you had like some ailment like
something going on you could just go
doo-doo-doo-doo at home and find
something out I think that could have
been credit
oh there is no question like that I'm
pretty sure everybody would like to be
beaming places here and that's what else
is them
okay there's a famous question people
they ask people would you rather fly or
be invisible and they flying it's much
more beneficial to everybody else but
people really want to be invisible so
they can steal things mostly that's what
servation Star Trek has been influential
on technology for decades now what's
next what do you sort of see from your
show from past Star Trek series and from
the tech that we have today what do you
see coming in the future well I'm hoping
that we have a breakthrough of zinc in
carbon field technology because I'd like
to be a plan of my children I'm hoping
all it could be selfish level that we
have some kind of battery technology
allows this thing to last longer than a
day without charging it and fuel cell
technology hoping that we can find some
technological way to reverse the danger
of e/m use because I'm surrounded by the
isleep surrounded by cables and charges
I walk around with new drives and I know
that there's all kinds of things that
it's doing to cellular change that it
evokes around it and I've just decided
to take that on anyway I'm hoping that
we can find somewhere to camp</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
