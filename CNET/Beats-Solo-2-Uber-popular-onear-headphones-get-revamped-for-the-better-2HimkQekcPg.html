finally has a successor to its goober
popular on your headphone and this is it
the solo - like the original this new
improved model costs 100 99 98 comes in
a variety of colors hi I'm David Carr
Noy and I'm going to give you the quick
skinny on the solo - which not
surprisingly looks a lot like a mini
version of Beats revamped over the year
studio headphone for starters the ear
pads have been redesigned with swankier
materials that make the headphones more
comfortable to wear
and those pads offer a little bit
tighter seal to prevent both sound
leakage and sound seepage like the new
studios the solo 2's are built more
sturdily and have no visible screws and
the curve of the headband has been
changed to deliver a snuggler more
ergonomic fit the headphones fold up but
not flat and come with a carrying case
and a detachable cord with an inline
remote and microphone for making cell
phone calls these do not have the active
noise cancellation of the step up studio
and studio wireless models I personally
wasn't a fan of the original soles and
thought they were overpriced and lacked
clarity but the good news here is like
with the new studios beats is tamp down
the bass a bit and gone with a more
accurate sound profile with better
detail the solo twos don't offer quite
the fullness of the largest studios but
they're definitely more pleasant to
listen to and sound significantly better
than the originals at $2 the Sola 2 is
still a bit expensive but at least its
sound is more in line with a headphone
that costs over $1 rather than one that
costs less than 75 I'm David Carr noise
and that's the beats solo2 on your
headphone thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
