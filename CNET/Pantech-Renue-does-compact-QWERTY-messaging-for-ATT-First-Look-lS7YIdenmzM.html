qwerty keyboard this is the pantech
renue for AT&amp;amp;T it's a new messaging
phone it'll cost you 69 99 with a new
two-year service agreement now this may
sound a little steep if you're used to
the highly subsidized android phones but
let me tell you this is actually a
pretty good price for a messaging phone
like this it has a 3.2 inch touchscreen
to go along with the QWERTY keyboard
might seem a little bit small but
actually pantech has done a really good
job making this finger friendly so
you've got five home screens here
they're only semi customizable that
means that pantech has decided that
one's going to be for bookmarks one's
going to be for contacts etc and then
you can customize within that framework
and you can also add some shortcuts and
rearrange the icons to your liking the
keyboard is on the compact side which I
personally like because it fits my hand
the buttons on the keypad are oblong
they've got this nice bright blue accent
the flatness gets in the way of my
typing slows me down a little bit I
think that I would be able to adapt over
time I just think that the keys could be
a little bit better there's a 3
megapixel camera and camcorder on the
back no flash pictures are not very good
and video is even worse it may be a
feature phone but there's a lot that you
can do on here for example you can text
you can update facebook and twitter you
can send email there's also AT&amp;amp;T
Navigator on here so you can get
turn-by-turn directions you should know
that this is a 3g phone so it will take
a little bit longer to load your stuff
up the last thing that 18t would want
you to know is that the renew is
actually certified eco-friendly so you
get some bonus
I'm Jessica doll court for CNN this is
the pantech renue for AT&amp;amp;T you can read
