last August and I gave it high marks for
having an easy to open case replaceable
battery and a decent internal hardware
layout but I disliked acer's overuse of
what appeared to be kept on tape and the
fact that the LCD and front panel were
difficult if not impossible to separate
now eight months later Acer is back with
an updated model the Iconia Tab a 5-10
how will it compare let's open it up and
find out I'm Bill Detweiler and this is
cracking open
unfortunately removing the a 510 s outer
shell is a bit more difficult than
removing the a 500 s first you'll need
to pop off the thin plastic strips that
run along the tablets sides and then
remove the screws hidden underneath then
using a thin tool release the catches
that hold the case to the front panel
assembly once you've gone all the way
around the case you can lift the front
panel up and out but not completely off
you'll need to disconnect the front
panel from a small circuit board that's
connected to the external microphone and
microUSB port with the front panel
assembly in case separated we get our
first look at the a 510 s internal
hardware and a few things jump right out
both good bad and interesting first the
good the a 510 has a big battery at 9800
milliamp hours it has more capacity than
the battery on the Samsung Galaxy Tab
10.1 but less than a 2012 iPads power
unit according to CNN's tests the a 5
tens battery delivered over 11 hours of
video playback which at this point meets
every other tablet except you guessed it
the iPad I also liked that much of the
internal hardware such as the speaker's
battery cameras and motherboard are
separate components this means you can
replace each part individually so what
don't I like about the a5 10 well for
starters Acer continues to cover most of
the internal connections with what looks
like to be kept on tape now while this
translucent film can both insulate the
connection and help hold the wires in
place there are plenty of PC
and connector designs that don't require
its use and it makes removing and
replacing the components a bit more
difficult than it really needs to be I
also found it frustrating that you can't
remove some components without first
removing another unrelated piece of
hardware for example you must remove the
speakers and volume power buttons
circuit board before removing the
battery
lastly the LCD screen is permanently
joined to the front panel with what
appears to be a form of thermoplastics
taking this process eliminates the need
for screws but makes it nearly
impossible to replace one without
replacing the other and for the
interesting Acer is clearly using the
same case for both the Wi-Fi only a 510
and the 3G enabled a 511 there's a space
inside the a five tens case for a
separate cellular card and an empty spot
on the motherboard for a SIM card slot
aside from my complaints about its
internal design the a 510 is a good
tablet with decent hardware it has a 1.3
gigahertz quad-core NVIDIA Tegra 3
processor 32 gigs of storage and one gig
of ram although it's ddr2 instead of the
faster ddr3 and its external design may
not be super slick or ultra thin but as
CNN's Eric Franklin wrote it's one of
the most comfortable tablets he's ever
held I only wish that Acer had made it
just as comfortable to crack open and
repair and a c-more teardown photos
