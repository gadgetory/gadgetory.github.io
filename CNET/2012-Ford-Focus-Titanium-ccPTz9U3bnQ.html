this focus the one the rest of the world
has liked for a long time let's drive
the 2012 Ford Focus titanium 5 door and
check the tech hot on the heels of the
new Ford Fiesta which also had some
imagery writing to do
this new focus moves forward solidly in
the category of cool small car maker
from just about every angle our
five-door or hatchback focus looks tight
I'm a little less complimentary about
the doughty er sedan
now the first thing I think most people
are going to notice about a focus
especially this titanium high trim is a
really nice cabin this is not usually
what you get in a low $20,000 to even
mid-teens thousand dollar car I've got
two LCDs a little one there and a big
one here let's talk about them this one
on the left is going to give you vehicle
information fairly simple on a focus
when you're under navigation that gets
subdivided two-thirds one-third and the
right-hand third also gives you
navigation prompts now the big guy here
again we've got a fully loaded focus so
we have the LCD with MyFord Touch the
bad news my Ford touch hasn't improved I
don't think any since we last first saw
it and didn't like it it's too
complicated there are too many little
fiddly regions to touch and it's too
slow to react upper-left is where you
find communications I've got my phone
paired for calls upper right the green
region is navigation lower left is
entertainment
am/fm as well as HD Radio fall over
Sirius is your satellite single slot for
CD USB F down here in the console you've
also got the SD card and your a/v inputs
down here
two USB slots here one of these can be
your media player the other one could be
a USB Wi-Fi dongle to get this guy
online you do have voice command over
here of course navigation navigation
street address street address
say destination street address death
destination street address in california
san street address including the city 3
0 0 0 Woodside Road Woodside when ready
press the voice button and then say set
is destination set is destination
setting destination start route sorry
there's no route active yeah there is
it's right here on the screen I gotta
hit that button right there so I want
you to see a couple things there first
of all I had to get very specific I had
to say destination street address when
there was a choice on the screen that
just said street address secondly
there's way too many times when I've got
to say set destination then start
navigation just get going and do it now
we have 2 levels of other information as
if this isn't enough so far sync
services and serious travel link sync
services are connected through your
phone you get all those sorts of stuff
here are what traffic report read to you
you can hear personalized news updates
and such then you've got serious travel
link which is coming down from the bird
and has a lot of similar information now
one choice on gearbox for a Focus
titanium anyways a 6-speed automatic
it's not an automatic it's a dual clutch
automated manual they call it a power
shift in Ford terminology you have a
drive and a sport location on the gate
no slapstick and no paddles on the wheel
you have a rocker on the side of the
handle instead for shift
okay let's check this automatic parking
stuff enabled the button right there
and I'm just gonna mosey along here
looking for parking spots on the right
this vehicle does not look for parking
on the left and as I creep along it'll
find one okay it says pull forward a
little bit and now it says stop I stick
in Reverse hands off the wheel and look
at this no hands that's pretty slick I'm
parking no wrong it's parking I'm
watching the rear cam to make sure I
lock his scooter over when I put it in
Drive look at this it turns the wheel to
do the nip and tuck for me and when I'm
done I put her in park that's pretty
slick okay now feeding power into that
gearbox is this guy a one choice only
two litre inline-four sitting sidesaddle
up here it's got direct injection no
turbos but direct injection has pretty
advanced technology 160 horse 146
foot-pounds of torque you know no one's
gonna write home about that zero to
sixty and eight point seven seconds
respectable 28 38 mpg
those are nice numbers and if you get
one of these foes I in the sfe
configuration that highway member goes
all the way up to 40
now the first thing you noticed in the
focus is the handling is really nice
it's taught without being harsh it's
light and nimble without feeling like a
flyweight they're done a really good job
dialing in this car getting rid of all
the noise vibration and harshness the so
called NVH without it feeling like a
snare drum which is way too often the
way automakers go with small cars now
the other thing you notice right away is
the engine is adequate but not
delightful it's not a slug but it's also
just kind of not gutsy enough what saves
you in many cases is this transmission
put this guy in sport mode and it's a
damn mind reader it shifts exactly the
way I would if I had a manual gearbox it
does really intelligent down shifts in
urban traffic that's kind of a tough one
for a transmission to do but it does
that well and all in all I'm looking at
30 point to total mpg after three days
and I think about two hundred and twenty
miles of driving in varied terrain city
highway up and over mountain passes this
car does really well it really delivers
in real-world mpg okay let's price our
little European flavored friend this
2012 Ford Focus titanium the top trim is
23 v that includes destination by the
way if you want to say 500 on that get
the sedan the hatchback is 500 more to
my eye it's $500 worth of good looking
795 for navigation you have the screen
but to have nav you got to buy that SD
card from Ford that goes in the console
695 for that slick parking package and
that's it you're rolling see next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
