behind me is the largest TV I've seen at
the show and probably the largest TV at
the show this is the 120 inch vizio
rs120 vizio is calling it a reference
series their further saying it's the
best TV ever made the specs back up that
claim pretty strongly it's a full array
LED local dimming television and before
you dismiss it because it's not OLED or
plasma or something like that that has a
better reputation know that some of the
best performing LED TVs that use local
dimming technology I've been doing the
best TVs we have ever seen this TV has
384 zones a local dimming that allows
the blacks to get really deep and the
whites to get really bright Vizio is
saying there's 800 nits of brightness
which is extremely bright brighter than
any TV I've seen cited it also uses
Dolby's HDR algorithm which we've seen
demonstrated in the past is the first TV
we know about to use that technology
that extends the dynamic range
intelligently instead of just along a
linear path to make those brights look
really natural and the darks again look
extremely black for a picture that at
least from what I've seen looks
extremely good this TV also has the
widest color range I've seen cited
anywhere it's really close to the REC
2020 standard which is supposedly going
to be used for next generation 4k
content Vizio claims of TV has an 1800
clear action rate which can translate to
very little blurring the set also will
accept a 48 frame per second signal
which is similar to what was used on the
HDR theatrical versions of The Hobbit
Vizio uses a new technology to actually
match the cadence of 24 frame and even
48 frame content to more faithfully
reproduce it there's also for all your
gamers out there 120 frames per second
input capability as well as a really low
latency so this TV is one of the
best-looking gaming TVs at least on
paper first of all that extra picture
technology Vizio does throw in some
sound extras to the bottom of the TV
here is actually a sound bar there's
also a separate subwoofer and Wireless
rear speakers included so all told it
should have some of the best sound we've
ever seen on a TV of course if you can
afford this model you're probably gonna
opt for the external sound system of
your own choice the set also has a
machine metal bass and really slick
understated styling all told the specs
of this TV are some of the best I've
ever seen anywhere and I'm really
excited to check out what Vizio can do
the RS reference series is available in
110
and a more manageable 65 inch size Vizio
has yet to announce pricing although
it's going to be stratospheric and they
do say they'll be shipping this year I'm
David Katz Meyer from CNET with what
Vizio claims is the best TV ever made
the RS one point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
