I'm Bridget Carey and this is your scene
at updates goodbyes SkyDrive Microsoft's
personal cloud storage service has been
officially relaunched as onedrive there
was a legal battle over the original
name so now it's called onedrive
there's Xbox one OneNote I think
Microsoft has a thing for the number one
the service lets you store files online
so you can access documents from any
computer the revamped onedrive apps for
iOS Android and Windows Phone can now
automatically save the photos and videos
you take to onedrive it's a decent
backup system onedrive offers 10 gigs of
free storage when you use the apps
camera backup feature Google Drive
offers 15 gigs for free the LinkedIn
network is about connecting with people
you know to grow your career but soon
strangers will be able to follow your
work
LinkedIn is rolling out its blog
publishing tool to everyone and people
you don't know can follow your blog
posts back in 2012 LinkedIn only allowed
certain people to write blogs calling
them influencers like Richard Branson
Martha Stewart and Bill Gates HTC will
reveal its next flagship smartphone on
March 25th but we may already know what
it'll look like master tech news leaker
EV leaks posted this photo which is said
to be the new HTC one model in the color
gold as you can also tell from the image
there are two cameras on the back why
would a phone need two back cameras
well I'm sure HTC will come up with some
cool sounding reason the current HTC One
the one with just one rear camera was
praised by reviewers but it lost in
sales against the more popular galaxy s4
since HTC couldn't match the marketing
power of samsung painting your phone
gold tho and throwing in a third camera
is one way to cry for attention nokia
just announced a new type of mobile
accessory to help you keep track of your
valuables it's the Nokia treasure tag
and it talks to Lumia phones and tablets
using NFC or Bluetooth you attach the
tag to your keys your briefcase maybe
stick it in your wallet and if the tag
is too
away from the phone it'll sound an alarm
and if it's really lost it can pull up a
map that shows where the tag is located
it'll come out in April for 30 dollars
and you'll be hearing quite a bit of
mobile news in the coming days as the
big Mobile World Congress show kicks off
next week in Barcelona the biggest news
will likely come from Samsung it's
expected to show off the Galaxy s5
that's your tech news update for more
details and links to these stories you
