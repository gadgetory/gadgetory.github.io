Aya's Akhtar you might not know this but
I'm a huge video nerd I used to make
videos all the time with my dad's cam
course I've shot and edited footage at
trade shows as a one-man video team
historic nowadays you can make one of
these your camera of choice if you
wanted today we're gonna count down the
top five accessories you need to make
your phone into a movie making machine
let's get to it
and number five more lenses camera
lenses are very important to create
different moods in the movies if you've
got a phone you've got one lens welcome
to if you count the front facing camera
these days you can find Universal lens
kits that clamp onto your phone to take
macro shots wide-angle shots and fisheye
shots iPhone users are at an advantage
because there are a lot of lens adapters
out there including this Kickstarter
lets you pop in your iPhone 6 as if it
was a cartridge number for a tripod
adapter a tripod adapter is incredibly
useful if you plan on making video with
your phone for the most part phones are
rectangular slabs and don't attach well
to other things a tripod adapter lets
you attach your phone to you guessed it
a tripod or like a video stabilizer
anything that would normally hold a
camera on top of that many tripod
adapters are adjustable so when you
change phones you're not stuck with the
useless adapter nothing ruins a good
flick like unintentionally shaky video
so invest in a tripod adapter number
three a battery pack depending on what
you're shooting you're probably going to
need a lot of battery life it doesn't
matter what else your rig has if you
don't have power you're not recording
anything Apple is famous words phones
being sealed up and samsung s6 is pala
tute both have excellent cameras so if
you're looking to use them for shooting
video it's time to invest in a battery
pack I'm a fan of USB battery packs they
can power a number of devices since
they're more versatile than proprietary
solutions and number two camera apps you
can get a lot out of the camera on your
phone with the right app on iOS check
out filmic Pro it gives the shooter full
control of things like focus shutter
speed ISO and exposure on the Android
side there's cinema fb5 with similar
controls both are paid apps by the way
eight bucks for the iOS version five
bucks on the Android version but having
control over what's recorded that's
priceless before we get to number one
you know how about an honorable mention
for duct tape because you can pretty
much do anything you want you need to
make a custom mount you don't have a
shoe doesn't matter duct tape but your
phone might be a
little bit gunky if you don't in the
right case on it and the number one
accessory you should have if you want to
shoot video on a phone it's an audio
adapter particularly a mini jack to XLR
adapter why a beautifully shot video at
a steady well-lit and while active it's
unwatchable with that audio if you're
serious about making video you need to
have good audio an XLR adapter lets you
use great microphones with your phone so
you're not stuck with that built-in
little dinky microphone there you go
you've turned your phone into a movie
making machine if you've got suggestions
let us know on youtube or on twitter on
that is you want more top fives like

watching
