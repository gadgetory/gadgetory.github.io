of the smallest things you can connect
to your TV but as big appeal to users of
services like Netflix Amazon video who
sling TV HBO Go and all the rest the old
purple stick was one of our favorite
streamers for the money and we love that
it can tuck behind your TV out of sight
the new slimmer black one is the same
price 50 bucks in the US the biggest
improvement the new version is speed
roku says the new stick has eight times
the processing power of the old one and
on our hands-on demo that certainly
seemed like the case the old stick is
relatively sluggish to load apps and
populate thumbnails particularly on
complex apps like sling TV but the new
one flies through and felt just as fast
as any of the Roku boxes to me it also
powers up faster which is important if
you want to eliminate the power cord by
using your TV's USB port Roku has also
improved the Wi-Fi connectivity of
course you'll still need a decent Wi-Fi
network at home to use it since unlike
Roku's boxes it doesn't have an Ethernet
port the other big new feature is the
ability to listen privately by your
phone or tablet
tap the headphone icon and Roku's app
and the sound is transferred to your
headphones and your TV mutes allowing
you to watch TV at night without
disturbing others for example for now
that feature is exclusive to the new
stick although some Roku remote saw fur
headphone jacks with their own - unlike
the $35 chromecast the new Roku stick
includes its own simple remote and
doesn't require your phone to use Roku
also showed off a new feature that shows
its most popular TV shows and movies
across all 30 of the services at
searches it seems like a cool way to
find something new without having to
explore each app individually Roku is
our favorite streaming platform at the
best selection of apps and interface
that doesn't prioritize one source like
Amazon video or Google Play movies &amp;amp; TV
over any other as the best search and
full customization so you can surface
the apps you use most just like on your
phone if that new stick delivers that
great experience with lightning speed
for just 50 bucks it could once again be
my favorite beating out the chromecast
fire TVs and Apple TVs in the world it's
coming later this month and we'll have a
full review soon I'm David Katz my
