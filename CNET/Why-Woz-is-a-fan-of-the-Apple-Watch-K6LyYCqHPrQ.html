iPhone what big changes would you really
like to see in it right now
all the phones are pretty good all the
smartphones are pretty good and it's so
hard to come up with what's a new idea
that nobody else has thought of you
might come up with some dinky feature
like you know I like I like the fact
that okay I'm a Samsung phone you can
say smile click it takes a picture from
your voice that's that's that's cute but
cheesy but that's not the sort of thing
that makes a whole new product I think
keeping the market with good products
only keeping everyone satisfied knowing
that they've there's so much attention
being put into their experience is is is
all I can really think of I don't think
we're going to get down to everything
you do on a phones gonna be in a watch
cars
we're roughly the same size and purpose
and build four wheels and a chassis for
a hundred years so it might be that the
device that fits in your hand all sorts
of different sizes like cars will be
that'll be the the dominant technology
for a long time the Apple watch I need
it does so much beneficial stuff for me
a lot of people talk about I don't
really need a watch it doesn't really
give me anything more than I have with
my phone this thing saves my life so
many times phone call comes in that I
don't want it's just a number nobody I
know hanging up right here on the watch
notifications come buzz me I know it's
happening I asked the question of the
world I can get the weather and I can
even navigate with the watch on its own
it actually talks to you and it beeps on
it buzzes your arm to tell you when to
turn I use Apple pay most convenient
payment system I've ever found right on
the watch don't have to pull anything
out of my pocket not a wallet not not
hash not a phone just pay right here and
and for boarding passes it's convenient
oh no this and movie tickets oh I tell
you once it gets into your life yeah you
find out it's as versatile as a computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
