Prix race weekend each team has two cars
out on track we know that but also a
third driver back at the factory
simulating every session
so bloody strong ambitious unbelievable
if you're an f1 fan like me you probably
have one of these a steering wheel and
pedals attached to an f1 game and you
buy it because you think it's realistic
you can race every track with every team
and sometimes it even rains but this
simulation is it a very basic level
because this is an f1 spec simulator
simulators in motorsport began life in
the aeronautical industry and developed
from fast jet trainers about 15 years
ago the technology easy being developed
into driver training with demands on
restrictions and testing even tighter
now and computers getting ever faster
simulators today are said to be as real
life as possible so much so I've even
bought a race boots the realism comes
from accurately simulating all the
senses you would feel from driving a
race car visually seeing breaking points
and cues and a pectus and stuff like
that that we have a audibly hearing the
gear changes hearing the braking look up
and hearing your engineer talking your
ear as well and then physically comes in
two different forms here on X car we
talk a lot about driving from the seat
of your pants and the feel you get from
the cars that we drive a lot of the
sensations and the things we like about
cars or what we feel firstly the force
feedback through the steering wheel no
power steering on this particular
machine and therefore the steering is
constantly trying to rip out of my hands
the brakes incredibly hard like it
expected a formula 1.com no servo on
those and also the clock every time I
change up a gear the whole chassis
moving around as you'd expect from any
gearbox in a high-powered race car as I
turn through this right-hander in a race
car my body will be squashed to the left
hand side the car but without actual G
this simulator exerts pressure onto my
left side of the body confusing my brain
into thinking I've got G Falls there are
nine pads all over the car
simultaneously working and because they
are pneumatically controlled they can
sustain the force therefore accurately
replicating g-force this is a proper
workout
more similar to aeronautical stimulators
the whole rig is suspended by hydraulic
rams these ads the pitch and roll
sensation to the suspension and
attacking curbs from a real car all of
this does a fantastic job of making me
feel like I'm actually in a full-on car
there is no doubt this is the most
realistic simulator I've ever driven but
how can it be used to develop drivers
improving technique and also improving
the car dan jackson is my make-believe
race engineer for the afternoon he'll be
monitoring the carcel emma tree is like
complete one full lap of the circuit see
how I measure up
the old 2007 circuit in Bahrain has got
a very Mickey Mouse section in the
middle of it hofer can get around
without crashing
a great way to early they're too slow
it's like Max feel the rear of the car
sliding around a kelly haven't got the
same temperature of the tides and I
wanted
one corner left one big breaking so
let's demain get this right back down
down down yeah I can suddenly feel the
car working now got the tires and brakes
up the temperature on the very last
corner and that's a laugh dan you
believe it's lunchy whatever been doing
wrong there's a couple of things really
the first thing is you're not putting
the brake pedal to four hundred percent
for I told you I can do a hundred kilos
and the second thing really is you're
not you're not confident enough under
break and say you need to be able to
push the brakes want and as the car
sales them to lead off the rate whereas
what you're doing learning if you have
put in the braids coming off the blades
going back on the race to sort of you're
not really getting that smoothie entry
to the corner you need one application
of the brakes and bleed off with you so
down and then one smooth application of
the swap lives left at the corner I
think that's the brutality of this
shaking me up and not being able to
really think about being smooth all the
input I'll try and put that and protest
with this next run as if we beat my time
wha fighter
I've got to that level now where I'm
psyched to really feel the setup of the
car and actually trying to attack the
rear seems to be very loose down how can
we make the car feel better okay so what
we'll do is we're going to add a quicker
rear wing and will soften up the
anti-roll bar over there and as well
Matt should then stabilize the rear end
and in theory even though on this
simulator I should have to feel that
when I'm driving
how they accelerate out the corn I got
to feel the car trying to rotate on me
I'm not that much better than last time
just one simple change completely
transform the way the car handled and f1
teams and those third drivers back at
the factories can use that to recommend
changes to the race drivers at the
circuit finding that sweet spot much
much faster and therefore hopefully
having a more successful weekend
technology has come on so far that the
real and simulated worlds are now truly
being amalgamated and it got me thinking
the champions of yesteryear came from
karting honed their craft pounding
around the world in expensive go-karts I
wonder whether the champions of tomorrow
will come from the simulated world from
the casual gaming community asked red
bull junior yanmar dobrze who three
years ago was playing gran turismo on
his bed and he'll tell you the future is
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
