holiday season cnet is here to help our
annual holiday gift guide collects the
best products with the widest range of
prices for every budget but to cut to
the chase this top 5 will reveal seeing
as top gift picks for the holidays and
since they're all pretty much equally
amazing I sorted these roughly in order
of the popularity of their product
category starting off at number 5 the
Microsoft Xbox one while the sony ps4
gamers have been waiting a long time for
these new consoles the Xbox one is the
more expensive of the two but it is
making its debut with more high-profile
games time will tell which one of these
is going to win the war for our living
room but if you want to kill our new
system and the games to go with it the
Xbox one is the one HDTV comes in at
number 4 the panasonic tc-p st60 editors
choice and one of the last plasma TVs we
might ever see from Panasonic underneath
all the LED LCD hype and the looming
monster of 4k TVs that no one needs
plasma is still the best option when it
comes to picture quality image contrast
and value you're still living with a
small sad little TV I would jump on this
one before it disappears at number 3
apple macbook air 13-inch sad to say but
even after the explosion of Windows 8
laptops and hybrids this year the
macbook air is still our go-to machine
for most users it's beautiful light fast
easy to fall in love with and there's
also one of the toughest laptops to ever
survive are always on torture test
speaking of Apple a tablet comes in at
number two the apple ipad mini that's
right the mini now updated with the
retina display yeah the ipad air is
great but most people already know what
that size of ipad is all about sure that
ipad air is lighter now but it's still
not as light as the ipad mini it's great
for reading great for traveling perfect
for kids and a hundred dollars less than
the ipad air
and that's where the apple love ends
will top off this list with our top
smartphone pic and for us that's the
samsung galaxy s4 everybody loves this
phone it's on every carrier the screen
is beautiful takes great pictures and
it's very fast now that we keep our
smartphones on us all day every day
upgrade like this is something that
makes a big impact so there you go five
of the hottest products from our scene
at Holiday Gift Guide you can find the
whole thing over at holiday cnet com or
more top 5s for me including the best
gifts under a hundred dollars top 5 cnet
