intersection of livable and super cars
is there something more than 12 volts
coming to your next car and top five car
technologies we need Apple and Google to
fix it's time to check the tech PC cars
differently we love them on the road and
under the hood but also check the tech
and are known for telling it like it is
ugly is included at no extra cost the
good the bad the bottom line this is C
net on cars
welcome to C net on cars the show all
about high tech cars and modern driving
i'm brian coulis when i mention super
cars to you you probably think about
some kind of a hand-built bauble that
costs a fortune purchased by rich folks
who almost never drive them the garage
Queen and you'd basically be right but
then we get to cars like the Lamborghini
Huracan that exemplify an interesting
trend I've noticed in a supercar
business lately to make these things
more liveable day to day and that also
brings in a lot of new technology let's
drive the Huracan and check the champion
this is what replaces the Guyardo the
best-selling Lamborghini ever and it
replaces it with a major leap forward in
technology and demeanor when Lamborghini
set out to replace the Guyardo they
wielded a lot of new and improved
technology adaptive electronic steering
magnetic fluid adaptive suspension
blessedly now a dual clutch instead of
single clutch automated gearbox an Audi
Quattro related all-wheel drive system a
dramatically new LCD instrument panel
and a body with clean subtle
aerodynamics not obnoxious cutouts or
powered rear wings now as Lamborghinis
go and I actually find this vehicle
understated and elegant the old
structure of this car is a composite of
some carbon pieces some aluminum pieces
a lot of sandwiches and blending of the
two it's not a true carbon tub with
aluminum subframe instead it's a glued
and riveted sandwich of the two
materials especially at the cowl and
down the spine Lamborghini calls this a
carbon hybrid blessedly conventional
doors do you really need this and then
you've got the glass cover on the engine
which is beautiful and clean but no
that's an option normally you'd have a
busier set of louvers there that's the
best $7000 you'll ever spend now inside
the Huracan things are decidedly more
modern than the Guyardo it replaced look
at that instrument panel it's a 12 inch
side to side all LCD driven by an NVIDIA
Tegra processor you've also got another
LCD over here that's a fixed set of
engine gauges now back to the main one
interesting behavior here you can have
sort of a split screen where you have
instrumentation on the left and you've
got your infotainment interface on the
right hold a button here on the wheel
and then you go into a full screen of
your Audi inspired MMI you'll recognise
and have seen that before
hold the button again and now you go to
a full instrumentation layout hold
another button and that can go between
full tach and full speedo there's no
other interface quite like this it's
also nice when you go in Reverse you get
your reverse camera right there in front
you in fact everything's in front of you
this is an interesting vision of moving
things away from the glance away centre
head stack
- right in front of the driver and of
course related to all that stuff in the
- is a pretty familiar kind of last
generation Audi MMI interface now onto
the drive controls this vehicles not
like any other in that respect either
here on the wheel everything is going
kind of motorcycle like notice there are
no stalks around the column only a
couple of properly mounted stock based
shift paddles left is down shift right
is up shift instead things that used to
be on stalks are here here's my high
beam switch here is my left right turn
signal switch wipers are over here and
then down here on the bottom here's
where my drive personality controls our
sport strata Corsa we'll talk more about
those on the road back here on the
backbone you've got a locked-down
start/stop button that's just a great
Hollywood theater there and of course
what would a supercar be without cool
titles to play with and here's a rack of
those for things like windows hazards
and most importantly on this guy
the optional nose lifter under glass is
the heart of the Beast the 5.2 liter v10
naturally aspirated no turbos no
supercharger they do it the
old-fashioned way
0 to 60 in 3.2 seconds that's what
happens when you got 602 horse notably
though only 413 pound-feet of torque
this guys are ever not a puller
now while this engine breathes
conventionally it drinks via two
technologies both port and direct
injection something a number of
automakers are doing more of lately to
optimize fuel delivery across the entire
rpm and load range 7-speed dual-clutch
automated manual gearbox is very
different than that Guyardo we had which
had a single clutch automated manual and
was on the bulky side this promises to
be much more refined oh by the way if
you care the mpg is 14 20 on this guy
that's actually not bad the days of
single-digit mpg supercars are just
about over
almost immediately
I notice how this cars got a really nice
transmission
because it's a dual-clutch we don't have
all that jerkiness of the single clutch
automated needles are known for instead
the shifts are super smooth plenty quick
of course it depends if you're in strata
sport or Gore so when you move those
drive modes on the wheel
you affect a lot of things you're going
to change your throttle mapping so you
get more power sooner you change your
steering ratio if you have the adaptive
steering option you're going to change
the way the adaptive suspension operates
you're also going to change the way the
instability control is going to dial in
you're going to change the shift points
and how aggressive and quick those
happen it really transforms a lot of
things about the car now this cars also
got an interesting set of sensors the
accelerometers and the gyros are
three-dimensional so you've got X Y and
C which Lamborghini says is really
helping them get some real dimension and
real-world flavor into how they modify
all of those drive systems
you know my favorite compliment for any
car it feels like tena it feels like and
when you feel like you feel best a lot
of the things you're also hearing about
this car is the exhaust that changes
when you go into sport or Corsa they
open up some baffles and you get this
nice back crackle beautiful sound
now there are some lamborghini quirks
that make this car that I feel he has to
live with I don't quite fit I'm lead way
back if my knees are all fun stuff the
other thing is when you get a windshield
this rakish and cheeky you also end up
with some great big a pillars that
really get in the way of tackling
corners
okay let's get you all budgeted to buy
your Huracan two hundred forty-one
thousand dollars is your entry point
with destination now we got to add a
handful of things to get it seen that
style adaptive steering is 2400 the
adaptive suspensions 3400 navigation is
an awfully steep $3,200 rear cam you're
gonna need it that includes backup
sensors nearly 4,000 the nose lifter
will save you twice its price the first
time you find a curve that's sixty nine
hundred dollars and the glass engine lid
I love it seven thousand all inward
about two sixty eight but who's counting
this is a very liveable approachable car
that is also extreme when you want it to
be but not when you don't it's a very
interesting story and I see it bubbling
up all over the supercar market and
perhaps nowhere expressed better than
right here
by the way if you want more Lamborghini
head over to CNN on cars calm and just
search Lamborghini you'll find my takes
on the Aventador and the Guyardo which
preceded the Huracan $100 Rolex will at
most damage your ego when it's found out
but fake car parts raise the stakes
considerably higher coming up
spotting counterfeit car parts when CA
Town Cars continues
you're not fooling anybody when a
counterfeit brake caliper cracks during
a hard stop or an airbag doesn't deploy
or does like a bond instead of a pillar
one of the most ominous things about
poorly made counterfeit parts posing as
genuine is that they likely evaded all
testing by posing as an original that
was tested and basically getting a pass
even legit low-cost alternative parts
are tested now of course automakers and
even junkyards have a vested interest in
you buying genuine parts because that's
what they sell in one form or another
this is a Honda airbag and this is not
but the government agencies that
intercept and monitor these things are
ringing alarm bells going so far as to
suggest you contact the FBI
if you suspect you've been sold
counterfeit car parts you don't need to
be a shade-tree mechanic to spot them
be wary of too-good-to-be-true prices
it's one thing to get a seventeen dollar
Maxwell Charger this is different steer
away from that guy who approaches you in
a parking lot to fix your car it
shouldn't need to tell you that
be wary of parts purchased online that
ship from distant countries especially
countries that aren't really in the car
business and look for typos on the box
motor craft and Delphi never misspell
their own names
it pays to do a quick double check on
the likelihood that you're buying a
cheap fake that will damage more than
your ego when it reveals itself
welcome back to CNN on cars coming to
you from our home at the mountain Motor
Club just north of a Golden Gate Bridge
thanks to increasing amounts of
electronic tech and electrically driven
components of your car there's been a
lot of research and movements toward a
higher voltage system in your vehicle
let's take a look at that now in a
future looking car tech 101
today your car almost certainly uses
exclusively 12 volts direct current to
do just about everything you know it
this is the stuff that comes out of the
cigarette lighter we call the power port
now in your console but it flows all
over your vehicle from taillights to
ignition system sometimes it's converted
to higher voltage for things like high
intensity discharge headlamps but for
the most part this car is a 12-volt
world and that dates back over 60 years
before that it was a six volt world in
many instances but now we're cutting the
other way to higher voltage namely 48
now just as 12 volts is a big increase
in the ability to get things done and do
it efficiently over 6 4 48 volts is
multifold
improvement over the current standard
yet it remains notably below the 50 volt
DC line that is generally considered the
beginning of substantial shock risk to
humans now the main motivation for
higher voltage is coming largely from
the engine bay things that used to be
driven by the sloppy parasitic belts off
the engine are now being driven by
integral electric motors I'm talking
about things like power steering pumps
air conditioning compressors and water
pumps that move coolant around the
engine you can drive those by
electricity and only when they're needed
as opposed to constantly tethered to a
belt you get nice efficiencies and you
also can package things a little more
tightly in the engine bay and speaking
of electrifying things several
automakers are considering using new
electric turbochargers which are spun up
by an integral 48 volt motor instead of
bypassing exhaust gases which should
reduce lag make the plumbing more
compact and lower fuel consumption while
creating that additional power it goes
without saying that
Eevee's already use high-voltage like
the 375 volt system that powers a Tesla
and you've seen those orange wire
housings inside electric cars and strong
hybrids those call out the high voltage
runs but those are currently limited to
systems that turn the wheels not much
else but even if you don't look at a
future with strong hybrids plug-in
hybrids and electric cars the move to 48
volts seems like it's ready to happen
because it grants so much more
efficiency to even conventional
Sinjin cars allows packaging to be much
more flexible which designers love and
takes components that SAP the engines
rotational energy all the time and
convert them to devices that tax mostly
the electrical system just part of the
time in a moment wheel worries and the
things that Apple and Google could best
improve inside your coffee with CNET on
cars returns
the the thing that I think we've had the
most fun with is we've given if the new
sound of electric vehicles most of the
feedback we've gotten from the
performance or car enthusiasts say oh
the cars are too quiet we've given it in
my opinion the right touch of sound so
when you accelerate or decelerate you
get that adrenaline flowing and it adds
a whole different dimension to driving
electric vehicles buy more from the ex
car team of seen at UK at cnet.com slash
welcome back to CNN on cars I'm Brian
coolie it's that part of the show we
take some your email got a twofer this
time from Jose oh and Chad s who both
asked about wheels Jose writes in how
about doing a wheels 101 about the
different manufacturing processes for
function and aesthetics of wheels and
Chad writes in I bent a wheel on my
Civic ax and on my evo mor after hitting
potholes thankfully I was able to get
both of them repaired I'm curious to see
how a bent wheel can affect the tire
from taking and holding air well guys
first of all I feel for anyone out there
who's had a bent wheel you know the
minute you do it you hit a pothole and
it's harder than usual the car shakes in
a different way and maybe even drives
funny right afterwards and you know
things just got expensive alloy wheels
have less protection these days and they
used to lower profile tires provide less
cushioning above the circumference of
the wheel not only are tires getting
lower
but maintenance budgets in just a matter
of a municipality seem to be getting
lower as well so the roads are pretty
crappy out there I'll do a car tech 101
on how wheels are made soon but know
that there are basically two divisions
Jose in the kind of wheel you buy cast
wheels or forged wheels cast wheels
that's one where hot molten alloy is
poured into a form and then cooled a
machine that tends to be a mainstream
wheel affordable not the highest
performance in some cases then there's a
forged wheel which is as the name
implies forged out of a single in
of alloy material under enormous
mechanical pressure these tend to be
very strong wheels they can be made
particularly light they're often
demanded in performance applications now
in terms of bending a wheel and fixing
it Chris
this is an area where I recommend you go
to a specialist ask around get
recommendations from your car club or
something because it's kind of an art to
bring this thing back into its perfect
shape in several ways what you want to
achieve is three things first of all you
want to get true back true means this
bead here has to be dead straight to
help the tire seal air as well as not
lose its seating in the wheel if you
spin it it shouldn't do this
wander left and right that's not good
for holding the tire in place or to have
a good balance on the wheel secondly you
want to have round you've got a perfect
circle again when it's fixed and there's
no divot here in the curvature the third
thing and it's harder to eyeball this is
metal fatigue as that metal is bent and
then brought back into shape that
fatigues the metal in many cases often
beyond a point of where it's safely
serviceable that can be dangerous couple
easy ways to eyeball an alloy wheel if
you're looking at it you can always roll
it down a smooth surface and just watch
how that bead might move if it's out of
true take it and put the face or
whatever part was damaged on a known
flat surface and look for any
significant gaps between it and daylight
but in terms of that metallic damage
from too much stress of being bent and
bent back
I've got no tips for you there after a
lot of promises mostly broken in 2014
car makers really are putting apple
carplay and android auto into new cars
this year this isn't just another
technology edition these two new
entrants have the potential to take over
some areas that car makers just can't
seem to nail let's run down the top-5
now these are my picks based on spending
a lot of time in a lot of cars that try
my patience with their cabin tech and
admittedly limited time poking around
car playing android auto since they're
very very new don't screw this up guys
and make us both look bad here we go
number five dashboard distraction I put
this low because let's face it screwing
around with infotainment while you drive
is still screwing around with
infotainment while you drive no matter
who designed it however Apple and
especially Google are expert at
predictive knowledge their systems are
built to try and know what you mean or
want before you're even done inputting
it nice on a phone critical in a car
number four lousy user interface car
makers are all over the road on their
you is what their screens and displays
look like all too often have a single
thing in common they look like hell
Google and especially Apple have a look
and feel to their platforms that holds
together across all screens and ideally
across third-party apps it creates some
badly needed consistency imagine if cars
had a gas pedal on the left and
sometimes on the right number three old
media even Apple the folks who invented
iTunes aren't so much in the mp3 game
like they used to be and neither they
nor Google were ever married to things
like satellite radio HD radio CDs they
have no problem quickly embracing the
new and dumping the old things like
streaming choices that come so fast car
makers can often just hope to be two
generations behind number two
stale POS in your car's current
navigation rig points of interest seldom
are they are instead these stiff rigid
outdated categories of things that take
longer to page through than to drive to
and almost never are they aware of what
you like it's mostly collections of
obvious things like national chain
locations or overly broad categories
like museums or cemeteries yeah
kill me move over and let live search
and my
references and history flourish in the -
before I get to number one some things
that are certainly beyond the ability of
Apple and Google to fix beyond
infotainment like complicated
touchscreens for temperature control why
blind spot and Lane Departure warnings
that all sound like the same bird
chirping or absurd 180 miles pedometers
that crush every increment down so small
you can't tell if you're doing 50 or 70
without taking out a magnifying glass
the number one thing that Apple and
Google can know must improve in the dash
is maddening voice command voice
commands in cars used to be like magic
until smartphones arrived and showed us
it's actually more like a gallstone get
out of the way car makers there's no
technology better proven you shouldn't
be involved in then voice commands add
in the fact that voice envelops most of
what happens in the dash and I can't
wait to talk to Siri or say ok Google
behind the wheel calling Peggy Jordan
mobile by the way if you don't want to
wait or buy a new car the after market
has beaten car makers to the punch
installing carplay and android auto
systems as we speak into the cars people
already own
