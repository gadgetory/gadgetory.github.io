cnet.com and we are at CTIA 2013 in Las
Vegas and we're taking a look at the
damps and pearl bluetooth speakers you
can tell these are stereo bluetooth
speakers that actually have two
components you've got the left and right
and basically they connect to each other
via bluetooth and you also connect them
to your smart phone to get wireless
audio and they actually sound pretty
darn loud basically they cost $1.99 and
will be available by July of this year
it also has a speaker phone capability
so you can actually conduct calls while
you're listening to music if a call
comes in you can answer it that type of
thing so all in all this is a very nice
device and now there's also another
product here that damson has also been
showing at CTIA we've got the larger
damson oyster and this device as you
tell it's larger has four drivers has
two on the sides here two in the front
also connects to your smartphone via a
wireless connection via bluetooth
another thing that's really cool is that
you can also remove the the grilles and
they have magnets on the bottom in the
back so you don't have to clip it and
just like pull it off and put it back on
and essentially this is a much more
robust device it will cost 229 and
should ship by June of this year so they
have folks we've just taken a first look
at the damson pearl and the damson
oyster bluetooth speakers i'm Brian
Bennett for cnet.com
