goodwin welcoming you to tap that app
the show where we take a look at the
hottest app for your mobile device now
one of the biggest issues I had when
switching to the Android platform was
the lack of music management software a
la Apple's iTunes ecosystem I mean who
really wants to manually drag folders
full of mp3's to and from their SD card
that's when I found doubletwist an app
that touts itself as the iTunes of
Android but it's actually much more than
that the doubletwist ecosystem is split
into a few discrete parts that you can
install separately first up there's the
double twist app for Android itself
which is a replacement music player that
allows you to browse your music by
artist album etc as well as view videos
listen to podcast and stream internet
radio stations the doubletwist desktop
software for mac and pc is a
full-featured music management
application that allows you to subscribe
to podcasts and organize your massive
music video and photo libraries you can
even import your music library and
playlist from itunes and windows media
player there's also amazon mp3 store
integration for those who would like to
make in-app album purchases they're also
a ton of options for deciding what media
gets synced to your device the desktop
software for windows can be a bit
sluggish for our taste at times but the
pros here far outweigh the cons now both
the android app and desktop software are
free and allow thinking over USB but
doubletwist does have another trick up
its sleeve for those willing to be
parted with the dollar 99 it costs to do
so doubletwist air sync is a paid
android app that allows the doubletwist
media players on your phone and on your
computer to communicate and think over
Wi-Fi so you can get the latest episode
of your favorite podcast and your newest
album purchase without having to go
digging around for a USB cable now the
air sync speed is a bit slower than USB
but ultimately it's going to depend on
the speed of your wireless network air
sync also rolls in a neat feature called
air twist that allows users to stream
music from certain Android devices to
their Xbox 360 or ps3 console over Wi-Fi
we definitely recommend
men that you tap the doubletwist app for
Android and the doubletwist desktop
software if you're looking for a more
automated way to manage your massive
media library if you like the free wired
experience you may want to go ahead and
give the wireless air sink a try to but
we're not one hundred percent certain
that all of you will want to go that far
that's it for this week's show if you've
got an app that you'd like to see taps
in your suggestions to tap that app at
cnet com I'm antuan goodwin and if
you'll excuse me I've got some podcast
to catch up on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
