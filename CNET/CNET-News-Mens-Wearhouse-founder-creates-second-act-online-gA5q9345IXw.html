Zimmer started the suit retailer Men's
Warehouse more than 40 years ago but he
was fired in 2013 amid disagreements
with the board he's now back with a new
company that offers tuxedo and suit
rentals online called generation tucks
he's here to talk to us today about the
startup which he introduced just last
week so George tell me a little bit
about what the response has been so far
about the introduction of this new
company well I think everybody is just
waiting for online tuxedo rental because
up until online tux rental you had to
make three trips into a store to rent a
tux one to go in and pick it out a
second to get it fitted and a third to
return it so today you can do it from
your living room so what's the what's
the reason for actually wanting to do
this you founded and helped run a
successful company for more than 40
years you're 66 years old a lot of
people retire at that point what's
what's the reason for actually going
ahead with this in the first place well
I said I started Men's Wearhouse in 73
and after a quarter of a century I went
into the tuxedo rental business at Men's
in 99 and over the 13 years that I was
there built it into a four hundred
million dollar plus business it's also
much more profitable than selling
regular clothing so I decided to just
have an online tux rental business and
it's going to be extremely successful
and profitable isn't it all personal
though well I mean people want to know
if there's any revenge not really it's
it's is really we're too busy trying to
create what we have to worry about
them you know they are in the same
business so I guess there will be some
impact but that's not what we're looking
for you were known pretty well for a
signature line with Men's Wearhouse is
there gonna be a signature line for
generation tax well we've not been able
to trademark one in the 40 years since
my first one it's become much more
difficult to get a trademark butt but a
line that I'm starting to look for is
something like Gen tux we got you
covered
nice what one other question I also had
was is it different creating a business
online we were talking a little bit
before about how you're a bit of a tech
Lyday you with Men's Wearhouse they're
not exactly doing a lot in online these
days so what's that been like for you
well it's it's been about hiring the
right people and combining high-tech and
high-touch my domain expertise in tuxedo
rental with the technology that is now
been first promoted by uber but is now
spreading everywhere is where we're able
to make everything more efficient by
matching supply and demand with
technology is that right I understand
that at one point maybe you were
involved in something else well I have
been involved in a number of things but
really the thing that I think most
people didn't realize was that I've
always been involved in the beer
business in fact I don't drink beer but
if I did I drink those seconds
stay thirsty my friends very good George
thanks for coming on and this is Ben
Rubin thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
