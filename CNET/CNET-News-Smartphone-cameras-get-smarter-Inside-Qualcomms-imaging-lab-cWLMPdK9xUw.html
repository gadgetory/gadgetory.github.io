we're building the 0th platform in
qualcomm san diego's research facility
and this is where we build this really
cool technology and we get it ready to
go into our Snapdragon product lines we
take the software and the hardware that
we're working on we bring it together on
to our you know latest test devices to
see how it's going to work on our newest
processors we show it pictures we show
it real world objects we show it faces
and it understands all that and from
then you can you know build a story you
can build toy's you can have the camera
understand what it's looking for right
away it detected that it was flowers and
there were no people and then it's a
plan so we have data about the scene and
this is a live 3d object like you were
going to take a picture of it but i can
also pivot it for example and i can show
it still images so we have cats a beach
scene you can see how quickly it's able
to say sky and clouds we're going beyond
just you know that it's a beach we're
also having this other data about the
picture where then you can search for
the the characteristics of your picture
right away so we show another example
here take a picture analyze it fully on
device and then convert it to text this
is a significantly harder problem
because I didn't observe the writer
writing The Strokes so now we're not
just converting a block of Texas e on a
whiteboard we're preserving the
positional orientation of the text as
well but imagine that it could learn
your style your abbreviations your you
know your shorthand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
