what's really appealing about them is
that most cost only about two hundred
dollars given that most 7-inch tablets
are about the same price they each need
something special in order to stand out
the Kobo arc attempts to do this with a
customized interface and enhance folder
feature called tapestries and
ever-present recommendations at the
bottom of the home screen but that
attempt unfortunately comes up short hi
i'm eric franklin and today i'll take a
first look at the Kobo arc the Kobo arc
feels a little heavy for 7-inch tablet
and features an unrefined design it's
kind of blocky and the bezel isn't flush
with the screen overall it feels a bit
antiquated as the tablet market standard
goes the ark includes a micro USB port
for charging and file transfers a 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera microphone
ambient light sensor power / sleep
button volume rocker headphone jack and
two front facing speakers also the back
cover can be removed they replaced with
a different colored one at an additional
cost the Ark ships with a custom version
of ice cream sandwich and features
something of an enhanced folder system
that allows you to organize apps widgets
pics and save articles you want to read
later in a folder like place on the
tablet Kobo calls these tapestries and
while they're useful they don't offer
any significant features beyond what
folders do the other custom feature is
the discover ribbon which is essentially
an ever-present scroll of
recommendations at the bottom of the
home screen and by ever present I mean
it never goes away and as far as I can
tell there's no way to disable it apps
loaded about the same speed as they do
on the Nexus 7 which is quick enough but
games run at a noticeably higher
framerate on the ark thanks to as omap
4470 processor
the kobo arc starts at two hundred
dollars for 16 gigabytes of storage for
more information check out my full
review once again i'm eric franklin and
this has been a first look at the cobo
art</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
