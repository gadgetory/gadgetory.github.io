officially enters the tablet Wars learn
to live with facebook timeline console
quality gaming comes to the iPad and get
ready to kiss your texting plan goodbye
it's all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer our own unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's start with the good amazon
held an event in New York City this week
to announce its revised kindle lineup
including the company's much-anticipated
entry into the tablet market the kindle
fire here's Bridget Carey with all the
details
hi I'm Bridget Carey with cnet TV here
at the new york amazon press conference
we're not only that amazon just
announced a whole new line of e ink
readers we also got a look at the amazon
tablets it's called kindle fire it's a
color 7-inch tablet that is at a really
low price point two hundred dollars it's
a big difference from that barnes &amp;amp;
noble nook which is forty dollars more
kindle touch 3g kindle touch and kindle
when it comes to the e-ink readers
amazon really dropped their prices not
only is a non-touch version now
available for $79 but there is also one
touch screen for $99 also much cheaper
than the barnes and noble version of its
nook touch amazon also has a 3g version
of its new touchscreen e-ink reader it's
a hundred fifty dollars and they're
going to be available for holiday but
the one that you can have order now and
ship now is the non touch version for
$79 amazon also unveiled a few new
features that really are important to
the new kindle fire tablet you're
looking at whispersync that not only
does books but also automatically syncs
the kind of movies TV shows so
essentially you could take a show you're
watching on your tablet stop it and
playback on your TV and amazon says that
worried about backing up your data is
the thing of the past everything that
you download is going to be stored in
there amazon cloud should be accessed at
any time and deleted from the hard drive
space anytime but that hard drive is
only eight gigabytes of course that's
why they're really pushing that amazon
cloud so essentially you have all the
space you want in the cloud to store
things
and Amazon introduced a new mobile
browser to its Kindle Fire it's called
Amazon silk and it's supposed to make
things really a lot faster to load than
traditional mobile browsers not only are
these new candles a lot smaller a lot
lighter but they're also a lot cheaper
expect them to be a big holiday seller
christina TV in New York I'm Bridget
Carey $79 for a kindle that's just like
a little more than a couple of hardcover
books from your local bookstore oh wait
we don't really have those anymore stick
around for more kindle fire details
coming up later in the show last week we
showed you some of the new features
Facebook is working on including the new
timeline which will dominate your
profile page while the timeline started
rolling out to the public this week and
Sharon Vaknin is here with a twofer of
how to videos to help you get started
customizing your profile and also hiding
some of those skeletons from your
Facebook past hey everyone I'm Sharon
Vaknin frisina com here to walk you
through the new facebook profiles now
known as your timeline timelines are
completely different than your profile
and they start with a new edition called
the cover photo for my profile I picked
this photo of myself but it can be
whatever you want like a photo of your
dog or your favorite city to change it
hover over your photo select change
cover and choose a photo from your
facebook albums or upload one from your
drive just blow your cover photo you'll
see all of your info on the left and
other profile items like friends apps
and photos on the right to edit or
change the privacy settings for any of
these items click on the item this works
for your info photos friends and other
modules you can also decide which boxes
show up at the top click the arrow to
expand hover over a box and click the
pencil there is an option to swap the
box with something else or remove it
entirely there is a new app called maps
which is a geographical version of your
timeline it plots points where you've
tagged a location in any of your posts
it's pretty cool but if you think it's
creepy hover over the box and remove it
now comes the fun and kind of scary part
your timeline all of your Facebook
activity is now viewable to you and your
friends in chronological order going all
the way back to the day joined facebook
in the very beginning you'll see an
empty section for the day you were born
the idea is that facebook wants you to
fill in events that happen throughout
your life even before Facebook to add an
event hover over the point in the
timeline where it happened and click the
grey line you have the option to add a
status update photo location you visited
or type of life event for example maybe
you learned a new language broke a bone
bought a new car or graduated there are
about 20 different suggested events but
if you want to add something of your own
just click other life events once you
fill in the information the story will
be added to your time line and it'll
show up in your recent activity at the
top but what if you want to hide some
events from your timeline you might be
embarrassed or regretful about things
you post it in the past but luckily you
can hide them
the easiest way to hide old posts is by
going to view activity at the top here
you'll see a simplified version of your
timeline which you can filter by type
once you find the post you want to
remove click the arrow next to the story
and you'll see many privacy options you
can hide it from your timeline change
the privacy settings or delete the post
entirely which means it's never coming
back if you have a lot of old pose you
would rather hide this process might
take a while but at least you only have
to do it once once you've added and
removed posts from your timeline you can
start featuring the ones you want to
highlight find the post you want to
feature hover over it and click the star
to make it full with two unfit just
click the star again when you've tweaked
your profile to your liking click the
Settings button here at the top and
select view as then enter any friends
named to see what it looks like to them
or click public to see what your
timeline looks like to everyone
including people who aren't your friends
I know this is a big change so if you
have any questions feel free to ask me
on Twitter or of course my facebook page
for a/c nut I'm Sharon Vaknin and I'll
see you on the interwebs hey everyone
I'm Sharon Vaknin for cnet.com here to
guide you through all the big privacy
changes on facebook when Facebook
announced timeline the new profile
design many people were worried about a
change in the facebook apps policies now
apps only need to ask for permission
once before sharing your activity
whenever they want you can't change the
new policy but you can decide which
friends get to see your activity or hide
the activity entirely without deleting
the app go to privacy settings then head
to apps and websites and click Edit
settings on the right then click Edit
settings again first take a look at the
list and remove any apps you no longer
use then find the app you want to adjust
permissions for and click Edit some apps
like Spotify let you remove specific
permissions like posting to Facebook as
you so go ahead and remove to your
liking for app activity privacy pick the
people who can see your activity from
the pop-up list if you don't want anyone
to see it click customize
then only me back in the privacy center
check your settings for how tags work
and how you connect to make sure you're
connecting with the right people once
you configure those settings head to
your timeline and tweak some important
privacy settings there every time you do
small things like add a friend right on
someone's wall change your info or add a
life event facebook logs it in your
recent activity if you think that's too
intrusive hover over any story and click
the X and select hide all do this for
every type of activity you want to hide
to unhide them just click the pencil
select hidden activity and click the X
next to things you want to unhide at
this point your privacy is already a
little more secure but Facebook buried
even more settings we need to adjust at
the top of your timeline you'll see your
general info on the left and some boxes
on the right to change the privacy of
your information click it hit edit for
any module and use the drop-down menu
next to each item to pick who gets to
see it for the boxes like friends and
photos you have options to to hide your
friends list click on the box and adjust
the privacy settings at the top for
photos click the box to see all of your
albums and adjust privacy settings for
each one now back at your profile info
you saw an option for hiding your mobile
number weirdly enough if you make it
visible to only me it still doesn't
guarantee your privacy go to account
settings then mobile and uncheck the box
next to share my phone number with
friends now your phone number is private
once again facebook always makes us do
more work than we should have to once
you've got all of your privacy settings
sorted out head back to your profile and
click the Settings button then view ask
to see what your profile looks like to
other users enter a friend's name to see
what info you're sharing with them or
click the public link at the top to see
what your profile looks like to the rest
of the internet if you have any other
privacy or timeline related questions
leave me a comment on my facebook page
of course or hit me up on Twitter for
cnet I'm Sharon Vaknin and I'll see you
on the interwebs
so broke a bone had surgery and overcame
an illness are all default life event
options oh maybe next time I go to the
doctor I can just refer them to my
profile instead of filling out the
medical history form haha if you can't
see the timeline on your profile page
just yet don't worry it's comin soon
whether you like it or not in this
week's top 5 Brian Cooley is not only
counting down the best free SMS apps but
he's also offering some shocking
statistics about your text habits oh hi
texting is huge in case you haven't
noticed the average American cell phone
owner now sends and receives over 41
text messages a day that's more than
1200 a month try that on one of those
500 texts for ten dollar plans and the
overages are going to just about double
your monthly bill now of course you can
get an unlimited text plan but I might
have some better options I'm Brian
Cooley with the top five SMS texting
apps that are both cheaper and more fun
to use they rely on your data plan and
don't lean on your SMS count we're going
to rank them by their feature set number
five is google voice that's right google
voice this app may have the least
features of any i'm going to show you
but it does something unique it assigns
you a separate google voice phone number
that means you can also text people who
are not on smartphones and don't have a
data plan and you still won't be charged
for SMS on your end pretty neat trick
huh it doesn't quite make up though for
other things it can't do like sending
pictures number four is kick if you're a
real heavy texter with like five SMS
threads going at once and you'd read
that day when a sluggish text app is
going to trip you up and cause you to
sex to photo to the boss instead of the
boyfriend kick is your huckleberry super
responsive and fast it's also got a cool
single letter interface these little
call-outs on the bubbles to let you know
if a text has been sent delivered or
read rate for the obsessively impatient
number three is called live profile it's
interesting and that it connects you to
your texting account via an email
address instead of a fixed phone number
makes it great if you use as many phones
as you send texts like some people do
you log in to whatever device you've got
via your email address on any of them
and your messages and contacts follow
you it also lets you post your text to
Twitter or Facebook but doesn't offer
group chat which three of our five do
number two is pingchat pingchat does
have the group chat that live profiles
missing but it also lets you text
pictures while sharing your location and
integrating your social network status
that's great because the stalkers union
called and they're demanding and easier
workload this is an ad-supported app by
the way and no clean paid version is
even available as of this moment before
I get you to our number one SMS text
alternative app let's get a little
reality check on this idea that
everyone's texting instead of calling
nope we're actually doing lots of both
the latest numbers from the pew internet
and american life survey so that the
more you text the more you call but the
more a person texts the more they prefer
to be contacted that way so take a hint
and stop calling me the number one SMS
alternative app is Kakao Talk it has
just about every major feature going for
it you can send pictures send video
share audio do lots of appearance
customization to keep you phone
fetishists from getting nervous that
maybe your phone isn't cooler than mine
and you can password protect a given
conversation like the one between you
and mrs. Jones but note that cacao is
available on the fewest platforms just
iphone and android as of today all the
others add either blackberry or Windows
support to those two for the full
details on today's great text apps check
out Nicole cosmas piece at cnet com
we've got a link to it at top 5 cnet com
I'm Brian Cooley thanks for watching
if any of you are texting as much as
brian says and I know some of you are
then you need one of these apps and you
should probably consider giving those
thumbs arrest too all right we're going
to take a break so if you have any
texting to do now would be a good time
we'll be right back with more tech
review right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good Angry Birds
bejeweled Tiny Tower these mild-mannered
games are fine for passing the time but
every once in a while it just feels good
to blow something up and this week's tap
that app jason parker shows us a game
that not only fulfills that need it
looks good doing it
welcome to tap that app i'm jason parker
and this is the show will recover the
hottest apps in the mobile space at this
year's e3 gaming industry conference a
certain mobile game quickly got a lot of
attention for having console like
graphics high frame rates and
great-looking gameplay on a mobile
device it was so good looking in fact
that many people didn't believe it was a
real game for iOS this week we're
excited to show off shadowgun made using
the unity 3d engine and offering a level
of graphics not seen before on iOS
devices in our hands on time with the
game we've been very impressed with the
solid controls crystal-clear visuals and
mix of tactical combat and third-person
action the storyline is fairly
run-of-the-mill you play as John Slade a
typical tough-talking bounty hunter your
job is to infiltrate a mountain fortress
in search of one dr. Simon an evil
geneticist who has created an army of
cyborgs mutants and genetically enhanced
humanoids while fantastical in
real-world terms most gamers have had
their share of chasing crazy scientists
bent on world domination shadowgun is no
different in this aspect but where
shadow can differs from the usual fare
are the jaw-dropping visuals and
easy-to-use controls on the iOS shadows
and ambient lighting give the game
unprecedented realism and a constant
stream of action keeps you engaged as
you make your way deep into the mountain
fortress the control system couldn't be
easier you move John Slade with a joypad
on the left and look around by swiping
the screen on the right you get buttons
for firing and reloading your weapon on
the lower right and you can switch
weapons once you find them by touching
the gun icon in the upper right but
where the control system really shines
is in how shadow gun handles cover to
get out of harm's way you need only walk
up to an object and your character will
hunker down automatically hit the fire
button to quickly come out of cover and
take shots at enemies pulling back makes
you return to a standing position and
pushing forward makes you jump over the
object other games of this type often
have you press a button to go into cover
mode but we really like the simple way
shadow gun handles this tactic as you
progress through the game you'll need to
operate elevators turn off laser
security systems
and operate other mechanisms shadowgun
keeps it simple by switching your
shooting button to an interact but anass
econd you walk up to a machine we really
like these design decisions that make it
easy to keep the game fun without a
bunch of unnecessary complexity with all
the great things shadowgun does like the
graphics too easy to use controls and an
engaging if somewhat predictable
storyline it does suffer from being a
bit repetitive each battle follows a
similar pattern bad guys come out you go
into cover then you work through killing
each enemy one by one enemy in weapon
variations somewhat make up for this but
you'll still follow this basic pattern
throughout the game still shadowgun is a
must-have for serious shooter fans
offering amazing graphics great level
design and endless gun battles all with
a heavy metal soundtrack if you like any
of these things we heartily recommend
you tap this app immediately that's it
for this week's show if you have any
suggestions send them to tap that app at
cnet com i'm jason parker and we'll see
you next time 799 is a little pricey
compared to most of the apps we tap
around here but that's nothing compared
to 60 bucks for a console game think
about it okay now that we've seen the
future of mobile gaming let's revisit
the past as we dive into the bad
retro gaming fans may enjoy playing
classic Atari titles like adventure and
break out on their handhelds but they
probably missed the classic controls
like a joystick and physical buttons as
Scott Stein shows us Ataris new iPad
controller aims to fix that problem but
unfortunately it misses the mark m scott
Stein senior editor at cnet com and if
you're an iPad owner and you're an
arcade fetishist well you may want to
take a look at the Atari arcade sure you
don't have a dedicated arcade joystick
for your iPad you have to rely on
touching and smudging up your screen but
there is a solution the $60 joystick
made by Atari docks into your iPad and
will allow you to use a joystick and
four buttons with Ataris greatest hits
arcade app just that app and it docks
vertically in portrait mode it can't
reorient any other way now that's a
trade-off because a couple of months ago
we also saw another device the ion icade
a giant arcade cabinet for your iPad
that used bluetooth now that one use
batteries and could work with several
other games in addition to Ataris this
one only works with Ataris but it
doesn't need batteries once you plug
that thing into your 30 pin you are set
and this thing is small enough that you
can tuck it into a backpack if you so
choose to take it around and I don't
know player k games with your friends
some people might prefer to still go
with an arcade cabinet though if you're
going to take this thing and dock it
somewhere on your desk you might as well
go full out geeky but with this you kind
of get a little bit of both worlds and
as a result the joystick and the buttons
feel a little bit less arcade perfect if
you're going to be a real retro
perfectionist compared to something like
the icade then again it's a lot better
than touching on the screen but if
you're going to put in that portrait
mode just remember it's going to shrink
down those arcade games kind of
letterbox them a little bit so unless
you're playing a game like centipede
here which uses the whole screen in
order to play because that was a
original arcade game that used that mode
most of them are not going to take up
nearly that screen real estate and wait
a second here if we're going to be
arcade perfectionist send
pede used a trackball wait a second why
are we using a joystick for that in fact
a lot of our Tories arcade games
centipede breakout and Missile Command
ones like that use track balls or paddle
so next time Atari how about giving us
one of those I'm Scott Simon said look
at the Atari arcade joystick doc for the
iPad have you tried playin Missile
Command with a joystick salima though it
is a bit better than playing it on a
touchscreen and would it have killed
Atari to make the stand also work as a
charger to Hannah do I have to think of
everything well if that's the case then
I think it's time to move along to this
week bottom line earlier Bridget Carey
showed us the highlights from
Wednesday's Amazon announcement but
here's David Carr nguoi with a closer
look at the kindle fire tablet I'm David
cardo and i'm here at the amazon event
here in new york city where amazon has
introduced a new one hundred ninety nine
dollar android tablet the Amazon Kindle
Fire doesn't necessarily look like an
Android tablet on the surface it's got a
nice minimalist simple interface to it
that really attempts to tie in all of
Amazon's services that includes a kindle
ebooks video mp3 audio and Amazon's
Cloud Drive the one short coming to the
device is that it comes with only eight
gigabytes of memory and has no explain
to slot for more memory amazon however
is touting the fact that you're really
going to only store a little bit of
content on the device and then delete it
and get stuff from their cloud the
tablet comes in only one color black and
it weighs 14 point 6 ounces amazon
wasn't giving a whole lot of specifics
on the battery life but i heard from one
rep here that it was about seven hours
under a worst-case scenario where you're
playing video so ok battery life similar
to the nook color it has a dual core
processor it seems zippy when we saw the
demos here amazon wasn't letting anybody
handle the device a couple of other key
features
amazon is touting is the new silk
browser it's a mobile browser that's
supposed to be a better mobile browser
with caching that allows pages to load
faster there was some talk of even being
able to predict where you were going to
surf for instance if you went to the New
York Times website and you ended up
going to the front page and they knew
that you're going to the business
section a lot it would preload the
business section for you the other
feature that Amazon was touting is that
whispersync not only is available for
work ebooks now like it is on other
Kindle devices but it's also available
for video and audio so everything syncs
wirelessly with this device similar to
what's going to happen when iOS 5 comes
out with Apple unfortunately you cannot
get this today this won't be out till
November 15th but Amazon is already
accepting pre-orders and expecting a lot
of people to do those pre orders and is
apparently making millions of these one
of the key headlines here is that this
device costs only a hundred ninety-nine
dollars amazon was expected to come out
with a $249 android tablet coming out at
199 obviously makes this even more
attractive some people are calling it a
new color competitor some people are
calling it an ipad competitor and
obviously for those people who don't
want to spend five to six hundred
dollars an ipad this becomes a nice
alternative and it's also smaller and
more pocketable until then it looks like
on the surface at least amazon has
really put out a product that a lot of
people are going to want this holiday
season i'm david carr nguoi and that's
the amazon kindle fire the bottom line
this week the kindle fire is in Fuego I
know it's not even Halloween yet but
whatever I hereby predict at the kindle
fire and all the new kindles actually
will be some of the biggest holiday
sellers of the year alright that's going
to do it for this time everyone but come
back next week for an all-new cnet tech
review when we will have all the news
from Apple's October fourth iphone event
until then there are tons of great
videos available every day at cnet TV
com I'll see you next time and thank you
for watching
