marketing to for LG Electronics here in
the US I often get asked do consumers
really need all these smart devices is
there really any benefit well today I'm
going to demonstrate how LG ai is making
people's lives easier and better both in
the home and outside and we're going to
start with the everyday items we use
most appliances so to help me show the
LT family of AI home appliances allow me
to introduce Chloe hello Chloe okay
let's go with me it's Saturday morning I
get up I first like to make sure
everything is ready for the day Chloe
what's my schedule smart learner has set
the washer to the sportswear setting
sounds like the perfect setting for my
workout gear thanks Chloe let's see what
we have over in our smart kitchen Chloe
what's for dinner tonight
okay Chloe is not gonna talk to me Chloe
doesn't like me evidently you can ask
your television to play your favorite
program connect to your soundbar for
enhanced sound experience or you could
even voice command to set to your
favorite picture mode you can also
connect and control all your smart home
devices for example before our next
guest arrives to my home I want to share
more about the TV innovations but I also
want to make sure that the room is all
set for his arrival turn the air
purifier on you got it turning on the
air purifier my next guests will be so
pleased the air is pure and clean now
all of LG's Smart TVs are equipped with
LG Thank You AI technology it's
certainly going to be a very exciting
year for televisions and LG</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
