on YouTube and why xboxes and ipods are
really hot these days no literally hey
there what's going on hope you havin a
great day I'm rich demuro with Cena TV
I'll be here all week and yes I'm on
facebook let's get you started with your
must click moment peebo park new Nissans
eco-friendly commuter car gets a
makeover the three seater has a 360
degree rotating cabin and tires that
move independently of each other the
all-electric pivo to can also move
sideways great for that parallel parking
challenged person the original pivo made
its debut at the 2005 tokyo motor show
and oh yeah the pivo too will also never
see the light of day moving through the
cube would you like some dipping sauce
with that melted xbox 360 another
example why I can't stand electric
stoves you can't tell when the burners
are still hot the xbox 360 owner got a
gooey reminder of that apparently there
was this massive halo 3 land party and
the only space left to put the box was
on the stove well you know the rest the
good news the Xbox took a grilling and
keeps on killing YouTube could make you
smarter well if you stop looking for
webcam videos and start watching
lectures from UC Berkeley the California
school now posting video of classes
online there's more than 300 hours of
free stuff but no matter how much you
watch you won't get a course credit or a
degree the most popular video Sims 141
search engines technology society and
business with guest google co-founder
sergey brin the most discussed video
physics 10 lecture one atoms and heat
what a perfect segue speaking of heat is
that a fire in your pocket first we had
the laptop battery scare of 2006 ah
remember that well now through the magic
of local news we bring you the exploding
ipod atlanta's wsb-tv tells the story of
one guy's ipod nano that burst into
flames well theoretically he shows off
his Bert pants pocket and the melted
nano the best part the flare-up happened
on the job where he works get this in
the airport that'll definitely get you
on the secondary screening list finally
Q on the street facebook or myspace mark
the intern here in you
Square the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC red
sox and yankees and now social
networking groups facebook myspace which
website do New Yorkers use the most
Facebook MySpace i use facebook i get to
keep in touch with friends from college
in high school and for work i use
facebook but i deleted my myspace a year
ago cuz it's played out corporate and
it's kind of addicting after a while i
use myspace just kind of jumped on the
bandwagon you know because everybody
else had it like with my face you've got
the whole blog thing you've got your own
layout and you've got I don't know it's
a lot more about you personality wise
and stuff Facebook it's kind of just one
basic layout you get to choose I mean
you have to zap locations and other
stuff but you know everyone kind of has
that so it's nothing really unique about
it you know what about friendster we got
to give some love to them I'm rich
demuro with Cena TV that's all for today
see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
