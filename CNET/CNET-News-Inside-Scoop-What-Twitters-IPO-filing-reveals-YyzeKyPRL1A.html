Sumi das joining me is daniel Terdiman
senior writer for Cena Daniel thanks for
being with us my pleasure okay so it is
now official there is going to be an IPO
for Twitter we had expected this yes the
paperwork has been filed so they have
filed what's called an s-1 with the SEC
that happened today yes and now we know
things that we didn't before what what's
going on with the financial health of
Twitter well twitter has yet to ever
make a profit but their revenues are now
in the range you might say about looks
like five hundred million dollars for a
full for the full year of 2013
extrapolating a little bit but and the
revenues are going up pretty you know
that's helped it healthy rise in revenue
let's talk about mobile because mobile
is such an important aspect of a Twitter
of this business model how is Twitter
set up to really capitalize on mobile
and take advantage of them well twitter
if to remember what started as a service
that was tied to carriers to text
messaging systems which routes were
really yeah that's why I Twitter maximum
length of 140 characters that was tied
to you know what you could do in a text
message so from the beginning it's been
built as a service for mobile and that's
played out or that's represented in the
fact that they say seventy-five percent
of their active users you know do it on
mobile sixty-five percent of their
advertising revenue comes from mobile
and if you compare that to what Facebook
did when you know after their IPO they
really struggled to to figure out how to
make money from mobile right they've
only recently kind of nailed that down
and gotten their mobile business in
order really this year right yeah and
that's why it's a primary reason why
facebook's IPO kind of tanked for the
first you know six months or so and now
that they have figured out mobile why
facebook is now sort of back above what
they're with their IPO right they've
gone above the original price so so
really twitter it seems like it's set up
in a good position then other
comparisons between Twitter and Facebook
of course that's the most recent sort of
IPO in history they are considered
competitors how did how do they compare
I mean we know that twitter has far
fewer users monthly active users than
Facebook does correct right so
so Facebook most recently said they had
I think like one point 18 billion
monthly users by comparison Twitter's
says they're about 218 million so that's
66 and there's even a larger gap in
terms of revenue it seems like Facebook
is making a ten times as much money and
in revenue and they have their already
profitable whereas Twitter's has yet to
ever make a profit right and and what is
twitter trying to accomplish I mean it's
it's it's a pretty lofty goal here it's
a billion dollars right if you think
about it a billion dollars for an IPO
doesn't seem like that much anymore I
mean like I think Facebook well remember
they tried to raise 10 billion in there
for a billion right but if the IPO goes
the way of facebook which I'm not saying
that it will but it's possible right
anything's possible so women think that
that Twitter with their billion dollars
is going to expand pretty significantly
in fact there's been rumors in the last
day or so that they're looking at a
lease on a new space in San Francisco
level double them at a size that they
have moved into their new headquarters
it seems out of here that long yeah it's
been about a year so that if that's true
then they're looking to double at least
double the size of their workforce
they'll probably acquire more companies
fill in you know some more holes so and
then the final question is when is this
IPO gonna happen when can everybody
actually buy shares we don't know
exactly yet but we can imagine it'll
happen you know by next month for sure
all right ok Daniel I'm sure this is not
the last that we'll be hearing everyone
Twitter IPO will probably be turning to
you again for news thanks so much my
pleasure for inside scoop I'm Sumi das
