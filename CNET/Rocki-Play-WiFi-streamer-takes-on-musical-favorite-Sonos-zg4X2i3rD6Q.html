are a lot of players in the market right
now but when you're talking about David
versus Goliath stories or to put in more
modern terms rocky versus Ivan Drago
there is no greater fight than that
between the rocky play rocky with an eye
that is and so knows I anti Pendlebury
and at only $49 this Rocky is a plucky
little upstart with something to prove
while the Drago or Dolph Lundgren in
this scenario is so nice
bigger prettier and with more resources
on its side as a Wi-Fi only player the
rocky play is a pretty basic device it
comes in a rubber shell with a number of
different colors to choose from and fits
in the palm of your hand
it features an onboard battery which is
good for a few hours of playback has a
USB power port as well and a 3.5
millimeter output the app that comes
with the Rocky is very easy to use and
you'll have the device up and running
very quickly at the moment its main use
is for playing back music on your phone
though it does offer SoundCloud access
and last.fm scrolling though there are
more services to come playback
reliability depends on your network but
it's mostly solid and definitely better
than other solutions like the forest
receiver while most music file formats
are supported it's Android only at the
moment but iOS is true very soon sound
quality is a lot better than you would
expect for such an expensive device and
almost as good as the Sonos connect
which is worth seven times surprised
though rocky was expected to lose this
fight it seems that the little player
could shake up audio streaming in the
same way that chromecast has for video
streaming at 50 bucks it's almost a
no-brainer
unlike dolph lundgren who is actually
around 160 idea
this is five Pendlebury for Cena</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
