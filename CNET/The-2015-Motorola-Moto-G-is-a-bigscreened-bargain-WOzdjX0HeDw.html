budget motive G a bigot 5-inch display
and the better camera as well for some
reason though it removed its 4G
connectivity with this latest iteration
however 4G is back visually the phone is
identical to last year's model it has
the same plastic rounded back that's
comfortable to hold it's the same size
too and it still has 8 gigabytes of
storage with the same micro SD card slot
inside to expand the memory the 5-inch
display is big enough to help make your
photos and videos on the move that bit
more immersive and it's 720p resolution
is perfectly sufficient to make your
everyday essential apps look
satisfyingly crisp the phone runs were
latest shiniest version of Android known
as 5.0 lollipop which is free of any
kind of manufacturers skin that does
make it a lot less cluttered than many
Android phones which helps make it that
bit easier to use if you're new to
Android this phone is a great place to
start inside there's a 1.2 gigahertz
quad-core processor now that is pretty
low-end and it does show it did not
impress on our benchmark tests and I did
find the interface to be a little slow
to navigate at times still it's capable
of a spot of gaming and you're crucial
instagraming is handled perfectly well
it has functions like HDR mode and a
panorama mode as well and it's capable
of taking some good shots considering
the low price the only annoyance I did
have is that there's no tap to focus
instead you have to drag a focus point
around the screen which can be a bit
fiddly when you're in a hurry if you're
looking for the best technology found in
a phone and the Moto G isn't for you
instead why don't you go and take a look
at our video of the new Galaxy s6
however if you're after a solid
all-round phone that has 4G connectivity
for fast data and also comes with a very
low price the Moto G is a great phone to
consider I'm Andrew Coyle for CNET and
this is the motorola moto G</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
