consumption tablet the kindle fire for
only two hundred dollars now google has
introduced the Nexus 7 tablet with the
latest version of Android a quad-core
CPU a 1280 x 800 resolution screen and
with a price of only two hundred dollars
the nexus 7 aims at sites directly at
the kindle fire hi i'm eric franklin and
today i'll take a first look at the
nexus 7 tablet built by a sous the nexus
7 feels lighter than the kindle fire and
has this soft texture back it feels a
lot like a sers recent line of tablets
and makes it more comfortable to hold
physical features include a 1.2
megapixel front camera power / lock
button volume rocker headphone jack
microphone pinhole and a micro USB port
there are no expandable storage options
no HDMI out and no back camera though
the 7 has a 7-inch IPS screen which
gives it better viewing angles in the
kindle fire and actually a lot of other
tablets that don't use IPS or pls panels
the screen resolution is 1280 by 800 the
same as most 10 inch android tablets the
screen feels very responsive to tapping
and swiping typing also feels very
precise the tablet ships with Android
4.1 which updates Google Play to now
offer movie purchases TV shows and
magazines although the OS is just as
customizable as before the way is
presented on the tablet by default feels
more controlled and possibly a bit less
intimidating to the uninitiated Riptide
GP ran smoothly and of course includes
the Tegra 3 splashy effects also got a
1080p movie to place movie on the tablet
looking especially great on that 7-inch
screen where the pixels are really
packed in the Nexus 7 is currently
available on the google play store for
199 dollars for the 8 gigabyte version
and 249 dollars for the 16 gigabyte
however it won't start shipping until
mid-july so far I'm impressed with what
I've seen
the screen looks great feels responsive
and the tablet already demonstrates its
power well in games and movie
performance the lack of expandable
memory or back camera as a bummer but
it's understandable given the dirt low
price for something that feels very
well-built i'm eric franklin and check
out my full review my verdict on the
Nexus 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
