gaming the rumors are right both Sony
and Microsoft are coming out their
next-generation consoles this year but
without some killer games new hardware
doesn't really mean squat Donal Bell and
this top 5 I'll be counting down the
most anticipated video games of 2013
ranked by cnet senior associate games
editor Jeff Bakalar starting off at
number five watchdogs you're a hacker
assassin trying to purge corruption from
a futuristic version of Chicago is
bloody as beautiful as smart and it was
a breakout hit at last year's e3 but if
you're already a little paranoid about
the idea of Big Brother using your cell
phone signal to track you down and make
you disappear this game might just push
you over the brink an old friend returns
to us for number four Tomb Raider yes
Tomb Raider not a sequel but more of a
reboot prequel that means you get an
even younger Lara Croft instead of that
old hag from the original that's going
to be a darker grittier story line
that's the ball you won't have to wait
long release date is set for March 5th
at number three the last of us without
on may seven for PlayStation this is a
free CLE realistic game made by the same
studio responsible for uncharted the
world is hit by an apocalyptic plague
and you're hired to protect the young
girl as the world turns desperate and
violent not exactly light hearted stuff
but that's kind of the trend here seems
like all these game studios are working
on their own version of Citizen Kane
beautiful stuff about as far from Mario
Brothers as you can get another old
friend comes in at number 2 grand theft
auto 5 you ain't changes
this time around the game goes even
bigger with Los Angeles like city in a
storyline that will bounce around from
three separate characters now Rockstar
said a lot of fans when they announced
that this game would be delayed until
sep tember to get the necessary polish
but with a new crop of game hungry
consoles around the corner you know
they're feeling the pressure to get this
one out the door but if you think
building a virtual Los Angeles with
three alternating plot lines is
ambitious then you haven't seen our
number one pick for the most anticipated
game of 2013 BioShock Infinite traps
it's like playing a work of art get this
incredibly detailed world of Bioshock
but elevate it out of the scenes and
into a city that floats in the sky
gamers have been waiting a long time for
this one and if Elizabeth hype it need
to set the bar for the future of
interactive entertainment so there you
go five games that are going to keep
this year interesting add those up with
a new console you'll probably be buying
I think it's fair to say that you should
start saving up right now for more games
to drool over check out Jeff Bakalar
full list of the 25 most anticipated
games of the year over on cnet and for
more top 5s like this head over to top 5
