welcome the very first Wi-Fi system now
very quickly a system because it's come
with not one but up to three hardwired
units you can use one of them to connect
to an inner source such as the bar band
modem and it will look like a normal
router and that's it if you live in a
small home like 1200 square feet or
1,500 but if your home is larger you can
put the rest of the unit around this
unit here to automatically extend the
Wi-Fi coverage quick and easy now in
terms of performance the v√©lib here is
right in the middle between the Google
Wi-Fi and the net view orbit I have here
in my testing interval feature though it
actually the was among the three take a
look here the links is mobile which is
the only way you can set up and manage
the system gives very limited setting
and feature and that feature themselves
don't work very well either
now take parental control for example
you can elute to block websites such as
Facebook and in this case well I cannot
access it using the mobile web browser
anymore but the mobile apps still work
so it's kind of useless
but don't worry like a Wi-Fi system that
will be improved via updates and for now
develop or we have something that tops
them all the price is the most expensive
system on the market costing five a
dollars for three units or Sordo for one
unit if you want to get to unit 350 and
the Google Wi-Fi can be head for chest
through the dollar for three units and
the net give or be for hard dollars for
two units but here's the thing the SI
units of the or B has in-app Wi-Fi
coverage and faster Wi-Fi speed than the
three units of the ballot now the reason
why the links it velop is better than a
Google Wi-Fi because apart from being a
dual band Wi-Fi system that include one
five gigahertz band and one tubing for
the good band for the Wi-Fi clients to
connect to it also comes with a third
five good man to do the job of linking
the unit together
also known as the backhaul and that
means each band just have to either
receive or broadcast the Wi-Fi signal
not both we translate into faster Wi-Fi
speed now the orbit is very similar with
one major difference its third bike
whole band actually has twice the power
as that of develop and that means you
can place the extender unit even further
out can't increase the Wi-Fi coverage
while maintaining faster Wi-Fi speed so
long story short or thing considered the
links is developed here is a very
effective Wi-Fi system that will deliver
Wi-Fi to almost all corner of your home
but it is too expensive so maybe you
should wait for the price to go down
before getting your own in the mean time
I don't see and it wizened why you
shouldn't get yourself the net D or B or
the Google Wi-Fi you will save at least
$100 if you don't know what to do with
that saving well just send me direct
message
I will give you my mailing address
because I don't you pay panel bad more
supply crunch and that's because I'm
don't go and this has been mostly about
the linkage velop Wi-Fi system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
