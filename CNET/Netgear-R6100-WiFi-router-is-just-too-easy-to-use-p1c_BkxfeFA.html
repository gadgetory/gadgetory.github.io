new our 6100 Wi-Fi driver from Netgear
as you can see is like the mini version
of this our 6300 right here now mini
boost in physical size and cost this one
here costed about 99 dollars almost half
the price of this one the question is do
you get what you pay for the answer is
yes and now now let's start with the yes
first of all this is an 802 point is an
AC or AC for short browser the high end
is also very easy to use take a look
here that's a label right here to show
the preset of while is setting that's
all you need to use it but you can see
that actually put on top of the plastic
right here that can go off and you know
what off it goes but guess what there's
another one on the bottom right here
exactly the same and that's means you
have to practice right into power and
connect is internet port right here or
one port to an Internet source such as
the cable modem using a network cable
and you are done
in fact I've had this one a little bit
too easy to use because the cable itself
right here is also included and it's no
normal cable this is very special
because you have two ends
that's right and each end has a label by
itself that can be read from both sides
now this end say plug into your router
and this and here say plug into your
motor now you know exactly which end
goes into which now if you want to
further customize this router you can do
that too quite conveniently view is web
interface or mobile apps and fighting my
testing it up a very decent performance
- that's sad let's move on to what we
don't get and it's quite huge now first
of all this is a dual stream router
meaning that is supported to stream
standard of y5 offering up to only 867
megabit per second when used with AC
clients when he would end client only
300 megabits per second
other high-end router 3 stream can offer
up to 1.3 big appeal to second or
foreign a 55 megabits per second
respectively the second
also the big disappointment is the lack
of gigabit ethernet the rural come with
one one port and for land for years and
all of them provide only 100 megabit per
second speed that is much slower than
the rarest of Wi-Fi speed and it make
your y network very slow as also means
that if you have a very fascinated at at
home faster than I want her to make it
people to second this is not a router
for you and finally I find some of the
routers feature kind of limited for
example has a QoS feature that can only
manage the upstream and not the
downstream and also the peril control
feature which is very easy to use but
cannot be managed through its web
interface after install and the
application all have to use the Open DNS
website for that now in oh I like this
one
expecially for how much it cost but the
lack of Gigabit Ethernet is probably the
deal-breaker for many people for more on
this router here check out my full
review at calm and if you decide to get
one will feel free to play with the
network cable to plug whatever and do
whatever port you want you are allowed
to do that by me that's because I don't
know and this has been the first look at
the our 6100 Wi-Fi Baron from Nadia</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
