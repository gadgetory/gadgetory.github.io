two phones to debut androids latest
software and it's the first metal Nexus
to ever see the light of day it also has
a new fangled type-c charger that you
can plug in upside down or right side up
loud stereo speakers a 12 megapixel
camera that takes some pretty nice shots
and a fingerprint scanner on the back oh
and it also costs a little less than
most premium phones for a lot of
comparable features okay let's break
some of this down hardware we've got a
5.7 inch aluminum body that slim but
dense and just slightly top-heavy for me
it's a little clumsy to maneuver and I
have to sometimes adjust my grip to
reach the fingerprint reader on the back
about that the scanner is accurate and
holds up to five fingerprints it unlocks
the phone to and can authorize payments
using android pay it's convenient if
you're holding the phone but not if the
phone is flat on a table you have to use
the backup pin if you don't want to pick
it up you can double press the power
button to open the camera and the stereo
speakers can fill a room with audio
there's also a reversible type-c
charging port which supports fast
charging just make sure you buy extra
cables or keep yours with you because
your friends probably don't have one yet
the 12 megapixel camera uses a Sony
sensor and takes nice shots in daylight
night and low-light 8 megapixel selfies
are pretty good too one complaint is
that the photos come out more yellowy
than the real world but that's still
better than a bluish tint along with the
Nexus 5x the 6p is the first phone to
debut Android 6.0 marshmallow and that's
a big deal or is it Google now on tap
which suggests actions and information
based on what you're doing is the
breakaway feature here but I'm still not
convinced it takes a couple seconds to
load and the usefulness of the tips is
hit or miss I do like being able to ask
contextual questions like order her tour
dates when looking up a musician it
doesn't get in the way and you can still
access the typical Google now cards from
here there's a lot of competition on the
high end but if you love Nexus phones
and the less expensive Nexus price the
6p won't disappoint but it is large and
dense so fans of smaller phones should
also look at the Nexus 5x which comes in
at an even lower price I'm Jessica doll
court make sure you check out CNN com
for even more on the Nexus phones and
Android 6 point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
