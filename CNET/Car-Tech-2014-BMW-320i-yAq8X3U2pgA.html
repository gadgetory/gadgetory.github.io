simple car then it got real fancy and
quite a bit bigger except for this one
it's gotten quite a bit simpler let's
drive the 320i the baby 3-series and
check the tech now BMW doesn't really
punish you for being parsimonious this
320i looks really good basically as good
as all the other three sedans out there
unless they're heavily trimmed so you
can't spot one of these all that readily
from a distance notice these are only
available as either a four-door sedan
rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive you
can't get a 320 convertible or wagon and
the coupes of course have moved on to
become 4 Series now all the 3-series are
basically for doors or convertibles now
inside the 320i it's the way I think it
should be this reminds me of the first
320 I back in the late 70s lean and
spare you also notice that the seats on
this car are manual every single
adjustment for aft height altitude and
my seat back those are all levers you
don't see that very often even cheap
cars have power adjusters but not this
one stock now to go with this LCD
display which is standard you've got
this iDrive controller that is standard
but it's kind of stripped down the new
iDrive controller has a touchpad right
here for navigating and pinching and
zooming like on the map for example
don't have that here I point that out
because one of my gripes about BMW nav
systems is to move around the map or to
zoom in and out is kind of a drag going
over to this little stack of icons on
the left the new knob would have pinch
and zoom like you have on your
smartphone you do have the shortcut
buttons and the back button it's an
excellent button arrangement because not
everything is done by a turn a kick and
a click but one area where they actually
even thinned it out more is you don't go
up and down on this knob all it will do
is left and right it's really the
bare-bones version of their controller
but it works pretty well as we scroll
through here you see your sources are
pretty straightforward I've got an aux
plus USB Jack and here you've got to use
this little BMW pigtail to get into your
iOS device I tried it USB only not
working optical disc slot right here
obviously and that's about it for
sources you don't have bluetooth
streaming here only bluetooth calling
and you do not have any apps on this car
as its configured it's a real bare-bones
BMW radio however is am/fm with HD but
satellite is an optional upgrade the
dashboard is similarly classic you do
have the BMW fuel efficiency gauge which
I find to be comically kind of loose but
it's an old-school thing for them the
wheels traditional it's got the three
spokes the way they did a long time ago
this is a very heritage looking wheel
one choice on the gearbox you'll always
see this paddle shifter here no paddles
are available here though you do have a
shiftable gate on the left now down here
this comes on the cars it's not optional
sport comfort Eco Pro you'll see those
echoed up here on the dash and this car
has by default auto start/stop
technology your defeat button for it is
right there
unless you press that this guy's going
to die at a stop sign and then a restart
when you lift off the brake and along
those lines when you get into Eco Pro
it's going to do several things it's
going to ease back on throttle tip in
it's going to run the whole powertrain
more gently it's going to run the AC
compressor more judiciously
now in the engine bay we've got a little
motor it's the first time they've had a
4-cylinder least in the US market since
1999 I think this is a 2 liter what they
call a twin power turbo that is not a
twin turbo nut for an engine this small
instead it's a twin scroll single turbo
it's got two phases built into it some
numbers 180 horsepower 200 foot-pounds
of torque the car weighs 3,300 pounds
gets to 60 in 7.1 seconds you have a
choice of transmissions we saw the
automatic just now that's an 8-speed you
can also get a six-speed manual which
has the exact same 0 to 60 times and
gives up just 1 mpg on the fuel
efficiency and that's 24 City 36 highway
on this automatic that's why they put a
small engine in here now notice that
this car also has in addition to turbo
charging direct injection variable valve
timing all the modern tricks as the Big
Brother 328i
which uses the same 2-liter n20 engine
but gets a whole lot more power out of
it we'll talk about which of these cars
makes more sense when we look at our
pricing on this 320i at the end of the
piece
okay first thing I'm going to do here is
turn off the auto start-stop because I
hate that in gas engine cars it only
seems to work elegantly to me in an
electrified car which this obviously
isn't so that's defeated there we go
getting into it now I'm in sport mode
automatic shift there's not ample power
here that's the first thing I come away
with that's the biggest misgiving I've
got after that the suspension is soft
and not quite as sharp as I'd expect in
a 3-series
that's sort of a lesser complaint but
it's on there the handling is very
predictable though rear-wheel drive on
this car and the engine up front you
know it kind of goes where I expect it's
going to go as you knows it through a
corner little understeer there for the
most part as you'd expect it's really a
classic 3-series from back in the day
which I'm not sure was their goal but I
love it okay let's price our cheap and
cheerful little friend thirty-three
seven basically base 2,000 more for
xDrive all-wheel drive 6-speed manual
that's a $0 pick hello I'm in now is
where it gets interesting do you take
this guy's seen that style at all or do
you enjoy its simplicity if you want to
go see that style here's what you do
21:50 gets you nav with that cool new
touch pad version of the iDrive
controller the driver assistance package
just under a grand that'll get you Park
distance control and the rear camera you
may have noticed we were missing Sport
Package is a steal 1300 bucks for these
cool wheels the M steering wheel sport
seats and sports suspension that's like
robbery and then to add a moonroof which
we don't have here either that's a
little over a grand all in you're still
under 40,000 CNET style but I just
wonder if it's gilding the lily the
bigger question is do you buy this or a
328 let's compare them on some salient
details the 328 has 60 more horsepower
55 foot-pounds more torque shaves 1.3
seconds off 0 to 60 but does give up 1
mpg average it also includes some nice
extra equipment and the 328 is $4,500
more not trivial money still I tend to
lean that way as a smart buyer because
you're going to end up with
more of that BMW performance that that
badge promises and I think you're going
to get quite a bit better resale value
on the other hand this 320i speaks to me
as well because it is all about what
3-series used to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
