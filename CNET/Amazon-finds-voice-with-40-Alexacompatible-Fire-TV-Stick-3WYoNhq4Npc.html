USB stick Amazon's latest TV device
packs some big-time features for just 40
bucks
the sleek little stick is designed to
hide discreetly behind your TV it plugs
directly to the HDMI port and includes a
slick adapter in case the fit is too
cramped there's also a power plug so
what sets it apart from Amazon's
original stick and competitors like the
Roku streaming stick and a word voice
Amazon's new stick is the cheapest TV
device to include a voice capable remote
in the box you can use it to search
across numerous apps for TV shows and
movies launch apps and even ask it to
skip ahead although that last feature
only works with the Amazon videos for
now Amazon stick also has Alexa the
digital assistant found in devices like
the echo and dot speakers just like
those speakers the TV stick can read you
the weather look up local restaurants or
even answer weird questions it's a big
disadvantage compared to those figures
is that you'll need to have your TV
turned on to use it its main task of
course is giving you access to thousands
of streaming apps like Netflix Hulu
YouTube sling TV and PlayStation View as
well as to Amazon's vast collection of
TV shows movies and music for those
functions we still like Roku better
Amazon's
interface pushes you too much to consume
Amazon's own content as opposed to other
apps like Netflix and doesn't offer any
customization or price based search
results Amazon's has a new interface of
debuting later this year however that
could change the equation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
