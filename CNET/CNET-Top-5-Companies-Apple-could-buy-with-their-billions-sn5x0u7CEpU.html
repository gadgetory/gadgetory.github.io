with a cash stockpile of roughly a
hundred fifty eight billion dollars a
lot of people are wondering what Apple
will do with all that money
maybe they'll use it to coast along
comfortably as they fall into obscurity
but more likely I'll bet those folks in
Cupertino are saving up for their next
big play Donald Bell and today's top
five I'm counting down the five most
disruptive yet plausible companies the
Apple could buy with their billions
starting off at number five netflix
value that around twenty six billion
dollars Apple could scoop up Netflix and
still have plenty of money in the bank
Netflix would be a great complement to
the iTunes Empire and could really help
them dial in and control the experience
of their rumored Apple HDTV plus it
would scare the pants off Amazon if
that's not weird enough for you how
about number four Starbucks for around
fifty seven billion dollars Apple could
own every street corner in America and
control access to one of our favorite
legal drugs to lock it down Apple style
they could restrict bathroom access just
the customers with an iPhone send those
Android users across the street to pee
at the Taco Bell like animals back on
more plausible ground at number 3 Tesla
heck you could throw in 4-2 with
combined value of under a hundred
billion dollars Apple could take the bad
boy of automakers and the mom jeans of
automakers and create something as
disruptive to cars as the iPhone was to
smartphones tablets and laptops may come
and go but the car is not disappearing
from modern life any time soon you're
throwing that Starbucks purchase and
you've got a network of recharging
stations ready to go at number two buy a
carrier big guns like AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon
are just out of budget so I propose
Deutsche Telekom aka t-mobile an
underdog with something to prove
available for around 71 billion dollars
they're already giving AT&amp;amp;T Verizon
heartburn with their uncarrier tactics
now having Apple at the helm would
really scare them
granted you'd have to make the iPhone
exclusive to t-mobile but I'm sure the
Apple faithful would switch all the
other carriers would be left with
Samsung phone
and high prices all right and now my
number one pick for the company Apple
should acquire with their giant pile of
cash Comcast Tim Cook if you want to
make people stand up and Cheer your name
please apply the Apple magic and
simplicity to America's most infuriating
legal monopoly not only will you
essentially own the keys to America's
internet for around a hundred and thirty
two billion dollars but you'll get Time
Warner and NBC to boot you'll be a god
you can basically print your own money
usually no way you could possibly make
that god-forsaken anti-consumer behemoth
any worse so there you go five company's
Apple could easily snatch up with their
billions if you object to have other
companies to nominate you can tweet me
at Donald or head over to top-5 cnet.com
I'm Donald Bell thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
