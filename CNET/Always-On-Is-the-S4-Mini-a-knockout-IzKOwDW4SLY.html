smartphone I've dropped it a few times
when I go to the gym bad things have
happened to my smart phones dropped it
in water dropped it on the ground the
cement you know had it fly out of my
pocket while I'm running that was
running the treadmill
and I like to listen to my music while I
run so when I was moving my arms the
fella and it just hit the floor and then
the button started messing up so if you
notice I have an older Samsung phone and
honestly it would be really nice to see
you know what the newer models have and
you know in terms of durability so there
you have it some true stories about
Fitness disasters so I decided in that
spirit that me and the s4 mini do a
little workout today now I know you've
all seen this scenario nice little work
out on the treadmill phone precariously
placed running playlists going and then
No oh that can't be good
although actually seems totally fine so
far okay no problem I got to say I'm not
surprised because I personally have done
this with my phone I don't know ten to a
hundred times and it's been okay so far
but let's take it up a notch
am I gonna get
Oh
I don't think there's nearly enough
water on you
I'm still a duck Samar
you're doing fine wants to know if I
intended the pan left or right I'm just
gonna make sure it's all the way dry on
the inside but a little water spilled
probably want to replace your Klean
Kanteen because the lid leaks all the
time for the phone this total power
oh no bonus five
maybe we should do another set I think
one more think so too
oh that seemed terrible I guess it looks
possible that I have a little more curve
than I had before but this thing it's
pretty impressive I know this was like
disappointingly awesome look at that
no problem okay well there's only one
thing to do now since we are at a
kickboxing gym
all right this phone is proving a lot
tougher than I expected so we're getting
a little extreme I'm not saying that
this is something that could happen in
real life I just need to know ready
ready okay let's do this straight
I haven't even made a ASCO yet that's a
good one cocky I got cocky you spread
the legs a little bit circulars with the
weather there we go alright another chap
okay so clearly I have done zero damage
to that phone with my pink gloves so I'm
gonna turn it over to our pro Benton
alright I'm counting on you Benton I
want you to kill this phone not me
just okay I'll be right here
oh yeah keep going next Oh get it
the phone hates you the phone is selling
your secrets to the NSA yeah anything
nothing hold on oh are we gonna have to
move to the feet
seriously the phone is fine it's almost
completely fine it felt like an
earthquake back there yeah you turn the
camera off but the phone is fine okay
that you know what we're going nuclear
what's right it's time for the feet okay
I'm ready I want three good kicks and if
that bone doesn't die it is a pass okay
oh come on it was on the backswing
all right last one
I would not want to be that bone okay
let's answer you did it then I really
yeah yeah yeah that's what I'm talking
about
you care I like him getting into the
spirit he's like finally trying to break
that thing all day
I know okay so that apparently is what
it takes this phone is definitely
cracked let's you couldn't get out of
the tape here it's still coming on don't
get me wrong but we definitely have
cracked the screen a lot it's making
little it's making like sad little
noises but the screen no longer comes on
all right now we know that the Samsung
Galaxy s4 mini can take just about
everything except for the Benton kick
which no one can take never it's almost
still</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
