traditional SUV platform attend the 2015
navigator truly kerry lincoln luxury the
Lincoln Navigator shares its platform
and almost every bit of gear with the
Ford Expedition
that means traditional truck based
architecture which doesn't really lead
to a comfortable ride but it does mean a
lot of room in this big SUV I've got
three rows seating and big side windows
think of all the passengers a nice view
and Lincoln makes the Navigator
exceptionally easy to get into along
with the big door openings I've got
running boards that automatically lower
down and these handles on the a-pillars
a mouse could really easily get into the
driver's seat on the other hand I
imagine many navigators will end up
wearing livery and transporting pain
passengers and these rear seats really
look more like coach than business class
to me given the large size of this SUV
you'll be surprised it only has a 3.5
liter v6 under the hood but this engine
comes from Ford's EcoBoost line that
means it has direct injection and twin
turbos that gives it 380 horsepower and
460 pound-feet of torque that's enough
power to cruise this SUV but for passing
and merging I really have to get into
the throttle and fuel economy comes in
on the low side only 15 miles per gallon
city and 20 miles per gallon highway
that's probably due to the 6-speed
automatic transmission a couple more
overdrive years would probably lose the
highway fuel economy but also hitting my
mileage is the four-wheel drive option
with the selectable system I can choose
between rear-wheel drive four-wheel auto
or four-wheel drive which locks the
differential puts power to all four
wheels that may be useful in some areas
of the country but it takes about two
miles per gallon off my fuel economy
Lincoln tries to mitigate the ride
quality with what it calls Lincoln Drive
control with this system I can choose
between sport normal and comfort
settings that system effects suspension
steering and throttle but it doesn't
quite overcome the big jolts I feel in
the cabin when I go over bumps in the
plus column the Navigator has a really
good turning circle for such a big
vehicle electric power steering gives a
good boost and I can really crank the
wheel around and I haven't even noticed
the front wheels binding when I'm in
four-wheel drive mode for driver assists
I just have a backup
and a blind spot monitor those are
useful but Lincoln really should be
offering adaptive cruise control and a
surround view camera maybe even throw an
automated parallel parking this is
supposed to compete in the luxury
segment in the dash here I've got our
old friend my Ford I mean my Lincoln
touch the navigation system has
good-looking easy-to-read maps and they
do show live traffic but they take a
long time to fill in on the screen
there's no online destination search
here so I just have the usual address
entry and places of interest database
voice command works pretty well for
entering addresses and street address
including the city one thing to keep in
mind here is that this infotainment
system is headed for the scrap heap in a
model year to link it should be giving
the Navigator the names sync 3 system
which is much much better
all right let's price out our 2015
Lincoln Navigator base price for the
rear wheel drive model goes for 63,000
$115 delivered now had four-wheel drive
and we're looking at sixty six thousand
six hundred and ninety dollars we've got
the 101a equipment group on this model
which gives us the automated running
boards and Lincoln Drive control that
adds seven thousand one hundred fifty
dollars per total of 73 thousand eight
hundred forty dollars to be honest I'm
not really a fan of this class of
vehicle traditional SUV architecture
doesn't offer the comfort of a true
luxury car Lincoln makes a game attempt
at a luxury SUV with the Navigator
but it mostly comes off as a dressed-up
Ford Expedition
