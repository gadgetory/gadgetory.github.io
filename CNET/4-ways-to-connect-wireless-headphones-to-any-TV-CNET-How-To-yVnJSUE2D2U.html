others are trying to sleep or maybe you
prefer to block out the noise of your
surroundings while you watch your
favorite show
connecting wireless headphones to your
television doesn't have to be difficult
and there's a number of ways you can
pull it off regardless of what
television you have here are four of the
easiest ways one of the most
straightforward ways is purchasing a
pair of dedicated headphones that are
built for televisions these typically
come with a base station and connect to
your television using a 3.5 millimeter
jack RCA cable or optical and they work
over radio frequency instead of
Bluetooth which comes with one major
benefit range radio frequency headphones
typically have a range of about 300 feet
when they're unobstructed you can find
these radio frequency wireless
headphones for your television for
anywhere from twenty to three hundred
dollars and the audio quality will vary
greatly having a dedicated pair of
wireless headphones for your television
might have its own advantages but if
you've already got a pair of bluetooth
headphones you can actually connect
those to your TV and it might cost you a
lot less most televisions don't come
with Bluetooth built in but all you
really need is a Bluetooth transmitter
which you can find online or at a local
retailer for as little as fifteen
dollars basically this takes the analog
or optical audio signal from your
television and transmits it using
bluetooth so all you need to do is
connect this to your television pair
some Bluetooth headphones and begin
watching Apple TV fire TV fire TV stick
and some Android TV streamers allow you
to connect bluetooth headphones for
private listening however some Android
TV boxes only support bluetooth for
keyboard and mouse input and depending
on which model of Roku and Roku remote
you have you can either use private
listening through the Roku app or plug
wired headphones into the headphone jack
in the remote the Roku 3 roku premier
plus roku 4 and roku ultra all feature
this in their remotes and finally if you
have a gaming console plugged into your
television you may also be able to use
that for wireless audio
unfortunately bluetooth support for
PlayStation 4 is limited to specific
headsets and Xbox one doesn't support
bluetooth at all your best bet with the
PlayStation 4 and Xbox one is simply
plugging wired headphones into the 3.5
millimeter jack and the controllers some
Xbox one controllers have a 3.5
millimeter jack built-in while others
may require an adapter for more tips and
tricks and other how to's be sure to
