that only techies can understand despite
its name the cloud is simply the concept
of story and accessing your content over
the Internet as opposed to directly from
your computer that's it so here are some
of the best ways to store and access
your files folders and media online for
free Google Drive is the one I use most
primarily for work but also for personal
docs and projects honestly pretty much
everything I type is at least in an
untitled Google Drive document somewhere
drive offers 15 gigabytes of free
storage now unfortunately that spread
across all Google services including
gmail so if you send a large attachment
it counts against your storage now just
to be clear this isn't a pure cloud
storage option it's more like online
office not to be confused with
Microsoft's Office online of course
drives great you can pretty much store
anything you want but if you have a
Google account you already have access
to it so you likely have some experience
with it now if you want to just purely
store data in the cloud here are three
services that are perfect for doing just
that any files you copy into your sync
folder will show up in your cloud drive
so you'll be able to access the file
from anywhere and even if you delete the
sync files from your computer you'll
still be able to go to the internet and
access them each of these services allow
you to share files with anyone else
through email and each includes apps for
both Android and iOS if you're
interested in getting an initial 10
gigabytes of storage for free check out
box
the interface here is simple and
appealing but keep in mind for the
problem with box is that there's a 250
megabyte file size limit not very large
if you're planning to store audio or
video though most pics we'll make it
through just five you can upgrade to a
100 gigabyte capacity and increase the
minimum file size to five gigabytes now
Microsoft onedrive is useful for both
windows and mac users and it gives you
an initial 15 gigabytes of storage
capacity it also supports up to two
gigabyte file sizes also for every
friend you get to sign up you get an
extra 500 megabytes of storage up to
five gigabytes for a total of 20
gigabytes if you sink one drive with
your phone's camera you also get an
extra three gigabytes of storage now
what's really cool is that if I download
one drive to this computer I can then go
to another remote computer log into my
onedrive account and then access every
file on this computer regardless of
whether it was synced or not also if
you're willing to pay two dollars per
month you get 100 gigabytes of storage
and for four dollars you get a whopping
200 gigabytes pretty great deal if you
need a lot of storage lastly there's
Dropbox now this may be the most popular
of the pure cloud storage services
reason being it supports the most
platforms including Linux and blackberry
now right off the bat you only get two
gigabytes of storage but like one drive
each time you get a friend to join you
get an extra 500 megabytes of storage
added up to a limit of 16 gigabytes also
by linking your account to social media
sites like Facebook or Twitter or
setting up a mailbox account you get an
extra one gigabyte for each of those or
enable the camera upload feature and get
another three gigabytes so although
dropbox storage start slow you can
easily increase it at no additional cost
and if you're using the app or desktop
program there's no file size limit for
about ten dollars per month you can
upgrade to pro which gives you 100
gigabytes of storage for twenty dollars
you'd get two hundred megabytes and for
fifty dollars you get
500 gigabytes all these options are
great for storing your data in the cloud
overall onedrive has the best features
and is the best bang for your buck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
