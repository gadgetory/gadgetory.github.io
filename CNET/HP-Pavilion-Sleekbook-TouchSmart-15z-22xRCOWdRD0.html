look at the HP Pavilion sleek book touch
smart 15 Z you can juggle all those
different terms around any way you want
it basically tells you that this is a
member of hp's pavilion line which is
their kind of mainstream to budget line
it's also a flake book which means it's
thin kind of like what you hear about
being called an ultrabook except for
this is an AMD system not an intel one
and of course Intel owns that Ultrabook
name so when you have something that's
kind of like an ultrabook
people come up with their own terms for
it in this case it's sleek book which is
a little bit awkward also called a touch
smart because it has two not a
touchscreen and the 15z because it's a
15-inch laptop and z because it has a
thin z-axis i suppose you put all that
together and you actually get something
that is more impressive than these some
of its many names you get a fairly thin
fairly usable touchscreen 15 inch laptop
that starts at 650 dollars now we've
seen some inexpensive touchscreen
Windows 8 laptops already for about that
price they tend to be a little thicker a
little chunkier this guy is actually
really envy ibly thin I like that a lot
and unlike a lot of those other systems
that use Intel CPUs that have Intel's
built in HD 4000 graphics and D combines
a CPU and a basic slightly better than
discrete GPU to to form kind of one hole
so you get slightly better graphics for
playing games than you would from a
comparable Intel powered budget system
now how much better I ran one game test
on here and on an HD 4000 system it got
about 10 frames per second which is not
great I'm here it got 15 frames per
second this is all the native resolution
of 1366 by 768 which is again not great
but it's 50% better so if you turn down
the you know the settings and you play
some older games then you can actually
do a little bit of gaming on this guy
which is not something you can usually
do on a $600 laptop now of course you
have to keep in mind that price does
have some consequences this is made of
plastic and kind of glossy plans to get
which something fancy looking laptop out
their budget laptops always have kind of
some flex in the middle of the keyboard
which I'm not a big fan of and a
touchpad which is not a sensitive as it
should be probably the biggest drawback
here is the battery only lasted about
three and a half hours which is
certainly less than you would expect
from a thin a highly portable Ultrabook
style 15 inch because you really want to
take this with you all day long
ah but if you keep in mind that it is
$650 for a touchscreen Windows 8 laptop
that is going to pretty much do anything
you want to do in terms of web surfing
and social media and email in a thinner
package than pretty much anybody else
has at this price then it is definitely
worth a look I'm Dan Ackerman and that
is the HP Pavilion touch smart sleek
book 15 Z I think that's all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
