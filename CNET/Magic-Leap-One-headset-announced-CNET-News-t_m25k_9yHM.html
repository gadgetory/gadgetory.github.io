mixed reality goggles Wow
sort of hear me out the company launched
an update to its website officially
announcing what it's calling magic leap
1 there's a headset a wand controller
and a small circular processing unit
called light pack that you'll apparently
clip on your pants or wear like a belt
as a reminder magic leap is the company
responsible for those really cool promo
videos saying what you see is what you
get while wearing our headset which was
then roundly criticized by both the
public and the press as being slightly
faked the goggles you're seeing on magic
Leafs website this time are probably
Photoshop renders of the final product
which is being touted as a creator
edition no video of the device was
released either and the site says quote
product is continually advancing and may
be different at time of shipment unquote
so take all this with a grain of salt an
exciting grain of salt but a grain of
salt nonetheless that's not to say they
don't have something real though since
rolling stones Brian Crescenta reported
having used the device and checked out
half a dozen demos including a
science-fiction world but he didn't
actually describe the device in detail
there was a picture of the first
wearable version of the tech in the
article codenamed cheesehead from way
back in 2014
glad we don't have to wear that yikes
magic Leafs website is still scant on
actual details but they have some
information on how the technology works
in a small platform features section
which briefly discusses how things like
digital lights visual perception and
persistent objects come together to
create the experience the company says
it plans to launch a creator portal in
early 2018 with the headset shipping
same year that's pretty ambitious
considering we've never actually seen
the device out in public but if the
company can make good on its promises
could be a really exciting 2018 for more
