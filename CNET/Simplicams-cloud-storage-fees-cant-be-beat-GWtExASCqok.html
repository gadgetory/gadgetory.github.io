a review of the arcsoft simply can
simply cam has comparable features to
the 130 dollar balconette cam HD Plus
and the two-hundred-dollar Dropcam pro
but it has a few extra things that set
it apart from the competition you'll get
the same live streaming night vision
push notifications and optional cloud
storage but this one starts at just five
dollars a month compared to belkin
NetCam and the Dropcam pro which both
start at ten dollars so if you're
interested in cloud recording services
but don't want to spend that 10 bucks
this is a really solid option another
interesting thing it adds is face
recognition most of the other cameras
have audio or motion alerts simply cam
can actually detect a face and send you
an alert when it sees someone it's not
like Facebook where I can tell who it's
looking at just that it's looking at
someone you do have to subscribe to the
cloud service to get that feature though
the video quality is also really good
it's on par with a belkin netcam it
doesn't quite reach Dropcam pros 1080p
but at 720p it's still a really really
crisp image and the alerts worked really
well too I got a push notification
anytime motion sound or face was
detected but I did run into a problem
with email alerts I enabled them and
entered in two different email addresses
that i wanted alerts to be sent to and
never once received an email simply cam
is a really good security camera right
now and if it manages to fix some of the
glitches I experienced during setup and
also with the email alerts it has a
really really good chance of being a
competitor in this market thanks for
watching I'm Megan Willerton for Cena</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
