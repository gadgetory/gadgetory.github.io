high-priced cell phone bills I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update it
began with verizon and now 18t has
joined the data sharing movement
starting in August if you're a new
customer with AT&amp;amp;T you'll now be
choosing between mobile share plans they
give unlimited voice and text but you
pick how much data you need up to 10
devices can share from that bucket and
generally speaking ATT and verizon's
plan prices are pretty similar but
depending on your needs one can be
slightly cheaper if you have one
smartphone and all you need is one gig
of data a month 18t wins but as for the
carrier that gives you more choices of
data packages Verizon wins in a case
with two people each with one smartphone
most plans come out the same the higher
you go in data and the more smartphones
and tablets you add the monthly cost
gets more practical you know how when
you're out shopping and they tell you to
just buy three more things and you get
ten dollars off but you weren't going to
spend that anyway but now you feel like
you're going to be gypped if you don't
it's like that and there's more mini
tablet excitement we have word that
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is working on a new
7-inch nook tablet that will have some
revolutionary screen technology
something no other product has and we
could be seen it in the fall paypal has
agreed to acquire a startup called card
io which has technology that lets you
scan a credit card number just by taking
a photo of the card they say it's secure
Verizon's 4G LTE just keeps growing the
carrier added 33 more LTE markets so now
337 areas have access to the faster 4g
speed AT&amp;amp;T has it in 47 markets and
sprint just turned on LTE the sweep of
15 markets Marissa Meyers first day is
yahoo's new CEO the internet cried out
for her to save the photo sharing site
flickr dear marissa meyer calm has a
simple message please help make flickr
awesome again the founder of the site
says the core flickr community feels
that yahoo has neglected the once
popular site as takings now turn their
attention to apps like Instagram
when you go out thursday night to watch
the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises
look up at the sky some major cities
will be shining a cat signal similar to
Batman's bat signal but this isn't
something for Catwoman fans it's a stunt
by the Internet Defense League the group
hopes it will raise awareness to fight
off future internet censorship
legislation the founders have previously
rallied websites to protest bills like
SOPA and even if you're not one of the
areas with a signal you can always
donate 30 bucks to get your own personal
cat signal flashlight to strike fear
into the hearts of those who wish to
limit internet freedoms that your tech
