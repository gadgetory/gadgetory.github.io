taking a look at the LG LS XS 2 6-3 2-6
s this is a $1,500 side by side fridge
we're looking at a twenty six point two
cubic foot capacity with seventeen in
the fridge and nine point two in the
freezer so I like the way this fridge
looks it's a stainless steel finish it
looks like a big metallic box the
control panel is the only thing that I
think looks maybe a little dated and
maybe this is just my old thing but I
kept the buttons up here where it says
the ice type and it looks like you
should be able to press and scroll but
you got to come down here and hit ice
type to control the panel minor issue
but I was annoyed a couple of times so
yeah pretty standard looking but in an
appealing way middle-of-the-road $1,500
price but guess what this thing performs
like a champ on both the standard 37
degree test and the cooler 33 degree
test the middle shelves of the fridge
hit the mark exactly over a three-day
period it was awesome also if it's a
surprising amount of stuff better than
the other side by sides we've tested so
far you won't fit an extra large pizza
box in here it's too narrow for that you
also don't have a lot of options for
shelf positions there's really only two
choices for each that said you put one
on the lower side and one on the upper
side and you will have enough height for
your jugs of milk other tall items like
soda bottles and condiments you'll have
plenty of room for those on the nice
roomy door bins we actually fit more
stuff in here than we thought we would
when we tried to load it chock full of
groceries so it's not perfect it's
missing little amenities that I like
like spill-proof shelves humidity
sliders on the drawers and if you want a
cheaper option that does all of that
you'll find plenty in the top freezer
category of fridge but 1500 really isn't
a bad price remember you can usually
negotiate with large appliances and find
them cheaper than the MSRP and if you're
looking for a side-by-side in particular
the LG LS XS 2 6 3 2 6 s does really
well where it counts
and it's well worth your consideration
as a more than confident side by side

review on cnet.com for CNET
