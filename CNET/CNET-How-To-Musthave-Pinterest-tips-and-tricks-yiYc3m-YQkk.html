are you've heard some buzz about
Pinterest it's a new social network that
lets you visually bookmark and share
things you find on the web and from
other users on Pinterest it lets you
categorize things like recipes clothing
do-it-yourself projects or anything else
for that matter into boards once you see
something you like you pin it and add a
little description then categorize it
into one of your boards it'll be saved
to that board and show up in your
friends feeds so I have a board for all
the veggie recipes I find places I want
to visit and DIY projects I'll get
around to someday ladies are obsessed
with it but you gentlemen are more than
welcomed and encouraged to join once you
get the basics down like pinning reap
inning and creating your own boards its
super addicting I'm a little bit
obsessed too so here are my top tips for
making the most of Pinterest if you
haven't already installed the
bookmarklet lets you quickly pin things
you find around the web without having
to go to Pinterest first here's how it
works go to pinterest com / about /
goodies and drag this pin it button to
your bookmarks bar now when you see
something you want to pin it just click
this bookmark and select the image to
create your pin just like Twitter you
can connect with other people by
following them that also means you can
tag them pinterest lets you tag friends
and posts and comments to get their
attention about something you find in
the description or a comment type at
followed by the person's name select
them from the drop-down and they'll be
notified you tag them let's say a friend
and I have a joint obsession with
dessert recipes with pinterest
collaboration feature we can both
contribute to one pin board head to one
of your boards and click Edit board next
to who can pin select me plus
contributors and enter the name of one
or more friends they'll get an email
invitation and if they accept it they
can start contributing to the
board in general the more descriptive
your pin is the easier it will be to
find meaning more pins and more
followers and so on so think about what
people might search for to find your pin
then type a hash sign then the keyword
you can add as many as you want just
don't go overboard or it'll look a
little spammy now your pins will be
easier to find meaning you're more
likely to be repin if you want to find
out what's popular on pinterest from a
specific site it's easy this is one of
my favorite tricks just go to pinterest
com / source / the web URL like how to
cnet com and another / hit enter and
you'll see everything that's already
been pinned from that site if you have
any questions shoot me a tweet and
subscribe to my facebook profile for
