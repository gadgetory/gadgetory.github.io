adidas miCoach smart run this $400 watch
features a 1.4 5 inch touchscreen it
includes Wi-Fi GPS Bluetooth 4.0 and
accelerometer and even runs Android but
it's not a SmartWatch it doesn't run
apps it doesn't play games and it
doesn't show notifications this is a
standalone fitness watch the smart run
feels great in hand it's well-built
not too big and it's light enough for
everyday use I also really like how the
watch features two buckles which keeps
the watch nicely in place while you're
working out but the smart runs killer
feature an optical heartrate monitor on
the back of the device this means you'll
no longer be required to wear one of
those uncomfortable chest straps inside
there's 4 gigabytes of storage 3
gigabytes of which is dedicated for
music that's right it's also an mp3
player
there's no headphone jack so you'll need
a pair of bluetooth headphones
unlike the Fitbit force the smart run
doesn't track you 24/7 but when it's set
for a workout the watch displays
real-time information for things like
beats per minute calories burned pace
distance and time all of which is that
upload 2d this is my coach website from
here you can view past workouts track
your achievements talk with other people
and even download a training plan to
your device
adidas offers numerous cardio and
strength programs to choose from
depending on your sport and skill level
once it's installed
virtual coaches will remind your speed
up or slow down to reach your ideal
heart rate adidas hasn't even gone ahead
include the voices of athletes Reggie
Bush and Derrick Rose to help get you
motivated now you have to be wondering
with all these sensors and features
what's the deal with battery life
well Dinah's promises up to 4 hours of
usage in training mode with music
playing if you turn the tunes off and
enter marathon mode the battery life
jumps to about 8 hours and if for some
reason you're using it solely as a watch
it can last up to 14 days our early
tests have shown that battery life is
definitely going to be an issue but
luckily the watch charges in under 4
hours but if you leave this little thing
home you're going to be in trouble the
smart run uses a special dock that
contains a microUSB port for charging
its 410 million
battery I'm Dan Graziano frisina and
that was a first look at the adidas
