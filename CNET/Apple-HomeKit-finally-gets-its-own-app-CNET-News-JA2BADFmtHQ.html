see your own personalized wallpaper and
all of your accessories no matter who
they're made by and you can control them
so easily if you want to turn on a light
of course just tap it if you want to
adjust the dimmer we'll just pressing a
little harder and slide and you can
adjust the dimmer just like that so you
can tap tap-tap across all the
accessories in your home but sometimes
you'd like to trigger a change to all of
them and for that we have something we
call scenes so for instance if you want
to get ready for bed you can tap
goodnight you'll see that close the
living room shades lock the front door
adjust the thermostat all in one step
now Siri knows how to interact with
scenes as well so if in the morning you
say good morning to Siri
well Siri can automatically get your
home all ready for you for the day and
you can also control your accessories
without launching an app at all because
home kit is actually built right into
control center swipe up control center
you can swipe over to see your home
controls with just a tap for instance
open up your garage door now home kit
takes advantage of our interactive
notifications as well so if someone
rings the doorbell for instance you can
tap in and actually get a live feed of
your front door camera talk to them on
the intercom if you want and even unlock
the door alright from the lock screen of
your iPhone now yeah
now since your Apple TV is always on
always plugged in and always on the
network in your home it can serve as a
secure point for remote access and
automation within your home so when
you're on the go you can actually access
all of your accessories securely
end-to-end encrypted and you can set up
automation like geo fences so that when
you roll into your driveway you can make
sure that the garage door will open the
lights will turn on and maybe even the
hot tub will start up in the back for
you all automatically now the home app
is great on the iPhone it's also
fantastic on the iPad as well so many
people like using the iPad as the
ultimate home control device whether
mounted on the wall or on the coffee
table and of course there's nothing
beating the remote that you always have
with you right on your wrist
the Apple watch it comes with built-in
home control support as well so that's a
quick update on home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
