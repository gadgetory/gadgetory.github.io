this is the sony MDR ZX 770 BN a $230
full-size bluetooth headphone that has
active noise-cancelling as geared toward
frequent travelers because it can be
also used as a wired headphone on
flights that prohibit the use of
bluetooth Sony also seems to be
targeting consumers who can't quite
afford the Beats Studio wireless but who
want a quality wireless headphone that
shares many of its features including
that aforementioned noise cancelling and
this is a quality bluetooth headphone
though not quite as good as the Beats
it's comfortable with memory foam in the
ear pads and seems pretty steadily built
but it's not quite as comfortable as the
beats isn't sturdy and doesn't sound as
good though it's very good for Bluetooth
one thing you have to make sure of when
you first run the headphones is that you
have them in the right listening mode
turns out the headphones have three
levels of sound quality which I didn't
realize at first there's a standard
quality mode that puts the priority on a
stable Bluetooth connection that cuts
down on the sound quality and appears
the headphones mic ship in this mode
what you want is one of the two higher
quality modes one of which includes app
tech support for smartphones that offer
this alleged enhanced bluetooth
streaming option as I said you can use
this as a wired headphone but you can't
turn off the noise canceling in Wired
mode the headphone sounds slightly
better in Wired mode but it doesn't
sound fantastic the noise canceling
works pretty well and has three
different modes to choose from depending
on your environment but it's not quite
on the level of boses quiet comfort 25
which is a dedicated noise cancelling
headphone and has no Bluetooth as far as
other extras go
you do get NFC tap to pair technology
and the aforementioned app tech support
battery life is rated at decent 13 hours
with noise canceling and Bluetooth
turned on color options include black
and the blue finish you see here and the
headphone shipped with a simple
protective pouch plus a headphone cord
and a USB charging cable the $150 MDR
zx7 70 bt is very similar to this model
but doesn't include noise cancelling
you don't need that feature and are just
looking for a wireless headphone that's
the model to get if you want both noise
cancelling and bluetooth and don't want
to spend upwards of $300 to get those
features the MDR zx700 en is certainly
worth considering I'm David Carr noise
