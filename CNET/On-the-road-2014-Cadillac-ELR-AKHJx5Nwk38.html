Chevy Volt with the style and technology
of a Cadillac but is it really the
peanut butter and chocolate experience
they promise one more like peanut butter
in caviar
let's drive the 2014 Cadillac ELR and
check the tech so what is an ER well
it's a compact cup same class as a Honda
Civic or a VW Golf and while it is a
sibling to the Chevy Volt it's actually
11 inches longer although you wouldn't
know it judging by this stubby nose
under that aluminum hood the rest of the
car seems to be a shrunken down cts
coupe overall the presentation is a
little too much like a little bronze
baby shoe do this don't do that first
off the cabin of the CLR fits it's
top-of-the-line image very futuristic
they've really sleek tout the Cadillac
look and of course no mechanical gauges
anywhere in the car also notice what
else is missing look around for a second
not a knob in the entire vehicle
everything is either touch sensitive or
some kind of a very nicely done button
here on the wheel you've got a couple of
rotators here on the stalk but this is a
very future interface which can be good
or bad sometimes they just don't want to
fiddle with this touch thing over here
to do the volume it's also got haptic
feedback and I think car makers are
learning that there is a place for
mechanical controls now here on the head
unit you've got kind of everything in
the home screen navigation and this car
it's real nav not just the OnStar Nav
audio system you've got every possible
source you want in there phone with
bluetooth streaming of course Pandora
sits all by itself over here not under
audio which then goes under radio and
other sources so they still got this a
little bit scattered here's where things
get a little bit tech for Texas sake
though and it's a theme we're gonna see
around the cabin now there's the radio I
just went to it and I'm seeing it with
all of its full information now give it
a second
now you see it winks out to a minimized
display and doesn't come back until I go
to reach it and the proximity sensor
brings it up very cool very stupid
what's the point why don't I want this
up all the time when it strips down to
less it doesn't get me anywhere it just
shows they could do it what I really
want is a real back button an actual
button not one of these constantly
moving variations of back and exit
buttons that show up in different places
on the touch screen as you may have
noticed in that you've got pause play
radio so you can hold things when you're
gotta be distracted and then get back to
your favorite broadcast now tech for
tech sake continues here here's your
door over the cupholders which normally
would be one of these things it's kind
of spring actuated but here it's like a
DVD player tray it's actually got a
motor but it's not very elegant the way
you use it you got to kind of burp it to
start and then it continues the rest
that doesn't necessarily make the
experience any better it just shows that
Jules Verne still works at GM ditto for
the glovebox door I don't need a button
over here to operate a servo to open the
glovebox which also my hand goes to that
button re proximity senses the radio for
no reason things are a little better on
the instrument panel over here on the
left side you see your battery charge
indicator on the right is your gasoline
level indicator and then you've got four
different instrument panels you can
choose from you've got classic modern
classic enhanced and modern enhanced I'm
not sure I need four but they are
meaningfully different maybe split those
two across to you get a lot of good
information in there about the vehicle
how you're driving it's good coaching I
especially like that gauge on the left
it shows you how you're accelerating but
also how you're braking it's a key tool
to teach you momentum conservation which
is really important to getting the most
out of your car's energy source whatever
it is now in light of all this
futuristic - it's kind of surprising to
see a very traditional looking PR NDL
automatic style drive selector really
more than a transmission control rear
view camera is of course standard it
just gives you trajectory doesn't have
any multi views there's no forward cam
there's no around camp and then
underneath the mode control is your
whole driving personality you start off
in tour which is your basic comfort mode
sports gonna make the accelerator
steering and suspension more aggressive
and then mountain is going to make a
more aggressive recharge profile because
it knows you're going
going up a grade quite a bit finally
you've got paddles on the wheel but
these guys do is do adaptive on-demand
regeneration so when you pull on one of
these you go into heavy regen it drags
the car back kind of like compression
braking in a combustion engine but in
this case it's more aggressively using
the regen of the motor engine combo to
charge the battery more and allows you
to put some drag on the car
it's either great if you're going down a
hill or if you want to do some cornering
and use this as kind of your braking to
turn in it can be used different ways I
don't think many drivers are gonna think
about it that way now one of the stubby
aluminum hood you've got basically a
hotted up volt voltec power system here
this is a 1.4 liter lean burn gas engine
which is basically there to drive a
generator to juice up the big old
battery that will then drive a 55
kilowatt traction motor that really
moves the car front-wheel-drive no
all-wheel drive option on this guy we're
looking at numbers that are 181 total
horsepower 295 foot-pounds of torque
remember it's electric very torquey
thing by its nature the whole machine
weighs 4050 pounds zero to 60 and 7.9
respectable seconds now some fuel
economy numbers gets a little odd here
eighty-two mpg e when you're running an
electric mode and you've got 37 miles of
pure electric reigns on a full charge by
the way and then you get 31 35 mpg when
you're running with the gas engine fired
generating juice as it goes to run the
electric motor it's a dual mode
situation on these range extenders your
total range gas and electric combined is
345 miles and charging is funny on these
cars it's four to five hours for a full
charge from flat on a level to 240 volt
charger but remember this isn't strictly
a battery electric car as long as you
have gas it'll make electricity and run
itself so it doesn't have range anxiety
the first thing I noticed in the ELR is
the most atrocious brake pedal feel I've
ever driven it kind of comes on in two
stages that are both kind of hard to
modulate smoothly the first one is just
operating regen it feels like and then
as you push further then the service
brakes kick in but they kind of kick in
like that if they go over a notch I mean
really awful but after that you start to
get absorbed and they're really smooth
and quiet ride quality in this thing
they've really smoothed it out and it
doesn't hurt that you've got 435 pounds
of a t-shaped battery underneath me kind
of going this way and then spreading
across the back does wonders for keeping
a car planted and very very solid and
fighting back against road vibrations
but then all that beautiful smoothness
is shattered
once you use up the battery like I just
have and the engine kicks in and it
actually vibrates the brake pedal and
the steering wheel I'm kind of shocked
by that
so in electric mode great smooth ultra
luxury car with a very good job managing
engine whine and gear gnash not every
electric car has that figured out but
man when that little generator engine
kicks in it's a different vehicle now my
other gripe is this doesn't feel that
fast I mean on paper it's two seconds
faster than a Nissan Leaf this doesn't
feel like it to me for some reason I've
I've run it through tour and sport mode
and there's never a crisp sort of a get
up and go from the electric power that
I've come to know in so many V's it's
definitely what I say
sprightly but that nice sharp kick in I
guess it's there I don't know I wasn't
impressed by that cornering of course is
pretty darn good because you got all
this weight well over two tons and it's
it's low and well spread across the
underside and of course the backseat
room is is kind of a nothing I mean you
you can't sit behind me when I'm in this
car there is no way there's just you
know what a couple of inches of legroom
back there this is the less practical
sister of the Chevy Volt
okay let's press our ELR I'd like you to
sit down for this part $76,000 base
that's a problem but we're not done to
get it seen that style you got to spend
seventeen hundred bucks for the luxury
package that gets you 20s intelligent
headlights and the blind spot and cross
traffic tech and then an adaptive cruise
control package is nearly two thousand
dollars more all in were right up
against eighty thousand dollars before
federal and state tax credits that could
easily be ten grand let's keep that in
mind still we're looking at a $70,000
very small Cadillac with two doors and
silly back seats that isn't that much
different a performer than a Chevy Volt
and can't hold a candle to a Tesla Model
S which is thousands less Cadillacs
doing a lot of great cars these days I'm
afraid this just isn't one of them
largely based on its price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
