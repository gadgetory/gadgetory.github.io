Wilson Tang on cnet com and it's time to
get loaded Amazon's Kindle Fire was
released to great demand a few weeks ago
according to the online retailer that
fire was the most successful product it
has ever launched but enthusiasm for the
fire may be waning user and professional
reviews across the web are panning the
user interface and awkward button
placement or just lack of buttons all
together in the face of turning opinion
amazon has declared that it will be
releasing an update in the next two
weeks that promises to improve
performance across the board and think
some outstanding user interface issues
still for just two hundred dollars we
can't help but feel that the fire is
still a steal speaking of low-priced
tablets HP we started its touchpad fire
sale this sunday night at seven p.m.
eastern and units sold out within
minutes the 16 gigabyte touchpad sold
for just a hundred dollars while the 32
gigabyte version sold for a hundred and
fifty dollars the original webOS tablets
from HP may have failed but that doesn't
mean that the operating system is dead
after weeks of speculation HP's new CEO
Meg Whitman announced on Friday that it
will be open sourcing webOS the move
while a dramatic change considering HP
bought software and company for 1.2
billion dollars was viewed by many as
the safest way for HP to capitalize on
some of the developer and tech
enthusiasts love for webos the company
however says don't expect any new webos
products to be available in 2012 a more
mobile OS news google has updated the
web version of its android market with
new sorting and display options that
hopefully will help would be at buyers
find better apps each review will now
display the mobile device that it was
reviewed on and users can sort reviews
by helpfulness date or rating the new
features haven't made their way into the
android market app yet though a more apt
news Apple announced that the Mac App
Store has officially surpassed the 100
million download mark the pc software
app store is available only on Mac OS 10
version snow leopard and lion and while
100 million apps sounds like a lot keep
in mind that apple recently reported
that the mobile iOS App Store averaged 1
billion monthly downloads and over 18
billion apps have been downloaded since
its
in 2008 finally in some industry news
companies and analysts are sending
positive reports about parts of the
industry while other reports don't look
so cheery first the bad news due to the
flooding in Thailand Intel is
forecasting that it will take a hit to
its business by a billion dollars
because of the hard drive shortage in
the meantime Samsung reports that it
believes it will sell 300 million
handsets and Apple's MacBook Airs
expected to be the top ultrabook of the
season both sets of devices do not use
hard drives those are headlines for
