welcome to tap that app I'm antuan
goodwin this is the show where we talk
about the hottest apps in the mobile
space these days I spend more time
listening to podcast than I do listening
to music there's so many good shows
about technology and cars and Android
now iphone users have got it easy
podcast management's built right into
itunes but Google's left its podcast
loving Android users out in the cold
without a native podcast subscription
service fortunately there are a few good
pod catching apps available in the
android market dog catcher puts your
favorite audio and video podcast at your
fingertips with a set of options that
allow users to be as basic or as complex
and granular as they'd like to be if you
want dog catcher to just download the
newest episode of every subscribed show
it can handle that if you want to set
the auto downloader options on a per
show basis dogcatcher can do that too if
you only want to download podcasts when
your phone's plugged in and on Wi-Fi
you're good to go this app also allows
resume playback so you can pick up your
shows where you left off now the on pod
offers just about all of the
functionality of dog catcher but adds
the ability to separate your podcast
into categories so you can keep your
comedy podcasts separate from your tech
news podcast now categories come into
play with a cool feature called Smart
Play that lets the user micromanage what
feeds get add it to the playlist and in
what order so if you like to start your
day with the latest news show then
listen to three comedy shows and then
finish up with the oldest episode of
your favorite internet radio drama
beyondpod will accommodate beyondpod
also offers a tablet optimized version
for honeycomb users both dog catcher and
beyond pod are going to cost you about
seven dollars each however beyondpod is
free for the first seven days for those
of you who like to try before you buy I
think that either of these apps is worth
every penny if you subscribe to a bunch
of audio and video podcasts the app that
will be best for you will depend on
which interface you like the best
whichever podcast manager you choose be
sure to fill it up with C net podcast
which you can find over at cnet com
/ podcasts and if you've got an app that
you would like to see us tap send it to
tap that app at cnet com I'm antuan
goodwin and if you'll excuse me I've got
to tune in to the latest episode of tap
that app weird</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
