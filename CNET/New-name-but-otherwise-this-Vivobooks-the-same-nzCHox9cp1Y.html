looking for a Windows 8 laptop what
exactly do you buy that's a pretty
confusing landscape with all these flip
tops and the safest bet tends to be
right now a standard laptop with a
touchscreen the price for a lot of these
laptops has been centering around seven
hundred dollars as of late and the asus
vivobook s400 CA offers that package for
seven hundred dollars a pretty good deal
when you realize that it's got a core i5
processor 500 gigabyte hard drive for
gigs of RAM and most importantly a 14
inch touchscreen with nice glass on edge
to edge over here now that sounds nice
but the battery life on this laptops a
little lacking it's not as good as you
would find on a lot of other ultrabooks
and this really is a big-boned ultrabook
it's heavy it's four pounds which is
more than you'd expect for something
that looks like this and it's a little
thicker than you'd expect it's in that
14-inch ultrabook territory lacking a
DVD Drive which wouldn't be a
deal-breaker except for the fact that
the acer aspire m5 i just recently
reviewed has a DVD drive at the same
price with a backlit keyboard this one
does not have a backlit keyboard and the
overall feel is solid it's a nice design
nice brushed metal feel on the back two
tone black and silver but it feels like
a couple of corners have been cut when
you compare it to a super slim laptop
like the zenbook aces top-of-the-line
ultrabook category that came out over
the past year the vivobook is a new
class of laptop by name this crazy
vivobook what is exactly does that mean
well it's basically a regular laptop
with a new name trying to emphasize the
fact that there's a lot of touch
involved here with the touch screen and
a very large pretty comfortable touch
pad nothing like as good as a macbook
air my opinion but it's pretty good in
the windows 8 universe all in all it's
an okay laptop it's a pretty good value
it's a somewhat forgettable final
product that definitely covers all the
basis if you're looking for but a
guarantee you're going to find a lot of
laptops like this out there at that
price range and by this time next year
that's going to seem like a lot of money
for this but even at the beginning of
2013
I think they're going to be a lot of
laptops coming out better offer similar
value may be even better if you feel my
enthusiasm flagging just a little bit
for this laptop it's because we've seen
a lot of these before this touchscreen
laptop that's your standard issue right
in that seven hundred dollar price range
the vivobook doesn't really rise above
the competition and provide anything to
write home about but it's not a terrible
deal if you happen to buy one I'd hold
out I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at
the asus vivobook s400 CA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
