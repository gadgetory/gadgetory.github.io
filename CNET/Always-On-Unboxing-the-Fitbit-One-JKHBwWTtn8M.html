which replaces the Fitbit ultra and
don't be fooled by this gigantic and
somewhat dangerous looking box the
Fitbit is tiny and you wear it on your
body when you're exercising alright
let's get it out of here wasteful
packaging so you may remember last
season as I mentioned earlier I tested
this guy against the Nike FuelBand there
were a few things about it that I didn't
love one was its lack of wireless
charging unless you were within a few
feet 10 feet I think of the base that is
fixed in this version and it also gets
sweat proof and waterproof too actually
think is a huge improvement water
resistant okay it comes in black and
burgundy we got the black model it is
small at first blush it's very obviously
smaller than the initial Fitbit and this
guy just basically clips on to your
clothes somewhere you wear it all the
time when you're walking when you're
working out when you're sleeping it's
pretty much Fitness data porn okay not
level it's packaging nothing nothing hip
or cool about all this like plastic junk
really
this thing up there we go okay here you
have your guide to the Fitbit
hieroglyphics one of my least favorite
things about it is that the feedback
mechanism is just completely baffling
you get a flower that grows the more
activity you do and then look if you
just press these buttons to get the
series of different numbers there is a
slightly different from the other ones
okay this is inside the box our little
sleep armband you actually tuck this
into the bands and you wear it while
you're sleeping and then it can actually
tell when you're in a deep sleep or not
when you're moving around and you can
use it to get kind of data about how
well you sleep that's a cool nerdy
feature that a lot of people like and I
personally think that sleep is a much
overlooked component of your overall
health
nerdy oh alright there's a new little
case for it with a clip that's probably
what helped this actually this is
probably why it's water-resistant
because now there's a rubber case for it
here's our charging cable for the dock
this is actually nicer and much tidier
and smaller than it used to be oh that's
a short little cable okay
there's no power adapter here so you're
just gonna have to plug this into your
computer and charge that way okay let's
get the actual Fitbit up I was stalling
because it appears to be attached by
many many little annoying plastic things
there we go okay Fitbit look how tiny
see if it'll come on
ah there we go Fitbit man this is small
now I know that that's a plus in some
ways but one of the things that happened
to me a lot with the original Fitbit is
that I left it places and or lost it
it's a little more easy to keep track of
easier to keep track of when it's in
this little thing here there we go
it's already wanting to measure my steps
look it's taken 248 steps since it was
born it's like a baby giraffe alright
let's go through the specs specs on the
Fitbit are pretty straightforward I
mentioned it comes in two colors black
and burgundy it has this Oh le D display
battery life is great
5 to 7 days before you have to charge
this guy you can get Fitbit software for
both PC and Mac when you sign up at
Fitbit comm you can track and log your
activity your food your sleep your water
intake your body mass and your weight
when you press the button on the front
of the Fitbit you change the display and
it cycles through steps distance
calories burned floors climbed this is
just an estimate and the flour of course
which grows and shrinks based on your
activity there is also a handy little
clock wireless syncing with the Fitbit
one is improved it now includes
Bluetooth syncing with iOS or your
computer unfortunately that is not yet
available for Android and like the
Fitbit ultra the Fitbit one will
automatically sync whenever it's within
20 feet of its charger so the Fitbit one
cost $99 there's also a new version
called the Fitbit zip that's a little
cheaper about 60 bucks I'm thinking you
might want to look into that one if
you're interested in the Fitbit I'm a
little concerned about the size of this
and the fact that it comes with two
separate pieces although look if you are
into tracking every single element of
your personal life the or activity your
workouts your sleep you're never gonna
get more fun data porn then you're gonna
get with Fitbit I also like the fact
that it does wirelessly sync over
Bluetooth and it's available for iOS and
Android which FuelBand cannot say
no pip it has its fans I want to love it
but it's just not my favorite it's real
cute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
