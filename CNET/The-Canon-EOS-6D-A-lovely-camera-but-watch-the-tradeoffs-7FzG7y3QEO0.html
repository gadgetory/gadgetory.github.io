cannons targeting with the EO 60 its
budget full-frame camera on one hand
it's got some fairly consumer II
features gps check built-in Wi-Fi check
single SD card slot check you finder
with less than 100 percent coverage
check wimpy autofocus system check on
the other hand it's missing things like
a built-in flash that you'd expect in a
non pro camera but it's not that the 60
isn't a really nice camera I happen to
like it a lot
it's got great photo and good video
quality a relatively fluid operational
design with a soft shutter action and a
solid but not weatherproof build photos
are everything you'd expect from a
full-frame model sharp with good tonal
range and they're usable well into the
higher ISO sensitivities with lots of
details in the highlight and shadow
areas the Wi-Fi implementation fares
pretty well as long as you bypass all
the stuff that requires a Canon Image
Gateway membership such as direct
uploads to other websites the camera
remote app lets you change shutter speed
and aperture ISO sensitivity and
exposure compensation which is a lot
more than you get with other apps as
usual the GPS operation was pretty
spotty here in New York City I could get
a signal while shooting in Union Square
but practically nowhere else and if I
forgot to turn it off during the battery
by incessantly hunting for a signal
that's par for the course though my
biggest gripe is probably the somewhat
sluggish autofocus performance while the
counter performs pretty quickly in good
light and it has a reasonably deep
buffer to maintain its 4.5 frame per
second continuous shooting rate the
autofocus really slows down in dim
conditions I think what's most
frustrating is that the 60 should be
clearly better than the older cheaper 70
and it's not well the 60s full-frame
photo quality noticeably outshines its
aps-c based siblings and it has a much
broader feature set in checkbox' ways
the 7d has a better view finder faster
autofocus a more durable
mechanism and an extra custom setting
slot just to mention a handful of things
if you're thinking of moving up from one
of canons aps-c based models like the
60d it's definitely worth it for the
photo and video quality if you're
considering it instead of one of the
more expensive full-frame models it's a
fine alternative if you don't mind the
ninety seven percent coverage viewfinder
single card slot less durable shot or
lack of a headphone jack
fewer customizations in all those other
little ways in which you might have to
compromise I'm Laurie grinning and this
is the canon eos 60</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
