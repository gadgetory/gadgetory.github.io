love-hate relationship with the iPhones
default alarm clock sound marimba sounds
like a cuckoo clock that Jimmy Buffett
would use to remind him that it's
margarita time on the other hand at this
point I've heard it so many times it
actually works as a kind of Pavlovian
trigger to get me out of bed but if you
can't stand to listen to the marimba one
more time here's a quick tip for setting
the iPhone to play your own music as
your alarm now if you're starting from
scratch head into the iPhones clock app
and hit the plus button to create a new
alarm set the alarm down here at the
bottom and then up here where it says
sound click marimba and you'll be taken
to another screen where you can choose
from other ringtones or pick a song from
your music library to do that tap pick a
song and then you'll be taken to your
music library which you can sort by song
or artist or album to find something
that you like now once you find the
right song tap it and you'll hear a
preview of what it will sound like raise
the volume level to get a sound this can
be loud enough to wake you up and then
pop the back button to stop the freedom
the sound selection should now show the
title of the song you selected now to
set the alarm tap the Save button and
then you're all set now what if you want
to change an existing alarm or you've
gotten used to setting alarms through
Siri here's what to do open up the clock
app and make sure you're in the alarm
tab hit the edit button at the top and
then find the alarm you've already set
tap it and it should take you to that
same menu we saw before we can select
the sound and then hit save that's all
there is to it now instead of waking up
to this you can wake up to this I just
