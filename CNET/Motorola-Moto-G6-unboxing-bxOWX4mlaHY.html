six this is right in the middle of the
series with the G six plus on the higher
end and the g 6 play on the lower end
this is not going to be the box that you
pick up at stores this is what they sent
me as a room viewer I can already tell
it's different when I open it up in fact
and the retail box doesn't come out it's
basically welded in here and I've got a
charm
a charming charm of a phone this of
course
points to Motorola as the maker of the
first modern cell phone adorable buttons
don't do anything well set that off to
the side and I'm gonna have to kind of
pry this box top off let's see what they
sent me they sent me the 32 gigabyte
version black and three gigabytes of RAM
so that's what we've got here too bad
because the phone does come in other
colors that I think are a little bit
prettier so here is the device right off
the bat we see a 5.7 inch screen this is
an LCD display I'm turning it over I'm
looking at it and this is really
beautiful it's got this curve to Gorilla
Glass 3 on the back this is the first
time we're actually seeing a glass
backing for Motorola it does look very
elegant in fact it looks like the phone
could cost two three times the price
just based on the design alone and
already I see that my fingerprints are
getting all over it which is typical you
can get a case if you hate it or just
learn to carry around the cloth I'm very
happy to announce that there is a
headphone jack a price by the way is
going to start at $250 so that is great
like I said before the design is just
really nice really beautiful curves
everywhere I'm actually going to put
this aside for a second and see what
else is in the box pretty much standard
stuff from what I'm guessing we've got a
sim ejector tool which I always like to
see not only can you put the SIM card in
but you'll have external storage up to
128 gigabytes we also have the requisite
pamphlets with safety information and
whatnot and we have the charger so this
is a turbo charger it
15-watt it's gonna be a little bit
faster than last year's 10:1 but if you
want even faster charging speeds you
have to go up to the Moto G six plus and
now one thing I'm actually pretty
excited about and this is frankly the
last thing in this box this is the it is
basically the USBC charger and this is
another first for the Moto G series the
most budget series well the best of the
budget series I should say and that is
because last year's G series that had a
micro USB charger port and going up to
the USBC is great because this means
that it's now standard and of course you
can plug it in either which way we've
got the camera bump on the back that's
pretty typical for Motorola design we've
got a 12 megapixel sensor and a five
megapixel sensor right next to it on the
front you've got an 8 megapixel lens so
that's that's pretty good for a $250
device we'll have to see what the camera
quality is like okay so this was our
unboxing of the Motorola MOTO G 6 there
will be much much more I promise check
back for our full review and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
