noise-canceling sports earphones which
makes them fairly unique but on top of
that they are one of the first
lightening headphones that means they
have a lightning connector on the bottom
instead of a headphone plug and they go
right into the Lightning port of iOS
devices no headphone adapter required
they cost $200 which is pretty pricey
but they do seem well-built with a
sturdy reflective cord a nicely designed
inline remote and their sweat resistant
they fit me really well too and have
silicone tips and wings that lock the
buds securely in place they reminded me
a little of boses ear tips which are
really comfortable on the remote there's
a button for turning the noise canceling
on and off the noise canceling isn't all
that strong and it certainly isn't as
good as the noise canceling on boses
QuietComfort 20 headphones the headphone
is called the aware because it has a
feature where you can choose to let more
sound in which is good if you're a
runner or biker and want to be able to
hear the world around you and traffic in
particular you control the ambient noise
setting in the JBL headphone a p-- that
app also allows you to customize the EQ
setting which is important because the
default setting on the headphone is
considerably bassy and sounds a little
muddy i was able to improve the sound by
adjusting the eq to a more balanced
setting in fact I turn the EQ off and
felt better about the headphone after I
did that it lacks a little clarity and
sounds a little processed but compared
to other sports headphones it sounds
good
ultimately the biggest drawback may be
that the headphone does draw some power
from your phone and reduce your battery
life I also didn't think the noise
cancelling was quite strong enough so
while there's a lot to like about this
headphone there are some drawbacks which
hurt its value a bit I'm David Carnot
