the Apple buy for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple September is
just about here and we've received our
invite to Apple special media event on
September the 1st now it's a safe bet
that we'll see new iPods across the
board including iPod Touches with a
Retina display and FaceTime and possibly
even a nano without a click wheel now
the rumors have been swirling around
apple's itv product but people are
really missing the biggest clue yet and
it's on the invitation hello
the I guitar it's right there so let's
recap some of the chatter about the next
Apple TV if we see it it's rumored to be
using an a4 processor chip there's still
no word about a subscription model but
it looks like there will be $0.99 TV
show rentals and there will be access to
the App Store
with the potential for the iPad or
iPhone to be used as a remote now
according to Bloomberg even Steve Jobs
doesn't think this will revolutionize TV
because most people aren't ready to cut
off their cable and stream content yet
now if you guys want this to really be a
game changer you got to integrate the
ITV the iOS and Apple's ecosystem into
its own TV I can only imagine what the
ITV could be like for me hey come here
check this out check this out do you
guys yeah it's 24 baby changing change
it change it whoa do that it's called
bright TV oh wait yeah yeah I got you
pause okay so bright TVs the best yeah
it is you know I still can't believe
that girl hasn't taken home an Oscar
it's a travesty now let's talk about a
product we won't see at the keynote but
we'll see in the future can you guys say
iMac touch patently Apple revealed a
patent application that shows how Apple
would transition the Mac computer from a
mouse and keyboard input into a touch
base input for iOS an accelerometer in
the display or a sensor in the hinge
would transition the software over and
this also applies to Apple laptops make
this the second time I've wet myself on
the Apple bike this year and in Apple
patents you might not like the big a
applied for a patent that could
potentially identify suspicious behavior
on an iPhone and either use voice facial
or heartbeat recognition to identify and
then potentially shut down the device
and there's a clue the next-gen iPhone
will have a heartbeat sensor Apple
mentions jailbreaking and unlocking the
phone as an authorized use and I don't
know anyone around here that has done
that before
now this isn't happening yet but it is a
little freaky to see what Apple is
thinking about in the future all right
if you might be wondering where all your
voicemails are going I've got a tip for
you what's up guys Brian Shawn here with
cnet.com and if you're just like me
which you aren't you're having problems
receiving voicemails on your iphone
lately now the last one I received was
about a month ago in July and I can
assure you my mom leaves plenty of
voicemails for me on my phone now if you
suspect her visual voicemail isn't
working
dial into your voicemail directly by
holding the number one on your dial pad
and you'll hear a status update now
that's a lot of booty calls you don't
want to miss so let's show you how to
achieve your missing voicemails go into
your settings then general scroll to the
bottom to find a reset and you'll want
to select reset network settings if
have a passcode lock which you should
enter it in press the magic button and
your phone will restart this method can
potentially help if your phone is having
trouble accessing network data for
things like surfing the web and
downloading email or retrieving your
voicemails it will also reset all the
Wi-Fi networks your phone automatically
connects to so you'll have to re-enter
those passwords as well if this doesn't
work select the reset all settings which
is also work for me but you'll have to
re-enter things like your iTunes
password but it will not erase any
content on your phone now let's give it
a few moments and voila there are my
voicemails ready for me to listen to one
month later i'm brian song with your
how-to for retrieving your missing
iphone voicemails use it wisely
that guy needs some help like some
serious professional help a lot more mad
i will tell him that thank you
now we like bold statements but LG's VP
of Marketing is doing his job when he
recently said our tablet will be better
than the iPad it's going to be
surprisingly productive LG's
android-based tablet is expected by the
end of the year and competition is
always a good thing but a recent I
supply report estimates that Apple will
dominate the tablet market this year
with over 74% of tablet shipments and
will still hold over 60% of shipments by
2012 you better jump on that LG alright
let's check out the app of the week
you've been asking about it and here it
is the Netflix app for iPhone and iPod
Touch that allows you to watch movies
and TV shows from your Netflix queue
over Wi-Fi and 3G now it has a clean
interface video quality is acceptable
over Wi-Fi but 3G is really going to
depend on your connection and you can
add content to your instant queue
directly from the app it's a free app
but you'll need the Netflix $8.99 plan
to access streaming content but I'm
excited this thing is finally here all
right on to the quick bytes netbook
manufacturers are probably crying after
seeing this it's the key case iPad folio
with an integrated Bluetooth keyboard
that has a thin leather profile the
keyboard can be charged separately it
lasts 45 hours with a full
and it's about 90 US dollars I want to
play with one of these ASAP and finally
the Japanese sumo Association is
planning to hand out iPads to 51 stables
or clubs that the sumo wrestlers belong
to they struggle using selfies for
communication because of the size of
their large hands I could kind of relate
because I was always called sausage
fingers back in elementary school all
right
that's gonna do it for this week's show
send me your emails to the Apple bita
cnet.com i'm brian tom thanks for
watching we'll see you guys next week
for another bite of the Apple bye
