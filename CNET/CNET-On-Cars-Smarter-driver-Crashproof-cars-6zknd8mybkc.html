car we're gonna make a few stops one of
which will be the crash proof car the
concept is a car with sufficiently
sophisticated driver assist technology
that it can avoid or alert you to avoid
almost any collision ESB initiates a
one-sided braking intervention that can
move the vehicle out of the danger zone
that's a talent that is distinct from
being able to drive itself Volvo's new
xc90 for example is a first step toward
its goal of crash free or at least
injury from crash free cars by 2020
among the tech to get it there is
automatic braking to prevent frontal
collisions automatic braking to avoid
turning left into oncoming traffic
pedestrian and animal detection Road
edge and barrier detection adaptive
cruise control with steering assistant
and vehicle-to-vehicle communications
none of this is science fiction
although the v2v technology is still
being brokered between regulators and
car makers at CES Ford gave a very
realistic look of coming v2v technology
that can let cars signal each other Wow
providing another layer of inputs to
help them avoid collisions very
important and efficient way to want
someone to see audible of warnings I
heard ok which means get out the way
warning exactly BMW is showing how an
array of laser scanners looking out from
around the car can detect almost
anything that is about to occupy the
same space as the vehicle the purest
definition of a collision from another
car to a pedestrian to a wall and we
need to keep in mind that the driver is
the best sensor that we have
however drivers do tend to get
distracted and we need to bring him back
into the loop which we do by providing
the warning and assisting him with the
braking situation
the European Union is aiming for zero
road fatalities by 2050 and sooner than
that cutting them in half by 2020
largely relying on these kinds of
Technology bundles even in showrooms
today it pays to double-check if the car
you're considering buying has as many of
these technologies as possible
on the march toward crash proof driving
