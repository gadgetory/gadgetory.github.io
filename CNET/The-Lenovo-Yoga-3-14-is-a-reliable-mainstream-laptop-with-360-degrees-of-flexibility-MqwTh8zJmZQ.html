radical design shifts no ultra
high-resolution screen this is just
another good version of the convertible
notebook that Lenovo kicked off in 2012
I'm Josh Goldman with CNET and while the
yoga 3 Pro showed Lenovo flexing its
design muscles the yoga 314 is the more
mainstream model but still features the
now-familiar yoga flip around design
this model has a 14 inch 1080p
resolution touchscreen that folds
completely back so you can use it as a
tablet albeit a fairly large and heavy
one at 3 and a half pounds the full HD
resolution works well for this screen
size and the IPS panel gives you good
off angle viewing but the glare off the
display is tough to ignore especially
since the screen doesn't get all too
bright the keyboard is good though I
found it a bit spongy and the smaller
right side Shift + Enter keys might take
some adjusting now inside instead of the
Core M processor found in the pro and
the yoga 311 you'll find either a 5th
gen Intel Core i5 or i7 processor
integrated or discrete Nvidia graphics
up to 8 gigs of memory and up to a 250
gig solid-state drive prices start
around $800 and go up to 1050 we tested
a core i5 with integrated graphics that
is just over $900 and it performed very
well with everyday use light photo and
video editing streaming video and music
on casual mobile games battery life was
respectable - at about 8 hours on our
drain test if you need more than that
check out the HP spectre x360 or
non-touchscreen version of the Dell XPS
13 which with similar configurations
both got 12 hours you can read the full
review on CNET com but this is certainly
worth your consideration if you're just
looking for a reliable everyday laptop
with some added flexibility
i'm josh coleman and that's a quick look
at lenovo's yoga 340
