country podcast from the Giant Bomb
podcast studio in San Francisco
California it's the Apple by Dykstra
country with your host mr. brian Tong
what's up everybody welcome to the show
episode 76 extra crunchy oh so munchy
I'm broadcasting from a secret cavern a
secret location somewhere in the
Southern California area Beachum you're
in the home base the mothership I'm in
the Giant Bomb studio in San Francisco
and next week actually the week after we
moved back up to our regular studio we
cannot wait man we have been in a
makeshift situation for how long now at
least what six months it feels like
feels like six months yeah I'm gonna be
like four or five maybe so people that
have been watching they haven't seen the
full breadth of what we can do on the
show yeah we got graphics we got
everything Hong Kong I think crazy so um
again this is Applewhite extra crunchy
it's the audio podcast a complimentary
piece to our weekly five minute video
show again the show though is all about
you all latest news kind of new updates
since we've last shot the recent show
but call us we get tons of calls and we
want you to be a part of it the number
is 1 800 61 62 63 8 tell us your name
where you're from your comments your
good apples your bad apples or maybe
help us out help out the other viewers
that are part of this show or listeners
to learn more I we always love it when
you guys can either correct this or even
tell us new things that we can give to
the audience so again 1 800 616 268 it's
all about all y'all so let's just jump
into it first things first the new 10.5
inch iPad that has been rumored over and
over it is expected to be announced at
an apple event in early April we have
seen in the past Apple events around
that kind of that March timeframe but
this new report is that we will see it
sometime early in April that's according
to our friends at digit times in
addition to that this 10.5 inch iPad
will be roughly the same size
as the 9.7 inch iPad what makes it
different is that it's going to gain
that point eight inches of size of
length of the screen why are you
laughing later matters that matters it
matter sighs mass size matters baby
it'll be around the same form factor but
you'll get point eight inches of screen
size additional because the bezels are
expected to be pushed all the way out to
the sides making it a larger screen but
around the same form factor which is
nice the reports also say that we will
see updates the 9.7 inch iPad the
current 9.7 inch iPad pro and the twelve
point nine inch iPad pro my baby my
favorite one the 12.9 but again these
updates most likely won't be big massive
changes all indications point to that at
least the 9.7 inch ipad pro will just be
a minor upgrade over the current model
so we're talking about a 10x8 the a 10x
chip in the 9.7 inch iPad pro it'll give
it a speed boost performance boost but
there might that that might be all also
if we're talking about the 12 point nine
inch it better get a two-tone display
that's what i want but Tim Cook in the
earnings report outright said Apple is
not working on anything like a hybrid OS
he said he feels that the ipad is
different than the mac than the mac line
and that although the ipad pro line will
do more he still thinks that the mac
line will do a lot more there for
everyone that is hoping for a hybrid OS
like i'm hoping for anything that gives
us some level of surface like
functionality and integration we're not
going to see it so bomberman it's just
not going to be as feature rich it's
going to be iOS still on a tablet and i
can tell you right now that it still
feels super limited they gotta do
something quick because my kids they
hate my macbook like they're like oh i
don't like it i can't touch the screen
they don't like it so I mean like the
iPad oh we love the ipad they just use
the ipad all day when it comes to my
macbook they're like I want your other
computer daddy is they don't like the
macbook so that's something the Apple
needs to think about you know I just
think in their DNA what they've shown us
is that they don't want to do that they
aren't willing to do that and so I to me
with
they can't do that it feels like the
iPad line specifically has almost
reached a point where it can only do so
much now if you're not going to update
the OS there's no fool OS on it or even
a hybrid OS and it's it's going to limit
what it can do for someone like me I
mean I'm a specific use case I'm not
gonna say everyone should go out and buy
a 12 point nine inch iPad but if you
love reading comics and you want to drop
that cheddar it's worth it drop the
cheddar I you know what if you want to
read comics on an iPad pro you can get a
refurbished like entry level one flag
649 bucks just wait till the new ones
come out the first gen will be way
cheaper right yeah it's like you've got
a full tab of that where magazines
really look true to size comics look
great uh you know I'm if I was a smart
person I probably would have waited but
i gotta get imax on games look really
great too i mean there's a lot of
awesome games on the ipad but um when
you were talking about the new updates
to the to the next ipad it was just kind
of like bigger size slightly tiny bit
bigger and a better chip that doesn't
seem like a big selling point you know i
mean so treat on them TT TT TT you want
you know what you want t DS on your on
your iPad pro totally I'll take that so
again we'll see what happens but for
people that are saying Oh Apple will
eventually catch up I'm just the surface
pro product has been out I feel like for
at least three years now oh yeah ain't
even four years sleep and it's gone to a
point where now as the industry has
evolved it can do so much more but it's
like the iPad feels like it's in the in
like in the past honestly just really
does yeah yeah feels like it's stuck in
the past yeah and so you know I've got
my boy on periscope Wow monny saying iOS
will catch up well if there was any time
to catch up this would be the year but
again Tim Cook said not a nots gonna
have not going to happen so we'll see if
you want to align when Apple's going to
actually do this keynote early April is
the indication if you look at Apple's
headquarters they also have that Steve
Jobs theater that really nice
amphitheater it's still not even close
to being done so my hunch is if they do
any type of announcement it'll be in
there um I know there they want to
they said the last keynote was a their
last one in that auditorium so maybe
there's gonna speed what is it like
fast-track the new Steve Jobs auditorium
to get done in time so they can do this
ipad announcement there we'll see we'll
see be cool but April some people I know
it's it's it used to be a bigger deal
but you know we'll see about that ok so
we've talked about iPads also in more
ipad news according to fiscal analytics
there they basically can't pull internet
traffic data and see what activity is
happening what's going on they were able
to identify for new ipads that were
spotting their analytics likely to be
the new iPad pro devices that Apple is
currently testing when Apple has the
devices their model identifier is
associated with it Fisk you saw iPad 71
72 73 and 74 the current iPad line
identifier 'he's start as ipad six so
clearly they're testing these fisco says
they picked up about 40 devices that are
being used with these new identifiers
this is about the same number of devices
they've seen typically about a month
before apple launches a new product so
that aligns as well with some sort of an
ape release the other aspect that I
found kind of interesting but it
obviously makes sense is that these new
iPads that were found or discovered
we're not only running iOS 10.3 some of
them were running iOS 11000 sneaky
sneaky huh beachy cool so again
everything's lining up that will see
these in April but that's just a little
a little bit of more meat for y'all to
chew on about the iPads also apple
continues to roll out there iOS and mac
OS betas the 7th beta for both iOS 10.3
and Steven I'm just gonna let you say
the 7th beta for our next guy who is he
macos Sierra mas yeah TenPoint 12.4 the
7th betas of both of those have released
to developers again the big feature in
10.3 is fine my ear pods we're also
getting like a podcast app widget at
least in the mac o
TenPoint 12.4 beta the big new feature
at least I will be coming out is night
shift finally coming to the mac and a
just on a random side note I like when
people tweet me that they're talking to
apple support and they actually call Mac
OS like they outwardly accidentally call
it ma close gonna dub I think we've
really done our job yeah good job man
good job man uh beach did you get a
chance to see this recent apple
commercial this called sticker fight I
haven't actually I saw something
scrolling past but I didn't go to click
on it didn't look too interesting but is
that an AR thing like an augmented
reality thing no it's just that it's so
I'm gonna have you pull it up it's this
link that I put in the show it's there
it's a video that's just outing their
stickers pepper passages so they just
kind of like God lost excited about
stickers I'm just telling you there's
something there's a nugget in there okay
I'm trying I'm trying to get to
something so if you can play the view
for people that are watching a play
about 20 seconds in there's a scene
where there's a guy who slaps a
caterpillar unlike some waffles okay
okay now when we get to that or whether
you time job I'm gonna tell parents
right there look at it okay so if you
pause it if you somehow pause it on that
scene where the waffles are if you look
to the left of the waffles there's a
phone there's a phone but look at it
very carefully I want you to tell me
beach what color do you think that phone
is it's like a matte white right does
not look white yeah it's like a matte
white color and it has like a weird
camera lens on it too that's haven't
seen that's an iphone 7 pro like to me
sorry plus my brains all over the place
that's an iphone 7 plus that is white if
you look at the lens that's the dual
lens and everyone's like oh maybe it's a
silver one and it's um it's a reflection
if you look at the top of that image
there's a knife on that shot yes that's
that's what silver looks like Oh totally
yeah so the phone to me without a doubt
that is a white phone I can't and even
if it was a
current iphone 7 that was silver like
people are saying oh it might be the the
edges of it the corners typically have
these antennae lines and it also kind of
has that iphone 4 look which does which
goes along with the rumors that have
been like it's going to look more like
an iphone 4 it's kind of square you know
so I'm just saying good good give a good
observations here Brian jeez I'm I could
I'm a starting I'm honestly I'm just
starting up a rumor okay that's all
we're really trying to go this is pretty
amazing I have to screenshot this for
the forehead line or our promotional
image I'm just saying is that that is
that the white iphone who knows it's but

gen apple TV running TV OS 11
purportedly appears in developers logs
this is according to the co-founder of
theory games they have an iOS and TV iOS
gaming company but they saw that an iOS
or sorry at evo s11 device carrying the
identifier apple TV 62 appeared in their
usage logs the current apple TV
identifier is 53 so obviously this is
some sort of new hardware the IP address
that this came from was within close
proximity to Apple headquarters
obviously Apple has not released any
information about a new Apple TV yet but
Bloomberg had reported earlier that a 4k
model could come as early as this year
a fork a model that should have happened
last year a model that should have
allowed us to stream or toss our 4k
video from our phone to our TV set like
at least like oh let's promote a 4k
phone on your iPhone but you can't watch
it anywhere except on your phone like
dude mid come on Apple like that to me
that was a no brainer but hey a year and
a half later that's cool so either way
um the 4k Apple TV that we're expecting
to possibly see this year looks like at
least new hardware for it has been
spotted in the wild and uh we'll see how
that all shakes out as well do you do
you have a current Apple TV I don't have
a roku and a chromecast i would i would
be down with apple TV well i wanted i
want people to call in and let us know
really you know i think the apple TV
product is an interesting one from a
standpoint is it just hasn't delivered
enough like if you're in the ecosystem
you're all good but for our listeners
Apple by nation if you guys and gals can
call us let's talk about it 1 800 61 62
63 8 what is it really that you want to
see from the apple TV is it is it
actually just 4k I I think that they
should remove the requirement to all
games that are on the appletv have to
work with the standard apple remote
alright that's a requirement so that
instantly limits the type of games are
being developed for it that's a bummer
like that's cut that's kind of lame and
then the biggest letdown right no TV
streaming service that should have been
exclusive to the apple TV that's not
happening either but what is it that you
wish or want the apple TV to do that
would actually make you buy it if you
haven't already and then if everyone
says yeah i already bought it okay fine
well then that that kills the whole
conversation right now so Apple TV talk
to us let's let's let's hear what you
got to say we're gonna jump over to the
air pods and I thought this was actually
really cool pretty interesting stuff
coming out from the Apple camp if you go
check out patently Apple Apple has been
granted patents for an earbud design
with biometric features including
improved noise cancellation so we know
the first gen I earpods I think super
convenient love how they work wirelessly
they have
little to no functionality unless you
use your phone to control them but if
you don't care about how they look on
you and if they actually figure here I
think you're gonna love it and I would
say most people that have ear pods
really like them what do you think about
that Beach have you think that's awesome
I definitely want a pair but like i said
before like they're just too expensive
you know and if there's more
functionality that's great they do kind
of look silly but that's fine i'll put i
get over it but you know a lot of people
have been calling us also saying that we
forget about the Apple watch you can
control the air pods with your Apple
watch too I mean control your phone and
what's playing and stuff like that so we
got a lot of calls about that yeah I
mean I guess I forget about that cuz my
Apple watches I never charged like look
my Apple watch I I haven't charged it
for around aha cuz it's more of a yeah
but I mean that you know a lot of people
called us and were like you didn't
mention the Apple watch but a lot of
people don't own it and that's just
another thing you have to buy to control
your air pods to control your phone so
yeah like he's gonna do that yeah so I
just want to acknowledge that people
were talking about that but um I would
love to have some sort of wireless
earbuds because I'm tethered to my
computer and my desk and that's a pain
in the ass you know so something tells
me you're gonna get air pods generation
to somewhere sharper if they're under a
hundred dollars possibly but I feel like
161 even like 120 is too expensive my
field I mean does Apple really sell a
product under a hundred dollars other
than a headphone or a cabled after
that's like 30 or 40 bucks they don't
not so I guess so check this out if we
talk about some of these patents that
make it interesting one of the first
patents shows how a follow along with me
photo plethysmograph or PPG this is a
sensor that could be added to an earbud
that can track your biometrics so for
example there's this part of your ear
called the tragus it's this front side
of your like kind of closer to your
cheekbone and if you touch it it's that
kind of little meaty part I'm gonna do a
little human anatomy here right now
that's your tragus right there okay so
what the patent would show is that this
sensor would be close to
like the exterior surface of the earbud
and most of the problems with the
earbuds is that it doesn't make contact
with an area that getting that is deep
enough right you don't want to put sure
there's air buds that go deep into your
ear but that's not what everyone wants
so their idea is to put the sensor that
allows it at least on the surface to
touch the tragus and that would allow
you to collect some of that biometric
data so good biometric day like a
heartbeat we got ya our rate you know
heart rate EKG temperature Oh it'd be
like Oh your ears are hot hot ears so
that's one of this that's one of the
patents to put that sensor in that
location right against your tragus I
learned that today and I'm gonna teach
you tragus what what is that beat sounds
pretty good for little training and in
between your ear that little thing that
holds your pod can you show us your
tragus right now sure sure sure there
you go there you go big baby baby ding
ding ding what do I win job I know you
and respect it's come also another
patent here we talked about the noise
cancellation they're saying that they
could arrange three microphones in a
triangular configuration to improve the
noise cancellation features for the air
pods we know that they don't have any
noise cancellation whatsoever so these
are two patents specifically to the air
pods or at least two ear buds but c'mon
let's be honest these are going to be
implemented hopefully into air pods but
like all patents it doesn't mean that
they're actually going to do it but it's
what they're thinking they need to bring
more features the air pods that's all
I'm saying but I do think it's pretty
badass first gen product I was I was
lukewarm on them I still have to diss
them for their functionality but they
are very convenient like they're a
really good product they're not a great
product but they're really really really
good they're just like almost there so
for people that say I hate on Apple
you're wrong wrong and people that have
any life yeah love hate love hate love
hate people that haven't used them are
the ones that criticized on the most I'm
like have you ever tried them that I
know like yeah yeah if they do they if
they sound anything like
you know like regular air pod ear pods
and I'm I'm happy because those are
great it's like them they sound much
like them yeah cuz they sound great like
I have no complaints with the quality
they sound just like them alright um
let's we're not going to bore you too
much but let's just fill through some
real quick hits of iphone rumors and
whatnot because come on in we always
have to talk about the iphone 8 6 months
ahead of time according to the Nikkei
Asian review their reporting how Apple's
plans to implement the rumored curved
OLED display on the new iphone this is
literally the report the curt display
curves will be gentler than Samsung and
offer no new functions so the gentler
means like a little less not as severe
right that wasn't me exactly that that's
all you got gentler gentler curves on
out display they also did say there will
be no new functionality so some of the
past Samsung products are like on the
Samsung edge s7 edge you could actually
you know there was some functionality
that you could use to access contacts
and things of that nature or shortcuts
that there's going to be no
functionality on the curved edge as well
they just wanted to make that clear to
us so yeah and then another follow up
because Apple is ramped up for these new
iPhones and the big talks about how
they're going to be using OLED screens
Apple is estimated to grab fourteen
percent of OLED panel production in 2017
specifically for the iphone 8 where does
that rank obviously they have their
orders directly lined up with Samsung
well Apple will be making fifteen
percent of the total annual OLED
production Samsung will get about fifty
six percent of that and then you'll have
other manufacturers again to remind you
the only oled screen that we're
expecting to see is in this kind of
premium iphone 8 potential 5.8 inch
phone well the other two will stay with
their standard sizes and stick with that
with LCD based screens cool fourteen
percent seems like a small number it is
there you know what it comes down to is
there's not too many oled screen
producers that's probably the biggest
limiting factor you have all these other
companies that might want to jump on the
bandwagon you know to do more OLED stuff
where they can't because
even although apples locked up I think
something like 75 million OLED displays
at least for this year they have a
future contracts which total 160 million
Oh LED panels directly through samsung
Wow so they're they're jumping all in
and it just I'm just curious to see how
many if they're really only putting this
oled screen on a 5-point an inch iphone
I think a lot of people just gonna buy
it because it's the even though I don't
want a five point eight inch phone I
don't want what you're big so I'm
complex if it's the iphone that has all
the all the bells and whistles I'm gonna
do it you gotta do it you're brian Tong
you gotta should have the latest gonna
have the latest apple stuff but i didn't
buy an iphone 7 plus i didn't i refused
well well that I let other people do
their bouquet a bouquet effect cool cool
um this one's actually really good
applecare+ can now be purchased up to
one year after buying an iphone so for a
lot of you every time you buy an iPhone
they're like oh would you like to buy
applecare and then they you say no I
don't want to I don't want to pay an
extra hundred bucks I actually quite
honestly buy applecare on everything I
get just because it's helped me out into
and then when I need to go into service
I'm like look at my history I've always
purchase applecare so they've kind of
done a few things for me that maybe they
normally wouldn't it's probably also
because I slipped them a twenty-dollar
bill but uh no i didn't but here you go
before 60 days was the window of time
you could buy applecare that extended
your coverage for a phone but now you
can do it up to a year this is only to
the phone right now things like the ipad
ipod touch and Apple watch you still can
only purchase it within 60 days to get
that extended coverage but which would
extends the Commerce of two years total
but yes is this something you can buy
online like you can buy applecare online
so like n so technically you can break
your iPhone like day 5 of owning it and
then be like oh I better go buy
applecare real quick online go buy
applecare and then take and get it fixed
yes okay exactly but i think if i recall
right when you know when you do any type
of swap out for a phone or a screen
repair there are fees associated with it
like your true i know there was like a
me like a thirty dollar fee or so when
you break your screen but even if like
let's say your phone uh Scott like nuked
or something I think it's you know to
replace the phone it's something like I
know like around a hundred or a hundred
fifty dollars to do any other type of
damage replacement hmm so and then mow
down for stuff they usually just do that
for free like any software its user well
yes they should but technically you only
have like 90 days of complimentary
support and a limited and a limited
1-year warranty gotcha like it's not a
fool it's not full coverage so apple
care for the most part basically gives
you full coverage in again you will
still pay some fees to get them
something service but it's not like you
have to replace the whole phone gotcha
but again nothing on does not the
extension is only applied the one-year
extension only applies the iphone not
the ipod touch not the ipad or apple
watch stuff so okay let's wrap this bad
boy up kind of like in a final story
here apple one did you see this article
little know i'm looking at it now though
looks fun so an apple one is going up
for auction in may this original the OG
apple one right this is wise yak and
steve jobs it's really the product that
started the company it's going to be
placed up for auction by a german
auctioneer it is an actual functioning
apple one it has all the manuals it has
the original receipts it's it's not so
and there's only supposedly allegedly in
the world only eight of these that
actually work right you'll have ones
that all beat up that were in like
someone's corner of their garage this is
like this is like the dude who bought it
and has bought every computer and saved
every computer in the original packaging
in hopes to get rich right that's
awesome this dude is gonna get rich this
is expected for this is almost the
equivalent like edison's first telephone
I feel like it's really like the Wright
brothers first airplane I swear to god
this is the equivalent of that dude
that's that's funny let's let's get even
more extreme let's get more extreme
seriously it's like first car by
Henry Ford yeah I'm its you're not
kidding this is like a paradigm shift
happening right here something it's
expected to fetch over three hundred and
twenty thousand dollars wow so i hope i
hope to gotta just go straight to like a
museum somewhere you know what i mean
like it shouldn't be like some private
collectors house used to be on display i
feel it could be on maybe it's a rich
person who buys it to put it on display
and brag that they have it you know
there's people like that i think that
like basically rich guys who bragged
that they're even more rich to have like
a priceless work of art in their house
but only like two people looking at it
every day or something yeah let me give
you a little perspective or we wrap up a
last year a rare appleone celebration
model so think of like kind of a limited
version of this fetched eight hundred
fifteen hundred thousand dollars in an
auction 2014 working Apple one was
auctioned for 365 thousand dollars and
then one signed by Wozniak went for 671
thousand dollars that's pretty awesome
that's that's pretty wild so there you
go if you got the cash you want to be
that rich dude who shows off in the
museum go buy it yeah all right should
we get to our phone calls let's do it
again hell yeah and if you guys want to
be a part of the show the phone number
to call is 1 800 61 62 63 80 I got some
music playing let me stop that ok here
we go guys first call yes this is a nick
from Alameda again okay I just want to
let you guys know that there is another
option to the home run HD and that's the
tableau which runs about the same in
cost but cool thing about tableau is
does have DVR function what you do is
you plug in any old hard drive that you
may have lying around your house plug it
into the the tableau unit and it streams
to all your devices and to your main
television via and Apple TV apps and
also I go with directv now because
DirecTV now has apps sign in for
whole bunch of kit shows disney junior
disney XD like that so it's worth
looking into DirecTV now in tableau both
connected via Apple TV cool love that so
I I don't I think the only thing that
Nick didn't clarifies if he was signing
into disney chose for himself yeah
that's that was my first question was
like no no i mean i think i wanted to
know is that that's what he's watching
all the disney god what I'm trying to
get at you watching Mickey's roadster
racers by himself at home oh I don't
even know that show exists bro what is
that it's Mickey's roaster racers they
drive rotors and race I mean you don't
know you don't know about that show so
you're saying it does exactly what the
title is that exactly ya know what Nick
somewhat that's awesome i love that he
called and he's not the only one that
called his like yo bro tableau yeah we
had a bunch of him actually a bunch of
people tableau check it out so I I did
not get the tableau product but I do
like the fact that you can just plug in
a hard drive directly to it I know that
with the home run HD they are getting
DVR functionality but you would have to
UM connect the hard drive as like a gnat
storage but it sounds like with tableau
you can just connect it directly to the
unit um and then I looked online and I
saw that the tableau has two tuners for
their two hundred dollar price point but
if you want for tuners so for people
could be watching programming at
different time different channels at the
same time it's a three-hundred-dollar so
it's a pretty cool thing so thank you
everyone that called because that's
what's all about educating us educating
our other listener so I'm down with that
I'm gonna check this out because i'm
chillin y'all still shopping you know
you know browse shopping like cut the
cord ma'am cool okay next call ah let me
get to it here we go yeah hey guys this
is nate color from Dubai and United Arab
Emirates I've got a quick question for
you about the next for this yeah I guess
the next 802 11 a Wi-Fi standard ad
what's the likelihood of us seeing that
in the next gen iphone good work but so
here's here's what I think about 802 11
ad I think the biggest thing about it um
if you
guys read up on it it does have faster
bandwidth throughput so you can get gigs
of data shot through ad but the biggest
obstacle about it is it's a really short
short distance so it's not like you
could be across your house and get 80
speeds like we even know with 802 11 c
you can be i think if i'm right should I
someone's going to beat me up for this I
think it's around is it like a 20 to
30-foot like straight site to really get
those higher faster speeds even when
you're going through walls it it's just
not going to be as effective well ad
although it gives you those faster
speeds it's a real short range access
point so it's almost like you need to
have it in your living room and be
within like five to ten feet of it quite
honestly it's not going to be something
that can be used what can be widely used
everywhere so I think that's going to be
the biggest limitation of it we for an
apple to implement that I think Apple
has always been slower to adopt
standards until they really become a
thing although if you rewind Apple
brought wireless internet before anyone
was really pushing it that hard with the
original AirPort base station that
looked like that cool silver UFO oh yeah
we pushed wireless internet before it
was even a thing so but I just based on
reading the limitations of AD I know it
just doesn't seem like something that
apple would be like all right we've got
to put ad in here the other thing is
right not only that you have to wait for
everyone to jump on the standard with
more routers it's just not very
prevalent right now so my hunch is that
we would not see it in the next iphone I
could be wrong but just knowing how
Apple thinks and how they have behaved
historically I don't expect it but maybe
maybe maybe not cool yeah I remember the
first wireless device ever used was a
Mac was like a real old-school macbook
or something in like the early 2000s I
was like what this is on the Internet
it's not connected in anything let's
brew okay let's go the next call ah here
we go hey I was just wondering if you
can answer this one question do you
think apples decided to corner every bit
of the market has eclipsed or desire to
actually innovate right now Apple is
just basically
to help with Android and they really
aren't creating your own or expanding
your own ecosystem with a used to the
just trying to attract same customer
base any opinions on this thank you we
got we got a smart we got a smart color
right there okay young buck who's like
um apples on innovative what are they
doing now I would say this apples apples
most innovative product last year quite
honestly where the air pods the w1 chip
was their most innovative product and i
think that the w1 ship itself is going
to be able to do a lot of things moving
forward i know it's not like a computer
i know it's not like an actual new
device and I don't necessarily think we
need new devices all the time but that
was that is one of their kind of
innovative tent poles of 2016 although
it feels like wait that's all you got in
yeah fine that's all they got but if you
look at how Apple's operating now their
customer base is so large it was all
about trapping I i will use the word
trap / keeping people in their ecosystem
there's a lot of us including myself
that when faced with certain decisions
you choose to buy an Apple product
knowing that it works with the ecosystem
of everything else you buy sure and
that's its biggest hold everyone is time
out the iphone what was what's the thing
that kept most people in the iphone
world even when they want it to look at
android the ecosystem the fact that the
apps typically come out first sure its
ease of use but you know it's tossing
content from there to your apple TV blah
blah blah all those little bells and
whistles you get just by being in an
ecosystem that makes a difference so
they've kind of rested on those laurels
they've built a huge base if you look at
the iphone adoption rate it's maybe I
phones aren't selling as much as they
used to you know when you talk about a
new iphone but I i think the iphone 8
will be you know and it has happened
over the past two years each new iphone
model has still been the top selling
number of iphone units that they've done
and i don't think it's going to slow
down anytime soon they keep on hitting
record iphone sales numbers um when i
say that it slowed down different
quarter
it's um it isn't as big as it used to be
because yes the market is maturing but
if you look at the overall total of
phones being sold over the life of the
product there will be more iphone 8 sold
at any other one so as a business person
there they kind of they're innovating
but a lot slower because they have the
market and that's sometimes what happens
to the big big machines yeah you
definitely want to keep your fanbase
happy definitely I I mean I just want I
think I think what it is is they could
do so much more but there's they're so
spread thin now they have too many
products I just don't think they know
what they're thinking of focus to be
like let's make this great product and
said it's like I will have some guys
here will have some guys on the Apple
watch oh yeah we got this Apple TV there
we got some guys on the mac oh yeah we
took everyone off the mac pro team
that's why you haven't seen in three
plus years like there's they're doing
too many things now we have three models
of the iPhone coming out we have three
models of the ipad coming out I mean
come on yeah come on and there were
stories similar to what you're saying
about like the Apple car like we had a
big team in Germany working on Apple
cars and all of a sudden that's not
happening so yeah it's quickly changing
now we have a big group of people
working on augmented reality glasses for
Apple you know who knows where they're
going man yeah so it remains to be seen
and I think that sometimes what people
mix up is that being innovative doesn't
always mean you have to sell the most
units of something so for example I
think the surface pro is the best hybrid
product out there it doesn't sell the
most but it does that doesn't mean it's
not innovative look at that remember
that Microsoft Surface to do that that
basically that tells you an imac that
turns into art tablet look I don't even
know anyone who has that yet yeah but as
a proof of concept first gen just wait
till Jen to gen 3 I think more people
are gonna buy it is it gonna outsell the
imac probably not but is it is the most
innovative desktop we've seen in a long
time yeah you know I do have like pro
video people like asking me like advice
for you know what should i do for
editing and what should i do for a
computer and I say imac and premier you
know
like still yeah I max has them that
probably the best screen could get and
you know so you can still say that
they're building stuff for pro people
you know we have one more call all right
hey Brian hey Steven this jack from rain
to Illinois I was gone a couple days ago
I had a issue with my iPhone where
throws up whenever I Terrell and I power
back on and it froze on the apple logo
so I had to take it in to simply mac
which is a apple retail specialist and
they had they pretty much restored my
iphone as as if it was a new iphone
thankfully I had almost backed up to
iCloud so I didn't lose any of my
information really I just had to go and
reinstall my abs and stuff but I think
Apple deserves a very rotten bad apple
for not fixing this issue and hopefully
they do pics it thanks love the show by
we got someone throat it but here's the
question beach like he was able to get
all his apps and stuff back on it right
yeah just sounds like a big pain in the
ass though it is a pain in the ass but
man it would have been a real bad apple
if he couldn't even get that back so
yeah if you lost everything then I'd be
like hmm all right so I think that's
gonna do for this week man that's it
where r I don't are we gonna be in the
new studio maybe the week after next
week yeah the week after you know next
week we still have one more week in the
dungeon and then then we're back all
right I like that okay again ladies and
gentlemen boys and girls remember you
guys can call us 1 800 61 62 63 aight
