situation where you really need to
record some video with your DSLR but you
don't have a tripod a monopod or
anything to lean against if this is you
then here are some tips to help
stabilize your video from a DSLR
handheld first up I want to talk about
correct hand holding technique it's
really tempting to have the camera in
your right hand with the grip here and
adjusting your zoom and focus using your
left hand the pros definitely don't do
it this way keep a firm secure lock
underneath the lens with the palm of
your left hand hold it steady in the
right and you'll get the steadiest shot
next make sure to turn on image
stabilization either in your lens or
your body this is really important
because it will help keep your shots
even more stable to help compensate for
a little bit of handshake then bring
your elbows close into your body this is
a good technique so you increase the
points of contact and make sure you keep
it really stable as possible regulate
your breathing as well so for example if
you only need to shoot a short burst of
around 10 seconds take a deep breath
hold your breath and start recording if
you have a strap it's a good time to
attach it to your camera with the strap
held taut against your neck like so you
can get some really nice smooth and
stable panning effects which gives you
something that looks almost like you've
invested in a slider or a dolly if you
also want to spend some cash though you
can consider investing in a loop so this
will be held right against your eye like
so and provide yet another point of
contact
keeping your shots nice and stable
remember when you're shooting at the
telephoto end of your lens you are going
to exacerbate any kind of camera or hand
shake so make sure to shoot a bit wider
those are some tips to help hand
stabilize your DSLR video for more tips
