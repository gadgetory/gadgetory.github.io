dominance this is the LG c8 the
company's latest television to use
organic light-emitting diode technology
to create a picture because of that tech
the c8 is not only really expensive but
also the best performing TV we've ever
tested but let's start with a design
specifically the part I don't love LG
one with an unusual stand this year with
a scooped out shape and a little foot on
the back for support I'm not a huge fan
in particular because it's nearly the
whole width of the TV and kind of tracks
from the slim minimalist look you can
see just how slim from the side thinner
than my phone along the top the CA does
widen a bit about two-thirds of the way
down to accommodate inputs the power
supply and other guts all told this is
one sleek striking looking TV even with
a stand attached
LG's oval remote is the same as last
year and felt fine in my hand you can
wave it around like a Nintendo Wiimote
to select stuff on screen or use the
cursor or scroll wheel to navigate LG's
webOS system is fine but it doesn't have
as many apps as competitors from Samsung
Sony and Roku but enough about style and
features let's talk picture you can't
see how good it looks from this video
but in person it's incredible ol LEDs
big advantage over LCD is perfect black
levels which allow best-in-class
contrast and punch the picture also
looks equally good from angles other
than the sweet spot right in front of
the screen while LCD displays wash out
color is top-notch lush and vibrant and
screen uniformity even a bit better than
last year LG talks up its new processing
chip and while we did see some
improvements compared to last year
they're minor at best the c8 is an
amazing TV with picture quality that
puts any LCD we've seen to shame but
owners of older versions shouldn't feel
too jealous they can even brag about
their nicer stands you remember I said
the CA Casa bundle right now it starts
at 3500 for the 65 inch size seen here
that price will fall throughout the year
but it will continue to remain one of
the most expensive teas on the market in
2018 that's a quick look at LG c8 oled
