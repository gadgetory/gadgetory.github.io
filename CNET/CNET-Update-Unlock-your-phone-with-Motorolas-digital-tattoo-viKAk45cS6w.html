and adopt a family robot I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your CNET update
during this time of year tech news tends
to slow down a bit but when the news is
dry it gives us the opportunity to cover
some of the more bizarre gadgets out
there
take for instance Motorola's digital
tattoo there are many ways to unlock a
smartphone there are pin codes passwords
patterns you can use a thumbprint to
even use face detection but Motorola
thinks you may want to use a sticker on
your skin it's called a digital tattoo
but it's just a sticker with circuitry
it's about the size of a nickel designed
to work with the Moto X smartphone when
you tap the phone to the sticker the
phone is unlocked now this isn't new
technology it's using NFC the sticker
could save you time but people may also
think you have some sort of skin disease
a pack of 10 costs $10 and it'll stay on
when you shower swim or workout Sony's
latest walkman is getting buzzed the
first cassette tape playing Walkman came
out 35 years ago but this new nwz x1
model plays ultra high-definition
digital audio files that means the music
isn't compressed like a typical mp3
along with hi-def Aria comes a high
price tag it's $700 it's a bit bulky
carved from a block of expensive
aluminum it has 128 gigs of storage and
32 hours of battery life but it's hid in
Japan where consumers are starting to
get into high def audio and buy high def
I mean you can hear every minut detail
like the artist breathing it'll probably
take some time before that becomes a
thing in the US but for less than the
cost of that new Walkman you can buy a
robot for your family say hello to the G
Bo a robot that's connected to the
Internet and it can be programmed to do
various things like take your picture
remind you of appointments and deliver
messages it has the ability to identify
specific people in your family so we can
deliver a message just for a certain
person it talks to you and you can talk
back
it's still in development and the
company is raising money now on
IndieGoGo to mass-produce this rotating
countertop buddy the promotional video
shows that it can sense touch and it can
be programmed with various apps it can
read a bedtime story or be used for
video chat the Creator has spent her
career researching ways to make robots
more responsive to humans and maybe Gebo
is a step closer to those helpful robots
that we grew up with on TV and in the
movies you can pre-order an Evo now for
five hundred dollars and it's expected
to ship in September of next year
