pricey that is if you pay month-to-month
Amazon is raising the monthly fee for
prime by two dollars it's now $12.99 up
from 1099 the student rate went up by
one dollar now it is six dollars and
forty nine cents the higher prices kick
in a month from now
On February 18th but if you pay for the
Prime membership and one big yearly lump
sum well that cost will not increase
it's still $99 a year so what that means
is if you pay months a month you're
really paying about fifty seven dollars
more in the long run now Amazon has this
month-to-month option as a way to appeal
to a broader set of customers who want
more flexibility to try out the benefits
which include free shipping and access
to a library of video and music to
stream it's estimated that 90 million
American households have Prime now
analysts see this increase as no
surprise prime shoppers spend twice as
much as non-prime shoppers buying little
things more often without paying for
shipping yet at the same time Amazon is
having to deal with the cost of shipping
fees increasing this isn't the first
time prime prices went up prime began in
2005 and it used to cost $79 but in 2014
and went up to 99 bucks a year well the
new prices change your mind about paying
for Prime let us know in the comments
