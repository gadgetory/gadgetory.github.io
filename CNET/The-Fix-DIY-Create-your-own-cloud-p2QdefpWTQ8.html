Drive are great if you don't have a lot
of data to store but if you have a
larger media library and you don't want
to pay a monthly subscription for cloud
storage the best solution is to create
your own cloud at the high end you can
create your own 16 terabyte nav server
that functions a lot like Dropbox but
it's really geared more towards the
business professional and it can get
really pricey so instead I'll show you
how to setup a basic cloud for yourself
it'll let you download share and manage
files just like you would on any other
branded cloud storage service you can
expect to pay anywhere from about 150 to
250 dollars for this type of setup to
get started the first thing I'll do is
plug in the my cloud directly into my
router then use Western Digital software
to set up the device I'll create a user
account and finally my cloud is
basically set up so now any files and
folders I want in my cloud I just drag
and drop into here once I've got all of
my files in there some photos and a
video I'm ready to access them from any
other device so in this case on my
Windows computer it's as easy as
launching the browser and signing into
WDS portal online
since this is a Windows computer I'll
actually browse my cloud using an
explorer window there's my video double
click and I'm streaming it over the web
I can even drag and drop files from this
computer directly onto my cloud to top
it all off there's an easy way to access
all of your files from your smartphone
using WDS app just like any other cloud
platform I can use it to view and stream
any files I have in my cloud plus I can
use the app to backup and share photos
I've taken on my phone my cloud is by
far the easiest and cheapest way to set
up your own cloud but remember that
since it is a single volume there's no
insurance if your drive fails so use the
USB input on the back to plug in an
external hard drive and backup your
cloud just to be safe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
