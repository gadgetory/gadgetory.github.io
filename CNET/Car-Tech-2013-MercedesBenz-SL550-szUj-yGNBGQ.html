mean sport lightweight which the car
hasn't been since the last time Nixon
had a bright future but with this the
sixth generation it's come back somewhat
to those roots and watered them
generously with advanced technology
let's drive the 2013 SL 550 and check
that Tech three inches longer two inches
wider and with more massive lines and a
macho face in the 2012 model this is to
my eye not so much a pretty car as an
impressive one maybe it's the Mars red
color but this year's SL got more looks
than any previous year I can recall
exposing the public to now for 2013
Mercedes has kind of revised the cabin
of the SL it's got a lot of this
throwback stuff with these big round
nozzles around the vehicle but the key
is always the same here in the center
stack and that is the Mercedes command
system which today is looking like kind
of a small screen it's kind of the
iPhone of its class navigation has
always been really well rendered by
Mercedes you can also go fullscreen
which helps a lot with this relatively
diminutive display at that sort of
setting it's actually not bad and bless
their little German hearts for not
making me jump through hoops to navigate
the map the way BMW does just grab the
controller kick it around the direction
you want to go for flyovers now for
media you have a lot of things to choose
from AM and FM radio with HD radio of
course satellite radio six CD changer
right here in the dash memory card means
SD card right here you're not going to
use that music register is a hard drive
you have ten gigabytes of the 80
gigabyte navigation drive available to
rip media to USB storage is here in the
console I've got to stick in there now
the media interface is this proprietary
cable which in this configuration has an
apple connector as well as a female aux
pigtail right above the USB seems that
they can make that a little simpler to
be honest and of course Bluetooth audio
for streaming and I showed you the aux
we also have Bluetooth hands-free
calling of course phonebook downloading
all the bells and whistles around that
now on the output side very interesting
this car comes base with a 5.1 surround
Harman Kardon logic seven surround
system and the subs are fascinating
there are two subs built into the frame
of the car right about the firewall
there's somewhere just past the Floor
Mats there and the base in this car
really is remarkable which is quite a
trick in an open car now if you roll
across this ribbon further there's your
phone technology you can play DVDs
that's what's under video that's only
when you're parked obviously but look at
the little globe icon when you press
that you get outrageously a sign-in form
you have to do a form literally with
your name address and email address so
Google will let you move forward to use
some apps you have Google local search
silly news headlines who have already
ran on some other better device
here's Yelp restaurant reviews that's
interesting downloading POS and routes
from outside the car Facebook that
scares me the Google local search is
interesting is it lets you both enter
address obviously and then navigate to
it but most importantly it also gives
you Street View and you can pan around
but notice we don't have the Google
Earth view for navigation the way you
know who does I'm talking about howdy
note the green irony none of this works
while you're moving it's a car not a
tablet and even if it was one it'd be a
damn small one now related to this but
different is the embrace app you can put
on your smart phone that lets you have a
relationship between the phone and the
car locate the car lock and unlock the
doors not nearly as sexy as this but
possibly a lot more useful San Francisco
we're starting get to the era where
voice command is getting more natural in
vehicles in other words a little closer
to what your phone does for one
one-thousandth the price do you want to
enter a house number or do you want to
start route guidance house member please
say the house number two three five
house number 2 3/5 accepted do you want
to start mood guidance yes starting
route guidance and you'll also notice it
was very quick on the uptake to process
what I said this is a really good voice
command system now the seats in an SL
have always been a wonder of engineering
we have the active seats in this car so
as you corner the bolsters kind of do
this to hold you in place it's kind of
spooky I find it kind of annoying but a
lot of folks love it
lots of comfort controls here are three
levels of heat on this button three
levels of ventilation back here is the
air scarf button that's this guy right
over here this is a heater it really
works well even though you've got all
this air flow coming over the top of the
car it doesn't come down here and steal
the warm air wonderful engineering oh
this is kind of dirty you got massage
seats with one two three four levels of
whatever it is they do from slow and
gentle too fast and vigorous I don't
think children should ride in this car
now you've never seen a glass roof like
this before normally you've got a shade
you pull back and forth to make the Sun
go away if you're getting cooked on this
one you hit the magic sky control button
right here on the roof console look what
happens it lightens up electrochromic
lee that's pretty cool in fact it's also
cool that we have a retractable with a
big glass panel that's also amazing
especially since this is I believe the
fastest convertible top in the world for
a retractable at least look at this
thing it's a miracle of Engineering it
does settle back in as it does this
multi panel clamshell thing to take up a
fair amount of your trunk space but look
how quick that was that was 16 seconds
oh notice what's missing here no ugly
windshield washer nozzles instead there
are laser drilled spray nozzles in the
windshield wiper assembly so the stuff
actually ends up on the glass and not
mostly over your roof on the car behind
you now under the engine bay comes a bit
of interpretation this may be an SL 550
but it's not a 5.5 liter engine or a 5
liter engine with today's modern
technology you get plenty of power out
of a 4.6
it has direct injection you can hear
that multi spark it fires a spark one
several times for a combustion cycle
both of these intakes are force-fed by
their own turbocharger one per Bank all
this adds up to an engine that does 429
horsepower impressive but the torque is
the real key number 516 foot pounds
that's a lot for a car that only weighs
4,000 pounds now it's mostly aluminum
construction these days and that means
they shave some 300 pounds to get it
down to two tons on the nose zero to
sixty about four and a half seconds and
delivering 16 24 mpg no gas guzzler tax
all this power goes out through a one
choice only 7-speed automatic let's go
for a ride
despite shedding what bring in the
pounds since the last year's model it's
still a heavy car that is not a sports
car that's zero to sixty and four and a
half seconds is impressive but the power
comes on in big globs in all the SL 550
succeeds and exceeds at what it aims to
do which is to be a personal luxury
statement and an exceptionally
comfortable car with a sporting veneer
to it okay an SL 550 is not a cheap
copper this thing bases at 106 now the
good news is it's really well equipped
most of the technology we saw in the
cabin is part of the base trim one you
have to add on a cart though is that
kind of frustrating Mercedes apps sweet
that's $14 a month an interesting new
pricing model for the auto industry for
any kind of option and the one you have
to get $2,500 for the magic sky control
glass roof</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
