2016 TVs available today but it sure is
nice available in both the 55 inch size
and the 65 inch I reviewed here it's a
sleek high-tech design that's so thin it
almost disappears been seen from the
side the top half of this TV measures
just half an inch deep which allows it
to look great on a stand and mount extra
flush against the wall the bottom is a
bit thicker to accommodate stuff like
inputs and processors but not the power
supply that's a big external brick I
also like the design of the remote with
its rubberized buttons and since the set
runs the latest version of Android TV by
Google it also allows voice search
although you don't get access to the
same app store available to Android
phones Android TVs selection of
big-screen apps is great in addition
Netflix Amazon and Sony's exclusive
ultra service all with access to the
latest 4k HDR content you get apps like
Spotify watch ESPN HBO and PBS KIDS
built in the best thing about this Sony
however is its picture quality thin LCD
TVs often sacrifice picture for style
but this sets color accuracy contrast
and HDR performance are top-notch it's
not quite as good as an OLED of course
but it costs a lot less on the other
hand the x9 30d is a worse value than
the Vizio P series which offers similar
picture quality for much less money but
if you want this TV style features and
picture and are looking for a brand with
more cachet the Sony x9 30 V deserves a
serious look I'm David Katz Piracy net
