and welcome to road warrior where we
take a look at the hottest gadgets for
life on the go coming up a compass
that's a car a Hummer that's a laptop
and a dash smartphone that's actually a
smartphone let's start with a trio
that's a less than a trio in a good way
the new treo 680 this is a gsm phone
they just launched today and it works on
gsm network so they haven't disclosed
exactly which carrier just yet initially
available in four different colors
unlocked at the palm stores but they
haven't announced pricing but in the
press materials they did say that it's
going to be an affordable addition to
the palm family so that means we're
probably thinking this is going to be a
little less expensive than some of the
other models out there the 680 can surf
the web and send email just like it's
older brethren it works on the GSM
network next up Itron exclaims its
Hummer go book is semi rugged as you
know we like to prove these things dan
ackerman puts it to the test now it's
time for the fun part one of the nice
things about a semi rugged laptop like
this is it's supposed to be able to
withstand spills to the keyboard or
touch pad area can it let's find out
pour the water back off
looks good to me pouring the water back
off nice touchdown next up Bonnie Shaw
thinks that the tmobile dash might be
the first legitimate competitor to the
motorola q it's a little smarter than
the Q it's shorter here it is for
comparison sake overall though same whip
that's nice to feel in the hand has this
nice kind of rubbery texture so it's
great for gripping and nice and light
has a beautiful screen and the keyboard
is pretty spacious although I prefer the
queue is a little bit more the dash has
integrated Wi-Fi to which the Q does not
finally Brian Cooley shows off some
geeky but cool hidden features in the
2007 jeep compass limited but over here
we've got something kind of nice but we
also saw on the calibre it's this pocket
sleeve for holding any kind of a
portable you can stuff an iPod or a cell
phone a lot of other electronic
portables should fit in here rubberized
on the inside so it keeps the rattling
down a little channel right here for the
auxiliary output wire to follow so you
close that down run the wire out of
there snake it over to your aux jack not
the tiniest arrangement but it's free so
go ahead and use it and then right below
that we also have 115 volt outlet in
other words a typical household wall
outlet to run your laptop charger what
have you that means is there's an
inverter already built into this vehicle
i like that brian says the jeep compass
is almost identical to the Dodge Caliber
case you're comparing that's it for this
edition of road warrior I'm Tom Merritt
check back next time for more gadgets
that keep you armed and dangerously
productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
