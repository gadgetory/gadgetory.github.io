its google maps app and some of what it
can do I'm Jessica doll court for seen
that and i'm going to show you what's
new in Google Maps a lot of the changes
are visual now the map spans the entire
page instead of just part of it and you
can see that there's a floating search
bar on top now say I want to search for
sushi in San Francisco the search
results just pop up immediately on the
screen I can go and I can click on those
or I can dig a little bit deeper Google
is tying in some recommendations from
your friends on google+ if you click
your circles then it will show some of
your friends favorite restaurants
results are now organized by cards and
they give you a lot of information
details directions are front and center
you can easily save a location that's a
favorite of yours Street View is now
much more front and center as well and
there are photos that other people have
uploaded for general use Street View has
been available in Google Maps for a long
time but now Google is making it much
easier to interact with you can also
tilt the screen zoom in and out on the
screen and just get a view of everything
around you directions show up in the
left-hand pane along with everything
else you've got your biking directions
walking driving and public transport
Google will show you a blue line to get
to your destination that's the fastest
route other routes will be highlighted
in gray and you can simply switch back
and forth now Google has built a little
bit of logic into google maps now so
knowing where you are a and knowing your
destination be it can suggest the most
appropriate way for you to get somewhere
in this instance Google knows that I am
on foot most of the time and that I like
to take the bus so instead of taking a
car it suggests that I just walk and
take the bus you can see that the bus
line is in blue and my walking paths are
dotted lines a lot of the capabilities
of google earth are also baked into maps
now and Google is really emphasizing its
3d capabilities in the 3d view you can
tilt your landscape zoom in and out and
rotate around you can also
fly around to different areas on a map
the 3d maps do seem to take a little bit
longer to render and load but there's
much more information and it is pretty
impressive that you don't have to add
any extra plugins to do this it just
happens in the browser automatically
previously in Google Maps you could go
inside certain establishments you can do
that here the difference is that if a
user has created a photo sphere you can
see a 360 view of the inside of places
when an interesting aspect of the new
Google Maps is that it adapts to you it
learns from the things that you search
the places you check in which locations
and businesses are important to you so
we you see highlighted as your results
on the map are probably different from
somebody else's so that's what's new in
Google Maps it's pretty slick huh I'm
delicate doll court for cnet you can
