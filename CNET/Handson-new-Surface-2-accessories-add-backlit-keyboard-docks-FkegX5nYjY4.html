microsoft surface 2 event in New York
and you know in addition to the new
surface pro 2 and surface 2 there are
new accessories there are new touch
covers and type covers that are backlit
there is a battery-powered power cover
that basically enhances the life of your
surface tablet there's a nice added
feature and charges walls in your bag
all of those have backlighting like I
said for the accessory maybe I'm most
excited about here is the dock this is
for the pro level of the tablets the pro
and pro to this like maybe you were
hoping for last year it slides right
into the stock attachment and comes with
one USB 3.0 two USB 2.0 Ethernet mini
DisplayPort audio in/out the whole
shebang and it allows for daisy chaining
of extra monitors too it's basically
that continuing of the all-in-one tablet
is your PC pitch now it's impressive
that the backlighting is actually added
to the touch cover and the type cover
and the power cover and there's also
smart sensing technology to know when
you're using it and when you're not to
adjust the LED backlighting
appropriately plus when you're doing
with the touch cover there is a promise
of a lot more sensors over a thousand
this time compared to 80 before so not
only will there be better prediction of
typing but there's a potential for some
interesting accessories and again
there's one of those now that that DJ
mixing cover attachment that was shown
and you can sense of this might be used
maybe is a large touchpad or maybe for
gaming about to see what else there is
but it's kind of an exciting development
if you are a surface user but I think
again boils down to the dock the dock
the dock I think that's the one that
you're going to want to get to hook it
up and make it your all in one home PC
I'm Scott Stein and that's a quick look
at what's making the surface 2 and
surface pro 2 a little bit better to use
starting with the accessories
