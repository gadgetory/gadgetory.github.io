and people are flipping out I'm Bridget
Carey this is your cnet update twitter
has tinkered with the timeline pulling
the past into the present allow me to
explain you see one of the main reasons
people love checking Twitter is because
you see a real-time chronologically
ordered feet of what people are saying
so you can keep up with what's trending
this second but if you follow hundreds
of accounts you're going to miss tweets
posted when you were not logged on and
twitter is now addressing this by
showing you older tweets it thinks you
care about right on top of your current
feed this is a new feature and reports
say about a dozen of these older tweets
will be on top of the real time stream
with the oldest showing first it's as if
Twitter spread a layer of Facebook
flavored frosting on top of your tweet
cake hoping to make it more appetizing
to new users it's really not now now I
don't have it yet but you'll find it as
an option in settings and eventually it
may be the default for everyone it's
similar in concept to the while you were
away feature where Twitter shows a
handful of posts maybe I people you
interact with and that's since you were
last logged in but it's just more of
that although it may not be labeled
clearly you'll have to pay close
attention to the timestamp in the corner
or you could get confused hitting
refresh sweeps away all the old and it
only shows the new personally I have my
own methods to sort through the noise I
use tweetdeck and I separate people into
lists for different topics so the ones
that matter most to me don't get missed
you can also never miss a tweet when you
have a phone screen that never goes to
sleep LG electronics put out a tease
that its next big phone the g5 will have
an always-on screen that would mean you
don't need to press any button to check
notifications or the time it could just
appear there always as if we didn't
already have an addiction to checking
somehow this is supposed to keep you
even more connected sounds a little
gimmicky but we'll learn more later this
month when the phone is unveiled on
februari 21st which just so happens to
be the same day Samsung is showcasing
its next big phone the Galaxy s7 that's
it for this tech news update and there's
over
more cnet com from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
