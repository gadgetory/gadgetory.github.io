welcome to tomorrow daily the best speak
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley scanner and i'm jeff cannata and
we're here to get you some science
headlines you probably don't think too
much about how veterinarians actually
train for surgical procedures but you're
about to we've seen human training
dummies used in all kinds of medical
applications CPR lectures and even
surgery now companies sind a ver is
hoping to help veterinary schools with a
lifelike canine model it has synthetic
organs bones muscles veins ligaments and
even fat and is made of materials like
water fibers and salt they're so
realistic they can potentially replace
living animals in training procedures
which definitely seems like a humane
solution to a little-known problem
they're currently running a crowdfunding
campaign on IndieGoGo and they are
hoping to raise 24 million dollars to
give or donate 1000 of these dog dummies
the dog dummy dog dummies to veterinary
schools around the world kind of amazing
this is amazing but it the saddest thing
is finding out how they've been doing it
up to this point without a dummy it's
like it's obvious but you just don't
think about the fact that they have to
use real animals to to practice on so
terrifying Thank You technology yeah for
stepping in and saving thanks nicely
saving the lives of dogs yeah good stuff
Harvard is back in the news with their
Bionic leaf bionic leaf 2 point 0 is the
product of a research team at Harvard
University previous versions of the leaf
could self heal and work with impure
water the newest version of the leaf is
ten times more efficient than actual
plants at converting sunlight into
biomass and can split hydrogen from
oxygen while submerged in water which
can then be collected and used to make
fuels team lead Daniel no Sarah says
quote this is a true artificial
photosynthesis system unquote and hopes
to use the technology soon as an
inexpensive renewable energy source to
power homes in developing countries
that's awesome ten times the power of a
real plants amazing we have the power to
rebuild the plan
six million dollar lease yeah I hope
this hope these are inexpensive enough
to actually become practical ways to you
know send to developing countries yeah
and even I mean even modern countries so
I'm I'm into it anytime we can make
things more efficient always good uh
would you like to talk about on thursday
I'm both so good i like i like the
artificial dog because i think a lot of
