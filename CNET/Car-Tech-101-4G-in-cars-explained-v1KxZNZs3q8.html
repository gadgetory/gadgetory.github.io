one is y4g what's the big deal
first of all the phrase for G in the car
has a lot in it let's unpack the phrase
because it tells us much first of all
for G that means greater bandwidth more
speed for G provides faster pipes so all
of a sudden you have the ability to do
things with less lag time for people
that are in the car the experience is
just that much better yeah it really is
this for G was designed with IP in mind
where's 3G was really designed to
support voice services 4G is really
designed to support IP based services
internet applications the next part of
that phrase is in the car we're talking
about an embedded connection that is
part of the vehicle as opposed to it
being tethered off your phone you're not
looking down potentially on your
smartphone which you shouldn't be using
to find the address and looking around
trying to see a house number you have
the ability to do a search for a
destination and actually be able to zoom
in and see a full 360-degree panorama of
your destination before you even start
driving you have the ability to get data
in and out very quickly
IHS automotive currently forecast the
modest 1.2 million 4G cars on the road
by the end of 2015 but spiking globally
the 16 million just two years later this
2015 Chevy Suburban and right now is
going to be among the first of what will
be a majority of General Motors cars
starting with a 2015 model year that
have or offer built-in 4G connectivity
howdy may have gotten there first but GM
looks as though they're gonna get their
biggest at least for the foreseeable
future
and both out en General Motors say that
the hotspot created in these vehicles by
4G is dramatically better than one
created by 3G as in the past
look at this connection speed on my
laptop on the network via the 4G hotspot
in the Audi a3 and this is just one
snapshot of course but during a day of
usage I saw connection times that
allowed me to focus on the content
and not the connection that's feticide
persistence of connection is a very
interesting part of this story once
you've got a constant connection in the
vehicle you start to change your habits
a bit you learn to rely on things like
connected nav streaming media access to
various types of apps things that right
now are seen as a bit of an elective
will start to become part and parcel of
what driving is an tantalizingly we may
see manufacturers get in the habit of
OTA our over-the-air software updates
thanks to persistent for Jake that means
you may wake up one morning get a
confirmation screen that says we've
updated the software in your vehicle
enjoy your new services and your new
interface it's the same to likely get
with our smartphones once or twice a
year but cars have never done that now
you can keep things fresh over the
lifetime of the car but also its
immediate freshness you have the ability
to bring material from the cloud into
the car as we know recalls and having
that the reprogramming of computer
systems is a huge expense for the car
companies they'll be able to do this
over the air without requiring the
consumer to take it to the shop which is
gonna be huge they get a ton of
diagnostic data from the car before you
go to the shop they'll know what's wrong
with it then the health of the car and
other stats of course the question many
of you are already thinking is benefit
who pays for this I'm gonna have another
mobile data plan well right now yes it's
a typically 14 to $20 a month add on for
the very few cars that have come out
with 4G built in in the near future I
suspect you won't have to pay at all
except with your personal driving data
which is rich in value and your car is
going to be collecting information
and sending it back whether it's how
you're performing in traffic if there
are potholes
maybe weather conditions I think we'll
see a model where we have a lot more
crowd-sourced data for each car phase
through the node on that network that's
communicating and then data is
aggregated in a cloud and brought back
to that vehicle which brings us to
security and privacy something where the
stakes get even higher when you're
dealing with a big moving object and one
that reflects a lot of detail about our
daily lives there are all kinds of
things that the industry can do in
including communiques to enable a very
secure connection between the car and
the cloud over a 4G network but you need
to follow those steps to be able to make
that as tight as as it needs to be so
far car makers are keeping 4G
connections sandbox within infotainment
making sure that the systems are secure
and that they're isolated from other
parts of the car that potentially could
pose a threat embedded 4G is not a
matter of if but when at this point and
the next two to three model years will
reveal the many ways car makers intend
to convince you it's worth paying for
one way or the other
