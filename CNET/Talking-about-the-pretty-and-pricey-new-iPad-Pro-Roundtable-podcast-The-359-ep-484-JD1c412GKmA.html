remember remember the 5th of November
and that's the only amount of that poem
that I can recall because I am NOT a guy
Fawkes enthusiast good morning everybody
and welcome to the 359 podcast where
Napa so 484 on Monday November 5th and
we're gonna be talking about the iPad
today go figure here you go we got Ben
we got Alfred we got Scott thanks I'm
glad somebody remembered it was Guy
Fawkes Day
oh you mean anonymous day it's anonymous
I love you for Vendetta yeah I forgot it
was that but we did not remember so I
remember so we've got Scott bag yeah
Scott thanks very much for coming again
and he's got the iPad pro with him and
we were joking around before the podcast
started that this is probably the most
expensive thing that's here around this
table including us so either way we'll
get into the iPad pro we're also gonna
be talking about election scams so do
remember to vote tomorrow and send in
your questions and comments we'll get to
as many as we can at the end of the
podcast and let's get to it
all right chickity-check it we'll see
you back in the chat in 3 minutes and 59
seconds from 3e - welcome to the 359 I'm
Ben Fox Ruben I'm Al Franken I'm Scott
Stein Scott just published his review of
the new iPad pro it's got a new pencil a
new design and new face ID but it's also
got a new price tag yes does this thing
is expensive it goes up to 1899 but
that's for all the specs and all the
trimmings starts at $7.99 for the 11
inch I looked at the twelve point nine
inch version and I've been living with
it for a little less than a week do you
like it is it a so I think what I'm
especially interested in is is it a
computer replacement is it gonna replace
a personal computer yeah what is it
laughs no I don't think it's a very good
laptop replacement because if you're
looking for a trackpad support or Mouse
support it doesn't have that still and
it doesn't have the sort of web
experience that the browser experience
that you might expect that's on a
Chromebook even that allows for deeper
web tools but if you don't care about
that if you have already been using an
iPad or know what an iPad pro is bring
to the table last
your similar idea in the
software/hardware super blazing fast and
I think the design of it is really
nicely refined but that's kind of an
Apple trend of this year larger screens
more refined higher price yeah
good grief the other thing that's like
the most Apple II thing about this is
that they came out with a new pencil
that doesn't work with the old iPad yeah
only works with this one yep so you have
to buy a new pencil and it's a hundred
and thirty dollars it's $130 so just a
lot now the thing is if you've never
gotten one of these before and you get
this now the pencil charges and and
works much more seamlessly it's great to
have that it's kind of like earpods
nice instant available for you much
better than that stabbing out the back
but you have to buy a whole new one and
I'd have any adapter for the old one is
crazy
okay but okay we're kind of focusing on
some of the less enjoyable parts of this
do you like using it was it fun to you
know kind of draw with with the pencil
there are a lot of nice improvements uh
well you know when you're using it for
what an iPad is for like all those
aren't graphics everyday like a web
browsing even writing I really like it
and I've traveled with an iPad a lot too
is I think to take notes with or just
use on the train and for the amount of
apps it has and for all that stuff but
what I don't like is when you have to
start editing or if to start doing
anything that gets more mission-critical
which was the idea of Pro that part you
can't take it with you I don't think and
file an entire story without a lot of
headaches so that part I don't like but
I did like the speed of it I like the
design refinement I like there's more
screen and less size I wish you didn't
cost more yeah yeah no kidding
so we've also got even more election
scams we've got Alfred here to talk
about them this one is targeting vote
for one one org tell us yeah so vote for
one one org is a voter information
website you can find out where to
register to vote what candidates you in
your district stand for and what's on
the ballot generally John Oliver had
promoted on a show last week tonight on
October 28th and I got a two thousand
percent spike in traffic after that
little promo and it two days after he
promoted scammers set up a website
called vote for one 1.com which is a
common mistake that people would make
you know
people are going on comm websites and
this website basically ran a online
technical support scam which is if you
ever go on a website it tells you like
hey you've been infected with a virus
please call this number to get it
removed and then you know they
essentially put a virus on your computer
if you do call that number and then you
ask that you they ask you to pay them to
get rid of it it's a very common scheme
but now they're using you know curiosity
around the midterm elections to
basically use it as a watering hole type
of attack where they know a lot of
people are gonna be looking for these
election updates and things like that
and they're using that to their
advantage with a fake website do do we
know if there are now more or less
midterm related hacks or scams going on
nowadays then maybe four years ago
I mean it's unclear because anytime
somebody gets hacked it's not like
there's somebody going out there saying
hey we did this or anything like that
but we do know that there have been
they're more vigilant about it and there
are a lot of examples about this so
Microsoft in August talked about how
they had gotten rid of these websites
that were basically doing the same thing
but they might have been for a lot more
malicious purposes because so while the
fake vote for 1.com website was more for
financial gains the Russian websites
that Microsoft had taken out more
specifically like politically motivated
hmm great if you want to read more about
these stories check us out on CNET I'm
Ben Fox Ruben I'm alfred hang i'm scott
stein thanks for listening
all right thanks everybody for joining
us for the recording of the audio
podcast and Thank You Alfred for
pointing out that the forum 1.com is a
virus because I was about ready to go
there to cut away for b-roll sake just
to demonstrate another say so it's not
there's no malware on it there's no
virus on that page but you'll get a
pop-up that basically says like hey you
have a virus you know click here to
basically save you a computer it's it's
scared where but it does point to this
whole frustration of you know trying to
get voter information or something like
that and then finding a page like this
instead it's just and it's just such
easy like low-hanging fruit yeah that a
lot of people as you said just wouldn't
go to the dot org as you know more
fluidly as you know vote 401 org yo yeah
good good to mention that and by the way
eat for the boat either way thanks for
the close save I really appreciate that
nice so the good questions are piling on
in right now so let's go ahead and swing
on over to Scott and we'll talk a little
bit more about what people want to find
out about this fancy new iPad pro Kevin
Jones says I've heard the twelve point
nine inch is about the size of a piece
of paper
I guess that's technically a little bit
larger right real life-size comparison
for an 11 inch what do you think Scott
um yeah that's pretty close I mean if
you hold it up to a piece of paper it's
obviously thicker than that but the 12.9
is a lot smaller you can see in the
review the comparison photos it's still
not small enough for me to carry around
easily in a small bag but you know
compare it to say you know the MacBook
MacBook Air 13
it's bigger what's taller but it's in
that it's more like in that range but
it's a it's an almost 13 inch screen
it's just that there's no more before it
was really large and here let's let's
let's here's a piece of paper
there we go why even try this what's
very yeah we're very techy here look at
that
exactly it's worth I really had to go
digging I don't have a lot of paper
around here go figure
thank you so there you go it's almost
exactly a piece of paper yeah it's
almost exactly so if you like paper if
you like a sheet of paper turn the turn
back up Scott turn it back up
show them side-by-side again
yeah and then yeah right on there you go
it's 1.39 pounds I believe so it's uh
it's fine to hold in one hand it's a
little heavy but it's doable that you
could never do that on the 12.9 without
feeling kind of absurd I still prefer
the 11 inch the reviewnit I got is the
twelve point nine inch because it's a
little more compact because it's a
little more compact and they now fit a
little more screen size and they're in a
cost less so I just feel like what would
you need the extra screen size for it's
like the max I'm not really into just
paying for a little more screen size
just to pay for a little more screen
size oh that would like it if you did
sure I mean I've always liked the more
compact computers so I and plus like
it's not like you can really expand the
desktop on iOS at any really meaningful
way other than to split screen apps so I
don't think it's the same as having a 15
inch laptop versus a 13 mm you just have
apps that are kind of bigger and you can
see a little more text on the page and
more canvas size obviously but that's if
you're if you're a sketch artist and you
want to make the most of it and sure
you're gonna get that one good question
next up coming from Matthew doctor looks
great but why so expensive didn't Apple
one year ago say how good things were
because the iPad grad and not the pro
was the same price as last year yeah
well you know you look at like the thing
they did earlier in the year with the
nine point seven inch iPad that you know
going into Black Friday that's a really
affordable pick and I feel like that is
more than ever the choice it's kind of
apples saying that they're having a real
split between things like that and these
higher-end more expensive devices maybe
the idea is like some trickle down that
like you know your that's the iPhone 10
are in some ways that like oh we're
gonna give you some of these features
shave the price but leave some stuff off
it wouldn't surprise me down the road
that that's like that
but you're paying a premium now and if
this thing replaced your laptop your
regular computer sure but it doesn't it
could with USB see we haven't even
gotten into that u.s. PC is a is a
frustrating thing right now on the iPad
because iOS doesn't support it
individual apps will I don't mean
doesn't support it in the sense that
you won't be able to do the cool
multifaceted things you might think you
can do with us BC it's very much a
practice also just based on apples
earnings call from last week it seems to
me that's the model they're going toward
now where it's basically we're gonna be
selling less products but we're gonna be
making more money by like charging a lot
more for these these items I'm
absolutely their budget iPhone is now a
$250 more than the cheapest iPhone one
and their budget laptop their new budget
laptop which is the air is now twelve
hundred dollars or is more expensive
yeah these are things that are happening
it's very much lore buying this yes like
I think they made that bet with the
iPhone 10 being $1000 back at a time
when everyone thought that was a crazy
price yeah and now everything from Apple
is just a lot more expensive because
that bet is paid off for them
I blame everybody that bought into it so
yeah and on top of that what's
interesting is is that they're
significantly expanding their services
model too so not only do you buy this
product but then they're like things
like Apple music you continue to pay for
it as you as you own it so for folks
that are big fans of Apple they're gonna
like these products this is there's
there's an obvious reason why they're
doing this they know that if they charge
a couple hundred more dollars people are
still gonna buy it they still really
like these products so as much as we
complain about it and say wow that's
that's a lot of money it's they
obviously understand that there's
there's very much market for this stuff
yeah and same time they're still selling
last year's iPad pro just 650 650
dollars for the 10.5 that's kind of
their budget that's not a budget pick
but I mean I really like that model
anyhow I I'm a little uncertain where I
land with this now because the pencils
are different etc but I'd much more lean
towards paying less for an iPad than
more until it can unleash all the things
that it's supposed to be doing I have a
really dumb question how's the camera
there is a camera photos in the video no
it's fine it's fine
it basically is the iPhone 10 our camera
for rear
- the portrait mode and - optical image
stabilization so that's pretty damn good
for a tablet but who needs that I guess
for AR can help the front-facing one is
again face ID true depth so your
portrait mode your momochi an emoji all
that you've got all that I will got all
I will say this if you bring a nearly
$2,000 iPad pro to a concert to take a
photo with it and then it deserves to be
broken that's yes I'm just like I mean
like it's pretty big and I'm just
thinking about somebody holding this up
like a concert well there are people who
might use it for work purposes or like
you know as Apple will talk about
shooting video if they want to shoot and
then edit and that's not as absurd as
you'd think if you were thinking about
something where you were trying to do
something quick for a place you're
trying to assemble a video for to talk
about something or design something
whatever but it's a little overkill you
know it's not it's not the use case for
it I'd much rather have some really
awesome accessories that turned it into
the laptop I need yeah yeah a super high
end camera you know some Schmucks gonna
show up to a concert with that thing
like Alfred said and fair fair warning
if you're that person and I see you
we're at the same show it's getting
pizza so yeah I wish Apple would just go
ahead and nerf the camera on that thing
that's a good sign I want to say that
what if you wore it around your neck
like that like flava flav yeah man 2018
I totally was gonna say that too yeah so
you should shoot your videos that way
that's that's not terrible so I think
yeah sure it's good that it look it's
better than not having it but again
that's not a thing that I would look to
as a as a key thing plus let's say
somehow the performance on this based on
benchmark test because there are not a
lot of optimized apps is super crazy
fast but if you're going off of
benchmarks it is in the realm of the
2017 MacBook Pro or the 2018 razor blade
like you said the it's running on iOS so
it's not getting like that and like
exactly exactly
and last year's was already plenty fast
there at the point where the speed is
not the issue I didn't look at last
year's and go if only it were faster
I'll say yeah other way to go for a more
flex out of a dumb question but like
what will you
possibly be doing on an iPad that like
you would need it to be that fast I mean
the like video editing maybe that is
that week's night so a lot of people
would love to be able to take that on
the road a lot of our viewers and
listeners also work in the same media
editing field and they have mentioned
like that'd be great if I could put that
on my lap here's the problem you know
Apple still has not made Final Cut Pro X
and there's premiere which I haven't
played around with yet there's iMovie
which is very limited yeah and it
doesn't as our video editing team said
when I said well I guess I can use my
mouse and I said no you can't and I
doesn't support a mouse you have to use
touchscreen from what I understand it
also doesn't support external hard
drives or anything like that no it's not
so what so then exactly for pro for pros
what what can you possibly do you could
import but then your stand that's where
they're selling you up on this one
terabyte storage but but that's the
thing as USB see easily supports that
that's the frustration is that we didn't
get into that but I want to get into USB
see in its limitations that's one thing
it doesn't do it doesn't they don't have
any sort of real Docs mm-hmm look at the
Nintendo switch even that does more
interesting things with you see there's
a possibility here that they've opened
with USB see but have not fully follow
through I want to get back to the
questions by the way Brian let's kick it
back to you yeah yeah let's get back
into the questions all right
shout out to those of you pointing out
that we have a white excuse me a white
sheet of paper for what it's worth the
proper term is legal size paper but
they're asking if we need to get a sheet
of a4 in here for Europeans to compare
it to will work right on that from Bill
yes imported European paper lead a legal
finest legal size from Bill in your
experience how reactive are connected
accessories like the stylus and
keyboards is there a lot of latency sure
no everything that connects feels good
the keyboard is fast
the keys are good the sturdiness sir is
about to burps happen get a roll with
them so this of course it's not oh it's
because it's not by the way this all
connects via magnets which can detach as
easily as they can attach
how do they work and the only work in
one see I had it flipped around sorry
about that so won't work the other way
there's a good little lesson about the
accessories I wouldn't trust this case
in a drop let's put it that way because
the edges are rocks are we doing a drop
test for the for the pros they didn't
even make any claims about durability in
a drop I mean where do a Macbook drop
test but yeah we could this will break
if you drop it that's what's gonna
happen to a Mac Mini a lot that's a lot
of glass so yeah the keyboard is sturdy
its decent for lap typing it's not great
but it's better than it used to be the
pencil is the same latency and pressure
sensitivity as last year so you're not
gaining anything in terms of the actual
stylus it's all about that double tap
which which opens up one function per
app so it's super limited and apps other
than notes don't really have it yet
procreate will but it's like a one you
know between pencil and eraser kind of
things so don't expect this is gonna
like bring up magic menus or be super
customizable the charging thing is as
simple as this there was no damn place
to charge it or plug it in easily before
it would roll away now like air pods
it's always charged it's there that's
pretty much it so it's nice to have that
it doesn't really change the equation on
that but I just want to have more types
of accessories but the ones that connect
work really well next question coming
back from Matthew dad sure does this
mean that USBC is the future of all
Apple devices oh good good question yeah
I think it should be I think also bapple
is developing well it's not gonna happen
do i I mean you think they're gonna get
rid of lightening on on the iPhone
leggings pretty old I think that if they
start moving towards wireless charging
then if they do have air power at all I
mean that that format might matter more
to them okay I can see that I'm curious
why they went with USB see for the iPad
pro but not the iPhone 10 R or 10 right
because I think that there's a business
model attached to maintaining what they
didn't do it for this is why I think
there's been enough model is another
demand yelling here taking it seriously
and saying we need
do you think that the next iPhone will
have a USBC there's a chance I think
this is the question is this does Apple
ever see the iPhone look you have things
like the Samsung dec stock or other
things that are proposed phones as
computers phones are certainly is
powerful enough you could do the same
thing you could dock it and use it why
not I think you're looking at it too
much from a practical perspective I
think that it I think an Apple
perspective but I think from Annapolis
perspective they make a lot of money
licensing lightning because they own
lightning as an input output so they're
going to maintain lightning as long as
they possibly can USB C is more an
industry standard I don't know why
anybody specific oh I don't think it's
likely for next year but if they cat
some point I mean look the pencil charge
via lightning and their answer was not
just get rid of lightning but change the
pencils so those things happen those
things happen they make bold changes not
always the ones you want certainly but I
think that USB see here is a great step
forward but can I just say one thing
about how it works which is that if you
plug it into a monitor etc it mirrors it
it doesn't show a second screen it'll
show second screens for individual apps
if the app unlocks it and right now
there really aren't that many that do it
but up to 5k and it will support the
charges things I get charged a pixel a
charged a switch so it does reverse
charging that's cool
it's nice you can buy third-party
dongles and headphone adapters USB C
headphones worked fine adaptors like
that worked fine so it means you may
have to mean have to buy as many
specialized things but your mileage is
gonna vary like it's not you're gonna
plug in a hard drive you can't do it
that way and you can't there was no dock
that allows you to really use it with
like a mouse there's nothing no support
for that and to me that's what USB C is
all about hmm
yeah maybe in future years or future
updates but I think totally would well
it could very likely be next year in
which case maybe this iPad is your
doorway to when that arrives but the
better thing would be to just wait to
buy it until that arrives why would you
buy on potential and wait a whole year
to see if it gets there or not yeah by
the way if you have the patience good
question
Dutch let's talk a little bit more about
the
pencil you say there's no other
additional functionality to it besides
that kind of programmed in shortcut you
can't use it in like a PowerPoint
presentation to jump around in slides
any other options like that every app
apparently has the ability to take
advantage of the to tap condemn thing
what I've implemented from everything
that I've understood to this point it's
for one function so it means that you
could potentially make a PowerPoint
thing and if that DoubleTap you just set
it to whatever you wanted and in the
menu and you said I want it to be
advanced slide but I don't think you
would be able to do more than that it's
like triple tap could do something or or
a slide or anything else it's just a
double tap function this is a capacitive
sensor so it sounds like in the future
why it's like earpods why couldn't you
unlock that for more functions but right
now it does sound very limited by design
probably because they don't they don't
want people to activate things and maybe
screw up things like suddenly oh I
there was a density oh maybe people
would erase something or activate
something I don't know but just don't
expect a ton with that maybe some apps
will use it right now I you have to wait
for people to activate it no no I OS
support fret it's like you're gonna
double tap and bring up like a menu in
iOS speaking of here's a really really
fantastic question from cross and shoot
why doesn't Apple go all-in on the iPad
and make a dedicated OS just for that
tablet yes please
why not it's a great interesting it
should it should be like what Google
tried doing with Android and like their
tablet OS and now it's just like Chrome
OS and they don't really know what
they're doing with addy
there's the pixel slated yeah yeah which
is like just something it's coming out
soon just like that that's Apple could
has the ability to just make a new OS
and ecosystem and and say deal with it
and people support it I think as long as
the apps stay the same I think that the
OS on the iPad is due for a very big
change like it needs to have nothing to
do with the iPhone I completely agree
with you there's no reason why I need a
grid of apps I need to see a desktop
I need to see customization I want to
see Windows with that much power why
isn't that being taken advantage of so
no it's a good question
I think that is where Apple's gonna go
the question is how fast are they gonna
be able to get there
and at some point the Mac you know the
Mac and iPad are not fusing but yet
they're gonna share some common app
language with marzipan
marzipan and at some point they're gonna
I would just say they're gonna get there
because that's the destiny of it is to
have some some element of fusion yeah it
seems like they keep getting closer to
it right each year it's like it's like
the computing power for this as you keep
saying is very much there but it isn't
being taken fully advantage of yes it's
like the future Mac will have some
element that resembles this iPad and at
some point the division will be
meaningless but we're still in the split
now and you're I don't like the choice
that has to be made between the Mac and
the iPad for these prices it's very
frustrating because you're like what do
I get and it is not an easy choice that
Apple doesn't make it easy and I would
you say this is not a it's not a MacBook
replacement it's not gonna do anything
more than it did before
in that regard okay we only have a
couple minutes left so let's go ahead
and take one more question on the iPad
Tony wants to know what you think of the
64 gigs on the entry-level Pro is that
enough it's it's oh it's alright I mean
I I think it's it's I would rather 128
on the twelve point nine or something
like it really should be 128 but then
like would that mean another price job
once way it feels like the acceptable
amount by the way there is no 128 on
this iPad you will go from 64 to 256 to
512 to one terabyte so 256 is a lot for
unless you're using it I mean if you're
storing and editing files and stuff you
go no that's not a lot but it's like
that's an acceptable amount but every
price leap is not a hundred dollars it's
like 150 or something it's like so
you'll go right into the thousand dollar
range if you go one storage tear up and
64 feels pretty bare-bones for a device
this powerful not only that
that's not expandable you cannot add to
it no very important point it's it's
crazy bare-bones
I mean if you're doing the whole idea of
the iPad pro is you're working on you
know they're talking about Photoshop and
huge tiles and like big big massive or
for 64 gigs it's just not gonna work 64
gigs doesn't really work for a phone
nice day 64 gigs is like cloud storage
and you're watching movies and playing
some games which is not the market not
supposed to be the market for the iPad
pro hmm that was that's too casual for
what they are claiming that's also
extremely small if you're Tron it so you
know how they talked about how the you
know these graphics for NBA 2k like 18
to K 19 are incredible and you're gonna
want to play it on that but like other
games like take up huge file space like
Super Smash Brothers ultimate is
supposed to be like 15 gigs on the
switch and like that's why that's why
they tell you to get like a micro SD
card for something like that obviously
that's not really available for the iPad
pro so if they're trying to talk it up
as if this like amazing gaming rig
you're not gonna get that on the 64 gig
version of it right file sizes couldn't
happen that's the limitation there think
you've really talked me out of buying
this thing not that are you ever on the
frickin market for it but it seems not
not worth the price to me like our
rating by the way is still TBD and
that's because I've been trying to
figure out some of the weirdness with
USBC over the weekend we didn't have
that much time with it less than the
normal time frame and we're trying to
figure out that and wait for a few more
optimized apps that really aren't that
many at this point that make the most of
the a 12x so but I would say exactly
that the the hopefully it's pretty clear
that if you were thinking about an iPad
pro and you don't mind paying up a
little bit more this is a nicer iPad pro
than last year's but it's not a
transformative iPad pro is it like $200
nicer uh if you're in for the whole
thing and you are planning to live with
this for like five years yeah maybe
because I feel like the USBC down the
road might be one of those things you
really regret not making the move to but
I it's really hard to say that at this
point with that Apple having made the
move in iOS
that's why I feel like that the smarter
move is to hold off if you could and
just kind of feel it out as the Year
next to your approaches doesn't like a
great answer but that's the problem with
with evolutionary tech that kind of
takes those like one step at a time
things this doesn't feel like I really
wanted this to debut with the
transformative USBC accessories that
would make you go what crap that's cool
and again it took about the $300 switch
but they did it because that was the
that's the appeal the switch was like oh
cool it's a console a cool to handheld
they did it and this does not transform
from a desktop to a portable experience
at this point in a way that you would
want to use alright you heard it here
folks I just want to use me Nintendo
Nintendo needs to get into a tablet or a
prototype I mean the switch is kind of
like that switch from Apple's on to
something with these directions like
it's a good it is a good direction it
just needs it's the right direction it's
just not the full journey and that's the
part that's frustrating all right we got
time for one more let's go ahead and
address the elephant in the room about
the four one one scandal so syringe Roy
dad sure while wallet are wallop why did
not anyone like who dropped the ball at
formal one about defensive domain
purchasing Alfred um I reached out to
them about this actually I haven't heard
back yet but I mean that that is
definitely something that people should
watch out for you know registering
different URLs but keep in mind vote for
one one org
is pretty much like run by volunteers
and it's not a government organization
or anything like that exactly not yeah
so I you know having the resources to do
that and then checking like if it wasn't
vote for one comma I was taken there's
like dot code there's always like
different another one - yeah - I mean it
takes a lot to protect against that and
I'm not saying that like it's impossible
to protect against but considering the
amount of resources that vote for one
dot org like really has you know it's
it's pretty it's pretty
difficult like considering those
resources so I don't think anyone really
dropped the ball here but you know
CloudFlare did respond to it because
they were one of the hosts for the page
that it redirected to you too and they
they took down the malicious page so
that's at least good news on that and
that you know a company that does have
the resources is addressing this very
well said long story short I've worked
in the not-for-profit space myself years
ago and it is a pain in the butt to try
to really account for all the things you
can really account for when you have a
lot more resources under your belt and
that you can strive for and when you
have you know basically a fixed income
to work with you're not gonna be able to
get away with and plan for as many
insurance policies basically don't be a
jerk
you know other people so yeah we'll see
how that pans out in our modern eco
sphere so yeah we are out of time then
