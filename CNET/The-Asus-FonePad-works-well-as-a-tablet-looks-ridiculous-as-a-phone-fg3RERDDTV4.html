is yet another 7 inch tablet from a sous
that closely follows the Nexus 7's
design it has pretty much the same
measurements however the power and
volume buttons on the left edge as
opposed to the right there is a 1
megapixel front camera and a 3 megapixel
back camera either camera is anything to
write home about and provide only decent
picture and video quality there's a
micro USB port headphone jack and mic on
the bottom edge on the back is a small
speaker grille on the bottom here and
there's a removable panel at the top
once you've actually remove the panel
which can be a bit tough given that you
require to push down and up to take it
off you'll find slots for both a sim
card and a microSD card the tablet has
an aluminum back side that gives it a
smooth durable feel but if you ever use
the nexus 7 you're getting roughly the
same level of comfort here the foam pad
ships with Android 4.1 point2 jellybean
there's an outdoor mode that
dramatically increases the screen
brightness making the already sharp IPS
display a bit easier to see in sunlight
a splendid is an app that allows you to
adjust the hue color saturation and
color temperature of the tablet screen
it also shows you how your changes will
affect images before you sign off on
them games ran pretty smoothly but don't
expect Nexus 7 levels of performance
here now I know this is kind of burying
the lead but the foam pad isn't just a
tablet but an actual full fledge phone I
use an AT&amp;amp;T sim to test it and it was
unfortunately disappointed with its call
quality yes this is me holding a 7-inch
tablet to my head and using it as a
phone I agree it's pretty silly-looking
and unfortunately you'll have to buy
your own headset as a tablet phone thing
coming from the foam pad is available
now in the UK but asus has no plans to
bring it to the US it'll cost you about
$275 if you import it or 178 pounds at
that price is not a bad deal if you're
planning to use it as both a phone and
the tablet however if you're strictly
going tablet I suggest the still faster
still cheaper Nexus 7 i'm eric franklin
and this has been a first look at the
asus phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
