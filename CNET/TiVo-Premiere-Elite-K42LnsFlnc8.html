with CNET and this is a quick look at
the TiVo premier elite now what sets the
elite apart from the regular premier is
that instead of just two tuners the
elite has for allowing you with a single
multi stream cable card to record up to
four programs at once while letting you
view a recorded program or stream video
from services like Netflix or Hulu Plus
now some may not see the need for so
many tuners but if you live in a house
where several people could be recording
things it can definitely save you some
headaches plus it means you can pretty
much hit record at any time without
worrying about conflicts and with two
terabytes of storage inside you can
record up to 300 hours of HD programming
probably its biggest downside though is
that it only works with digital cable
and Verizon FiOS so there's no support
for analog cable in over-the-air antenna
satellite or 18:2 u-verse on back you
get connections for HDMI component and
composite video and optical and analog
audio plus an eSATA port for adding
additional storage and USB ports for
things like TiVo's bluetooth slide
remote or a TiVo Wi-Fi dongle that's
right the elite even at it's $500 price
tag doesn't have built-in Wireless what
you do get is Ethernet and built-in MOCA
support for networking using your home's
coax cables now the rest of the elite is
just like the regular premier same
excellent interface same selection of
streaming and on-demand video services
and music services like Pandora and
Rhapsody and now the capability to
stream from one premiere unit to another
on the same network and thanks to a
software update recently the whole thing
performs much better than it used to but
if it's not fast enough for you and you
have an iOS or Android device there are
free apps that really make using it
snappy all in all if you can afford it
and its monthly service which starts at
$20 a month or $500 for lifetime service
it is an excellent DVR I'm Josh Goldman
and that's the Tebow Premier elite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
