question for you this is a Baltimore
from Dave and I am just catching up a
Monday show and I notice there's no Jeff
now I'm wondering if he called out
advanced warfare today it's Bakalar at
home playing call of duty just curious
if not if he's at home and like at some
funeral funeral or something horrible
I'm very sorry but I got a funny feeling
Bakalar is getting double xp right now
well the rest of the world is working
anyway thanks for uh thanks for the
great shows talk to you later
what's up everyone it's Thursday
November 6 2014 thanks for tuning into
the 404 show I'm Jeff Bakalar joined by
dan Graziano the three-peat it's it's

as is still under the weather Arielle
Nunez over on the board howdy
who is this guy's name golden does it
matter
art jerk no I don't remember no I just
don't I don't remember either Baltimore
something about Baltimore from Baltimore
great he would have felt really bad if I
really was at a Funeral wouldn't ya
yeah no it's all good I just had the day
off
no I wasn't playing call of duty how
much xp did you get a lot that's not
that's not the point okay you know I
played a lot of Call of Duty but had
nothing to do with why I was out I think
if you wanted to play call of duty at
work you would just play it at work so
it's not reason to be out this is just
there's a smart man exactly should bring
you to the office and see what it is
it's better here than at home so I'm 12
sometimes construction all right we got
a great show planned for today so I I
emailed the winner oh did you know we
gave away a sunset overdrive Xbox one do
you know that the hell the hell it's not
like you could win if I enter no you
can't my brother who you don't know it's
like a family it's like friends and
family that game looks of any employee
your employee they you picked the winner
so I picked the winner no I did oh you
didn't know it's a third party that's a
bit of no that's right I didn't know

yes yes the Royal they yeah they did
and it's a guy named Stephen F and I
email them a minute ago and Stephen has
three days to write back and claim his

Destiny bone
I sure exactly so and then in a few
weeks we're gonna give away the Call of
Duty one too and that's got a one
terabyte hard drive mm pretty sick
that's nice oh so Steven get your crap
together and email me back if you want a
free xbox one do that and then you've
got until tomorrow to enter the Back to
the Future contest that ends sometime on
Friday so make sure you do that we've
had tons of submissions thanks to
everyone who's done that
what else do I got to take care of here
before we jump into the stories I don't
know I think that's it so let's get
rolling
all right let's there all right first
things first thing this new thing is
hitting the Internet it's from Amazon
it's called the Amazon echo okay Dan
myself and Arielle just finished
watching their little teaser product
video and after all the cringing and
squirming in our seats was over we were
like what the hell is this thing so Kay
so here play the video and we'll talk
about it while it's playing what the
hell is Amazon so go it seems like
Amazon is like trolling us let me get
that if you think they're trolling it's
literally yeah it's the video is so
cheesy
and the cheesy video I mean it uses a
voice recognition and everything that
obviously like think about how bad Siri
is think about how bad all of these
voice activation or voice activated
products are right like it's clearly it
has has have a disclaimer saying like
screens are stimulated sure sure sure
smartphone commercials and that's what
this has to be because it's not gonna be
that good I'm very pessimistic I was I'm
gonna buy one if I get you invited
I love these like this thing sucks but I
can't wait to buy me so here's what it
is I'm just a downer I know voice
technology I know I mean it promises a
lot right it's and it's saying it's
gonna do a lot it looks cool they could
have done a better job on the video
right the video is a little suspect so
here's what it is if you're listening to
the show but you probably are Amazon
echo it looks like the size of a
Pringles can a little small maybe a
tennis ball canister is that a good a
now no definitely print like that but
lighter everything more Pringles yeah
yeah it's a little bigger than Pringles
is
yeah I guess it is because we're looking
at it in scale with these yo-yos in this
video anyway so it's like this you know
cylinder looking sort of thing that is a
Bluetooth speaker and also has this
voice in it sort of like within alluded
to a series sort of helping hands sort
of thing where you can tell it to do
things and it hooks up to your Amazon
devices I don't know if it's gonna work
with all your Android devices I would
imagine it would do something I might
not might not I might only work with
your freaking fire phone that you don't
have or your your Fire tablet which only
a fraction of people have so I don't
know but it's always connected it can
answer questions in the vein the way
Google answers with Google now it's very
similar to Siri yeah it's like tell me a
joke it tells you joke but one of the
cool features what we're seeing now if
you're watching the stream is that it
can do a long clock you can wake you up
and everything right and you can just
say so you activate with a code word I
can just be like hey Jeff right you can
oh I don't know you think it's gonna let
you set your own what said it says
always listening but it activates with
special words no I was it like a wake
were it was way cooler had a name for it
yeah I took it as you could set your own
name maybe you can't I don't know but I
let's just say like oh hey Jeff like
Sheriff their alarm right so it I love
that idea of not being like not getting
out of bed they shut off your alarm I
would just finish I will miss work so
often if I have this product and then
they played a man pisses me off when
like I hate when a new product comes out
and it does something for you that you
don't need it to do oh no okay like this
guy he wakes up and he's like hey alarm
oh nobody called it Alexa Alexa oh hey
Alexa turn your alarm off lady and and
he's like hey the wife goes why are you
turning your he said cuz it's Saturday
and then they go what day is it Alexa
and it's like it's Thursday where were
you that you lost all concept of time
you forgot it was the middle of the guy
that week no one does that the only
useful feature is what's the weather I
would love to say good without it like
with OK Google you say ok Google what's
the weather or you have to hit the Siri
button asked
there is if you can just say it without
pressing a button I love that let us not
forget so to your point I agree that is
a cool feature to your point though they
show this sample video and this echo is
in every room in their house so they're
obviously so you know you're only gonna
buy one of them you gotta move it
everywhere you go and that doesn't work
for me if it's in your bedroom well then
it's in your bedroom I'm gonna leave for
work I'm gonna leave the echo in the
living room now no you're not crazy
that's not what you want to do it's just
it's by invitation only right now right
so you can't even buy one if you want
okay so it's it I request an invite
because I want to buy horse you did you
can seven so if I'm selected I will
receive an email with an invitation to
purchase it in the coming weeks it's
like let me give you money but Amazon
does this all kind that they always
announced things with that like surprise
sure we had no idea this was coming
there were no rumors about it no leaks
sort of like the fire TV stick that came
out of breaks ago but no one cared and
they're doing a special offer where if
you're a Prime member you save $100 no
significant it's still a dollars
normally you get a 50% off for 99
dollars
I think what they're thinking is just I
mean for 99 bucks I guess I'd buy this
you I think I'm gonna it's an impulse
buy yeah 99 is the one right now is is
like crazy to me but for 99 it's like
yeah like I bought two um the fire TV
stick Stu because they had the same
prime pricing right what was it it was
like 15 bucks oh yeah so cheap very
cheap Prime members anything glows you
know at the top has a rim sort of light
that glows real nice you can tell it it
has examples of phrases you can say to
it will it rain tomorrow play music by
Bruno Mars now don't forget this is all
gonna probably operate within the Amazon
ecosystem so you're gonna say play music
by Bruno Mars does that mean it'll work
with your Amazon Prime music
subscription I hope so
like it obviously won't work with I
assume Google Play Music or iTunes
maybe Spotify I could see them doing
that it would be nice to get some sort
of clarity on can so there is an Amazon
echo app it says here for fire OS
Android desktop and iOS okay
I can handle that but yeah we you know
look this thing is literally an hour old
hmm
so we'll find out much more about this
tomorrow oh wait maybe you have to say
what yeah you can't set a custom world I
guess it says echo is always ready to
connect just say wake the wakeboard
Alexa right but no it's not like you can
pick awake oh yeah it'd be like Alexa
Robert and some magic you're married to
one of them is just Graziano oh that'd
be awesome like hey Graziano I don't
have that much pull at Amazon not yet so
there it goes and then the other thing I
want to touch on real quick before we
move along
they-they-they bragged about this thing
called far-field voice recognition which
is something apparently that is a
sophisticated seven microphone array
that will somehow hear you better than
any other voice listening device out
there it just it comes off so
pretentious it's these sensors use
beamforming technology to hear you from
any directional form of beam like with
enhanced noise cancellation stuff yeah
it just it's easy to get a little
skeptical I hate the way that they just
I don't know be simple explain it be
simple sure sure and and I want to know
what the Bluetooth speaker sounds like
you know Bluetooth audio for the most
part sucks right yeah it's not the pet
you you get what you pay for is what I
do but I'm seeing in general that
technology oh yeah not deliver the best
sounding the modality and you know I
want a really high-end sort of you know
Bluetooth speaker so we'll see how it
goes I was also a little unclear about
if you can charge it or not like uh if
it sounded like in the video they kept
having it plugged into the wall it seems
like it only it doesn't have a battery
it has to be plugged into the wall I see
the power adapter here and everything
and the little girl in the video said
one of my favorite features is that it
can just sit there plugged in which is
like the weirdest every features that it
doesn't have a battery and I can't bring
in it it's not portable so if you're
like going camping but it makes sense
because guess what's not going camping
with my guess I can't because it needs
to be connected to the cloud as well so
it has some sort of Wi-Fi in it and
alright
jury's still out I wonder when we'll get
our
our hands on one I'm sure it'll happen
real soon okay I wanted to there's a
bunch of pop culture stuff that we got
to get to today number one Star Wars
Episode seven has a subtitle what is it
it's Star Wars The Force awakens the
force awakens which I don't know how I
feel about that yeah I mean they've
never been really good after the first
three in terms of subtitles hope is cool
Return of the Jedi and Peyer Strikes
Back I like all that I have to rewatch
them actually because it's been so long
re-watch them or see them for the fine
Ives in there be honest we watched the
Vita going-away party were you there
when we have no it was nice yeah no I've
seen them I really like I think it's the
second one I think it's uh what's that
not Return of the Jedi it was the second
one with my favorite one Empire yeah
Empire Strikes Back yeah really good
okay is it so I always get them mixed up
the third in the second a lot of people
do like return I mean they were all very
good I liked them all there was none
died like there was no moment where I
just didn't like it sure uh the newer
well I guess not new anymore it's been
10 years no but there's yeah we're gonna
say they're terrible not terrible
they're good movies outside of the Star
Wars franchise they're not bad they they
entertain but for I mean I'm younger to
it's not like I did grow up in Star Wars
but I didn't see them in theaters or
anything - yeah um
and I love Star Wars but and when these
new ones came out was just it wasn't the
same feeling as when I saw the first one
it's tough for me to comment on the
whole thing just because like you said
it's it's a Jenner it's a few
generations before us and maybe the
generation before us and I'm not gonna
just like associate myself with you I
know you're significantly younger than
but growing up I didn't see them until
maybe I was like 13 or 14 and you know I
remember watching the first three and
being like oh this is kind of alright
and then you know what it really did did
for me like Spaceballs really Baseball's
was my real sort of introduction in our
Wars because I feel like I saw
Spaceballs first really and I was like
man this is really good yeah like funny
I know Brooks is great he's the best so
yeah I don't know I feel like I can't
comment on them because it's this
situation where those movies have a
certain kam penis to them - mm-hmm and I
can't you know say like oh the first you
know episodes 1 through 3 you know
because they looked so much better than
the original 3 it's like we're I mean is
this working
looks alright they don't really do
anything for me it's I love old movies I
love black-and-white movies I'm sure
like that but in terms of like the
aesthetic that they're trying to oh yeah
man you face a little jarring where it's
like Oh after the third one all the Jedi
Technology want to trap and let you know
what I mean like everything's made of
cardboard I mean yeah you can look at it
that way but that's that's the things
that continuity I mean I all I'm asking
for is a little continuity hmm but yeah
I don't know I don't you know I've
really I think I'm just not into I just
don't care about Star Wars I know are we
talking about this because if people do
this I know people do care about I mean
I love JJ Abrams - I've loved ways done
with Star Trek I like super 8 so I think
he's like the one to make Star Wars I
mean I can't say mainstream it's always
been mainstreamed yeah
but to get a new generation hooked on it
sure but then again there's always like
what the Clone Wars is all those shows
there's a lot of good news yeah so I
think the younger generation may be
hooked on it but he will make it like
what he did with Star Trek how Star Trek
now I do like analyst who knows yeah
really good I don't even know I don't
know why I'm even gonna ask him this
question but Arielle come on show me
those thumbs down for Star Wars yeah you
know it's not I don't hate it
have you seen them I've seen two of them
return to the J and Empire Strikes
universe plane it's the first door yeah
maybe I did but I just don't remember
yeah Oh such a yeah so young when it
came out yeah for sure
I watch them again though no yeah it's
worth checking out once yeah you know I
don't know no we have Star Wars fans
listening in their Pony like bash in
their head and gonna hate the fact that
I didn't call it mainstream kill me yeah
more pop culture news so I'm have you
been watching South Park this season oh
it's been magnificent I like it because
they have continuity finally right like
every episode in the old one it was like
Seinfeld there was no it was just a
whole new day
zone and no one here that Cartman did
something crazy right at this time like
what butters burned down the gym he was
still suspended from school the week
later right the joke in it like Stan's
dad is secretly Lord or Lord and
everyone's going gluten-free alright so
there's these things that they're doing
but the bigger theme about South Park
this season is that they're tackling
mostly tech issues they did last night
was an episode about freemium about
mobile gaming and free-to-play apps and
they were comparing it to the sort of
you know addiction reliant corporations
that basically make money based off
people's addiction and they were
comparing how alcoholics fund you know
alcohol companies and beer brew and all
you have to say is drink responds right
and so they do they were comparing that
to the freemium apps people who you know
are just sort of addicted to the instant
gratification and those micro
transactions and you know they they make
a really compelling point with a really
silly delivery and that's something only
thing they tackled this year they've
done
uber they've done drones over also was
the whole like Tesla and everything yeah
scenes from like Tesla's announcement
which is the thing I love about South
Park because they have such a quick
turnaround where they had parts of like
President Obama's acceptance speech
years back right so I just love that
they're so relevant totally well they
may make any mention for day yeah you
know that's what happens really amazing
stuff if you're not watching in I know
it's not for everyone in its crass and
it's it's taboo and you're so easily
offended but it is very smart television
there's a reason they've been on the air
for almost 20 years yeah it's and it's
actually a very smart because freemium
they at one point Stan spins I think
like $200,000 on again it's like 28
grand and we always see those articles
come up on seeing it where it's like
parents are out of outrage because their
kids are spending so much on mobile
games I mean I play clash of clans on my
phone it's like the only mobile game I
play and that is a freemium game but you
dump money so it I paid I think five
dollars I've total yeah okay
at one point they said Stan you stayed
home from school and you built a new
hospital for Canada right and you did
that all in eight hours and that's what
these games are my clash of clans as we
speak I think I'm like gaining gold
right and if you want to gain a quicker
you pay right admit gems and they the
the funny thing is that so the idea is
that Canada is behind this Terrance and
Phillip mobile game which is also the
devil is in flu and all of that spoiler
but so so so basically they go so
Canada's making money off American and
they basically lay out the entire on
like a white board lay out the entire
structuring of how a freemium game works
and why it's profitable mm-hmm and what
and basically they say they're like look
all it is it's just fun enough and it
revolves around waiting its and people's
desire to skip the waiting is like that
trigger that pops the corridor into the
machine that makes them suspend you know
the 40 cents at a time yeah it was very
smart with when they mentioned how you
and 99 or 90 percent people won't pay
right and then you have the ten percent
for the tiny fraction and that's weak
and that is completely true - it was
crazy
so I I love South Park we weren't gonna
do a show without mentioning this week
at least without mentioning advanced
warfare that came out on Tuesday hmm and
for my money it's the best Call of Duty
game in a very long time but there's a
feature on the PlayStation 4 exclusively
that is hitting a roadblock so over the
last couple weeks Sony rolled out a new
version of the firmware for ps4 2.0 that
introduced something called share play
which basically lets you toss or
essentially hand the controller over
right as you would on your couch but to
someone over the Internet
someone's on your friends list and I'm
on the fan I'm you know in a party chat
with him like hey Dan you want to play
this game at that I'm playing for my
house you can set that up on the console
and then Dan will have an hour with the
game oh so it's not like split-screen or
anything it's not share play do you have
to have a I know to play on so the
person hosting it has to have
PlayStation Plus so if I don't have
place is fine real yeah Wow
pretty cool me buy ps4 now there's the
thing well you're spending a lot of
money today here's the thing though
there's a little bit of controversy
because Sony had advertised that like
any game would play mmm nicely with
share play turns out
collodion Vance warfare mmm they're
blocking it and they're not letting
people share the game over the Internet
controversy has ensued and yeah we're
starting to wait and see how it plays
out I mean it's yeah that's definitely I
could see that being an issue because
there are all these companies it's
activision activision yeah and
allocation is it EA too or no oh it's
not EAS titanfall oh okay because I know
EA always has issues and games right oh
he's against the AI it's tough to hide a
feeling it was launches like um I don't
know it's crazy because ridiculous that
yeah they're blocking this feature
because it it only benefits them because
it gets people talking it's like oh my
god I played this for an hour I'm gonna
go out and buy one like it's is an
awesome title it's weird if you're
hosting it you can sort of like take
control back at any point cuz you could
be like oh man I let Dan play this part
but I want to play this part and you can
you can virtually rip the controller out
of his hand but they can't play online I
would assume like it and then you know I
don't be single-player missions I don't
believe you can I do believe you can do
co-op stuff though like offline Co it's
cool yeah it's really impressive sort of
stuff I've I haven't been able to test
it out just yet but on paper it sounds
pretty awesome I'll have to wait and see
how it plays out in reality finally a
little bit of show-and-tell oh yes
can I see this of course excuse me so
this is I'm holding it wrong I was
holding this what is this thing H the
Asian looks like it looks like some sort
of paraphernalia it or an inhaler I mean
yeah you know very high-end inhaler it's
it's HTC re camera right and it's it's
supposed to take on GoPro it's HTC's
whole idea with it is you put your phone
down
so when little Billy is playing
basketball you are not behind your phone
washer you're just holding this
and it can take photos like that and
take videos yeah because that's totally
normal
I mean this is it's like your own little
like periscope it's very it's very smart
it has a wide-angle lens right so it can
capture everything there's no power
button when you pick it up it powers on
automatically neat and there's no
viewfinder you just use the lens we're
gonna go but you can connect it with
your phone I think over like Wi-Fi
direct and have a viewfinder on your
screen so and so I just hit this button
and also if you hit that button one snap
is a picture okay 16 megapixels all
right
now I want to start filming holding it
will film oh and when you let go it so
no if you hold it it will start blinking
okay and I think that's how it starts
filling up oh yeah look at that it's
gone I mean it's a very good product we
gave it a very good a three and half
star rating from Josh Coleman who
reviewed it right and it's kind of neat
so it's more to play do it oh that's the
GoPros are waterproof but they need a
case response waterproof up to about
like three feet right and you're just
dunk it in the front has a small button
where you can press it at the 720p so
the back is 1080p gotcha
720p slow motion so it's I love the idea
it's cool that you can you could just
stand it up like we said think if you're
not watching think about it like an
inhaler and I always hate when you see
people and they're always behind their
phones taking photos with the words like
this elites conceal Deacon sweet just
you can stick in your pocket or yeah
like right here stick right in there the
issue is though so it has about like I
think like an hour or so of battery life
continuous recording obviously it's not
meant for that it's meant for quick
videos it's just gonna peaked up in the
my head you see that he's like but the
issue is it's $199 the sweet point I buy
it
haven't gonna buy it on the show I like
it there you can put two now you're
upside down though you can put an SD
card into it well I'm like we know it's
recording right now yeah no it's been
recording so an opposed the video leaves
oh pretty cool I love the idea of it
it's just the price seems too expensive
it can hold it comes with eight
gigabytes of storage
and you can hop out and put a I think
128 gigabytes
I got an SD card really yeah okay so I
mean it can store ton sure and I think
there's like an extended battery that
clips on to the bottom right for long
expense it comes in different colors a
bit yeah uh I actually don't know
really I was at the launcher it comes in
in the paler white and I hope it comes
in like flashlight black cuz that's what
I would get like it was it was other
colors yeah oh yeah yeah rare you forget
that we were actually sitting next to
each other apparently the issues are
though that it's audio quality isn't
like that good right does audio quality
is poor sure I'm gonna live with that
but yeah I mean look a little rugged and
the whole thing is this the photos it
takes aren't any better than a
smartphone okay that's so you're
spending $20.00 on a smartphone you're
spending $200 on this this is fun
because you know I don't like you said
I'm buying this strictly because I don't
want to be that guy doing the whole like
you know in front of my face like a
reject you know what I mean I mean what
HTC has had a really tough time in the
smartphone game and they they make
incredible products I love to HTC One in
the metal design right so me being
pessimistic again when this hits the
bargain bin I'll be the first to pick it
up
I just think $1.99 is you heard it here
first folks man are you like are they
paying you more than we know I don't
know I'm just so biased no you're not
biased you're only two Apple products
that's the biggest fan boy ever
uh speaking of fanboy I did a video with
Sarah Harbin I want everyone to go check
it out I'll post the link in the and the
show notes we're doing this thing called
nerd rage have you heard about this I
did yeah you see it I didn't see it so
it was live so Sarah's having us like
record these uh these minute long rants
and I did one on fanboys and then she
animates the ring yeah it's great
so we'll post that in in the show notes
as well boys can you give us a quick
rundown of without spoiling your video
what were your rants with fanboys I just
think they're the worst people in the
world and like they're just I just don't
I don't respect anyone who just chooses
blindly blind allegiance to a specific
brand product right mmm definitely and
people are like happy they like proudly
label themselves like I am a Sony friend
I mean to get so intense the Apple
versus Android this Microsoft or Sony
Windows it's just the worst thing ever
it's like a way of life I love my
Android phone but I think the iPads a
great tablet I think the iPhones a great
product too um it just it's my personal
need I don't have anything against it
and that's my problem and then like
fanboy ISM can be applied to a lot of
different things in the world the way
people just like do things without
thinking I mean yeah you know like
religion a lot there's a lot of things
politics whatever it is you know people
just do it because they think they
belong to a certain side anyway we're
not going to go down that rabbit hole
but I'll link to that in the show notes
