collaborative way to create stories that
you will love let's go check it out
so I'm starting here on the Explorer tab
this is where I can browse my entire
collection of photos and videos thanks
to Windows and the power of AI and deep
learning story remix can recognize
people and objects in photos and videos
so now I want to use my collection to
create my own story so I'm going to go
to the create tab so here we have a
video that story remix is already made
for me and what's really unique about it
is the footage was captured
collaboratively by all the parents who
were at that game I just set up a story
and I invited them to join and then they
use story remix on their phones to
contribute all of their footage we've
added pen and ink support to story remix
you might have seen inking on photos and
videos before but this is new I'm going
to anchor this note to Gina okay now
check out how the note follows her as
she moves down the field and evade this
defender some story remix has already
made a montage for me I'm gonna check
that out first
but I want this video to be all about
Gina my MVP so to do that I just touch
her thumbnail and story remix will redo
the entire video with her as the star
let's try an even different vibe because
story-based can do that too it can give
you a whole new look and feel for your
video by just touching the remix button
story remix is going to change the cuts
the filters the music this is brand-new
and this is a storyboard interface where
I can easily add or edit or remove clips
and then if I want to change up the song
I can do that thanks to groove just open
it up think about what theme I'm looking
for I think I want cinematic so let's
try film
okay let's amp up the intensity on that
one okay now I'm going to select that
one and watch how story remix redoes all
the cuts to match the beats of the song
this saves me a ton of time because it
means I don't have to re-edit my video
every time I change the song so I came
here to look for inspiration for that
final clip so there's that fireball that
caught my eye and I do have an idea of
what I want to do with this fireball so
let me move the video to right where she
kicks her soccer ball okay now let's put
the fireball in the project move it over
to the fire butter the soccer ball and
then I'm going to anchor it to the
object let's see how this looks huh
here's an explosion that'll do let's
place it my project move it into the
goal let's watch it
