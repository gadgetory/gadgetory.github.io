at their press conference here at e3 but
did they deliver well sort of Phil
Spencer came out here and he said that
the entire press conference is going to
be devoted to games and while it was
wasn't necessarily exclusive xbox one
gaming so let's get to the exclusives
first sunset overdrive has to be the
biggest exclusive for xbox one coming
out this year and we finally got that
exposition for the game that we've been
needing so bad we have an idea of where
it's going to take place what the
characters are about what the backstory
is a little bit and we have five of what
the games actually going to be like and
I think that was really important for
Microsoft to convey sunset overdrive has
a very comedic sort of storyline and I
think that's a refreshing tape the game
kind of makes fun of itself so I'm
really looking forward to that
but when it comes to other exclusives
that xbox announced here at their press
conference there's a little light we saw
that a new track is coming to ports of 5
motorsport and we also heard the
announcement of Forza horizon 2 then we
got a gameplay demo of fable legends
later this year also the entire halo
franchise is getting an HD remake for
Xbox one and you can also mix and match
missions throughout all four games and
your own sort of mixtape campaign it's
pretty cool so what else in terms of
exclusive for Xbox one dead rising 3 is
getting DLC first to the game Harmonix
came and said that they're going to be
giving us a new dance central spotlight
game that will be download only for Xbox
one and Kinect that was really the only
mention of Kinect during the whole show
finally in terms of exclusives you found
out that Platinum Games is working on a
game called scalebound and crackdown is
coming back to Xbox and a reboot
specifically for Xbox one Microsoft had
a lot of catching up to do on the
independent gaming front and they sort
of made a push for it with ID at Xbox
which is their independent publishing
platform and we saw sort of a highlight
reel of games we can expect to see on
that platform this year and beyond so
that really does it for exclusive to
Xbox one both the messaging to me is
that Microsoft is going to be banking on
timed DLC that's going to hit xbox one
first we saw that with call of duty
advanced warfare we saw it with involved
we're also seeing it with tom clancy's
the division from ubisoft we'll have to
see how that works out plus there's a
few exclusive xbox one titles that
gamers can finally start getting inside
of that that's it here from their press
conference at e3 2014 I'm Jeff Bakalar
foreseen it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
