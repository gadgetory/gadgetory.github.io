wheels and beats by dre on the stereo it
doesn't get much more imported from
Detroit than this Chrysler 300s will pop
behind the wheel of this 2014 model and
check the tech this is a luxury sedan so
it's no surprise that the interior is
nicely appointed there are a couple of
spots here and there where it kind of
seems like Craigslist cheaped out a
little bit on the material but in
general everywhere that you the driver
come into contact with this vehicle
steering wheel particularly these blue
leather seats that are going to match
nicely with our jazz blue exterior they
all feel really good and well put
together now one point that you come
into contact with a car regularly that I
don't really like is this electronic
shifter now it looks like your standard
t shape shifter but instead of staying
where you put it it actually returns to
neutral once you've pulled it down into
reverse or to drive kind of like BMWs do
and it's a little bit difficult to tell
exactly what year you're going to land
in if you have to quickly for example go
from Drive to reverse when parallel
parking more often than not you end up
in neutral or even worse in park one of
the parts of this vehicle that stands
out the most is the standard at this S
trim level beatsaudio system it's got
those big red B badges on all the
speakers its 552 wide spread through
about 10 speakers including one
subwoofer in the trunk and it's a pretty
good sounding system I know beats gets a
bit of a bad rap for being not very good
founding for as much as they cost but in
this car it's pretty good mix in the
dashboard we've got Chrysler's UConnect
8.4 infotainment system and it looks
like all of the UConnect systems we've
seen across the Chrysler brand but
they're not all created equally this is
actually an earlier version of the
software I believe and what leads me to
believe that is that the rerouting
algorithms on this seem to take about
twice as long as they did in the Dodge
vehicles that we've driven recently
which actually do have the newest
version of you connect this car is also
lacking the sort of in-car Wi-Fi
hotspot' a lot of the UConnect s the
actual connected part of you can
now under the hood this 300 s is going
to be powered by a 300 horsepower
version of Chrysler's 3.6 liter v6
engine it's a couple of extra ponies
over the standard 300 thanks to a sport
exhaust now this is paired with an
8-speed automatic transmission this is a
good gearbox it gives us good crisp
shifts that are quick but they're also
smooth it's not a lot of jerking around
of the vehicle when you're changing
gears with these paddle shifters now the
3.6 is only available with this 8-speed
automatic if you jump up to the v8 you
actually drop down to a I think a
5-speed automatic transmission that's
not that great if you have to have your
v8 that's definitely a time you're going
to want to wait for next year's 2015
model because it's going to be upgraded
with that 8-speed automatic also it's
going to help it get a little bit better
fuel economy as well
okay let's price this 2014 Chrysler 300
s 34 395 is going to get you out of the
door on this s model which is about
middle of the range but we've got a
couple of options that are going to be
we're considering the first is going to
be that you connect navigation system
which is good for getting you from point
A to point B but we're pretty sure is
going to be improved next year so if
that's what you're looking for maybe
hold off for a little bit we've also got
a safety tech package that's looking a
little bit spark store car of this model
year add a couple extra odds and ends
and we're looking at an as-tested price
of forty thousand eight hundred and
seventy bucks
