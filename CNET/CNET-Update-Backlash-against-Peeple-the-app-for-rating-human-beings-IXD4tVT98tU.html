couldn't get any worse there's now an
app where people can rate you as a
person I'm Bridget Carey this is your
CNET update we use five-star ratings for
many things like restaurants and movies
but now there's a site where people can
post a rating and review about you as a
human being and there's nothing you can
do to take it down this frightening app
is real it's called people spelled with
two E's
some say it's Yelp for people anyone can
make a profile of you and write up a
review of what they think of you and you
get ranked from 1 to 5 stars based on
how good you are personally
professionally and romantically so if
you have a crazy ex that wants revenge
they can theoretically give you one star
tell the world you're a bad person and
it'll be stuck there for anyone to see
that's a nightmare that could hurt your
chances of getting a job the people app
is not live yet it's in beta testing
with plans to go live in November but
it's already stirring up anger as people
flood the company's social media
accounts with negative comments
questioning the legality of this and the
lack of privacy I reached out to the two
female founders of this app for comment
but they have yet to get back to me they
do have a YouTube channel where they
documented the creation of their app and
they stressed that they're making this
to better the world and that it's a
positive place for sharing what others
like about you here's how one founder
explains it to someone she's talking to
on the phone
we want to clarify that this isn't this
isn't like a judging website we don't
want to we don't want to judge and that
in the sense of being mean or you know
we want to actually like bring the
better out people they will not allow
profanity hate speech bullying talk
about your health or disabilities but
you'll have to report it to get it taken
down it's hard enough for Facebook and
Twitter to combat online abuse to make a
post about someone you have to connect
with your Facebook account but not
everyone puts the real name on Facebook
if someone wants to make a comment about
you the person has to give the site your
phone number so you can get notified by
a text message there are legal questions
about getting unsolicited text messages
from apps and you know there will be
issues around defamation of character
and libel you can't delete ratings but
the best you can do is to fend yourself
by writing on your own profile even if
the founders have good
intentions this concept could be
emotionally damaging to anyone that
doesn't have a perfect rating making
mistakes is part of being human we
experience regrettable moments but we're
also designed to move on to heal from
those bad moments but with this app
there's no healing it's there for anyone
to see although it promises four
negative reviews to disappear after a
year if this doesn't give you enough
reason to run away from social media
forever then you may be interested in
some changes coming out to Facebook the
site is starting to test a new feature
that lets some people put a short
looping video clip as a profile photo
and you can also create temporary
profile photos that only last for a set
time and add a description to the top of
your page that's it for this tech news
update for Moorehead to see Netcom from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
