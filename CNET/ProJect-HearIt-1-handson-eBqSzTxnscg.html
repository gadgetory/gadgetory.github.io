cnet.com and I am here with the project
here at one headphones this is a debut
headphone from a company that makes
affordable and very good turntables so
we had high expectations for these
headphones they retail for around a
hundred and thirty dollars now the only
problem is that they have this similar
design to a couple of other headphones
that retail for less there's an incipio
model for instance that can be had for
less than thirty five dollars these are
a little bit better built in those they
do have a little bit of aluminum on the
outside and they have a little bit
swankier feel to them but they're based
on a very similar design now I don't
know what's inside the driver's what the
components are so it's very hard to tell
whether the exact same components they
do sound very decent they just don't
necessarily have the build quality and
the sound quality of a headphone that
would cost $130 I did like them and so
did Steve Guttenberg who reviewed them
they sound very smooth and clear they're
also well balanced have decent bass
response not as good as something like
the ath m50 from Audio Technica
that's a little bit pricier headphone a
little more full sized so they're a
decent sounding headphone not fantastic
so the real question here is the value
equation if these were priced at closer
to $75 we could certainly recommend them
but they're harder to recommend at $130
particularly since they don't have any
sort of inline remote with microphone
and the cord is attached on this so
there you have it the project here at
one headphone a decent headphone just
not the greatest value I'm David Carr no
way thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
