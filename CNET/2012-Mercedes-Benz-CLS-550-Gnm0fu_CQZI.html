their four-door coupe it remains a
statement car this is also somewhat
practical let's drive the 2012 CLS 550
and check the tech
let's put the cls550 in its place within
the Mercedes model range it's a
four-door coupe of biggish executive
kind of presence
it's very eClass in its presentation in
person it's nowhere near s-class in size
or pomposity now don't confuse this
eClass based CLS with the s-class base
CL which is a true coupe it's got two
doors if you can't count doors very well
then just count the dollars forty-three
thousand of them separate the two models
now a CLS is kind of a high tone thing
so a lot of tech comes in it base for
example this navigation system is
standard on this car I would hope so at
this price level however it's not that
big a screen in Mercedes fashion it's
not touchscreen obviously they use their
command controller which is down here
with a back a clear and then a
multi-function knob to do things if you
want to enter an address it's pretty
straightforward although they've got
this multi ribbon thing that I've never
gotten totally in love with top ribbon
middle ribbon bottom ribbon so let's try
the voice controls enter destination
pre-selected state is California do you
want to enter town first or street first
town please say uh California town name
two things I want you to notice from
that short little sample one you don't
get these annoying little beeps you have
to wait for secondly notice that I
didn't have to say exactly what the
command was on the screen where the
system falls down though is dealing with
voice and the phone system on certain
things like when you're trying to call
up someone on the phone book call name
please say the name
Mitchell Chang think Jim excepted mobile
dialing who the hell think Jim Oh it's
Jim think you know Mitch Chang Jim Fink
so that didn't even come close here's
your other option redoubt phonebook
please say the name from which reading
out should begin
Mitchell Chang homestead rich who
homestead Tina
you see what it's doing there it's
reading
the directories from the name that I
gave it two problems one it got the name
completely wrong - I can't tell what
it's reading me first last last first
and if there's only one or the other I
don't know where it is in the sequence
am/fm HD radio satellite radio bluetooth
streaming with good metadata a six disc
slot with movie playback and 10
gigabytes of hard drive space all are
standard in the entertainment rig and
it's one choice only ipod connection
however is optional all of it blares out
of a one choice Harman Kardon system
with 14 speakers and over 600 watts now
in the dash you can see a whole lot of
things that are part of the optional
driving technology on this car let's
take a look here's my distance readout
for my pre-safe braking it's showing me
where the car is spotting vehicles in
front of me Blind Spot Assist on or off
it uses indicators in the mirrors that
as you see are way far out on the glass
we get on the road I'll tell you what I
think of those and here's your lane keep
assistance training that on or off it's
a stick shaker in case you're drifting
across a lane and don't have the
corresponding signal on now I'm a big
fan of things that are built into a well
designed in - interface but some things
shouldn't be there like seat adjustments
and Mercedes made you do that for the
longest time now they're down here in my
sensible set of switches alongside the
seat bolster up here in the engine room
you've got a big part of the CLS story a
550 as it says on the butt of this thing
tells you it's five and a half liters
right but no mercedes give up on that
simple nomenclature years ago now it
doesn't mean anything this is a 4.6
liter twin-turbo v8 you can tell by the
plumbing up here right away we've got
two turbos you can spot those down here
and one over there that gives this car
402 horsepower and again because it's
blown it gets 443 foot-pounds of torque
gets this 4200 pound beast up to 60 in
just a tick over five seconds and
delivers 1624 mpg which is not only
pretty good for a big fast car but quite
a bit better than the last edition of
this big fast car
this car is powerful it's not responsive
tons of horsepower lots of torque but
the throttle on this car is basically a
light switch on or off you cannot make
any decent maneuvers in traffic without
this you're going back and forth all the
time because the power comes out like
that and then it goes away like that
it's a very hard car to drive smoothly
which should not be the case for $70,000
on top of that you've got heavily
assisted steering it's finger light and
highly assisted brakes the three
different drive modes here on the
console if you go to sport mode that
puts you in a really sporty mode it's
almost impossible then not to snap your
neck back and forth as the power comes
on and goes away and the end mode of
course drops you right to manual which I
found was good I like using the manual
shift on this automatic because this guy
hunts seventh gear like a hound dog but
unfortunately it's constantly driving to
get into seventh gear which on this car
in many situations is like a thousand
rpm let's say the late departure
technology is pretty good as you
approach the center line you get the
stick shake on the wheel like you're
supposed to and it keeps doing it
halfway into the next lane so hopefully
that'll get your attention at some point
if not you may have died behind the
wheel who knows as for the blind spot
tech it works great you know it's well
calibrated but I find the indicators are
too far out in the mirror if they were
here in the post like a lot of other
cars who shall go unnamed they get my
attention a lot more rapidly in some it
accomplishes what a big dollar Mercedes
is supposed to do a big quiet huge power
ride that has a presence but this is not
the kind of car you get a grin from
driving you get a grin from me singing
it
now when you're done driving a car was
so little Road feel you may as well have
it park itself the automatic parking is
excellent you approach a spot with your
signal on put the car in reverse when
the blue parking icon points at the spot
work the pedals gradually while the car
does the backing in and steering then
pop it in drive and let the car nibble
that last bit to straighten itself out
tidy
okay let's price this 2012 CLS 550 at 72
to base lots of tech is in there you're
going to get the navigation Harman
Kardon audio most of the interesting
digital inputs but you got to add a few
things there's a premium one package for
forty four hundred bucks and that guy
brings you iPod and aux rear-view camera
which ought to be stuck adaptive all LED
front lights keyless go bunch of other
niceties a chunky package but lots in
there for twenty nine hundred you can
get the driver assistance that's the
adaptive cruise the automatic braking
the blind spot stuff and the Lane
Departure warnings and the last thing
you want to think about is the parking
technology front and rear sensors and
the parking assist logic that's a little
under a grand but if you need it you
know who you are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
