Classic and what do you think should we
go to Mars well hey what's going on
everyone welcome to new sorry
the Cena debate show where I Jeff
Bakalar argue with my friends and
colleagues over three rounds of dead
serious debate today on the show I'll be
battling mr. Roger Chang hello CNET news
executive editor so if you don't like
the news it's his fault really is sorry
so here's how the game works Roger and I
will be debating over three rounds
whoever makes the best case will get
most of the five points that are up for
grabs assigning those points is mr. Ben
Fox Ruben nope sorry alumni how are you
sir doing great I just realized Roger is
your boss so I screwed up in terms of
conflict of interest that's my bed
alright we flipped the coin before the
show to see who would go first
Roger won that flip good flipping Ben
what is our first topic please okay
round 1 following nintendo's successful
NES classic and SNES classic Sony
created a mini console of its own
now that the reviews are out what's your
verdict on the PlayStation classic 90
seconds on the clock starts now
alright so Nintendo did a wonderful job
of tapping or nostalgia with the NES
classic and SNES classic the playstation
classic does feel like an awesome ran
the graphics on it look really dated
these remember these is sort of the
first time we got 3d graphics and there
are a lot more akin to the kind of
console games that we play now except
they'd look terrible
whereas those Nintendo games were
beloved their 2d they were
side-scrolling and they kind of hit a
time when retro graphics we're a popular
place the PlayStation game just they're
just not that great and the biggest game
there Final Fantasy 7 is getting its own
HD remake in modern consoles don't
forget know yourselves doing the same
thing
ok you're not wrong look I reviewed the
thing and if you read it you would see
that no I didn't think it was that great
of a thing but at the end of the day I
do think retro consoles are in poor
I think there's a lot of people who
maybe were not old enough to play games
in the mid 90s who can see this thing
and appreciate just how painfully ugly
those games were so I think there's some
sort of archival you know legacy thing
that that needs to be appreciated there
you know and I think there's something
important about preserving games we
don't talk about archiving games that
much like think about games that just
get lost by the wayside like this is an
important step to keep generations of
games alive where they probably won't be
preserved I'll say this that were troops
of the fact that about the library is
totally limited and all right ran out of
time is okay but whatever it's a limited
library the games are not the best on
that Ben what do you think about round
one you're still writing notes this
one's pretty close this one's pretty
close but I'm gonna go three for Roger
to for Jeff and not because Roger is my
boss and therefore very smart and
wonderful Oh Jeff I liked what you were
saying specifically about preserving
games but I think Roger had a couple
more points about it being an also-ran
too similar to what the current games
are but that's fair crummy graphic so
nice job on this one Roger
yeah those games look like hot garbage
all right round two Ben what do you got
okay
Elon Musk Elon Musk says there's a 70%
chance he'll get to Mars with in his
lifetime and eventually plans to
resettle there okay we'll see if that
happens do you think we even need to go
to Mars
90 seconds starts now okay
no we don't need to go to Mars we've got
enough problems on earth that we need to
solve first why do we have to go to Mars
and create new Mars problems I think we
need to worry about Earth problems first
and then we can go to more you think
bars wants us there
you think Mars is like oh this is gonna
be great all these Earthlings coming
over here that's gonna do well for all
the the rocks and dust we got here they
could kiss that goodbye it's never gonna
work out okay you don't want Martian
problems you want earthling problems in
becoming Martian problems so no we do
not need to go to Mars
Earth has enough crap
going on here let's fix earth problems
first I totally hear your point we do
have a bla problems in fact it's a huge
amount problems too many problems
overpopulation totally destroying our
planet environmentally that's why we
need to move Mars this is this is a
screwed-up planet already we've got to
move on to a new place yes sorry we've
got nowhere else plus keep in mind we
are a race of explorers of pioneers we
have nothing at left to explore to
pioneer out here the next frontier has
to be Mars we have to move out there
that's what we need to go you say
explore what you really mean is ruined
escape or escape earth I don't know I
just don't think the answer to all of
Earth's problems is abandoning keep in
mind the earth can only sustain a
population of about 10 billion we're
already at 7.7 billion right now okay
well then maybe we do need to go to Mars
Ben what do you think do we really need
to go to Mars this shows that this is a
pretty good round you guys were both
very enthusiastic proponents of either
of your side this time I'm gonna have to
hand it to Geoff three to two because
you made such a strong argument about
your earth first agenda so but I say
earth first right okay thanks I
appreciate that Ben all right the score
5-5 we're in a dead heat round three is
gonna decide who takes this one are you
sweating I am you can't see it but I am
alright round three okay this one comes
from YouTube viewer Rafael Martinez jeff
is a very loud critic of the beach but a
proud child of the Atlantic coast
Roger hails from sunny California which
I hear is very nice so which one is
better it's kind of weird one the
Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean
ninety seconds starts now
alright clearly the Pacific Ocean is
much better it is the largest of all the
oceans thus bigger is always better here
keep in mind that it is the biggest
ecosystem in the world the ecological
ecosystem there that the kind of the
life in the sea that could be its own
wonder of the world you mind the Great
Barrier Reef throw there
just forget but I know you hate beaches
but keep in mind beaches on the west
coast are free you got to pay for
beaches on the East Coast that's crap
you don't pay for beaches they're free
it's a natural resource we should be
able to walk on the beach
okay here's why the Pacific Ocean sucks
okay have you heard of a little thing
called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch
are you proud of that a freakin garbage
pile in the Pacific Ocean twice the size
of Texas yeah you're right Roger there's
all different kinds of new animals in
the Pacific Ocean like turtle plastic
spiders and all this other crap we throw
in the goddamn ocean it is insane to say
that that is the better ocean everyone
knows the Atlantic Ocean is home a
better boardwalk Pacific Ocean boardwalk
technology has not caught up with
Atlantic Ocean boardwalk technology and
you want to know why I know that you
know but the Atlantic Ocean is better
Roger Trang because you left the Pacific
Ocean to come to be fair I like it lanta
west west coast to the east coast
oceans are not part of that I'm pretty
sure they're part of it I'm pretty sure
you told me you're never going back
that's not even true that is not
remotely that's a lot it's what I heard
Ben Fox Ruben reporter extraordinaire
who won the round and the game oh my god
Wow with that bombshell against Roger at
the very end they're not personally not
a ghost ocean I never said I would not
go back oh okay well here we are from
the perspective of a ridiculous debate
show though it was it was a really nice
twist at the end so I'm gonna have to
award this man Jeff three points to two
very nice job and I think that means
Jeff may have won the game Roger this
was a damn pleasure please come back
eight to seven I mean it doesn't get
closer than got your victory off of lies
so that's that's cool whatever
hey I mean you're a news guy to tell me
that I'm lying that's that's kind of an
insult but nevertheless
he'll be back for round two of our show
what did I win oh really
I want a hype button that's nonsense
yeah here get out of here with this
thing I don't want it alright that's
gonna do it for nope sorry thank you so
much to roger chang thank you so much to
Ben Fox Ruben this has been a damn
pleasure you too
really appreciate you spending time with
me if you don't want to suggest the
topic for next week's show please do so
