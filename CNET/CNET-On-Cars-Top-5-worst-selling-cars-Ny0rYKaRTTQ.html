worst cars a hundred ways but I've
chosen five cars that bombed largely
because of their tech or engineering
innovations
I'm Brian Cooley with the top five worst
selling cars that tried too hard deliver
something we probably didn't want and
they really couldn't do number five the
Plymouth Prowler 8200 total sales the
Prowler was advanced for its heavy use
of bonded aluminum construction but they
wasted that tech on those absurdly over
posturing outboard wheels with pontoon
fenders
that's an Indy car q guys you should
back that up with more than a v6 on a
four-speed automatic number for the
Pontiac Aztek I know predictable 5020
sold I hate to pile on but the Aztek was
a mess it's high-tech look of
conflicting body panels and glass panels
and weird angles was awful and one of
the first cars developed primarily on a
computer maybe if they had done more
physical mock-ups they would have come
in the office one day and seen this
thing in gun gas and killed it being
number four on my list about the kindest
comment it ever earned number three the
Studebaker Avanti 4,600 sold it pains me
to put the Avanti on here but it was a
dud the Raymond Loewy team designed a
hot looker with rare front discs and an
optional supercharger all good tech but
the complexity of the fiberglass body
eluded studi production delays led to
canceled orders led to the cancelling of
the company number two the Lincoln
Blackwood 3300 sold this ghetto-fabulous
take on the f-150 turns the bed into a
carpeted power linen trunk that yet
couldn't really access basically it
neutered a perfectly good pickup offered
it to you in only one color and charge
you 50 grand for the honor
Chevy's Avalanche sold circles around
that by being oddly innovative in a more
useful way the number one dud seller
with wacky tech was the Studebaker wagon
air 940 sold it's a collectible these
days this oddball was a wagon with a
roof
retracted from the rear to the front
leaving you with kind of a Ranchero but
with high sides what do you carry in
there and how do you load it without
making your chiropractor rich add in the
fact that that complicated roof leak
like a rain forest and this was a piece
of engineering before its time I'm not
sure a car maker could pull it off today
for all the latest on cars and they're
hopefully successful tech innovations
