welcome to the Apple buy you know the
drill for everything good and bad inside
the world of Apple and the big news the
air pods made it like they really really
made it Apple made the air pods
available for sale this week for 159 in
the US with an initial shipping date of
December the 19th in the UK and the 21st
in the US but that changed quickly and
now the u.s. shipping date is at six
weeks see I've told you already I'm a
fan of the tech inside and you know what
look who happened to get a pair of these
early this guy you know what give me a
second here oh well I make this look
good come on it's all about owning it
it's all about the person Buddha dude
she'd be confident and other people will
think we look good because I know I do
when is in his ears
all right the iOS standpoint to update
officially rolled out this week with
everything we've talked about from new
emojis like the taco the burrito plus
the return of my go to peach bootie new
wallpapers that really aren't that great
a new headphone icon when bluetooth
headphones are connected and the new TV
app and I waited a few days before I
updated it and guess what it's clear for
iPhone users to jump on but with all
these OS updates and iOS devices you
know it wouldn't go perfectly without a
hitch this time it's the Apple watch OS
three point one point one update that
ended up breaking some Series two
watches that would display an
exclamation mark making them completely
useless people affected will now have to
send their device back to Apple to be
replaced because retail locations can't
fix the problem in store C Apple doesn't
cover restoring the Apple watch through
its diagnostic port Wow guess what that
is a bad apple now Apple has rolled back
the update until the issue is resolved
all right we've heard more than enough
about the next iPhone but a recent
announcement by manufacturer synaptics
gives us a sneak peek of what we can
expect from there under glass optical
fingerprint sensor called the
natural ID FS 9100 it's capable of
scanning a fingerprint through one
millimeter of glass and the sensors
eliminate the need for cutouts on the
display of the device plus because
they're under glass they're scratch
proof waterproof and respond well to wet
fingers yes it actually sounds worse
reading that out loud
synaptics will begin production in the
second quarter of next year and has
supplied apple with LCD display drivers
in the past Apple most likely has their
own solution but I just wanted to
showcase the tech a little more on this
show okay let's jump back to that TV app
specifically on the Apple TV that comes
with the TV os 10.1 recent update Apple
is making the TV app really the
centerpiece experience now you also get
single sign-on with your cable operator
so all the TV apps work seamlessly but
that's if your provider has made a deal
with Apple and there aren't that many
like the big boys
there's no Xfinity no Time Warner or
Verizon files so if you're someone like
me who has Xfinity you'll have to sign
into each app individually but some of
the standalone channel apps like food
and Albuquerque Comedy Central don't
have support so it's going to be a
crapshoot and that's frustrating if it
works with the apps and networks you
watch or subscribe to the TV app is
convenient if it does but again it's
also missing Netflix and Amazon Prime
now ultimately it feels like a
fragmented attempt that could have
worked with every cable provider and
every network and every service like
Netflix and Amazon gave up their user
data to be a part of it but you know
what they don't and it's not going to
change anytime soon ultimately it
emphasizes the real miss by Apple here
not being able to lock down a streaming
TV service deal of their own and I'm not
completely pooping on this maybe they
can get all those things to fall into
place in the future but for now it's a
nice aggregator if the TV shows and
movies you watch and their networks are
all available for you now in other Apple
TV news amazon has released their new
shopping app for TV OS it's a nice
addition that's available on 4 gen Apple
TVs but it's not the Amazon app everyone
really wants we're still patiently
waiting for the Amazon Prime video app
and how many times have you heard
someone say I'd love to have tinder on
my Apple TV all of you right
no nobody has ever said that okay well
if you
want it the team at tinder has now made
its dating app available on the fourth
gen Apple TV as well
if swiping right and disposing of people
like cards isn't your thing now you can
do it with friends and family while
humiliating complete strangers on a
big-screen TV all together
tinder calls it the biggest thing to hit
family night since Yahtzee you know what
I'm actually going to download this app
right now alright that's going to do it
for this week's show you can email us at
the Apple bite at cnet.com or tweet me
at brian tom thanks so much for watching
we'll catch y'all next time for another
bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
