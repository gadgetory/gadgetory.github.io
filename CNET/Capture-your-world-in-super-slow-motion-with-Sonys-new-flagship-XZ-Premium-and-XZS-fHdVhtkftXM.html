last flagship phone but here we are
again with a new flagship called the
ex-head premium it's here way too soon
but I think the egghead premium is a
great looking phone the metal chassis
has curved glass on the front and back
and the chrome version is so shiny it
doubles up as a mirror to make sure your
hair is totally on point
the camera resolution has dropped to 19
megapixels from 23 on its predecessor
but the pixels themselves are larger
which should help with both low-light
shots and achieving a more even exposure
something that Sony's phones have
struggled with in the past a super slow
motion function has been added to the
video mode too while many phones have
done slow motion for a while the XF
premium can shoot at 960 frames a second
to slow the action down even further if
you already enjoy slow motion videos of
your dog jumping for a treat or your
friends face punting off their
skateboard you'll love the super slo-mo
here the 5.5 inch display has a 4k
resolution and a high dynamic range with
Sony stage is a first on a smart phone
this should help give much richer colors
which I'm looking forward to testing in
the full review the egg said premium is
joined by a slightly less high-end
sibling in the form of the x's ed s it
looks identical to Sony's previous
egghead phone but packs for new camera
tech from the premium sibling including
the cool slow-mo video there's sadly no
word on pricing yet for either phone but
don't expect them to come cheap or find
out more when they go on sale later this
year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
