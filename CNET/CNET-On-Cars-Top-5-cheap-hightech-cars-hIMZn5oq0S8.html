ish or so equipped
CNET style with the smart tech not
stripped and we're gonna rank them by
CNET score here we go
number 5 is the Scion fr-s 25 8c net
style in arguably the coolest car when
you're on a budget the brand-new FRS
comes in all low slung and handles just
like it looks all the modern media
sources are in there and for less than
900 bucks you can option in navigation
on the main screen and get the upgraded
audio as well the downside is all kinds
of guys in their hotted up civics and
Subi's are gonna want to race you and
you don't want to do that unless it's
downhill because this first-year model
is notably tore Calais the smart money
waits for a power bump in the 2014 let's
hope number four the Scion iQ this is
our cheapskate today 17 434 seen that
style I know it looks like one of those
Nike shoes for a baby but it's actually
a cool car as long as you never drive
past a storefront and see a reflection
of yourself in it instead keep your eyes
on the new head unit with integrated
Pandora and the nav and premium audio
cost you a mere 850 bucks and you're
gonna get real-world mpg in the mid 30s
though from an engine that sounds like a
coffee grinder at times
number three Hyundai Veloster the 2012
at 22 to 25 CNET style anytime you can
get a cheap car that has style you're
ahead of the game and the Veloster
definitely has style now I didn't say
taste it has two doors on one side one
door on the other side and looks like a
sow bug from either in the direct
injection engine is cutting-edge though
not really powerful in this application
Hyundai has about the most responsive
touch screen in the business though the
interface can get a little busy and
their 10100 powertrain warranty that is
a huge Benny at this price plus our
Antwon Goodwin proved the Veloster can
double has a decent monitor and speakers
for your Xbox 360
number two the 2012 Ford Focus titanium
25 935 done CNET style the titanium just
makes the cut price-wise partly because
we SPECT the hatch not the sad-looking
but cheaper sedan it has a direct
injection engine that delivers
real-world mpg into the 30s my Ford
touch is one of the most ambitious if
not over ambitious interfaces in any car
it's got a really good voice command and
you can even option self-parking tech
and stay inside our price point I would
recommend you at least consider the
manual gearbox as the dual clutch
automated manual can be a bit of a
carnival ride
okay seen its best rated tech savvy car
when you're on a budget that's the Prius
see the little Prius 22 to atc net style
now once you and your therapist work
through you becoming a Prius driver go
get one of these in the level three trim
that's the point at which Toyota's
industry-leading and tune apps system
gets in there along with GPS navigation
and all the modern media options while
you fiddle with all that you'll be
getting real-world mpg around 50 in a
car that looks way less like you hate
cars than the original Prius nobody else
can touch this package of modern driving
for this price and it's the only car on
today's list that gets a C net editor's
choice
