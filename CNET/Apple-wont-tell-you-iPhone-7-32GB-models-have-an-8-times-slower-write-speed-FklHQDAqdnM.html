the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple let's get
to the show and it's official Apple has
sent out the invites for their next
product announcement on Thursday October
the 27th at Apple's campus in Cupertino
just in time for the holiday season now
we know that new Macs are coming the
invitation has a black background with
some color explosions inside the logo
and the title hello again
and just to drop a little knowledge on
you hello was used by Steve Jobs to
introduce the first Macintosh back in
1984 and hello again was used to
introduce the Bondi blue iMac in 1998
that was s Jays first product
announcement after his return to Apple
now you know so we've talked about some
things that we can expect with the
revamp 13 inch and 15 inch MacBook Pros
a thinner design an all new oled touch
bar and support for USB C and
Thunderbolt 3 reports say Apple will be
ditching traditional USB ports as well
as MagSafe you know just one of their
best power cord innovations ever and
Thunderbolt 2 as well Mac Kotick are
reports that Apple will be getting rid
of the MacBook Air 11 inch discontinuing
it entirely but we'll keep the 13 inch
MacBook Air around plus apple's ultra
thin 12 inch macbook will still remain
in the lineup it's about time we see a
real refresh because the MacBook Pro
line hasn't seen a significant design
change in over four years
that's right cuatro a√±os and I don't
count the retina pros as a significant
design change we've still heard no
details with other Mac's the Mac Pro you
know Apple's trashcan ashtray tissue
dispenser Super Mario pipe inspired
design it hasn't been touched in almost
three years and the Mac Mini has been
over - it's been a year since the last
iMac refresh as well but we'll see if we
see any upgrades for any of these beyond
just the normal speed bump stuff and the
one thing I'm curious about will Apple
use this keynote as another moment to
talk about courage you remember courage
the courage to move on do something new
that betters all of us and our team has
tremendous courage they did it with the
iPhone 7
are they really willing to make us use a
freaking dongle with our laptop now for
no good reason
see that's
not called courage that's called
stupidity but an apple product
announcement is always exciting and this
one is really one of the few ones where
we really don't know too much and you
can watch it all with our CNET live
coverage starting at 9:00 a.m. Pacific
time before the keynote starts at 10:00
right here on CNET but we still don't
have a date for those Apple earpods and
I know there are a lot of you that
really want them some of you don't so we
should find out about them by the 27th
as well now the iPhone 7 plus is jet
black has recently become widely
available in US Apple stores but
inventory drops pretty fast bottom line
you have a better chance to get one now
even if it's a scratch magnet that even
Apple recommends you get a case for it
but that's not as bad compared to this a
handful of people using skins to protect
their jet black iPhones for low profile
protection have found that the text
printed on the back of the device ends
up transferring on to the skin when it's
removed from the device say what yeah
the vine print doesn't completely come
up but it does become faded and you can
see here clearly it transfers over so
jet black owners don't use skins for
protection on your iPhone 7 yeah you
know what that's a bad apple but iPhone
7 owners buckle up for this one GSM
Arina reported a couple weeks ago that
the 32 gig iPhone 7 and 7 plus models
had slower storage performance compared
to the 128 and 256 gig models now that's
been confirmed after unbox therapy put
it to the test and found that they had
close enough read speeds with a 32 gig
model reading at 686 megabytes per
second and the 256 gig model reading at
856 megabytes per second but then when
it comes to write speed it's not even
close 256 gig iPhone 7 wrote at 341
megabytes per second and the 32 gig
model wrote at forty two megabytes
nearly eight times slower now in a more
appropriate real-world test a four gig
movie file was transferred to both
phones the 256 gig iPhone 7 model wrote
the movie in 2 minutes and 34 seconds
while the 32 gig model took 3 minutes
and 40 seconds see larger solid-state
drives typically perform faster than
smaller ones we know this but it's a
significant difference that was
never brought up by Apple who always
loved to chat about their speed metrics
and for all y'all who aren't happy about
this
on behalf of you we're throwing out
another bad apple
yeah that's bad I'll write an Apple
watch news a quiet update to Apple site
confirms that the Apple watch Nike Plus
Edition will launch a day after the new
Macs keynote on Friday October the 28th
it brings a standard aluminum casing its
own unique perforated watch bands and
specific watch faces and complications
that you really can't get on any other
model
they start at 369 for the 38 millimeter
and 399 for the 42 millimeter versions
and if you were hoping that Apple could
deliver your car for the future in 2020
we've talked about this think again the
team internally known as project Titan
has refocus on developing an autonomous
driving system that gives Apple the
ability to partner with existing car
makers or incorporate it if they decide
to design a car of their own that's
right
bloomberg reports Apple has
significantly scaled back its Apple car
ambitions that has led to hundreds of
people from their team of about 1,000 to
be reassigned let go or they have left
on their own now reports say leadership
has constantly changed the team has been
in flux there's never been a clear
direction Apple is given the car team a
deadline of 2017 to prove the
feasibility of this self-driving system
and then to decide on a final direction
I'm sorry but Apple this looks like a
lot more than a bump in the road
all right let's announce our winners for
the connects go power watch portable
battery where we had over 1500 responses
the correct answer for what I call two
ipads joined together was the maxi pad
it was really weird because all week
I just got messages and people sending
me pictures of like feminine hygiene
products and I wasn't sure why so
congrats go to Misha write on email I
got to show love for the ladies here and
at Sean Patrick are on Twitter we put
nostra Tongass on a magic carpet and I'm
sure he appreciates that all right
that's going to do it for this week's
show you can email us at the Apple byte
at Cena comm or to me at Brian Tong
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
y'all next time for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
