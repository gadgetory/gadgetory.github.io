I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update it has been reported that
American and British government's hacked
into the computers of a sim card
supplier to steal encryption keys to
billions of SIM cards essentially living
these government's spy on phone
conversations and data transfers at will
without a warrant gemalto the company
that supplies those sim cards
investigated the hacking claims and says
there was no major theft of its
encryption keys and customer data
however it admitted that it was the
victim of a sophisticated hack in 2010
and 2011 and that was likely carried out
by the National Security Agency and UK
spy agency GCHQ gemalto said that in
that hack it's possible some encryption
keys for older 2g networks were
compromised this accusation all started
from documents leaked by former NSA
contractor Edward Snowden reports say
the NSA worked with the GCHQ to hack
gemalto which provides mobile sim cards
to major telecom companies around the
world like vodafone verizon and china
mobile the NSA and gchq have not
commented it's hard not to be left
wondering who to believe or even what
companies you can trust with security
there are smartphone apps that can give
you an extra layer of encryption if
you're concerned about eavesdropping to
make an encrypted phone call use signal
on iOS and the app red phone on Android
both are created by the company whisper
systems also silent circle makes another
suite of encryption apps if the world of
cyber espionage hasn't completely turned
you away from using smart phones all
together well maybe you'll be interested
in a brand new cheap smartphone from
Motorola the updated moto e is only a
hundred and fifty dollars that's without
a contract full price it's smaller than
today's monster phones but you can
customize it with color bands that you
snap around the edge it comes with the
latest version of google's operating
system android lollipop and it runs on
4g LTE networks it's also on sale in the
UK and it's going to be coming to more
than 50 countries if you want a
smartphone with more old-school style
verizon is selling the blackberry

fifty-dollar rebate so you basically get
it for 50 bucks it hits verizon's
