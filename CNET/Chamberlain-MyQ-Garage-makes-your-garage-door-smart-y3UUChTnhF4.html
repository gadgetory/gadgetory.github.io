going to look at the Chamberlin my cue
garage door opener this is $130 smart
home product and this basic function is
pretty simple you connected to your
garage door opener and then through an
app on your iPhone or Android device you
can use it to remotely control the
garage door from pretty much wherever
you are
it also lets to see the status of the
garage door and a containing
notifications so if it's open when you
don't want it to be your phone will tell
you and you can close it pretty quickly
with the app so you mount a Wi-Fi hub
for the mic you hear in the ceiling and
the idea is that it flashes a signal to
your existing garage door opener and
then that tells the garage door to open
and close there's a sensor on the door
that helps detect whether the garage
door is open or shut and that sends a
signal to the Wi-Fi hub which then tells
your phone hey your garage is open your
garage door shut gives it kind of that
status update now you do need to plug it
into a power outlet so you have to have
one nearby probably will if you already
have a electronic garage door opener
it's also designed to work with pretty
much any garage door opener on the
market chamberlain says it works with
about 90 percent of existing models
anyone from about 1986 on I think is the
date they say is pretty much going to
work you do need to be comfortable
popping off the top of the garage door
opener and finding the program button
inside that will send the signal to the
mic you opener to have it programmed for
the right sensor setting to open and
close the door so installation is pretty
simple there's a bracket here that you
have to screw into your ceiling it comes
with a couple of drywall anchors if you
need those here I just went right up
into the woods and there's no drywall
and then the hub itself slides right on
as for the sensor on the front of the
door you can use screws but it also
comes with some adhesive strips and
that's what I used here that in order to
control my cue from your phone you do
need a Wi-Fi signal out to your garage
now I do have a pretty weak Wi-Fi signal
coming out here but it still works
there's only one bar it shows up on the
app but it's good enough I've had no
problems with connectivity now there are
a few other smart garage door openers
out there and some you have to wire
directly to your existing opener that's
not really ideal for obvious reasons
wireless solution is a lot more
convenient it also will tell you through
a series of beeps and light flashes when
you close the door you have about a 30
second delay once you press the close
button the mic you
and from when the door itself actually
shuts so the mycube garage door opener
is a pretty simple product and that's
sort of nice it kind of does what it
says is going to do you don't have to
worry about much else with it so it's
nice about the my cue is that it's kind
of evidence that the smart home
ecosystem isn't going to be the series
of walled off little gardens it's a part
of the nest Developer Program so it can
work with your nest thermostat and other
devices in that ecosystem it was named
as one of the first partners for apple's
homekit program which is going to link
various devices into iOS and just this
past week they also announced support
for the new wink hub which is part of
quirky smart home spin-off design
exclusively to make smart home products
so it works pretty well it's relatively
affordable and my cue is poised to work
with all kinds of other smart home
devices if you want to go down that road
that makes it kind of an easy
