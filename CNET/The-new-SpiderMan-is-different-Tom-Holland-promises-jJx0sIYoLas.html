know me as spider-man but I'm also just
a kid from London who really loves doing
what he does as much as spider-man is a
character that is loved by a huge range
of people I think the real target
audience is people sort of below younger
than 16 and it's because he's going
through what they're going through you
know like struggling with puberty and
talking to girls this game new top know
you seen that before she probably
stopped staring with Laurie it's creepy
though my big thing about this movie is
making sure the audience get to see what
would happen if a 15 year old was given
superpowers and also not being the cool
kid you know I often find that
superheroes I like the bachelors or the
billionaires and they everyone loves
them Peter Parker is basically the
complete opposite Peter you're still
with us
uh yeah yeah whenever I hit someone it's
always by accident so I'm always sort of
like I'm sorry oh my god my bad if
someone can lift the truck right and
then punch someone in the face you'd
probably kill them so it never really
made sense to like lift up a truck and
then punch someone shut gasps so we just
tried to bring this sort of youthful
vibe into the fight scenes ah it does
get really dark and really badass at one
point when the stakes are really high
but you do see him have fun with his
powers and really enjoy being spider-man
what's up guys
you know I'd never done a movie before
there's nearly like eight years ago now
and it was a whole new world for me to
explore plus your name Lucas pellet you
know I was following Amy what's around
and she really guided me through the
process and for me it was one of the
most advanced learning experiences of my
whole life I had convinced myself I
hadn't got the part
so I scrolling through Instagram and
Marvel posted a photo of spider-man
saying go to our website and find out
who the new spider-man is and you know
when you're you feel like your heart
just sort of stops I'm like oh my god
what am i doing so I open up the
computer it said my name and I went nuts
like crazy so after ten minutes it was
all over the television and trending on
Twitter and all my friends were texting
me like oh my god dude we didn't know
this was happening so yeah it was a
really crazy day when I was a kid I had
probably 20 different spider-man
costumes throughout the years but only
recently about two years ago I went to a
fancy dress party dressed up as
spider-man and then found out once I got
there that it wasn't a fancy dress party
and I was the only one dressed up as
spider-man and everyone thought I looked
like a complete dick but who's laughing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
