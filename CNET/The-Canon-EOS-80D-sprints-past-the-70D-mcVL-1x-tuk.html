canon eos 70d debuted and if you're
ready to upgrade the ATD is a definite
improvement over its predecessor but if
you like your blues blue and your reds
red you'll have to do some tweaking I'm
Laurie grinning and this is the canon
eos a DD a better version of the
company's $1,200 enthusiast action
shooting DSLR it's got much better live
view performance while not as fast as
mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera
it's finally usable for subjects and not
so fast motion the camera has a new
twenty four point two megapixel dual
CMOS sensor that has a faster on chip
autofocus system and delivers better
accuracy during continuous shooting
there's also a new fine detail picture
style that makes a huge difference in
photo quality the defaults just aren't
very good but the fine detail settings
bring the sharpness of the photos into
line with competitors the one non
traditional DSLR capability is HDR movie
which like on Panasonic's cameras
combines multiple exposures for each
frame for better dynamic range and it
does seem to bring out more shadow
detail however it's only available while
shooting in an automatic mode canons
basic zone and at a lower quality
compression rate if you're into filters
there aren't that many and they're not
as flexible as on mirrorless models and
some just produce terrible results plus
if you want in body image stabilization
for greater flexibility and lens choices
or just want sharper 4k video they're
less expensive but still good mirrorless
