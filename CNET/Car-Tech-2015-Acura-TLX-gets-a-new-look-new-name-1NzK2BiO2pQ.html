the TL so all encompassing that acura
felt like it needed an all-new named the
2015 t LX is lighter and shorter from
nose detailed in the previous generation
TL but it has the same wheelbase so
you're not losing any interior space
because it's lighter acura is able to
make do with maybe just a little bit
less power in this generation we're
looking at a 3.5 liter v6 that's gonna
do about 290 horsepower that's gonna
knock off the 3.7 liter from last year
that did 305 so we're again a little bit
less power underneath the 3.5 ii engine
option available is a 2.4 liter inline-4
engine that we've seen under the hood of
the TSX
and the ILX it's gonna do about 206
horsepower now if you get the front
wheel drive version of this car don't
worry the rear wheels will still have
something to do because front drive
versions of this car are equipped with
Acuras precision all-wheel steering
system that's the rear-wheel steering
system that's going to be able to
individually adjust the steering of the
rear wheels to keep the rear end of the
vehicle active when you're cornering or
changing lanes it's gonna enhance
stability and dynamics if you get the v6
you have a choice between front-wheel
drive with the precision all-wheel
steering or Acura super handling
all-wheel drive system that's been
updated for this generation to have more
torque vectoring across the rear axle
the result is a much Sport of your
vehicle that's got a sport of your
suspension and better brakes that have
been augmented to keep up with it inside
we've got Acura sort of to screen
infotainment system that we didn't
really like when we tested in previous
Acura models but this one's gonna be
equipped with the Acura link connected
system so you're gonna be able to get
things like Pandora internet radio and
AHA connectivity so you can bring your
apps into the dashboard safety check for
this 2015 model is gonna start all the
way at the front end with Acura is all
LED headlights a standard feature that
we first saw on the MDX
it's also got a full suite of passive
and active driver aid technology
including things like for collision
warning and active brake mitigation
things like lane departure warning and
lane keep assist so we've got all the
bases covered there as far as safety
check
20:15 TLX is going to be replacing the
old TL later on this year I've been
