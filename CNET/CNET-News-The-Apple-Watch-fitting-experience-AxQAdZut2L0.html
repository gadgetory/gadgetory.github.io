here in Sydney Australia
I'm Seamus Byrne for seen it and for
those of you out there who might be a
little confused about how you're gonna
buy your Apple watch we're gonna go
through a bidding process and give you
all the details on what you need to do
at your local store to get your hands on
the new Apple watch what we've seen here
in Sydney today so far is no one's had
to queue up to get there or what at the
point you can't queue up when you arrive
if there are appointments available
Apple will give you an appointment or
they will assign an appointment time to
you for later on in the day and say to
come back at that point they have here
in Sydney we've seen about half a dozen
bidding stations
fittings are every 15 minutes and
they've said they've got more fitting
locations on other floors of this store
so there's a lot of capacity for coming
in and going through that Tryon process
you're essentially being asked to make
your reservation and then come in and do
the fitting to decide which size which
Bend and which model you want so you
need to come in and basically have that
booking you can either book online or as
I said some people aren't walking up and
then being assigned appointments for
later on it really does make a huge
difference to try on the Apple watch
before you make your choice
it really does have a very different
weight between the steel band version of
the Apple watch and the Apple sport with
the rubber band
it really feels different on the wrist
and you want to know what that's going
to feel like for you to make that choice
same with 42 mil verses 38 mil in some
ways I found that the 38 mil actually
felt nice with the steel band which was
just an interesting contrast having
mostly thought 42 mil was the right size
for me so there were going to be those
personal differences you will only
understand by trying it on Apple has a
really slick setup here for how they're
doing the try ons they've got the main
fitting stations which have pullout
drawers where they have the full
selection of watches available but they
also have mobile setups with a clever
case that is constantly charging the
watches that are in that case and if it
recharges itself on a MagSafe adapter so
they've really thought about how they
can actually set up these demo stations
easily anywhere in the store for
themselves another thing is that the
demo route on the watch that you get to
try is non interactive so you won't be
able to trade on and expect to be able
to tap and interact it's running it just
a standard loop it's also standard for
right-handed whereas or people who will
wear it on the left I'm a lefty and
trying on on the right now I couldn't
technically try it on in the right
direction just because of how that demo
loop works but you get the feeling and
then you can go over to the other
stations where there are general
hands-on options available that is
interactive you can try out a few of the
different sections it's still on a loop
but within that loop you can actually
interact with things like the photos the
messages things like that I think you
really do need to get into the store and
they've got a smart IDE you will not be
able to pick this up off the shelf to
buy you need to get in a reservation
have this fitting and then you will
understand which watch is going to be
right for you if you want to buy
yourself an Apple watch I'm shameless
burned for CNET from here in Sydney
