reports first the gadget of the week
it's the ultra mobile pc or UMPC all the
buzz coming out of the just-concluded
see bit tech trade show in germany now a
umpc is about half the size of a laptop
about twice the size of a smartphone so
not as useful as the former not as
portable as the latter it typically runs
the compressed version of Windows dubbed
origami on a cpu clocked it around or
below a gigahertz hmm sounds like a fun
way to kill an afternoon doesn't it the
field includes Samsung's q1 ultra the
Asus r2h the oqo model to sony ux series
but isn't it interesting that Apple the
company that has had the most luck
getting into the palm of your hand than
anyone except for Motorola and Nokia
isn't doing one of these now the news
Internet Protocol TV or IPTV made a big
step forward or at least a big step
sideways this week it now has an
official industry forum behind it france
telecom ericsson Sony Panasonic and
several other big names are now the open
IPTV forum which is kind of an odd name
because membership in said for them is
closed but aside from that by September
07 they promised to publish a formal
technical spec for IPTV and that should
help clear the way for deployment to
your home and mine here's my nightmare
scenario though what if Sony ends up
handling open standards all they do is
proprietary and France Telecom ends up
doing drm they want Apple iTunes to be
open and Ericsson which does cell phones
what if they end up with the big screen
details don't laugh it could happen the
Airbus 380 the a380 is that huge new
double-decker jumbo jet and it is in the
buzz report this week because of its
maiden voyages to the US airlines are
all a drool about the 555 passengers
this plane can carry but I go the other
way how few can we put on board leaving
room for the in-flight lounge designers
have already mocked up great designs for
lounges on a380s look at this guy he's
in the bar having a couple
re standing up through the whole flight
and the Air Marshal isn't even thinking
about tasering him I love that and how
about here now he's decided to sit down
before he falls down and he's got a
groovy little workstation to sit at and
dispatch belligerent emails while he
comes down off his liquor hi it's like
never leaving home I love this and
finally if you think you have a deleted
file horror story I can top it there's a
huge database up at the Alaska
Department of Revenue it's used to track
payment of 38 billion dollars in oil
revenues dispersed out to Alaskans in
other words it's a lot of money going to
a lot of people or should I say it was
you see one of their IT guys deleted it
no didn't just delete it formatted the
drive it was on now even that alone
wouldn't cause a seasoned IT pros bowel
to turn to water but this would he also
clobbered the backup drive no problem
restore it from the backup tapes no they
were unreadable it was gone now remember
this is the record of 38 billion dollars
nobody panicked said fun director and
really good liar Amy schoo no they
started typing and typing and typing
reentering 300 file boxes of paper
records one keystroke at a time close to
a hundred people worked overtime and
weekends for six weeks to get it all
back in there and you know there are
more errors than before now will you
please take a look at our editors choice
backup hard drives I'm Brian Cooley this
has been the buzz report thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
