phones Nintendo has been chugging away
at the hardware market for years even
when some people think they should go
the way of Sega a new report from The
Wall Street Journal says Nintendo is
readying The Legend of Zelda for its
phone debut
the report says Nintendo is working with
mobile developer DNA to build this
version of Zelda this is in line with
previous statements by Nintendo's
president who said the two companies
would work together on mobile titles
Nintendo has gone on record saying it
would launch five mobile games by March
2017 only three have been released
within that time table with four titles
disclosed Zelda could be that fifth one
so when would you see a Zelda game hit
your phone the Journal says expect
Animal Crossing to be released first
that game would likely be released in
the second half of 2017 Legend of Zelda
would come after Animal Crossing
however the journal sources said the
timing could be changed
Super Mario run turned a lot of heads
when it was first announced the game is
free to download with several levels
available the full game could be
unlocked for a one-time $10 charge
reports say that as of January 2017
about three percent of Super Mario run
users paid $10 to get full access to the
game a Legend of Zelda mobile game could
be really big for Nintendo if it's
handled right for more information check
