to the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple but maybe
this week gets a lot of bad for
Cupertino after Apple's earnings really
they just aren't good in fact they're
just ugly after they posted their first
year-over-year decline since 2003 now
how long ago was that
that's when Apple finally released
iTunes for the iPod on Windows the first
piece of Apple software ever on Windows
and Steve Jobs joke that he'll finally
froze over
now everything for the big a was down
they posted a fifty point six billion
dollar quarterly revenue with a profit
of ten point five billion a year ago
those numbers were at fifty eight and
thirteen point six billion now iPhone
sales were down ten million units from a
year ago Mac sales were down half a
million units and iPad sales were down
over two point three million units from
a year ago now our predictions show told
you 2016 would be a down year that were
plenty of you that get all upset when I
criticized Apple for their missteps and
lack of innovation but maybe you'll
realize we speak the truth here now no
new products are taking off there's a
lack of innovation and flattening or
declining sales and their flagship
categories all bad apples so what can
Apple do to shake things up at this
point not that much of these iphone 7
pro schematics from Japanese magazine
Mac fan are real the image is believed
to be Apple's rumored flagship iphone 7
pro with a 5.5 inch screen that shows no
sign of a headphone jack anywhere the
schematics show the iphone 7 pro will
have the same thickness as the iPhone 6s
plus at 7.3 millimeters and the same
dimensions there's a spot for the
rumored dual lens camera and a smart
connector on the bottom rear side which
we know can be used for data transfer or
charging so there are still potentially
three different iPhones coming this year
an iPhone 7 iPhone 7 plus and an iphone
7 pro now this helps but there's nothing
radically different here and if you're
waiting for the potential all glass body
iPhone in 2017 or 18 that's a long ways
away so what about the Apple watch maybe
that can change their fortunes
well the Wall Street Journal reports
Apple is working
including cellular connectivity and a
faster processor in the Apple watch to
independence from the phone is nice if
you want it and if you're ok with buying
a separate data plan for it but that's
not compelling enough for me to
immediately go and buy the next-gen one
for keeps
I want Wi-Fi I want FaceTime video that
makes it the only Dick Tracy watch on
the market and I want apps that are
useful until then I'm still passing okay
how about the Apple car project that has
been rumored to be targeting 2020 that's
an eternity in the tech world and will
probably have flying cars by then
kidding but you know hoping Apple
continues to hire automotive industry
execs and reports claim that Apple is
prototyping car parts at its product
realization lab the facility has been
known for prototyping new Macs iOS
devices and other Apple products now the
big a is still having trouble finding a
manufacturing partner to work with after
a handles blot reports Daimler and BMW
have both walked away from talks to help
build the Apple car the report says
talks dissolved after being unable to
determine who would lead the project and
who would own the car data Apple
obviously wants the AI car to be built
into its iCloud platform now Apple is
looking at Canadian Austrian firm Magna
International and surprise Apple making
a car from scratch isn't all that easy
bloomberg reports the FBI has decided to
keep the iPhone hack they used a secret
from Apple the FBI paid 1.3 million
dollars for the method but they claim
they never purchased the rights to the
technical details of the hack and
therefore don't have the necessary
information a review process known as
the vulnerabilities equities process
allows flaws to be submitted and then
it's determined if these security flaws
should be disclosed to the company in
this case Apple in order to fix them but
none of that will happen and finally are
you rich enough for lunch with Tim Cook
for the fourth year in a row
Apple is participating in an auction
through charity buzz for a chance to
have an hour-long lunch
at Apple headquarters with Timmy just
like Apple's earnings the auction is
brought in less money each year bringing
in six hundred ten thousand dollars in
2013 330 K in 2014 200k last year and
right now it's sitting at two hundred
ten thousand and you know what in about
ten years
so I'm guessing Tim Cook will be paying
to have lunch with me
all right that's gonna do it for this
week's show you can email me at the
Apple by-the-sea Netcom or tweet me at
Brian Tong or send your trolling
comments questioning my sexuality on
YouTube thanks so much for watching
we'll catch you all next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
