their connected car tech they better be
at those prices but what about the rest
of us just because we haven't got so
many bucks we can't get distracted are
we stuck with an iPod cable and a CD
changer oh no no I'm Brian Cooley with
my top five cheap connected cars cars
that have connected tech in the dash but
only costs between the mid 14s and
mid-20s cnet style number five the Scion
fr-s this is the priciest car in our
list and actually has fairly limited app
support but far and away it's the most
capable road car so factor that in now
if you get the bespoke head unit upgrade
you can view facebook timelines update
facebook post tweets DM people on
twitter and do other things that will
make it a flat race to see who lives
longer you or your lease yelp is in
there as well and done up seen that
style this guy is only about twenty six
one number for the 2014 Kia Soul the new
one it's the newest car on our list and
one of the very few cars that uses
android to run the in dash head unit
it'll let you split that screen to have
two apps vying for your attention at
once it's also got the android web
browser in there though not while you're
moving all of this will either be hot or
just a hot mess I'm not sure so I'm
going to keep it down here at number
four until the vehicles out and I get my
hands on one I'm ballparking it around
21 grams cnet style number three the
2013 Chevy spark once folks stop
pointing at you you'll get the last
laugh properly configured your little
spark can have Apple Siri integration
that's a first bring go connected
navigation in the dash via a phone app
and tune in support so you can be among
the first generation to have no idea
what a car radio antenna is there's also
support for the OnStar app dermo tlie
find your little car in case someone set
a box in front of it or something about
14 5 seen that style number two the
prius c
little Prius we gave this guy a cnet
editors choice because it is one
all-around fun running fuel-sipping
internet connecting son of a gun and
it's our lists only hybrid now when you
option it with entune you get a handful
of well-known apps all cloud loaded by
Toyota as a batch no fiddling around
loading and tweaking each one just get
in there and use them and it works with
a slew of smartphones about 23 for cnet
style now my number one connected car on
a budget if just on the number of apps
alone is the 2013 ford fiesta now this
car doesn't even offer myford touch it
uses good old-fashioned sink and in the
process rolls up this industry crushing
total of thirty-nine apps and Counting
you see Ford just became the first car
company beating GM by a few hours to
open up its platform to developers so
the Fiesta will remain his connectedness
for a long time a fiesta trimmed up
scene that style with all 39 apps and a
sunroof won't even hit 19 grand now
competition in this category is fierce
with eminent new offerings on the way as
we tape today from Honda Kia Chrysler so
stay on top of cnet's unique car tech
reviews there at cars cnet com I'm Brian
Cooley thanks for watching
