their connected car tech they better be
at those prices but what about the rest
of us just because we haven't got so
many bucks we can't get distracted are
we stuck with an iPod cable and a CD
changer oh no no I'm Brian Cooley with
my top 5 cheap connected cars cars that
have connected tech in the - but only
cost between the mid 40s and mid 20s
CNET style number 5 the Scion fr-s this
is the priciest car in our list and
actually has fairly limited app support
but far and away it's the most capable
Road car so factor that in now if you
get the bespoke head unit upgrade you
can view Facebook timelines update
Facebook post tweets DM people on
Twitter and do other things that'll make
it a flat race to see who lives longer
you or your lease Yelp is in there as
well and done up CNET style this guy is
only about twenty-six one number for the
2014 Kia Soul the new one it's the
newest car in our list and one of the
very few cars that uses Android to run
the in - head unit it'll let you split
that screen to have two apps vying for
your attention at once it's also got the
Android web browser in there though not
while you're moving all of this will
either be hot or just a hot mess I'm not
sure so I'm gonna keep it down here at
number four until the vehicles out and I
get my hands on one
I'm ballparking it around 21 Grand CNET
style number three the 2013 Chevy spark
once folks stop pointing at you you'll
get the last laugh properly configure
your little spark can have Apple Siri
integration that's a first
bring go connected navigation in the
dash via a phone app and tune in support
so you can be among the first generation
to have no idea what a car radio antenna
is there's also support for the on
staraptor remotely find your little car
in case someone set a box in front of it
or something about 14:5 seen that style
number two the prius c
a little Prius we gave this guy a CNET
editor's choice because it is one
all-around fun running fuel sipping
internet-connected son of a gun and it's
our lists only hybrid
now when you option it with in tune you
get a handful of well-known apps all
cloud loaded by Toyota as a batch no
fiddling around loading and tweaking
each one just get in there and use them
and it works with a slew of smartphones
about 23 for CNET style now my number
one connected car on a budget if just on
the number of apps alone is the 2013
Ford Fiesta now this car doesn't even
offer my Ford touch it uses good old
fashioned sync and in the process rolls
up this industry crushing total of 39
apps and Counting
you see Ford just became the first car
company beating GM by a few hours to
open up its platform to developers so
the Fiesta will remain his connectedness
for a long time a Fiesta trimmed up
scene that style with all 39 apps and a
sunroof won't even hit 19 grand now
competition in this category is fierce
with imminent new offerings on the way
as we tape today from Honda Kia Chrysler
so stay on top of CNET's unique car tech
reviews there at cars cnet.com i'm brian
