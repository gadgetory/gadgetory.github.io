is a segment called play this where
gamespot and cnet editors tell you which
games you should be playing so I'm
playing the witcher 3 wild hunt and i
continue to play the witcher 3 wild hunt
tonight i'm going to play some more of
the witcher 3 wild hunt pretty much in
every waking free second i have i'm
trying to play snake bird because it is
wildly entertaining for just a simple
gameplay that is one of my favorite
games last year was Wolfenstein the new
order and now it's got a standalone DLC
bit Wolfenstein the old blood you can
download it for xbox one ps4 or PC so
I'm playing bravely second the game is
about a fantasy world in which you are
rescuing a damsel in distress and
fighting monsters in an attempt to save
the world I'm playing a game called
besieged it is an early access steam
game it's a really unique physics-based
sort of puzzler where you build these
medieval sort of catapults and you just
completely obliterate other fortresses
and holds of soldiers you're a snake
you're a bird you're eating fruit you're
solving puzzles and it is fun and hard
as hell and it's more of the like
awesome fast paced brash gun shooting
fun times of the new order and i'll have
an apostle earth it's only available in
japan right now so you have to import it
or buy it to work here and buy the
accompanying japanese 3ds because v3
ds's region locked so it's a little
tough to get but i would say it's worth
it if you can read japanese it's also
not an english it's a weird pick and
then maybe some witcher 3 wild hunt and
honestly don't even bother checking in
with you next week because I'll probably
be playing their way
3 wild hunt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
