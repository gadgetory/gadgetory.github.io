day browsing the internet on her laptop
at home I do pretty much everything I've
listened to a lot of music I email I
chat with friends I use different social
networks like Facebook and Twitter I am
currently searching for a job so that's
a big resource for me but a new study
from independent security evaluator zuv
baltimore finds that major brands of
home and small business Wi-Fi routers
are easily hackable forcing users like
Shana to take pause it's totally
shocking I feel like I'm protected at my
home using a network that's
password-protected a computer that's
password-protected potentially having my
entire life being looked at and being
active accessible by somebody else is
scary when your router gets hacked are
actually intercepting the signal before
it gets to your computer so they can
then have access to your computer any
kind of financial information that you
send or personal information that you
send can be intercepted at that point
experts say there are a few precautions
users can take to better protect a Wi-Fi
network from hackers you can change your
router password you can look into
changing your router username from admin
to something else you can also look into
changing your router's IP address if you
have passwords make them strong the
study's authors recommend router
manufacturers take on the responsibility
of fixing security issues and alerted
all vendors a spokesperson for belkin a
major router vendor says they are
exploring ways to enhance their security
and for concerned consumers to consult
their website for safety tips in San
