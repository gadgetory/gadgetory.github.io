over a year and now nissan is trying out
as electric drive system in another car
this is the env two hundred this little
electric utility van is based on
nissan's nv200 commercial vehicle now
it's got the exact same drivetrain as
the Nissan Leaf that means an 80
kilowatt electric motor and a 24
kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack
driving the front wheels and it also has
the charge port up front just like the
leaf now the env two hundred has a lot
of utility it's got these large doors in
front which allow easy access and
sliding doors on the side it's also got
a large cargo area and of course these
middle row seats pulled down or you can
take them out entirely to maximize the
cargo space now as the env 200 is a
concept vehicle nissan has put a lot of
high-tech gear in the dashboard we have
this navigation system with stereo it's
a big touchscreen we also have an LCD
instrument cluster that stuff you
probably wouldn't find in a national
commercial vehicle but nissan also says
this could be a family vehicle like a
small camper or something like that in
which case this stuff might make sense
because it's a larger vehicle than the
Nissan Leaf it probably got less range
of a Nissan hasn't said what the range
is now although Nissan is only calling
the env two hundred a concept it is
actually testing the car with the
Japanese Postal Service so it could be
something they're looking to put into
production pretty soon i'm wayne
