tablet that connects with your keyboard
if you have an iPad you can do that too
now it's not going to be exactly the
same Microsoft Surface does have a nice
trackpad and it has a pen that has new
specific commands but the iPad has a
bunch of other solutions keyboard cases
that allow you to type while on the go
and there are three new ones in addition
to all the others out there that are
really nice alternatives each one
offering something a little bit
different Logitech has an ultra thin
keyboard cover for the iPad and the iPad
air that's already been one of my
favorites well now they've got a
revision to that one the new ultra thin
keyboard cover has an adjustable angle
so finally if you're sitting at a table
you can tilt it back more not a huge
amount but it makes a difference and the
attachment on the back is a little weird
and different it's not quite the hinge
but it still allows you to clip it on
like a cover and the keys have been
slightly adjusted there are now a whole
row of specific iOS keys that you can
press that do things like volume or
search or going to a home screen and the
keyboard feels thankfully much the same
as before still a hundred dollars a
Belkin has entered the chase as well
they're already a number of good
keyboard accessories from Belkin but the
code thin type keyboard cover for iPad
air looks to provide a similar idea it's
made out of aluminum so it's got a even
more metallic and sturdy feel in my
opinion than the plastic and metal
Logitech one also a hundred dollars
what's different here well it's got all
metal so it feels a little more rigid
plus there's a riser in the back so it's
a little more elevation it's got the
hinge attachment that snaps right on to
the back of the iPad like the original
Logitech had which I prefer
and the key layout is pretty good
nothing too compressed a lot of specific
iOS keys on top and the keys feel good I
like Logitech's a little bit better one
great feature here this automatically
pairs so when you put this in there's a
little sensor on the bottom and boom it
Auto pairs and you don't have to turn on
a switch like you do on the Logitech
that's a nice feature and then finally
let's say you don't want to spend a
hundred dollars on a keyboard for your
iPad what do you do
you could spend $30 there is the anchor
sir TC 930 ultrathin keyboard accessory
that looks almost exactly like the
Logitech one from a distance it's a
little bit different it has a pop-up
hinge over here that allows you to stand
it up for a little extra support there's
still a magnetic hinge on the back to
allow you to attach it like a cover and
you know you turn on a parrot just like
this for Bluetooth keyboard so you're
really not missing all that much $30 is
a heck of a deal it's really a steal for
an accessory and it works now is it as
fantastic a typing experience as on
Logitech I prefer the logitech typing
experience where I feel like I really
fly when I'm typing but man you're
saving $70 and you want something that
allows you to type once in a while
that's a pretty excellent pick anchor a
newcomer in the space offering something
that completely undercuts the
competition so there you have it three
alternatives each one actually really
good I still like Logitech the most for
the typing Auto pairing is great on the
Belkin and man the price may make the
anchor the Best Newcomer of all of them
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
latest keyboard covers for the iPad air</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
