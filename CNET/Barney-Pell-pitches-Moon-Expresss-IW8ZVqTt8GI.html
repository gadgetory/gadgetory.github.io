chairman and chief technology officer
for moon Express and tell you what we're
doing today tonight we're actually
celebrating as a Sarah our launch party
where we're for the first time opening
up and inviting in press and friends to
come and see what we're up to um what we
are up to is building an autonomous
robotic lunar lander that will leave
Earth launching on a commercial launch
vehicle like the SpaceX Falcon 9 and
then once it's out of Earth orbit our
system will take over I'm cruise to the
moon slow itself down you can see its
own rockets and then lose all of the
speed so that it goes Lance gently
exactly on the moon we're going to land
so including precision of a precision
landing hazard avoidance and all those
other kind of smarts on the system we
have licensed and partnered with NASA so
we have a huge head start in terms of
Technology and that's how we can be a
very small startup company just 13
people now and actually already have our
own space qualify abal lunar lander that
we're developing so what is the business
of going to the moon so we're really in
the early stages of the business that
going to the moon I think that there
will be a lot of the business will be
resource development in the moon we may
think of the moon as a dead dry rock but
actually the moon is very very rich in
resources the moon probably has more
platinum than are in all the mining
reserves of planet earth and that
platinum is generally just on the
surface of the earth because it's been
brought by asteroids hitting the moon
all the time over millions and billions
of years so you can go out harvest that
that platinum and then bring it back the
another part of the business another
resource is water water in addition to
being useful for life support when we're
traveling and living in space is also
the key element of rocket fuel hydrogen
and oxygen form hydrazine the key rocket
fuel we use in space shuttle we now know
that there is more water on the moon
there's enough water on the moon to
power 3 to our us-based shuttle launch
every day for the next three thousand
years okay so this is fast amount of
resources and if you get that you can
bring anything you want back from the
moon
actually for free once the
infrastructure is built or you can bring
that back to low-earth orbit and once
that fuels are the North orbit then it
changes the whole economics of space
development because you can just launch
only the payload you want to low-earth
orbit and then use all the fuel from
there collapse the economics so really
this business starts now with being able
to have a commercial development landing
on the moon and bringing payload for our
customers and ultimately we think that
will lead over the next you know 10 to
20 years to a whole new commercial
development business based around the
myth and so tell us about the vehicle
this is a quarter scale to the version
of your Lander yeah this quarter scale
version of our Lander you can see the
these are the legs okay and it's really
important to have legs so you can
balance and not not fall and tip over
this is showing various instruments I
don't know if this one if you look under
here you can see a tank at the bottom
okay um that is showing the the main
engine for the lander and that's the
thing that is like as its thrusting out
so the system is losing its feet as it
goes down what's not shown on this is a
whole bunch of little thrusters oh I
guess if you come over here this is a
model of 11 such thruster so the system
would actually have a bunch of thrusters
all over it and the thrusters are used
for stabilizing the attitude so the
thing doesn't spin out of control then
you've got various other instruments and
so on one thing we're going to be
showing tonight is that we've built a
little mini telescope that can go and
land on the moon and start taking
pictures of anything once it's there and
that we have actually a customer who
would like to build that telescope in
larger scale and have us deliver it to
the dark side of the moon or the far
side of the moon that's the only place
in the whole universe that doesn't
actually see earth so it doesn't have
any of the radio or light disturbances
that come from</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
