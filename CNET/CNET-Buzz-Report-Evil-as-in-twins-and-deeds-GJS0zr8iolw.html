buzz report and now for the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week is
planners new stereo 3d monitor which is
currently on display at the Society for
information display conference this week
in San Francisco and hey no chuckles
those guys can party anyway this 3d
display combines two high-res LCD
monitors with a mirror in the middle so
that you can view images in stereo if
you're wearing your super dork mm 3d
sunglasses I know we got y'all excited
and I'm sorry Google co-founder Sergey
Brin has admitted this week that Google
compromised its don't be evil principles
by cooperating with China and censoring
websites and search results now we
contacted Yahoo for comment where a
spokesperson said we are continuing with
our current strategy regarding China
Tuesday was primary day in California in
several other states so we thought we'd
take this opportunity to run through
some tech election results first the
operating system results Mac os10 has
been running a strong campaign with a
hip sexy style that really appeals to
the younger vote we expected a good
showing from Microsoft Vista but
unfortunately it missed the filing
deadline completely and despite high
hopes for the third party candidate
Ubuntu we are now prepared to call this
race for the incumbent Windows XP sp2
for more years this week HP recalled
almost 700,000 digital cameras because
of a danger that the batteries could
burst into flame always trying to put
out the competition nikon has announced
the new D 90 water Canon DSLR Alex to
the 22 year old who launched the million
dollar home page last August recently
found himself under attack from hackers
who took down his site with a denial of
service attack and then demanded money
in exchange for leaving the site alone
but that clever Alex he partnered with a
security company and traded protection
for ad space on the hugely popular
website C hackers that's why alex has a
million dollars and you guys are just
nothing you guys are nothing go ahead
and leave our sight alone nothing to see
here move it Allah researchers from
Harvard University are working on a way
to clone humans now I got pretty excited
about this because Sina keeps me really
busy but frankly it's really not all
it's cracked up to be
oh shut up you shut up show's over lady
I'm Molly Wood and this has been the
buzz report thanks for watching I'm
willing women this has been the weather
part thanks for watching
