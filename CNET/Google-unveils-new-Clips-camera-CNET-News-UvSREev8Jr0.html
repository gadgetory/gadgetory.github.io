photos let us step back into a moment
with friends with family some of our
favorites are the candid ones like this
they capture the essence of a moment but
the problem is to get those photos
someone needs to be the photographer on
duty waiting to press the shutter button
at just the right moment and we were
thinking how do you capture those
fleeting spontaneous moments while
letting yourself be part of the moment
so we've been working on that and I'm
really excited to share an entirely new
type of camera that works with your
pixel we call it Google clips and this
first edition is specifically designed
with parents and pet owners in mind so
you'll capture more of those spontaneous
smiles first steps and first tricks now
clips has all the things you would
expect from a great camera a high
performance lens a powerful image sensor
it has a shutter button but that's not
what this camera is all about we
reimagine this camera from the inside
out starting with the software and
applying machine learning to build a
camera that takes photos for you so you
can enjoy the moment and instantly get
shots you couldn't get before thank you
how does all that work it starts with an
AI engine at the core of the camera
let's talk about what that engine does
when you're behind a camera you look for
people you care about you look for
smiles you look for that moment your dog
starts chasing her tail clips does all
of that for you turn it on and it
captures the moment so you can be in the
moment and because the software is at
the core of the camera it's gonna get
smarter over time
we also reimagine what camera Hardware
should do for you clips is tiny it
weighs almost nothing so you can easily
toss it into your pocket
and it's a hands-free camera so you can
get these amazing new perspectives on
your experience and get yourself in the
shot by attaching clips to almost
anything or setting it down now from the
beginning we knew privacy and control
really matter and we've been thoughtful
about this for Clips users their family
and their friends let's start with the
basics it looks like a camera and it has
an indicator light so everyone knows
what the device does next it looks for
stable clear shots of people you know
and you help the camera learn who's
important to you and finally all the
machine learning happens on the device
itself so just like any point-and-shoot
nothing leaves your device until you
decide to save and share it this
approach to designing and engineering
clips required some significant
technical breakthroughs to miniaturize
the type of powerful machine learning
that only a few years ago needed a
supercomputer let's take a look at what
Clips actually captures so here's some
clips I've captured with my family at
home now as you can see it's not just
photos that clips is taking taking
little snippets that capture the whole
moment we call those of course clips you
can save them as a motion photo or
choose any frame to save as a
high-resolution still it's like having
my own photographer shooting and
choosing the best moments for me and I
just have to swipe to save to Google
photos which can automatically make
movies out of your clips in seconds so
that's the new Google clips a new type
of camera that brings together at the
best of Google AI software and hardware
tell people more easily capture genuine
candid moments of family friends and
pets clips will be coming soon and
selling for $249</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
