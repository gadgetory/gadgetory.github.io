world braces itself for another round of
fake products and stupid PR stunts
Amazon's Alexa for pets
t-mobile's connected onesie who lose
eight seconds streaming service but what
about the tech ideas so stupid that they
kind of actually work the products and
services that we thought would totally
fake until they weren't first up has to
be Kubo the headless robotic cat cushion
designed to bring companionship to kind
of odd people but it's not just weird
and wonderful products from Japan when
Google announced Project loon in 2013
everyone thought the search company had
gone a little batty but turns out the
plan to deliver internet access with
giant floating balloons was no joke and
four years later it was connecting
Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria in
fact Google loves launching new services
that look fake after all Gmail was
launched just a few hours before April
first in 2004 when Amazon first launched
its grocery ordering - buttons they
looked like a prank but now you can buy
as much toilet paper as you want without
having to haul it out of a store like
you're preparing for the buck apocalypse
and while duolingo is a Moche language
course was fake it's clean tutorials are
the real deal and then there are the
products that probably just shouldn't be
Pizza Hut has its Pizza ordering shoes
Tostitos has its breathalyzer bag and
Domino's had B Pizza Delivery robot what
about the iPhone connected nose hair
trimmer or Spartans silver lined
underwear because nothing protects your
masculinity from cell phone radiation
and fourth wave feminism like a Faraday
cage around your junk but our absolute
favorites Elon Musk's foreign company
flames are definitely real definitely
flame throwing and definitely a way to
mess up your curtains I'm Claire Riley
and for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
