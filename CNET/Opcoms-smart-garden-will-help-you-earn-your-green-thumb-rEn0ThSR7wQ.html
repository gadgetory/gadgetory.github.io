have a green thumb and needs a lot of
help with gardening we might have found
the solution for you I'm Megan Willerton
and we're here at CES 2016 looking at op
comlinks opcom farm cues these are
stacked smart gardening solutions for
the inside of your house basically an
indoor garden for you to grow vegetables
and fruits and herbs and basically any
sort of organic plant that you desire so
it actually is really really cool
you have LEDs built in that adjust
according to the stage of growth of the
plant that you're growing so if it's a
young seedling it might have more red
LEDs which are designed to be better for
those types of plants as it transitions
into the harvest phase it might move
into the white LEDs which are better as
it's maturing and then ready to eat you
can also track all of these stages on
the related Android and iOS app
basically looking at humidity indoor
temperature and it does automatically
adjust the settings based on the
specific type of claim you have so if
you have Boston lettuce
it'll optimize the settings
automatically for you but also if you
want a more hands-on experience you can
actually manually adjust all that stuff
to within the app this is the premium
unit it's gonna sell for 4000 bucks in
the United States when it starts
shipping in February so hopefully we'll
get hands-on of this at the CNET smart
home
