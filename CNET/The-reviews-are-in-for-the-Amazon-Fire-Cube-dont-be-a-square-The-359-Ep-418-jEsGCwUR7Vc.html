Dan Ackerman so the reviews are in for
the amazon firetv cube the latest gadget
from Amazon designed to control your TV
with your voice we got our hands on it
and the quick rundown is that you know
the good news is you can channel surf
with just your voice the microphone does
a pretty decent job at picking up your
commands even over your loudspeakers the
bad news is if you have devices outside
of the fire TV like if you have a DVR or
a game console or Roku you still can't
really use your voice to control that
Dan you were able to play with the cube
for a little bit what were your
impressions I did play with you
yesterday and you can actually use voice
commands for a bunch of different things
outside of the fire cube itself but not
as extensively as you would with
something like a harmony which is really
the gold standard of universal remote
type devices I did like that the voice
commands the Alexa voice commands
recognized your voice even if there was
loud music play it's actually good
because that was the biggest thing I was
skeptical about right yeah if you have a
movie or music blasting and you go you
know it actually heard us mmm almost
every time so that was great and when
you're controlling stuff on the fire
cube which is all your video apps and
things like that and amazon stuff great
fantastic not a problem it's when you
want to mix it with other things in your
in your system whether it's your cable
box or a game console it works but not
quite as seamlessly I feel like it
doesn't have the same hooks into the
into the commands that let's say a
harmony does because when you set up
your Harmony it says like what brand of
cable box you have what's the model
number and it really knows you know
button for button what everything is
yeah so we gave it a 4 out of 5 star
rating on our website I would say it's
probably like a 5 if it's if you if it
comes with rice which I don't think it
does but next up Google has released an
update that shows you how much
information the tech giant like has on
you so after Facebook's data misuse
scandal they also released this tool to
tell you how much data that it has on
you but I also remember people pointing
out that Google has way more information
on you than Facebook does which makes
sense you know Facebook is generally
just one social network but Google has
data from your chrome Brad
they're from Gmail what you're looking
up in Google Maps YouTube what you watch
on YouTube
where you are if you're using like an
Android phone and so it obviously has a
much bigger data profile on you so this
update you can find your privacy
settings and the data that they have on
you from like Google's apps now right
now it's available in Gmail but they're
planning on rolling it out to like maps
and photos and all these other like you
know Google apps are available is this
something that you're planning on using
I mean I'll take a look at it but I find
there's a lot of a lot of big hype about
privacy settings and privacy and
information tools and for the average
consumer they're never gonna make the
three or four mouse clicks required to
take a look they won't know what to look
for if they do you and I are very aware
of this but if you saw the average
person in the streets oh my god Google's
tracking me alright what else is new
yeah they do people just it's so
complicated issue they just throw their
hands up and say I don't even know what
to do about there's always this whole
thing of like data apathy in the sense
of just exactly that's a great term yeah
of that where the idea is that you know
yeah Google has all my information but I
also like knowing where I'm going at
anytime you know like it's its
transparency theater yeah yeah I thought
that's that's a pretty good way to
describe it so also the Supreme Court
decided today that states can charge you
for sales taxes online even if the place
you're shopping from doesn't have a
physical location in that state which
was a ruling from a 1992 case that
essentially had set the president for
about like you know decade what this
really means for you and what you really
need to know is that you'll probably be
paying more for stuff you buy online now
which I'm sure no one is a fan of well
it's that loophole they're closing where
if somebody is in a different state and
you buy something they don't know which
state to charge your sales tax for so
they don't we knew this loophole would
close eventually yeah and just want to
include this in breaking news this
morning Intel CEO Brian krzanich
resigned after the company's board
learned of a consensual relationship
with an Intel employee the company's
chief financial officer Robert Swan will
be stepping in while they search for a
new CEO that's all the time we have for
the show today if you liked what you
heard check us out on CNET I'm alfred
ring
Herman thanks for listening look at that
4 minutes are done alright see you guys
25 seconds over we got to do it again we
got free passes what a bunch of pros
take 2 take 2 do it again alright so as
always thanks everybody for joining us
I'm gonna go ahead and hop into the chat
and pull out some questions and comments
so that we can keep this conversation
truck rolling and I guess right out the
gate let's take one from Matthew dacher
who says uh will the fire cube accept
commands if I give them to something
like the Sonos beam we were trying to
set up something very similar to that
yesterday I'm not sure if we got it set
up
I feel like external sound bar speakers
are exactly the kind of thing this thing
should control but right now one of the
big complaints is outside of the fire
cube it doesn't do volume and mute
commands at all I think but if it
doesn't right now I feel like that's the
kind of thing that would have to patch
in because that's what everybody wants I
just notices that it has an aux port so
if I like plug that into my TV power
HDMI infrared something or other and
micro USB that's good yes yeah because I
was looking at was like live well yeah
over our dan would you hold it up for us
I'm gonna hold it up for ya
there we go let's see okay so here's the
front is the top there was some basic
volume and power commands here on the
back you've got again a power cable in
HDMI in an infrared port and a micro USB
and that's basically it I think it has a
little speaker on the bottom but most of
the time you hear it through your TV
although it does have I believe a
speaker built-in I feel like we should
start including in reviews like how
easily you can leave fingerprints we've
been doing that for years brothers when
you're here that well is it when you've
been here 13 years like I have you will
know that we include fingerprint
information on a great many things
although it may depend on who's doing
the reviewing and what they had for
lunch I'm 12 any any any Scott review
will have a lower
fingerprint section I'm just saying
there's a ton of finger prints on yeah
that wasn't in the law whew
I'm mad I like things that are a little
mad that's so the Pellman said everyone
what's a touchscreen laptop but then you
have a laptop with finger Pattillo I
just leave the Cheetos dust all over
yeah it's amazing
all I had to say was a nice coffee and
look at that we have a question from
Elton Mokoena he's asking does it have
Dolby Atmos it's a good question I do
not know off the top of my head let's
see if we can pull up the review in the
meantime review I just guess it Brent
Madison asks will the fire cue plane on
Amazon content yes yes and it'll do it
right through the cube because the fire
TV platform has Netflix and has a bunch
of other video services built in so
that's the easiest way to do it well
this is also different from like your
fire like the fire TV stick or anything
like that in the sense that you can use
this to like channel surf right like
like normal channels yes what we did was
we switched over to we're like we said
Alexa play CNN HD on cable and it
switched the input from like HDMI to two
HDMI one on our test TV you know turned
on the cable box and was able to okay
sometimes not every time correctly tuned
to but the channel was fresh channels
600 we tried if we said CNN on our
particular cable system and went to the
standard definition channel which is
terrible that's ever since he had an HD
then it went to the HD channel or if I
gave it the channel number which I knew
off the top of my head 600 then it went
to the HD it didn't work every time it
had some trouble communicating with our
cable box occasionally but this is you
know day one basically for this product
so so I had this question when it was
first announced and I don't know if they
you know cats my are tested for or
anything like that but if I said like Oh
turn on like what's the weather would it
turn on like the channel like any random
like Weather Channel or no I think it
would give you the rest standard Alexa
weather and it might I didn't try this
it might display the Alexa weather you
know app yeah but like on like on the
screen maybe weather is not not the best
example what if I said like turn on like
sports or something like that would it
like just go to ESPN or wear it like
like put on a World Cup game or that's a
good question
well hook it up and wait we had a TV
back here let's hook it up yeah find out
I don't have any Wi-Fi in here but I was
able to do you know everyone says oh
there's no YouTube on the fire platform
there's actually a helper app you can
get that will basically serve up YouTube
inside the silk browser but it's
actually fairly seen as experience and
it worked really well and we could voice
search for YouTube videos through that
so you can go on and say like 93 59 past
and if it's on YouTube yeah what we
search for a lot at home now is my son
who's six is fascinated by videos where
people eat crazy food like BuzzFeed has
that whole he's deeper yeah and they eat
like the world's stinkiest fish in like
at in the Scandinavian fish so we had to
watch tons and tons of videos of people
eating sir streaming which is possibly
the world's smelliest food is fermented
Candice horse and urine yes yeah yeah
much worse you should show him Skippy to
able what's that
that's the LA beast he does eating
challenges oh like he drank 20 year old
Crystal Pepsi once and okay I've heard
of that one Obama yes he he vomits
profusely and violently in almost every
episode III will tell you that when
Crystal Pepsi came out I was actually
working in the beverage industry trade
magazine business so that was a big
story for us I think I believe I was
writing about Crystal Pepsi at some
point back in the nineties Crystal Pepsi
is back in POG form a what an answer for
Elton milena
it does in fact have Dolby Atmos okay as
quoted from David Katz Maya who did the
review it has all the capabilities of
the $70 fire TV streamer including 4k
HDR video Dolby Atmos but it lacks the
HDR 10 plus yes but you know there's so
little HDR content out there and there
are multiple versions of HDR I don't
know if I'd lose a ton of sleep over
that the big thing is it's basically
like the fire stick or fire box but with
this big Alexa voice command being
built-in and the ability to kind of
control other devices if you have your
echo hooked up and it's already doing
some AV commands for you which is very
possible it does it for a lot of things
you probably don't really need this if
you are a big harmony guy like myself in
a lot of other people are you don't
really need this but if you're starting
from scratch and you want a finer level
of control and you want that sort of
Smart TV experience that's a lot better
than the
junkies smart TV apps built into your TV
then that seems pretty cool I think it's
like $120 I mean certainly not not bad I
don't think I'd pay for that but you
wouldn't pay for anything you never pay
for anything I'm actually taking this
home for free after so I'm taking this
clock yeah fine okay let's take another
question from Liam McBride does the fire
TV cube come with a remote yes they all
do yeah
although if you want to do stuff with
your other devices you were gonna need
those remotes as well sometimes to do
some of the functions sometimes to tell
this box basically how to use the
commands and right behind your original
remote for you or whatever and hit the
you know hit this button on it and then
the remote also has like a microphone on
it right so like if you're stuck if your
speakers are really like way too loud or
if you just don't want to yell at your
TV you can always just like kind of
whisper into it as it it might I didn't
try that it might rain to my face do you
have the microphone in the remote that
usually works pretty well actually I
mean the Amazon remote leaves a lot to
be desired it's simple its basic no
super quality like you know there's
nothing wrong with it it's not gonna
ever serve as a universal remote no no
but the voice search is okay like I wish
my Harmony remote had a microphone in it
so I could do voice search I'd be
curious to see if Amazon in the echo app
that you could put on smartphone if they
could start working in universal remote
phone calls there yes
although they don't have they don't seem
to have that Universal like IR blaster
capability that's the key thing yeah
that's like the big difference between
this cube and like other products right
or a like Smart TV stuff yeah yeah like
you can you can put it on a TV that's
like relics yeah it's a giant the giant
blaster and that's what you need like
I'm with my harmony setup I've got like
the blaster hub I've got a little micro
blasters everywhere to make sure I get
good coverage I never got that yeah do
you wanna pay for a buddy from life
improvements if you open Amazon in your
Chrome browser you can cast that tab and
chromecast is there any way to get
google play movies or music in there oh
that's a good question that's a very
good question
I bet a cast of that would work from
your browser because I've done that
before with I think HBO or something
that wasn't on it was something that was
not on it gets sticky
yeah yeah but it's not the best
experience but it's definitely possible
I was just casting from my browser this
is its Android related and the fire
stuff is built on on Android I was just
casting from my web browser on a MacBook
to Nvidia shield because I wanted some
because now they have video content on
the Sirius XM app but only on the phone
app not on the Android TV or other you
know apps only on the phone app and the
web browser so I wanted to watch some I
want to watch some Howard Stern videos
now that they've added those and I just
cast it from my web browser right to the
shield TV so you know that code that
chromecast comes in handy a lot of the
time isn't it great how fragmented
everything is it's all a band-aid over
time frankly I'm surprised you didn't
need like three extra dongles did I lose
I I basically shoehorned it in III I
soft hacked it onto my TV when it was
content not intended for TVs but I
wanted to watch the the Snoop Dogg
interview you can do that IG TV now
probably - I guess good TV would also
have to be vertical because they don't
it's not horizontal yeah oh boy I'm
sorry I'm old I don't know what any
Instagram stuff mean we have enough time
for just a couple more questions storm
king is asking is this going to replace
your cable box or work with that we've
kind of covered on that but that's
always a big question if you subscribe
to a OTT service that has an app that
works on this then perhaps that could
replace your cable box or if you just
want to consume on-demand content from
Netflix and Amazon and is there fire
yeah and those services sure I don't
know if the Hulu TV the live TV works on
its app I don't think it does it but I'm
sure it will someday if they want this
to be a cable box replacement all you
need is a device like Roku does this
other devices do this that have the live
TV apps that are VOD T replacements for
your cable box the problem is everyone
thinks I'm gonna cut cable gonna save a
lot of money I'm gonna get like the Hulu
TV live DirecTV now or stream stream TV
watch the Tommy you go through well you
know what I'm a real-time news junkie so
I need the news channels and a few other
things little HDTV
Travel Channel I as a 20 year vegetarian
I'm obsessed with watching the media
strewed shows possible that's my that's
my secret shame really
behind me at home eating site and
watching BBQ pitmasters or or carnival
eats there's something kind of beautiful
about but it is it is it's it's it's
it's not so much forbidden you watch it
more so is like I'm better than you kind
of things I'm just fascinated that this
other world exists I would never eat it
but I like watching it I wonder if like
me a bunch of like meat eaters watch
like vegetarian shows there are no good
vegetarian shows that's the problem so
if anyone would like to put together a
tour of the country's best vegetarian
restaurant chef I've had the television
host with a lot of experience please
call my agent we got a good question
here from bill Harry D alright so what
do you guys think does the cube really
give you anything above not having to
talk to your remote that's an
interesting question the way it's
phrased I think voice commands really
are the future of a lot of home AV and
and and and other control the fact that
you can do it out loud you know what if
I have my shield my Nvidia shield I
can't be bothered to find that goddamn
remote or the controller and talk into
it I'm just frustrated want to do it out
loud I used to do it with the Kinect on
the Xbox but that never really worked
but I'd like be I like the possibility
of it you could probably do almost all
this to a regular echo just sitting in
your room because as that great far film
or a Google assistant that's kind of
this with the IR blaster built-in and
some other AV functionality that that's
thing if you have a lot of equipment you
don't really need this if you're
starting from scratch it's certainly
worth looking at if you're invested in
that Amazon ecosystem but I always tell
people I don't remember what life was
like before we talked to our lightbulbs
what kind of life are we living I I just
can't I wouldn't even know how to turn
on a light I will say I've recently
gotten smaller but I really do enjoy oh
my god talking to intelligent or not I
mean I can do it turn on different rooms
the numbered lights within each room I
do i do percentage just now I'm like I'm
like Alexa turn on to 50% and it is it
is kind of effin brilliant
is kind of annoying for me though cuz
like the last few days I've been sick
and I've had like a sore throat and it's
like I got to turn this light on but it
also hurts for me to talk well you just
do the phone app and you go where's the
Philips now but I could also just hold
the damn thing no no my my son named the
room lights in his room Easter Bunny
there we go Alexa turn off Easter Bunny
when it's time to go to bed
malleable that's very nice all right
let's take one more and we'll switch
gears on the way out the door here one
more from Ville Harry this is a great
question what do you see changing with
Intel going forward I mean the big
question for Intel actually has nothing
to do with the news today the big
question mark for Intel is what is gonna
happen next year will they lose a major
customer when and if and I'm not
convinced they will when Apple moves
away from Intel chips in their laptops
and desktops and moves to their own you
know a series style chips which they
used to do many many many years ago then
it was big news that they switched to
Intel had made MacBooks much more
compatible with everything else in the
universe and basically made them the
default computer for a lot of people
will Apple move away what will that do
to Intel's business they already have
you know AMD and and and and other
companies nipping at their heels on
other parts of the business can they can
they maintain market dominance without
Apple and will Apple take that big leap
of faith to move away from the Intel
platform which is just so Universal even
though when we see those Snapdragon
handful of Snapdragon laptops they don't
work that great and there's some stuff
that's just incompatible and that's what
happens when you move away from that
from that Intel platform that's my read
on that yeah he said it much better than
I could have so I'm just gonna leave
leave it with that okay and with that we
are just about out of time and that's
gonna be it for us for the week thank
you to Dan for coming and subbing in
last second as we were man down today
down I always are a good life raft
