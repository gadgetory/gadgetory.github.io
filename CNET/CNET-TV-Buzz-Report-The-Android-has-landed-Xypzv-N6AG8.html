online information source with a digital
age
hi i'm molly wood and welcome to the bus
report this week the android has landed
the LHC is offline and the kids are not
alright but first it's the gadget of the
week the gadget of the week is the
t-mobile g1 aka the HTC dream it's the
first phone to be released running on
Google's Android platform and at first
blush it's just about everything we
expected it to be both good and bad it's
got a full qwerty keyboard snazzy
customizable interface gps Wi-Fi 3g
multimedia messaging and copy and paste
suck its iPhone there's a browser of
course and tight integration with gmail
there's built-in access to the drm free
amazon mp3 store which is super cool the
android market promises to let you shop
for cool apps which is good timing since
apple's been doing everything it can to
kill cool absolutely then again the g1
is locked to tmobile doesn't have
microsoft exchange support and you have
to have a google account to use it so
you know if you're dying to be part of
the new world order go get yours on
october 22nd or join the resistance and
goal emo and now for the news amid all
the excitement about the new g one this
week here comes the new segment that I'm
calling the buzz kill and gadget noted
some fine print in the t-mobile contract
apparently if you exceed one gigabyte of
data use on the phone timo could cap
your bandwidth rate at 50 kilobits per
second out the move wait wait there's
breaking news this just in t-mobile has
bowed to customer complaints and decided
to lift their one gigabyte cap on their
data plan that's so reasonable of them
you never hear a teen to do and stuff
like that anyway get your buzz back on
we now return to the buzz report already
in progress in other news due to a
helium leak that was apparently much
worse than initially realized the large
hadron collider will now be offline
until at least spring TG Daily noted
that the shutdown shows just how complex
and fragile the collider really is a
malfunction in an electrical connection
that's just a few inches long can close
down the 20 billion dollar project for
months citizens against the Large Hadron
Collider noted
what they won't be cranking up that def
machine until at least next spring hey
guys looks like we'll be getting
Christmas after all and now for the
return of one of my favorite segments
kids these days the website womb ecomme
which lets users engage in speed dating
via web cam is now letting everyone in
on the exciting painfully awkward first
webcam date viewing let's take a look
what's your name John Oh John Bueller
take your shirt off take your shirt off
Wow hey there cutie I like you I like
you to do so did you join cuz you want
to see my titties cuz I'll show ya i
will show you let me cover him up
because i know you weren't expecting
that oh my god I feel so dirty right now
can you put the stuff in your eyes and
finally let's have a look at what's
clogging the tubes because I can't think
about that wound me thing anymore this
week it's ninja cat
look at that almost 3 million views and
then you know what happened i thought
they're watching cat videos for like
another hour what is it about cats and
video cameras it's magic I'm Mollywood
