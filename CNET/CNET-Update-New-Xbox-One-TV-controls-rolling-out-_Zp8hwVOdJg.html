all-in-one remote I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update Microsoft has
always boasted about the TV features of
the Xbox one because the game system
connects to your cable box but it hasn't
been all that impressive well that may
change Microsoft invited some Xbox Live
members to test out new TV control
features which include the ability to
set DVR recordings and watch recorded
shows from a tablet or smartphone and
the one guide which is xbox version of a
channel guide can be viewed on a tablet
so you can keep watching the current
programming on your TV now for those
that haven't been invited to test it out
well the rest of the world has to wait
until later this year to see these new
perks technology is getting better at
replacing paper why carry a heavy book
when you can load it on a Kindle why get
newspaper ink on your fingers when your
news is in a smartphone app and it's
simple to take notes at a meeting with
your iPad but sometimes we just grab
paper and pen because it can be easier
for scribbling down notations or marking
up documents Sony is trying to replace
the legal pad with a new toy it's the
digital paper slate and it's like a
really big touchscreen Kindle it's a 13
inch e-ink screen that's about as thick
as 30 sheets of paper the idea is that
you would load up all your PDF documents
onto this and use a stylus to make notes
on the big screen and then you save the
notes or you can share them but at a
price tag of a whopping 11 hundred
dollars I think most folks who prefer
handwriting will stick with a two dollar
legal pad and speaking of digital notes
microsoft recently launched Office for
iPad and although it cost one hundred
dollars a year to access the suite of
office apps like Word and PowerPoint
there's a little loophole that some
folks can exploit to get around paying
the fee Cena discovered that someone can
share their office login credentials
with numerous iPads to unlock the
software and Microsoft is not strictly
enforcing the limit of how many times
one account is installed on a tablet
microsoft says one paid subscription
lets you install it on up to
five tablets but it doesn't seem like
Microsoft will stop you if you install
it on more than five it's kind of like
sharing your HBO GO or your Netflix
password with all your friends and
family sometimes technology can spice up
the most typical household items like a
lamp check out this new desk lamp from
LG which uses OLED technology instead of
a typical bulb many of the top TVs and
smartphone screens use OLED with oled
lighting we're getting closer to a world
where we can put up sheets of
illuminated wallpaper in the home
imagine that that's your tech news
