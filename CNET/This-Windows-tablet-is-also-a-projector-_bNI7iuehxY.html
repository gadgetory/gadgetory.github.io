gadgets into our mobile devices is
ongoing we're taking a look at a tablet
here that has a projector built in it's
the acumen holophone so let's begin by
talking about that projector unit in the
top now you can see it does make the top
back part of the tablet here protrude
slightly but it's not too bad the tablet
remains relatively slim despite the fact
there's got a massive great projector
crammed in there so you get 35 to 45
lumens of brightness with this thing
obviously it's going to work better in a
darkened rooms or against certain
backdrops and up here you can see
there's a dial this controls the focus
what I quite like is that's begin
projecting all you have to do is press
this button on the side here and the
projector comes to life in terms of
battery life obviously projecting an
image it's quite battery intensive I'm
told you can expect between 2 to 2.5
hours of projection time as you may have
noticed the tablet itself is running
Windows 10 it's got a 7-inch display and
the company is calling this a phablet
because it actually has 4G LTE powers as
well it's got an Intel quad core chip
inside and it's backed up by 4 gigabytes
of RAM now this is going to be pretty
expensive you can expect a 650 to 950
dollars depending on the configuration
I'm told there will be a discount price
offered for schools so this isn't the
first time I've seen a projector in a
mobile device I remember a few years ago
Samsung actually had to go with a phone
called the Galaxy Beam it didn't really
take off but you know it's a pretty cool
idea if you really like the idea of
being able to beam a movie onto a wall
anywhere you go it might be worth
checking out
it's gonna be trialed in a few months
time before it goes on sale globally in
june the name is the acumen holophone
for much more tech check out sina TOCOM
