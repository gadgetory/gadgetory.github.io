memos and it's sort of a voice recorder
memo app but for musicians so it wants
you to play your guitar player piano
maybe sing-along it's gonna record what
you do in a very simple memo format
after you're done recording it takes
that audio recording and tries to figure
out what chords you played puts down the
bars the tempo that you played and even
lets you add some basic bass and drums
based on the chords and the timing it
gives you a nice little demo package
that you can then either play around
with in this app or export it's got a
tuner built it first so if you want to
tune up you can do that
and it seems to work best if you do big
ringing open chords basic 4 over 4 time
kind of like this
I can play it back and follow along with
it if I had the drums and the bass based
on the chords and then I can go in after
I'm done trimming it and I can edit the
actual chords let's give that a quick
listen
and that'll loop around so if you want
to like play some chords and then noodle
over it don't do something just a little
funkier
and then when you want to do something
more of the song you can take it and
export it into GarageBand or logic or
just send this audio file to someone by
email post of YouTube whatever you want
it's a free app for iOS and that is
music memos by Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
