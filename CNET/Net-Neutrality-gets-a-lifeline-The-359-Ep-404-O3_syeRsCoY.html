Alfred hang legislation to save net
neutrality passed the Senate yesterday
thanks in part to a few Republicans
crossing the aisle but don't expect this
to mean net neutrality which are rules
that prevent ISPs from blocking or
slowing Internet traffic from being back
just yet
the legislation still has to go through
the republican-controlled house and get
presidents Trump's signature as far as
it seems to me that all seems pretty
unlikely yeah I mean yesterday when the
vote passed I had seen all across
Twitter basically oh no neutrality is
saved we did it but you know there's
still a lot more steps to go through
here but I mean it is a move in a
direction you know in a positive
direction for neutrality so I mean
what's next for them then uh the
Senators the the the Senate Democrats
were taking a bit of a victory lap
yesterday they're also claiming that
this is going to create an additional
amount like a nice momentum boost that
will hopefully encourage more
Republicans in the House to actually go
through and vote for net neutrality to
show like hey this is what the people
won you you were you were voted in to do
this kind of thing
look that sounds like a nice argument I
don't actually know that that's actually
gonna work plus President Trump it seems
to me super unlikely to actually go
through and you know sign this if it
actually ever reached his desk because
he's the one that brought in a GP to
become the chairman in the first place
and he's anti regulation I mean even if
he didn't sign it was is there any way
for the Congress to basically force this
through if they get like two-thirds of
the vote which you know they barely even
got more than half in the Senate that's
a good question I don't I I think they
do need president Trump's signature on
this one there might be some sort of you
know veto loophole but I'm not it's been
a while for my physics class so I'm not
actually sure physics but specific
civics class it's Thursday people either
way we'll see what changes actually take
place when net neutrality rules are
removed from the books on June 11th so
we've still got some time before that
actually changes
next ebay is working on adding more
personalization to its website I went to
a press briefing yesterday about this
where they set up this whole mini store
called the store of Ben I can now retire
as a tech reporter after getting this
time aid to that just for you they made
it they made it just for me and that was
the idea is is that what you do is you
take this like survey or questionnaire
on eBay which I know that doesn't sound
like very cutting edge or impressive you
do a questionnaire but eBay claims that
they did the a ton of work on the back
end to actually start to surface a lot
more stuff that you would find
interesting if you just tell them a
little bit more about yourself and your
interests that's interesting all these
interests like I don't go on eBay every
day just to browse for a random stuff I
might be interested in that sounds like
something that I go on Amazon for right
when eBay is probably hoping you do that
more often with them I specifically go
on eBay just to find like cheap versions
of things I like I know I really want
that like somebody else already owns
yeah and a lot of people I think
justifiably complain about eBay that
it's a mess it's disorganized there's so
much stuff there and I don't know what
to find this is kind of them trying to
answer that situation and they've been
trying to do that for years trying to
like organize the site a lot more yeah I
don't know it feels like they're trying
to turn like the thrift store into like
a target yeah and no to it look that
might work I don't I don't know I I
liked getting the store of been I'll
just say that last its global
accessibility Awareness Day which
focuses on making technology more usable
for people with disabilities last week I
got a chance to check out a bunch of
Apple's efforts in the space including
voice-over features for the blind our
own Ian sure today we're at about
Microsoft's new adaptive controller
built for gamers with physical
limitations
either way this sounds very positive and
it's nice to see these tech giants
trying to make some of these efforts
mm-hmm
either way if you want to read more
about these stories check us out on CNN
I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm alpha ring thanks
for listening
now to be fair we did have a bit of a
special plan for today that has
absolutely fallen through by a person
who will remain nameless wait what we're
not gonna call them out by name for a
friend's ridiculous for those aware of
the scene at history you'll be familiar
with an old program once upon a time
known as the 404 we did have a special
guest lined up today and the jerks on a
bus right now
I'm sure he's not that happy about it I
thought we were just gonna go if that we
couldn't find him because it was episode
404 wasn't that I mean I'm all for
making fun of people being on buses but
if we don't even want to do that you
know it sounds appropriate to me right
loser get it uber ouch
anyway as anyway we had this we had this
situation lined up for like a good week
beforehand and we're pretty excited to
have episode 404 with the 404 guys or
the 404 guy but you know it didn't work
out that's okay that's that's live shows
that's podcasting uh-huh either way if
you clinically we had stuff to talk
about otherwise if you get a chance give
Jeff hell on Twitter oh that would
definitely be a big good motivator yes
please fly my pretties I know who you
are people that watch the show pretty
regularly go find Jeff Bakalar and trash
him on Twitter for us that would be
amazing please destroy his DMS okay it
would be pretty fun so I'm jumping back
into the chat right now looking for
questions and comments and I think it's
safe to say we could expand a little
more on net neutrality because this is a
dense the issue that's gonna play out
over a long time no matter what way it
swings at this point but it was a nice
little shining beacon of hope for those
of us who are proponents of net
neutrality maintenance to see that vote
pass yesterday yeah there were like only
three Republican senators that went
across the aisle for this one yeah but
that's usually how this horse trading
works is that you really only need like
one or two
to get it over the line so generally you
send as few of your people over as
possible so that they don't they not as
many people are risk when they are
actually up for election that's that's
generally how I've seen it so then and
then they always claim the stuff where
they were like well I was I wasn't sure
until the vote was actually happening
yeah give me a break you knew exactly
what you were doing yeah I wanted to
talk a little bit more about that xbox
control that we ran out of time yes it's
about on the Pocket Lily I did a story
that was very similar to this for tech
enabled about a year ago but this was
more this is more so about like outside
efforts to make controller specifically
for gamers based on their disabilities
that this was a guy you talked to in DC
who played Street Fighter
yeah but he's from Texas but the company
that like sponsors I'm a major
controllers for him they're they're
based in DC North Virginia more
accurately but yeah to see a company
themselves be the ones to make this is
insanely cool like I said like so
there's companies that like that one of
the companies that I spoke with
AbleGamers they they make these
controllers like they visit them and
they see like what their needs are and
then they have to go like extremely out
of their way to like they one of the
controllers that I found that they made
was they found these like really old
parts that were only made like in like
2001 to 2003 and then he he bought like
their last stock because the company is
no longer in in business anymore so he
buys like the remaining stock that they
still had like it more than a decade
after they went out of business and then
he used that to basically make these
controllers and he's not like making any
money off of this you know this is more
for like as a nonprofit or like a
charity so it's incredibly cool to see
you know Microsoft themselves to be the
ones to make this because then the you
know they're not in short supply you
don't have to really go out of your way
to make something like this yeah it's
it's really awesome they're doing stuff
stuff like that yeah and the adaptive
controller by the way is $99 so you know
to me that seems like look that's not a
little bit of money for a controller but
at the same time the expense that goes
into creating some of the stuff
probably it's significantly more than
that and the the base of customers is
probably considerably lower
yeah specially since so what I've seen
from companies like like you know big
game like game makers is that they they
usually make these changes on the
software like it's never really like a
hardware thing that they put out
themselves but on hardwood on the
software like Uncharted is a really good
example of this so I think in the first
game or something like that they had an
issue where it was like people that were
colorblind really couldn't see that much
so in the next one or they might have
put a patch for it where like it changed
the colors for it so it was like dynamic
enough that you could see everything
they have all these other features to
where like there's like parts of it
where like you kind of have to like mash
the X button really fast or something
like that so if you have a certain
disability that won't let you do that
they you can like turn on a mode that
would like just get rid of that for you
or anything like that yeah so like I
said most of it is usually in software
but it's like really cool that they're
coming out for like hardware solutions
which is usually the larger obstacle
yeah yeah I I got a chance to talk to
Apple about this they say from from
their software from their operating
system perspective they're constantly
trying to add new features in year over
year every single year to try to help
people with different types of
disabilities I got a chance to talk to a
Paralympian who uses the Apple watch to
track his workouts and he's able to
toggle between the Apple watch because
because he's able to walk but he has
there's a cerebral palsey below his
knees he's able to walk but not very
quickly so he's able to toggle between
the Apple watches walking functions and
also wheelchair functions so he can kind
of keep all of his workout information
and all of his movement information in
one place which I thought was pretty
cool and he does it at like a very high
level where like he's been in the
Paralympics and 2012 in 2016 yeah it's
always nice when you get to cover a
story that's actually endearing and you
know positive yeah it's rare but it's
nice it happens yeah let's jump into the
chat and take some questions actually
let's start with a poem michael hazel
says republicans are red democrats are
blue neither of them care about you
your money has more power with private
entities screw
net neutrality I'm actually impressed
with that that was pretty good rhyme
scheme wouldn't disagree with that poem
either yeah he's got some points in
there yeah
however some of us are still proponent
of it and where do we fall specifically
ask you let's editorialize for a second
we try not to get too personal about it
I'm not so paranoid personally about the
services having my information because
hey spoilers I already got it it's more
about the potential for abuse and the
restrictions of access that that make me
nervous
I already with the ala carte and
streaming media these days it's already
difficult enough trying to maintain the
different streaming channels you want to
keep and if they're gonna put extra
barriers up in front of that when you
live in a place like I do and you don't
have choices for service providers that
really sucks mmm that's my biggest
concern as a consumer as a consumer I
mean like look also I I think I've been
pretty open on the show that I've been a
more skeptical about net neutrality
rules in the first place and I'm
definitely interested to see what
happens on June 11th because there are
certain people that argue that the sky
is gonna fall and there are gonna be all
these changes and I I think any changes
if they do happen are gonna be fairly
gradual by the idea that ISPs are gonna
be blocking websites or some of the
other nightmare scenarios I don't
personally see that in the cards but
I've been wrong about all sorts of
things so III can understand why a lot
of people would want to argue you know
very strongly to try to protect these
types of things because they think that
it is entirely possible yeah so after
the Senate vote passed yesterday I
received a statement in my inbox from
FCC Commissioner Brendon car which I I'm
trying to like hear him out on this on
this on his argument but I'm also like I
don't understand why net neutrality
would block that what he's saying so
he's saying that you know we're fighting
for better faster and cheaper internet
act yet internet access by by cutting
through all this red tape that net
neutrality brings and I mean if if I
still don't understand how net
neutrality he essentially blocks that
you know if you want to like leave a
comment telling me why net neutrality is
all this red tape that is blocking us
from cheaper and faster internet because
it I really don't see that happening
where when if net neutrality does die
all of a sudden your internet bills are
gonna be way cheaper and faster that
just doesn't seem like on the flip side
they're also not gonna automatically
just get more expensive and you know
this is the kind of thing that's
obviously gonna be a gradual burn but
we're all entitled to have our own
biased opinion again I've had a really
really bad long-running history with a
certain service provider that I will not
name here CNET we all have yeah yeah
everybody's got their own horror stories
but I mean yeah as this is unfolded I've
tried to force myself to read more into
the other side of it and there is great
potential for innovations and privacy
and security improvements of the
broadband it's just watch it unfold the
broadband providers clearly do not want
the additional restrictions you know
you're gonna create a law telling them
how to run their business obviously
they're gonna take the position that no
we don't want this law and they're gonna
make the argument that like look you
want to put a law in the books that
you're not allowed to have a bear as a
pet in your house why would that make
any sense either so they're probably
viewing it or that's their argument is
that they're viewing it the same way is
that you're putting unnecessary
restrictions on us they like don't
actually belong anywhere alex is also
against net neutrality stating that I
don't want them making money off the
info I have without my permission of or
benefit and that's where I get upset and
that's another good point I just like
that we've all got we're keeping it
civil we've all got our own personal
angle is to come in on this yeah
shockingly personal but going back to
the eBay story by the way eBay went out
of its way to say like look we're gonna
get this additional personalization and
fro from you but we're not gonna sell
the data and initially like maybe more
than like two years ago or something
when I first started covering tech I
might have been like oh yeah whatever
but like nowadays everybody is so much
more aware of what's being done with
your data that I actually appreciated
the fact that they they wanted to
highlight that and they wanted to say
like look we're gonna give we're gonna
take more information from you
you're actually gonna use this feature
we're not gonna package it and sell it
we don't want to do that so you know
yeah I asked me want to make you a
customer ISPs would make the argument
that you know you are giving them
permission by signing up for their
service and a green are their terms and
conditions but that's also something
that Congress has been talking I was you
know watching a Senate hearing yesterday
where they talked about that where they
need to build better terms and
conditions that protects consumers and
in the sense of you know just because I
want to use the internet doesn't mean
that I'm giving you the right to tell
everybody about what I'm browsing
through and all this stuff but yeah I
mean that's that's always been the
argument of I he's like hey you're
signing up for this you agree to the
terms and conditions you are giving us
your permission to sell this and you
know there there is a lot of advocacy
out there to change that I see we have a
lot of questions yeah they're filing
right on in APEC and I are on the same
page I'm for net neutrality but would it
end up providing even more ISP companies
where I live I have one choice spectrum
and I'm paying a lot for a little
kindred spirits yeah do we think that we
could potentially see other better
options for service providers come out
of either side of this unfolded we've
discussed this before on the podcast
aside from net neutrality regardless of
where it ends up going there's a very
significant expectation that 5g is gonna
help provide a lot more broadband
service precisely and I I think it's it
might have been Alex in the chat who
keeps pointing that out and thank you
for that we are on board yeah and it's
not gonna be a year from now by the way
so we are if if things really go south
for customers related to net neutrality
and things don't actually shake out the
way customers want it to it's not like
5g is all of a sudden gonna show up on a
white horse in the next year or two or
so so it's they don't expect it to be
right around the corner where we're all
gonna have all this additional
competition and more options yeah it's
just funny to me like the thought of you
know all these like different ISPs that
are like oh man I really wish I could
give the world cheaper and faster
internet if only this net neutrality
weren't there to stop us no it's not
that's such an unrealistic scenario just
sitting on these giant piles of money
and just be like I'd love to spend this
much
to give everybody a habitat have all
this internet but we can't give it to
people for free unless they get rid of
his red tape come on guys very good
points
let's Jarrell you do you think
discussions like this net neutrality are
going to start becoming more prominent
in not to get into politics or not
diving into that but will it start
becoming a more push button issue kind
of thing with campaigns more prominent
it seems to me the Democrats are
definitely trying to play that card they
think that they're getting traction on
net neutrality and that's why they're
saying like we've got momentum and we've
got the public on our side we're gonna
try to you know force the house to get
involved with this I mean like people
are demonstrating in the street about
this kind of thing which if you took a
step back that's kind of surprising this
is this is a really wonky don't have CC
rule I mean people really care about
their internet access it's true I'm not
a paranoid person but I really hate my
service provider that's another big
reason is that people have very little
trust of a lot of the service providers
so they don't they think giving them
back some power is not gonna be helpful
yeah well we'll make sure to stay with
it as it unfolds how would net
neutrality affect people in Canada if we
use USA services in other countries do
they have to be abiding by USA law for
the server's being used we talked about
this know if this impacts a u.s. there
is global reverberation to this right
there could be there could be there's
certainly like some countries that have
looked at strengthening their net
neutrality rules because of what's
happened in the US but it's also like
it's gotten really jumbled on a state
level where there are like more than it
doesn't state yeah looking on adding net
neutrality rules there's also this whole
effort going on in the courts to where a
lot of major Internet companies are
trying to force net neutrality rules to
stay in place through you know different
lawsuits so it's it's just becoming it
like a big mess at this point so if
you're Canadian and get us you just
you're just as likely to know what's
going on is like a u.s. customer because
it's it's probably gonna get Messier
before it gets simpler I mean if
anything defines the global playground
it's the internet go figure
cannot let syringe eyes poem go without
notice I the correct answer is Laurel
I'm hearing yani Senate reinstating net
neutrality
ajit finds it funny that's pretty good
that's not bad well we got some real
talent in the chat guys thanks a lot
CNN is now a poetry website yeah I could
go for like a spoken word like Poetry
Jam kind of thing want to host a special
episode of that we're literally doing
that right now send in your net
neutrality poems we'll be here all day
we'll read them off for you so let's go
back to the uplifting side of the
stories and talk about tech enabled
Carlos Martinez says I'm blind you
should tell Apple to make a true speed
dial feature mmm that would be nice
inclusion what are some other email them
today there's actually a blind PR person
I was working with for the Apple story
that I'm sure he'd be very interested to
hear that insight from Carlos so yeah I
will I will send it to him after the
podcast Thank You Carlos do we know any
other potential tech enabled features
that they are working on right now in
concert with the the Smart Watch and
what we brushed on before they don't
really talk about future features but
you know they walked me through a lot of
stuff obviously when it's it's series
not really that great but using Siri
especially for folks that are blind or
have other physical limitations making
Siri or any voice assistant more
powerful is obviously useful because you
just do it via voice and that's that can
be really helpful and you can operate
your phone operate small appliances in
your house potentially lock the doors
that's that's something that you you
could see as a positive for the smart
home yeah
before we go Alfred I wanted to hear a
little more about your experience with
the gaming controllers and the people
you spoke to there that seemed really
awesome yeah I wrote the story about a
year ago I I didn't get to use any of
the controller spreaded I did see them
getting used it was really interesting
so there was one where was kind of like
this like floor pad kind of thing where
you would put your foot on it and you
would use that to like control back and
forth like look around in a first-person
shooter because the way like she
couldn't like basically turn and well
like it would hurt her wrist a lot it's
like to use the analog stick to like
look around so she would use that to
look around on the floor and then like
like shoot with like her other hand
which like she had no problem using so
that that was like another really cool
feature of that they showed one of the
the ones that like you controlled with
your mouth yeah this Street Fighter guy
is oh no no that wasn't like a special
controller like that was what I thought
was super awesome this is that this guy
that that you talked to is one of the
best Street Fighter players in the world
right yeah he plays with his face yeah
so he he sets up like a an Xbox
controller and he ki mapped it so that
was part of the software like you can
change like Oh punch can be like this
button instead of like another one
that's like harder for me to reach and
he like sets it up so he can play like
really well just by playing with it like
his mouth and his tongue so like he
he'll use his tongue inside his cheek to
like press certain buns and stuff and he
like totally owns people he's very good
I never got to play him but III would
definitely lose what was this player of
choice chun-li really yeah that's a
tricky player in general so the way that
so I actually play Street Fighter and as
so chun-li it makes sense because of
like the way that she's played so if
you're playing with like a character
like Ryu or Ken it's like you have to do
all these like different combinations
and stuff but Chumley's characters like
a charged character where right you like
hold back and then like you press
forward it's probably - forward and like
attack or you can like button mash the
kick button for her like multiple kicks
so it makes sense at that like there's a
character like that he plays a character
like her I don't know he plays in Street
Fighter 5 now I'm not even sure if he
and yeah so so yeah that that was one of
the other controllers so that's
something that you can like map like
different keys and she can put it
anywhere she wants that's brilliant yeah
so that that's what I was talking about
that was like the parts that like he had
to buy from a warehouse that like from a
business that like no longer worked and
that is her husband with her who like
that he like he spends most of his time
like gaming with her like that's how
they bond together but it got to a point
where she couldn't play that much
anymore because her hand hurt too much
and that's the floor board that she uses
like turn that's so cool
I mean I'm I personally just kind of
curious I almost want to try um myself
like I really want to try them to see
how they yeah I mean it's awful when you
can't like do something that you love
because of a disability or anything like
that it's like really cool that that you
know there's people out there building
this for free for them and now Microsoft
getting into it too yeah one of the
things that Apple also mentioned to me
was that some of these features that
they do develop for accessibility end up
helping you know just broadly like the
community and yeah enroll so for
instance inverted colors which are used
for people with visual impairments some
people just turn that on when they're
you know going to bed so like you don't
get like a big white somebody that I
spoke with about that called that like
the curb effect where it's essentially
you know how like on the sidewalks like
there's there's like the parts that are
flat that like it's easier to like push
a wheel up toward like for a baby
stroller or anything like that or like a
bicycle that was originally like
mandated by law for people in
wheelchairs so to be easier to get them
on the curb but like they found that you
know by doing that it made it so much
easier for like everybody with wheels to
get on so like that's that's like
exactly what your point is yeah as
somebody who's pushed a stroller more
than once I'm definitely very thankful
for that
it is interesting just to see what can
be included in the gaming experience you
know we see from the low level just how
to game differently with a Wii mo which
kind of changed the game and then we're
seeing way more intensely amazing
innovations with these devices here I'm
really interested to see where it goes
yeah we are just about out of time but
we got one more poem that came through
from Matthew - you're a haiku net
neutrality feel screwed by my isp need
Internet choice beautiful absolutely
beautiful I we will should be let's
let's offer to read any net neutrality
poem on air as long as it's not dirty
yeah yeah we got to keep it kind of PC
so yeah but anyway Oh are we done yeah
we are out of time I was trying to
filibuster a little bit longer to see if
Jeff gets here but apparently not this
thus concludes our episode 404 Suns joy
without the 404 yeah that's okay but you
know maybe maybe we'll see you guys for
episode 1000
