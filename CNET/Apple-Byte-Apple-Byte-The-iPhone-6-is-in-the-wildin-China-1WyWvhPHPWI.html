the apple pie for everything good bad
inside the world of Apple now I first
like to start off the show with an
apology for all those rumors about
LeBron going to Cleveland that were in
fact true hello what up Dre hold up i
gotta finish some talk to just like
apple rumors have been over the past few
years like every rumor you hear is
actually true so I'm sorry in yes I get
a bad apple onto the show and we have a
heavy dose of iphone and I watch news if
you're anxiously waiting to see a
working iphone 6 you won't have to
anymore well kind of thanks to my
relatives iphone 6 clones are already
appearing in China's mobile phone
marketplace that are even using the
rumored form factors for the iphone 6
and a full functioning iOS 7 even if
it's a little laggy now the week oh I
six features the 4.7 inch body and the
goophone i6 will start shipping on
August the first with a quad-core
mediatek chipset 1 gig of ram and a
13-megapixel camera now I would just
change the name because I don't like the
idea of having a gue phone and if you
want to get your iphone 6 case ahead of
time spy in has listed multiple 4.7 and
5.5 inch cases on amazon get them while
they're hot if you actually think
they're going to fit the phone that
hasn't come out yet also a report last
week says Foxconn is preparing to
enhance its assembly process with a new
line of robots now each of the planned
100,000 robots are in the final testing
phase and will cost around twenty to
thirty thousand dollars and we'll be
able to pump out an average of three
hundred thousand smartphones now they'll
probably be seen a lot of these this is
a picture of the alleged new touch ID
part for the iphone 6 that's below the
current iphone touch ID sensor and if I
was getting replaced by a robot I'd take
as many pictures of leaked parts as I
could so keep it up China all right
according to a Chinese report from CN
beta the big a will reportedly increase
the speed of its a 8 chip to 2 gigahertz
faster from the iPhone 5s is one
point three gigahertz and the iPad Air's
1.7 gigahertz a7 processor the chip will
keep the same 64-bit dual core
architecture even if the competition is
using quad core chips the reasoning
behind this is because Apple uses a
custom design chip optimized for iOS and
the a7 more than delivered on
performance compared to other phones all
right onto the i watch watch Taiwan's
economic Daily News says Apple is now
planning to launch three versions of the
iWatch in the third quarter of this year
a 1.6 inch model and to 1.8 inch models
with a high-end version of the larger
size coming with a sapphire display now
you remember that same one was
unscratched bilang before many bending
reports and rumors still point to an
October announcement with a possible
November release date and the 12.9 inch
iPad pro rumor has been resurrected
analyst ming-chi kuo says the big screen
iPad will be made official this year as
well I'll write a report by the
washington post says the ipad may be the
cause of unexplained rashes in children
after the Pediatrics Medical Journal
focused on an 11 year old boy who
developed a rash that would not respond
to conventional treatment his skin
tested positive for nickel and the
doctors traced it back to the iPad he
had been using for the past six months
and the iPad tested positive for nickel
as well that's a bad apple now they put
a smart case on his iPad and his rash
subsided but that can explain this a big
red rash that I have on my inner thigh
it's it's actually right here like all
in here now Apple responded saying their
products met the strict standards and
nickel allergies appear to be on the
rise but I use my iPad against my bare
skin all the time especially in my lap
see maybe having a plastic iPhone isn't
that bad and I'll take everything bad
back that I said about the iphone 5c we
sit in here Apple's supposed to be the
leader for innovation and we're here
talking about plastic and do you guys
want another bad apple because I have
one more this week's not app of the week
goes to Kim Kardashian's Hollywood game
so for the sake of report
I tried this out for you and you create
yourself you make like an avatar and Kim
Kardashian becomes like you're much
better-looking Yoda to guide you into
becoming a star you can do the red
carpet event and go to boutiques and
clubs and flirt and you can be a model
or a fashion designer or a list movie
star and did I mention you can flirt now
the game is free but it really sucks you
in because you need these things called
k stars that you can buy with your own
money unless you want to wait around
doing photo shoots and jobs to earn k
stars and who wants to do that holy crap
did i just say all that this game is
horrible the only thing that's accurate
here is that you have the same chance of
being a big-time celebrity with no
talent whatsoever except it's on your
tablet and that's a big bad apple do not
download this game because I just did it
for you all right we'll be back next
week with our e-mail episode in again
you can send me your asking me anything
questions to the apple byte at cnet com
or tweet me up Brian Tom because guess
where I'm going on vacation it's this
horrible tropical island called Hawaii
so thanks so much for watching and we'll
see you guys next time on another bite
of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
