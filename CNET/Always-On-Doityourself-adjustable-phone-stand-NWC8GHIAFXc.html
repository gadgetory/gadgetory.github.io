called boomba bean it's a flexible phone
stand for Android and iPhone and here's
the thing though first of all I'm
worried that this stand will eventually
damage your phone's charging port since
it puts all that pressure on it and
second of all it's 40 bucks so I put my
engineering cap on and I came up with my
own version that's less than $10 and I
call it ya Bovina so without further ado
let's get started here's what you'll
need you'll need a gooseneck lamp you
can find one another thrift store you'll
need a set of pliers you'll need some
contact cement scissors a suction cup
medium sized and some sticky belts okay
the first thing we need to do is
disassemble this lamp so turn it upside
down and come most lamps you should be
able to peel this part dock and expose
the wiring so now what we need to do is
pinch these wire connectors and all
we're doing right now is opening them up
so they can be removed you should be
able to slide them right off and once
you're done with that untie the power
cord and it should pull it right out and
now we'll put the belt back on and work
on the top we need to remove the head so
obviously let's take out the bowl but
save that for something else and here's
what you need to do there will usually
be a nut holding the neck of the lamp
and the head together so with your
pliers hang on to that nut and play it
with one hand and twist with the other
the head of the lamp should screw right
off
soon as its unscrewed you can just pull
the head out and remove the nut you want
to keep that Annette will need it in a
minute comes to wiring and attached to
that is a nut and a washer we don't need
the washer will keep the nut and now
we're ready to assemble level V now so
take that nut and screw it on so that
it's just flush with that part right
there so make sure your suction cup is
clean
grab your contact cement or any
heavy-duty adhesive would work here and
what you'll need to do a little muscle
is brush on a thin layer of this
adhesive right here
and a thin layer on to the suction cup
okay the way this stuff works is that
you need to let it sit for about 15
minutes until it's glossy and then after
it's set for a bit you put the two
together and they'll instantly it here
so I'll be back in about 15 minutes all
right we're back and it looks like these
two are ready to get together so I'll do
is take the suction cup and adherence
and you shouldn't really have to hold it
here it should bond immediately if you
waited long enough
okay they've bonded and the last thing I
want to do to clean this up a bit is
wrap some filter on the neck so I got
this sticker felt it has a sticky side
so I'll just cut out a strip long enough
to cover those parts
get a little arts and craftsy here
alright so I just and that's right here
and now it looks pro see how good does
that look
alright our stand is ready to go but now
we have to put it to the test so I'll
grab a couple phones I've got an iPhone
and an s3 and I want to show you just
how awesome the stand is alright stick
it on did it here's perfectly to the
suction cup and check it out it's not
going anywhere
so I can put this next to my computer
screen and have all of my screens
aligned you can use this thing for
FaceTime Skype taking self-portraits it
really comes in handy and for less than
10 bucks it's definitely worth it now if
you want to kick it up a notch and make
it more like the une boo bean that also
charges your phone you can find a
gooseneck lamp that has a wide enough
neck so that you can drop that USB cord
down the neck and also charge your phone
while it's on the stand all right I want
to see what you do with this DIY project
so tweet me your photos on Twitter and
send your suggestions to always on at
