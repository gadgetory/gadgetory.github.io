event and we're taking a look at the two
new colors in the collection this is the
jet-black iPhone 7 and this is the matte
black regular black iPhone 7 plus and
we're going to take a closer look
particularly this one which seems to be
a fingerprint magnet but other than that
it looks really nice as you can see it
almost looks like it has a completely
uniform body you can slightly detect the
ridge over here where the actual screen
begins and the back cover ends but as I
mentioned before this is going to be a
huge issue in keeping your phone clean
as you can see here the the new camera
but it looks pretty elegant if you can
keep your finger prints off of it now
let's take a look at the plus model
obviously the dual camera is the first
thing you'll notice about the new matte
black finish which replaces the space
gray which we had before also you can
see that the antennas have now moved
positioned there now on the border of
the actual phone which is also a nice
and welcome change and lastly let's take
a look at the biggest design change of
all which is the removal of the
headphone jack you now have two stereo
speakers on the bottom and sorry I
forgot one more the home button the home
button actually has haptic feedback so I
can feel it but it doesn't actually
click or go down so it will detect the
pressure and serve an actual phone as an
actual home button
Apple may be prepping us for the removal
of the home button in the 2017 model and
that's it for now but for more details
make sure to check out our full coverage
