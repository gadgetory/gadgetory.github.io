mountain lion for mac there's a really
cool feature called AirPlay Mirroring
where you can show what's on your
desktop on a big screen TV hooked up to
Apple TV let me show you how airplay
mirroring is something you might use
when you want to show your work at a
meeting show your photos to your family
watch video and more but on an Apple TV
connected to the big screen you start by
making sure you're on the same network
as your Apple TV then look for the
square shaped icon in your menu bar
remember it will only show up if you're
on the same Wi-Fi network before we get
started we've heard about some people
having issues with audio but there's a
really quick fix obviously you'll want
to make sure the volume is up on both
devices but if you're still having
trouble going to the Apple menu to open
system preferences choose sound then
under the output tab make sure apple TV
is selected now you should be able to
hear audio coming from your TV sound
system no matter what you're showing now
that everything is on and ready to go
for a look at the desktop choose the
Apple TV from the drop-down menu one
great use for airplay mirroring is
photos when you want to show the room
which you have on your laptop open
iphoto and simply start the slideshow
and go fullscreen piece of cake next
let's try some video obviously with
Apple TV you already have connections to
youtube and netflix so there's not much
point in showing those here but what
about hulu this is important because
even though you already could use
airplay on an iphone or ipad running iOS
5 you couldn't show flash because as we
all know iOS doesn't do flash no problem
with AirPlay Mirroring just start up a
show or movie and hulu set to full
screen and it looks great same with
Comedy Central another flesh site no
problem there overall AirPlay Mirroring
is one of the greatest new features in
mountain lion especially for its ability
to show flash movie sites that's it for
this how-to I'm Jason target for cnet
