the line for Jeep
this ain't no CJ let's drive the 2014
Jeep Grand Cherokee summit and check the
tech you can spot a 2014 Grand Cherokee
by the face revised rather notably but
beyond that the Grand Cherokee carries
on as something of the American Land
Rover big clean and bold without a lot
of that world war 2 bric-a-brac that
doesn't make a lot of sense to buyers
under 40 anymore except for some little
tiny since 1941 call-outs you'll find on
the headlights and the steering wheel
they just can't help themselves now
right as you get inside this guy you
realize it's about as spacious as you
thought it was going to be as you
approached its bulkiness walking to it
plenty of good Headroom and I'm not even
nearly at the bottom of the seat travel
as you can see this isn't the CJ Jeep of
back in the day this has become the
biggest bushwa rock crawler in the
market but they're meant to be luxurious
that's what Grand Cherokees do in the
Jeep lineup let's get right to our
center stack technology this is what you
probably notice right off the bat in
this very nicely almost - nicely
appointed cabin this is a Garmin
oriented nav system to begin with you
recognize that right away because it has
the familiar where - that's Garmin
language it's rated as one of the
easiest to use in the entire auto
industry once you do get your navigation
set or just browsing the map it's one of
the nicer looking ones street names are
always quite legible as are the legends
for traffic and such or direction of
street it's a little doughy and a little
bit soft once you do min well enough you
can read it very well onto the media now
AM and FM radio both have HD radio and
it's well documented here you've got an
HD button indicator there on the right
and once you get into the FM HD where
you often will find secondary or even
tertiary stations it's very easy to
bounce between them you just hit next
and it goes from HD 1 to HD 2 Sirius XM
of course satellite radio standard on
this car as well does a really nice job
of calling out that particular kind of
media with good channel art great meta
tags and they use all the real estate I
almost rarely see a station name or a
title that has to rotate or go
you know piece by piece now like
old-school thinking they still put media
under a separate bucket and that's where
you'll find your iPod connection SD card
is one you're probably not going to use
so often but again meta and album art do
a good job as good as you did on the
card and of course bluetooth streaming
with meta tag information again you've
also got an aux jack and by the way all
that stuff lives down here in this bin
in the front in the back there are two
more USB Jack's but don't get excited
those are not for media those are USB
charging jacks fewer technology touches
I want to call your attention to four we
go to the hood
interesting very electronic very modern
very non Jeep to be honest shifter down
here that controls the 8-speed automatic
now down here are your drivetrain
control systems and what's a fairly
ambitious and sophisticated
undercarriage because we have the four
wheel drive version not all of these are
this is honestly kind of taken out of a
page from Land Rover that had this thing
pretty early on but you just rotate then
up and it does all the thinking for you
for setting up how the four-wheel drive
works from snow to sand to let it figure
out as conditions change and then we
have mud and rock you also see how the
air suspension has different ride
heights you can invoke those if you want
in fact the levels go from entry exit
which the car only does when it's parked
to arrow for being on the highway to
off-road one an off road to high and
higher and then you can push it into
four-wheel drive low right here that by
the way is even lower than it used to be
on the Grand Cherokee now a forty four
to one low range ratio super crawl on
that guy and you've also got descent
control right here to get down a hill
using its smarts and not your foot last
bit of cool tech in this cabin is the
center display on the instrument panel
notice we've got attack on the left temp
and fuel gauges on the right those are
all real gauges mechanical but in the
middle there is an LCD as is current
fashion on higher trim cars you connect
apps now not a lot going on here yet
you've got Bing search a bunch of remote
telematics you can do from your
smartphone and a hotspot which functions
as proof that car makers want a piece of
the mobile bandwidth explosion it cost
anywhere from 10 bucks a day to 35 bucks
a month to activate the jeeps built-in
hotspot and when you do it's only 3G
now the first thing I noticed when I get
in the engine bay without reading a
single speck is that I know there's a
Hemi v-8 option because you got about
enough room in front of this v6 to put
one of those micro-apartments they're
doing these days so yes you can get two
more cylinders on the front that's
another video we have the 3.6 liter
variable valve train v6 one of their
Pentastar motors this guy doesn't do any
particular trickery but delivers 290
horsepower 260 foot-pounds of torque
good enough to move this basically five
thousand pound vehicle up to 60 in about
seven and a half seconds while
delivering that bad
17:24 MPG in 4x4 trim what's also
interesting to me is there's a diesel a
turbo diesel option for the first time
on this guy it's an Italian motor
sourced by you know the parent company
of Chrysler Fiat but it adds $5,000 to
the sticker price even though it gets up
to 30 on the highway
I couldn't earn that back in my lifetime
now around town where you're gonna spend
99% of your time in this Jeep the
driving is it is a truck you don't
forget that between the kind of numb
throttle response the bouncy Jhansi ride
and the thing you don't find anymore on
a lot of vehicles which is high profile
tires relatively so this is like driving
one of those foam pillows power is great
this is a really nice v6 engine and it
comes on really well but it's blanketed
in a bunch of other BS that just tends
to mute its responses sport mode does
wonders to cure a lot of that but it's
actually too high-strung for most
drivers to use every day it's it holds
the gear a really long time and it's
going to piss you off because it's just
too much noise and too much worrying
going on unless you're really into it
and then the suspension lets you down so
there's no happy medium in this thing
now we have adaptive cruise control
which also has a forward collision
warning which will get in there and
mitigate the crash you activate that
just by turning on cruise and then you
have these two buttons here that rather
cartoon Allah show you distance greater
or distance less and if I set this right
here and I set my speed and I set my
distance it seems to be very well
reading the road in front of me but I
got to tell you in the end driving this
Grand Cherokee I just feel like I took a
nice off-road vehicle and I suburban
eyes dit too much it's been defamed
maybe that's just me but I think an
off-road vehicle with this kind of
credentials should be a little more pure
instead of swaddled in all this stuff
but this is America who am i kidding
juniper Grand Cherokee CNET style is
pretty easy just bring 52 gram you order
the summit trim level that we have at
about 49,000 and then add four-wheel
drive for 3,000 more skip nonsense like
the optional backseat blu-ray system and
tell your kids to just roll down the
window that thing out there is called a
tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
