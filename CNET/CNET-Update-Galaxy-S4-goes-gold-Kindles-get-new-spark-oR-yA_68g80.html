kindles but not gold Kindles I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update Gold
seems to be the new smartphone trend the
gold iPhone 5s is a popular model and
now it looks like Samsung is going to
sell a gold galaxy s4 Samsung's Middle
East Twitter and Facebook accounts
posted photos of the galaxy s4 with a
gold back plate and the front plate
around the screen comes in either pink
or brown we don't even know the price or
even if this will be coming to America
or other countries of course if you want
your phone in real 24 karat gold there's
always gold genie com the website is
selling an actual gold iPhone 5s for
under two thousand nine hundred dollars
but if that's too pricey the real gold
HTC One is a deal at just over two
thousand five hundred dollars and if you
think gold is a strange trend how about
curved screens Samsung's already on it
and plans to show off a smartphone with
a curved display in October an executive
of Samsung shared the news with Reuters
indicating that the curved smartphone
screen will be introduced first in South
Korea now Samsung has shown off concepts
for flexible screen back in January we
just never saw it in a smartphone yet
and here's some more practical tech
amazon just came out with new versions
of the Kindle Fire color tablets this
third-generation lineup begins with the
kindle fire HD it's got the same innards
as last year but with a new outside
design and it starts at one hundred and
thirty dollars the more improved version
is the kindle fire HDX it comes in a 7
inch screen starting at two hundred and
thirty dollars and the 8.9 inch version
starts at three hundred and eighty
dollars the HDX models have a higher
resolution display and each have
top-of-the-line processors which means
they'll be great for gaming other than
size the only other difference between
the HDX models is that only the larger
8.9 has a back camera the rest just have
front-facing cameras there's new
software to these tablets will have a
mayday button that you can press to get
tech support at any time
amazon prime videos can now be
downloaded ahead of time if you're
traveling without an internet connection
and you can't stream it and x-ray is now
available for music so you can follow
along with the lyrics kind of like
karaoke or you could just find out what
song is playing in a movie or TV show
amazon is taking pre-orders now but the
shipping times are all spread out first
comes the regular fire HD that's next
week then the HDX 7 inch arrives October
18th and the larger HDX 8.9 begins
shipping november seventh that's your
