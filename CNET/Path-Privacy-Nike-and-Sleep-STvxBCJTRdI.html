com here at South by Southwest 2012
we're in our fabulous second market
recovery lounge where we have just given
Dave more in the CEO path a nice big cup
of blue bottle coffee it's the best idea
I've seen yet at South by so thank you
it's like survival it's survival
technique yeah Southside does that to
you so I'm hurt you guys brought the San
Francisco coffee out here so let's back
all the way up for the people who don't
know what rap is there may not be that
many but you never know yep what is the
deal with that so if path we are
creating sort of a modern journal then
the idea is that you sort of capture the
experiences and special moments in your
life and then you can share them with
your close friends and family so we're
very focused on family and making it a
very intimate place a very trusted place
to connect with less people not more and
share more often and you do have some
interoperability widow Facebook yep yeah
we interrupt really well actually with
Facebook Twitter Foursquare and tumblr
so you have a new release which adds
kind of some cool new features music
match I don't think we've said that
encryption of user data yep privacy is
kind of unfortunately yeah no big deal
you seem to go together yep um
encryption is coming later yeah so you
know our next release so this is two dot
one we're doing a couple of two dot one
to two releases but when we went through
this interesting situation where we
found that users you know wanted us to
take a different approach to how we help
them find their friends I'm Pat and
what's been interesting is that people
basically much more interested in how
applications work on their mobile phones
I think much more so even than the world
of computers in the web so initially you
were not uploading or story
user data before you started uploading
the address books what made you decide I
think it depends on which type of data
you're talking about yeah with with
paths and we think of privacy we think
of this experience we've created for
people you know we've created this
experience where only you can contribute
to your path when you post whether it's
a thought or a photo to path we use SSL
to transmit the data we store it you
know using very advanced database
technology we use mom go for everything
how long do you store address book
information we actually store it in
perpetuity now but the opposite so if
you deactivate your account is that
information deleted yeah so we offer
both deactivation and deletion so one of
the things from working at Facebook for
years that I found it where the we found
I should say is that users sometimes
last to deactivate their account
sometimes they'll ask to delete it
sometimes they want it back after it's
been deleted so we offer to two step
which is a really important thing to
offer for social systems I think because
there's a I'll tell you we've already
had people that asked to delete and then
wanted it back and so offering the two
step is really important I think so the
first step just like to actually write
deactivate means you know you deactivate
it that you can get it back deletion
means the data is gone you're gonna have
to start over so but I think it's
important to offer the user control and
do both so what happened to I'm just
curious about this you said that you
deleted the user data from address books
you waiting for but if those people are
active users or they then kind of
grandfathered into like a super private
experience or did you go back then and
asked them if they wanted to reupload we
just went back in and asked them to if
they wanted to reupload so all of the
data that we had prior we deleted it was
pretty interesting watching the number
go to zero and but now you know we've
had a large large number large
percentage of the users have chosen to
opt in so I think it's I think that's a
good thing were you surprised to
discover I mean I think you know you
talked about the attitude toward the
mobile usage and I think that phone is
it really it's an intimate device yes
were you surprised though at because it
seemed like it kind of you became the
poster for it but you've said many times
a lot of other apps do this I don't know
if I was surprised i think the intensity
was it was obviously very intense but
you know the reality is that mobile is a
pretty new thing you know it's only been
a couple of years into some of the more
advanced social experiences that have
been created you know i mean us and
Instagram and Foursquare and a lot of
these experiences are two to three years
old if at most and so privacy in a
mobile context i think is still
something that there needs to be a lot
of education around a lot of interesting
sort of conversations around one of the
best practices what are the one of the
ways that consumers want this to be
handled and i think also there's a
genuine interest amongst consumers
around how are these applications built
I know do you think one of the things
that's kicked off a little bit among the
technarch journalism community
was a discussion of whether there is a
culture of respecting user privacy in
Silicon Valley and because there's a
natural tension possibly between the
data collection that's necessary to
create the experience that you want and
the users sense of their own privacy do
you think app developers are habitually
kind of creating apps that that don't
necessarily put privacy first most
people doing the most sophisticated
social experiences certainly put privacy
first I think the challenge comes when
you are developing a new experience or a
new social context right so for us we're
developing this new context which I
actually think hasn't existed on the
internet yet where you know it's an
intensely personal sharing experience
it's meant to be very private it's meant
to be a place where you can share
thoughts which you might not share at
other places I think you end up when
you're developing a social experience
especially you end up in this situation
where you're both defining social norms
and sort of trying to figure out where
they are and what consumers want and are
comfortable if all sort of in real time
and so I think the best thing that you
can do is be very transparent about what
you're trying to do and you know I think
if you look at you know any of the big
apps the facebooks the Foursquare of the
instagrams everyone is trying to build
wonderful experiences for people and I
don't think anyone has a has a you know
direct disrespect for anybody's privacy
it's it's mostly that we're all just
innovating and trying to create new
experiences so you have a new
partnership just announced it stopped by
with Nike tell us what is next
the first thing that we're releasing is
an integration with the 90 plus running
application and we're doing some fun
unique things wear when you go out for a
run we update your path in a very
contextual way saying dave is going for
a run through the rain in austin and
then your friends can respond to that
and when they do respond you get tears
in your headphones really yeah and then
when the run is over we update your path
with a beautiful map which shows the the
route of your ride your fastest pace and
it actually shows the phases of your
friends along the run as they cheered
you on so that's the first thing the
second thing we're rolling out in a
couple of weeks is integration with the
Nike FuelBand so the FuelBand is a new
new gadget new device wearable computer
that nike just released just a couple of
weeks ago actually which basically
tracks your everyday activity the number
of steps that you take the amount of
time that you're active like that up
yeah and it translates it into what they
call a fuel score I gotta asked you
before I let you go it's a nice sleep
thing I mean I'm weirdly addicted to the
sleep thing but like where did that come
from that's a big part of people's day
and there's this clear trend towards
capturing more data about sleep and so
we sort of just put a tiny you know
different tone or water there around you
know building this kind of beautiful
experience for going to sleep and we
added some utility to it so that it
turns off the notifications and it puts
the application to sleep it also sort of
tells you how long you've been asleep
and we're going to do some fun things
with visualizations around it in the
future but it makes it so that you know
as we work with more companies in the
health space whether its jaw bone or
other people that are interested in
sleep we can that'll become a big big
piece of it and the good news is is that
it's actually the third most popular
type of content on top I really like at
first I saw it and I was like really i'm
gonna tell it i'm asleep I tell him
sleep all the time by kid stuff and so I
realized just doesn't like a feature
suggestion you need a nap word yeah we
hear that we do need a nap but like
nagging me about how I only got an hour
of sleep like that was a great now that
was go down what we'll do we'll do the
nap future this career alright I
appreciate ya i will good luck itself i
sell you thanks for coming to talk to us
