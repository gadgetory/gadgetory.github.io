a very large all-in-one computer it's
the Visio CA 20 70 b1 now it looks like
the desktop PC market has pretty much
boiled down to all-in-ones for the most
part these big all containing monitors
with slight basses your IMAX have them
your Dells have them Vizio has them
Vizio came out with this last year and
it's a pretty attractive product now
it's not a super budget model like you
might think it's actually priced in the
middle tier compared to other computers
like it this is the high-end version
Nvidia the invisi O's line there's a 24
inch and this 27-inch starts at 1549 for
a set of configurations that includes a
quad core Core i7 processor now we get
to that in a moment
eight gigs of ram a one terabyte hard
drive and this big bright 1920 by 1080
display with touch now it's a pretty
nice display and as vibrant especially
compared to its 24 inch cousin which I
didn't think was quite as bright or as
zippy now is about that processor it's
faster than your average in this price
range but keep in mind that Intel now
has fourth generation Core iSeries
processors that are going to be popping
up in pcs all over the place
one will it show up in particular
computers we don't know but pretty soon
so when will you see a version with a
faster processor it might be sooner or
later you might want to hold out for
that but the value package here is still
pretty solid and it does have a couple
of TV related features that you might
like one is that it comes packaged with
an IR remote there are also two HDMI
inputs on the back so if you like using
your computer as a television in your
dorm or wherever so that's nice but
there's not a lot else here in the
equation that's really gonna reach out
and grab you particularly there's no
higher end graphics like nvidia AMD
gaming graphics and there's no optical
drive but most of these pcs don't have
optical drives at this point it's a
solid value and if I were to pick a
Vizio product I probably pick the one at
the top end because of the fact you're
not paying that much more the
entry-level ones in the 24 inch actually
are 1279 which is not that big a dip in
value now yes there's a touchscreen but
Vizio also packages a wireless keyboard
a trackpad that come in the box it's a
nice touch of a trackpad versus a mouse
because I kind of prefer that and if
you're using it on a sofa it's a lot
easier to use a trackpad than reach for
some other device one no annoying slash
nice thing that comes in the box and
I'll explain why I say that is this it
is actually a subwoofer that doubles as
the power brick now it does give nicer
sound but you're dealing with another
box that you have to connect to as
opposed to just taking your cable and
plugging it right into the wall I don't
like having that many things on my desk
but if you really love having a
subwoofer maybe you'll be happy
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
Vizio 27 tb1 that is currently available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
