headphone from bose the sound liek
bluetooth on ear which retails for 249
95 and comes in two colors at launch
black and white hi I'm David car noise
and as you can see here these guys look
similar to boses sound true on your
wired headphones but they aren't quite
as compact and don't fold flat in their
carrying case so the overall package is
bigger still at 5.4 ounces or 150 2.6
grams
these are quite like for a bluetooth
headphone and like they're wired
siblings quite comfortable to wear they
fit snugly on your head but it's worth
mentioning that they will move around a
bit if you shake your head vigorously or
jump up and down they're not really
meant for running but you can certainly
use them at the gym while you're lifting
or doing lighter cardiovascular exercise
I wouldn't sweat on them too much though
as for features the remote control
buttons are well placed on the right ear
cup and answer calls you tap the middle
control button which also allows you to
skip tracks forward and back when you're
playing music there's a new two-way
microphone system and something Bose
calls adaptive audio adjustment
technology which automatically changes
volume based on speech level and ambient
noise whatever does it does well because
I had no problem making calls on the
noisy streets of New York I also had no
problem pairing the headphones with both
iOS and Android devices and experienced
a minimum of wireless hiccups along with
the carrying case you get a cable for
using the headphones in Wired mode plus
a micro USB charging cable battery life
is rated at 52 hours which is pretty
decent as for the sound this is one of
the best Bluetooth headphones I've heard
and at the moment anyway it's arguably
the best on your wireless headphone I
can't say it sounds as good as certain
wired on ear headphones in this price
class such as the bear dynamic t51p but
for a bluetooth headphone it sounds
pretty natural was strong but not
overpowering bass and good clarity you
get a touch of what we call Bluetooth
artifacting but average listeners
probably won't hear any of that
as I said this headphone costs two
hundred and forty nine ninety-five and
that's pretty pricey but it does cost
significantly less than the popular
Beats Studio woloson over the ear model
the beats gives you a bit more sound
isolation has active noise cancellation
and arguably sounds slightly better
however this Bose is a lighter more
compact headphone that travels better
and that makes it a very compelling
choice in the growing market of premium
bluetooth headphones I'm David Carr
noise thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
