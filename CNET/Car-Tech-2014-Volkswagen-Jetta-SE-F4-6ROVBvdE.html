always seemed to try and look like more
than they are the Jetta is a refreshing
departure its austere it's German it's
solid but it's not fancy and glitzy
we're gonna prove it now as we drive the
2014 Jetta se with an all-new motor and
check your tech I knew after about 10
minutes in this car when I first took it
out this was going to be a video about
the simplicity of the Jetta and how it
excels so well when it's not trimmed up
I'm not a huge fan of Volkswagen
technology in the cabin it tends to be
kind of dull their audio systems don't
impress me things of that nature but the
essential cabin structure the way this
car is laid out it's sort of German
nature makes it great at its core and
that's how I'd order a Jetta I also like
the fact that it's a handsome cabin not
a fancy cabin too many cars in this
class tend to lay on the plastic chrome
and the plaster wood and all kinds of
swoopy designs to draw your eye away
from the fact that it's an inexpensive
car well it's an inexpensive car there's
no reason to make apologies for that if
it does what it does well now as I
mentioned you don't pay a lot for a
Jetta se but you do pay one penalty it
doesn't look like much there's not much
trim at this trim level it looks like
just one big blob of paint on wheels if
you go a little higher in their
hierarchy you do pick up things like fog
lights that do wonders for the face and
you can option this guy up with a little
simple little trim spoiler on the trunk
lid sounds silly but it does wonders for
that sad little rump and for reasons
that are lost on me the connectivity
package that we have includes alloy
wheels go figure
ah inside is an oasis of yesterday this
car being simply trimmed has no stuff
that has a learning curve you've got a
radio it was funny when I told Antoine I
was gonna take this car out and get
ready to review what he says enjoy the
am/fm he wasn't kidding
am/fm radio no HD satellite radio right
there
media brings you up bluetooth streaming
or my iPod which is here in the console
and
sit this is a throwback to the way cars
used to be but it's also refreshing to
see a head unit that is so robust and
simple that you don't need to think
about it and be distracted while using
it simple gauge cluster goes with it as
well tach speedo and a simple fuel gate
I don't think it even has a temperature
gauge I'm sure you'll get an A you light
when the things melting down but beyond
that this is what you see one screw up
here ergonomically though when you want
to page through the various odometers
you have to pass through every time
setting the clock look at that I have to
set the hour then the minute then I can
get to odo 102 and DTE I have to be
missing something but I don't think I am
similar on the climate controls this is
a vehicle that has no automatic
temperature control on it you simply set
a fan speed and ballpark hot or cold we
have the 5-speed manual gearbox an
automatic is available we'll talk about
that in a moment
and once we get on the road we're gonna
see this is actually a pretty nice
shifter for a car that's at a very
modest price the bigger theme on this
vehicle aside from its simplicity is
that it's got a nice clean design in
here everything is very direct that may
be surprising to you because normally
when I get a VW head unit that has
navigation I'm going the other way it's
not direct it's poorly designed it's
just plain ugly this is actually the way
VW head units do best now where this car
gets its with connectivity label is
largely these buttons up here I wrench
an SOS this is kind of an OnStar rig to
be honest not much more than that it's
not like a Lexus enform or something
where you get this whole concierge thing
where they go you know find your theater
tickets or a movie recommendation
instead this is relatively sort of
survivalist type stuff they can tell you
where your car is unlock the doors send
emergency roadside assistance or you can
push the red button if you're in a real
panic situation connecting to the
information center
we've all cornices with Margie
how can I dismiss you today the other
part of connectivity is over here that
you have bluetooth streaming audio so
put those all together and that's what
makes this an SE with connectivity now
believe it or not under the hood of our
new Jetta is actually a new engine and
this is an interesting story a VW
typically on these cars on the
garden-variety would have a two and a
half liter inline five a kind of bizarre
motor that really only Volvo shares an
architecture with I mean who doesn't
five cylinder in line these days or
anytime but they've gotten away from
that now which is kind of good most
reviewers thought it was kind of an
agricultural motor here is a downsized
version of their 2.0 turbo which a lot
of folks think is a great engine 1.8
liter in this case sitting sidesaddle
turbocharged as I mentioned and has
direct injection what they call FSI add
the turbo you get TSI that's their
nomenclature 170 horse 184 foot-pounds
of torque pretty good numbers gets this
roughly three thousand pound car to 60
in seven point three seconds while
delivering 26 36 mpg also nice numbers
all around not stunning on the zero to
60 but the rest is pretty good now we're
talking about the manual transmission
for those zero to sixty numbers and mpg
you take a bit of a haircut on both if
you get the automatic so I don't
recommend it unless you don't know how
to drive something with a clutch
okay now underway this car has got an
interesting power curve so when I get
started I'm going to feel it like I do
with every gear change you start off
with an initial dead spot the initial
tip in is there because the turbos got
to spool up they've not ironed that out
like you might find on a much pricier
car but once you get past the initial
spool up and like I say it's in almost
every gear or transition you got to
bring it up but then you get this nice
long fat fan to power that I really
enjoy driving so it's a trade off and
certainly part of the low displacement
and high fuel economy of this engine the
transmission and clutch engagement is
quite good it's a little bit vague on
the gate the gears are very close
together sort of left to right I'd like
a little better spacing there but that
makes for a nice short throw at least
laterally overall it's a nice gearbox
combination a nice clutch feel the ride
quality is really good in this car it is
not harsh but it's also not sloppy it's
biased a little bit more toward comfort
than the other Jettas higher up that
have a sports suspension but I could
live with this suspension all day long
this is a really nice bias for everyday
driving and the engine note is very
smooth it's what you're not hearing in
this video right now is any kind of a
coffee grinder with nuts and bolts
thrown in it sound that I hear on a lot
of cheap cars this one's really smoothed
out better than that last two and a half
litre five which had some discordant
notes to it
all-in-all what you're finding in this
car is a very nice
deme German driving experience this is
what Volkswagen used to do so well and
is doing well again now if you're
looking for the sporty kind of VW that
you had when you had your 80s rabbit
that's not here remember they are
chasing the market that is owned by
civic by focus by the Hyundai products
and Kia's and many others that are that
are going after a mainstream driver so
they've they've sort of dfangs some of
the handling and bias of comfort okay
let's price our jetta SC not bottom of
the line but close to it it's going to
run you about nineteen seven out the
door with destination if you want to
have an automatic the six-speed
Tiptronic civ ailable for eleven hundred
dollars I wouldn't do it then you've got
another 1500 or so that adds the
connectivity trim level here and
incongruously alloy wheels so about 21 -
all in for this guy
and that's CNET style but not
really because you can't load up more
tech options on an SC you've got to go
buy a higher trip level car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
