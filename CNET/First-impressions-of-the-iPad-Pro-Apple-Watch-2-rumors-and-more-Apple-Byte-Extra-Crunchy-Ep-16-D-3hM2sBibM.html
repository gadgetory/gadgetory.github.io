to the apple byte extra crunchy episode
15 we're doing this remotely we're doing
this back and forth and you know we
wanted to just jump right into it
there's so much stuff going on but again

leave a voicemail 1 800 61 62 63 eight

will play other people's comments on the
show later on today right yes we have
quite a bit of voicemails so thanks for
calling us guys yeah we love it we love
it okay let's jump in till we know that
it is ipad pro week the ipad pro went on
sale online on wednesday people are able
to pick some of them up in person you
know I've been talking about the ipad
pro for years now like i really wish i
could be there with Beecham just like a
rub it against i want to touch it I
haven't I haven't even felt wondered
held one yet you can't even see this but
right now I'm just doing like ipad feel
my face no you can't people listening
they can't even see this ipad feel much
just looks like a giant iphone oh look
it look how big this is dude look it I
can I can't put this in my pocket the
thing is I gotta say though um right now
just my initial thoughts I don't have
all the accessories for it we'll talk
about that in a second but you know as a
larger iPad in a media consumption
device this thing is awesome like on the
plane the first thing I like set it up
do next to me was like
whoa what he's like is that a big iPad
that he couldn't stop looking at I was
reading comics it finally feels great
when you you know no matter what
everyone says Oh media content is so
much more immersive yeah because it's a
bigger screen but did you guys just
settle in and the flight and just watch
a film together no I I did play some
videos so I could show it to him and he
was like you know it's one of those like
the bromance like totally showing off to
a guy and the other guys like oh this is
awesome and you guys were vibing and
then like it just it's totally geeky
right but he was digging it I would say
just initial impressions this speakers
on this or awesome i can actually kind
of i'm not saying its work the money to
pay a thousand dollars if you just want
better speakers but you know you can use
this as a standalone i was like playing
a justin bieber's latest album purpose
oh my i can't believe i outed myself yes
said that like not the only one man i
was just talking about it too it's a
good album people don't do it don't get
it twisted and don't knock it unless you
tried it but the best way I could
describe it and Stephens a music guy so
you know he'll he'll be able to get his
take but it's like pop music meets EDM
meets hip hop production and the sound
is fresh and clean and there's at least
ten tracks on that album that are just
sick yeah it's like I'm I'm not I'm
always gonna be an open-minded person
about anything so you know if i like it
i'm just gonna try it i don't even care
everyone people be like I'll Bieber for
reals i'm like no it's it's good okay i
stopped i'm brian tongues justin bieber
review oh yeah we time up yeah yeah yeah
so again really immersive if you like
what the ipad does and you want on a
bigger screen you're going to love this
now the other thing about it though
right apple promoted really the biggest
differentiator about it was that pencil
and that smart keyboard pad but dumb
dumbs at apple i pre-ordered it right
away online but now the pre-orders are
delayed out four to five weeks oh my
gosh okay you might not even get it in
time for christmas dude not only that
beach him even on the first day love
sale for the ipad pro they didn't even
have them in stores that is a bummer so
the key differentiating product that
makes this unique to itself they don't
have either of them how stupid is that
that is very dumb man every
has to wait for the pieces of their iPad
to show up that is so oh my god i can
what do you think that could be what do
you think that could be Beecham I don't
know that could be I'm not prepared with
the sound effect but I think that is a
horrible horrible really bad apple it's
just a disgusting Apple ah i would give
you the fighter games i was searched it
to give you time we should just have a
resident screamer in the podcast i'm
just gonna like get a bunch of screams
together for the next show so um you
know overall though I think as Apple is
promoting it as a laptop replacement
it's not there yet I don't think it it
it just won't be but I'm gonna give it a
go and just use that smart keyboard case
when it comes in for a week straight and
see how I feel about that I'm gonna
force myself to UM the pencils cool I
got a bunch of creative apps on here I'm
not one who's gonna be drawing all the
time but I think this thing has the
biggest potential as a creative device
as long as the apps yet developed for it
properly so uh it's it's honestly really
cool though it's it's pretty badass it's
it it's a head turner only because it's
so damn big right yeah yeah you know
they should make like a comic book cut
like a comic book colouring book where
you have to color in your own comics oh
that would be awesome doing that on your
head I would totally do that honestly I
would totally do that um just others
also to follow up with the ipad pro just
some other tidbits about it they've run
benchmarks on this ARS technica ram
geekbench benchmarks and the results
have shown this thing is a monster okay
the ipad pros a 9 x processor to
dual-core chip outperforms the current
12 inch retina macbook with an intel
core m processor it outperforms a laptop
okay not only that if that's just raw
power but if you're talking about
graphics performance the actual graphics
performance of the ipad pro outperforms
2015 15 inch retina MacBook Pros and
lower so it does a 15-inch MacBook Pro
it out does a 13-inch retina MacBook Pro
all the 2015 models it out does the
surface pro it out does the iPads all
ipads and graphics
it's a beast this thing has so much
power it looks beautiful I know my i
have a macbook pro for work and the
screen just looks amazing I have to
always look at pictures on that so yeah
I'm very excited to see what it looks
like in an ipad pro super super nice um
some other tidbits I came out because we
can't test it but reviewers have said
the actual stylus or the sorry oh my
gosh I just said it the pencil it's not
us it's not the stylus the pencil when
you like have it on a table and you roll
if you just like have it sitting there
it's weighted so that it ends up rolling
into place so that the word pencil shows
up on top oh wow that's funny man that
is so stupid that of everything they're
like yell brandy you know that's comes
from like a marketing person no one else
totally I was like damn it fine I'll do
this crap he's like why do I have to do
this let's not put an eraser on it let's
 eat us oh my god you have to bleep
let's let it roll man this shows the
terrain I can't believe I just said that
they had meetings about that they're
like we have to figure out how this pen
will always show the logo and then some
guys came up with an idea and they
produced it yeah it's pretty bad also I
don't know if you have this video pulled
up or not but did you see the surface
pro vs ipad pro response I did I did um
here we go I got a ricer this is crazy
of course they're not using the same
exact application so it may not
necessarily be completely accurate but
they're both using their notes app and
you can actually see the ipad pro doing
these like smooth quick lines and the
surface pro the lines like are delayed
they're a little more jaggi it's yeah
that they are noticeable when he did
that really fast that was very very
noticeable how fast the ipad pro is
that's cool yeah so glee you know I want
to see this side by side with actually
some apps yeah like the create like the
creative you know drawing app something
like um procreate or Adobe draw I want
people to do that same test but you know
initially it it looks it
was how responsive at least the ipad pro
pen is which is pencil is which is
pretty cool I'm sorry I'm not used to
we've been talking about it as a pencil
and now that it's finally out I'm not
used to calling it a pencil no it
doesn't make sense to be called a pencil
has to be a pen dude it's a stylist yeah
it's a stylist but throughout the the
rubber tip it actually I got a use one
in store and when you do like brush
strokes when you turn it on the side the
actual stroke does get wider so I mean
it's cool it is super cool and did some
cool water color stuff I was like all
right this is pretty neat so I'm the
ipad pro also tim cook you know he's
hyping this up and talking it up he says
he believes and this is again coming
from the CEO of Apple so just know where
he's coming from he says that the ipad
pro will replace notebooks and desktops
yeah i don't know about that um that's
what he thinks i mean sure possibly i
don't know I just when I trying to get
some work done I just need like a laptop
with a keyboard in front of me you know
I can't really get anything done on an
iPad I mean I get what he's trying to
say it's all from your perspective and
if that's what he wants to believe it's
fine but there are certain things that I
even just using this now I have I want
and have to use a laptop to do them to
get them done yeah for sure like that's
just that's just the bottom line so even
you know Excel documents word processing
his his quote was like here we go I
think if you're looking at a pc why
would you buy a pc anymore no really why
would you buy one yes the ipad pro is a
replacement for a notebook or desktop
for many many people they will start
using it and conclude they no longer
need to use anything else other than
their phones do you believe this
statement to be true or false Stephen
Beecham balls balls oh absolutely we'll
find out what happens and how this all
shakes out now since we're talking about
we kind of talked about this on the
Apple by actual video show I thought the
story is fun because we're talking about
products everyone's buying you know the
apple ipad pro 128 gig is actually sold
out in stores right now so they don't
have pencils
they don't have smart keyboard cases and
they're out of a hundred twenty eight
gig ipad pros but if you had a guest did
you see this what's the lowest rated
Apple product in Apple's online store
what do you think it is looking at it
right now and I'm actually I'm pretty
surprised who are suffice yeah i mean i
was thinking it was gonna be like an
ipod or something but yeah it's a hora
you know some pair of headphones but it
is the three-foot lightning cable i
totally agree though i know how useful
is that was only three feet well three
feet is short yeah it's pretty short but
also i was surprised that i looked up
even apples headphones and ear pods and
they were rated higher than the
lightning cables like I've had two
lightning cables pretty much like the
Brugh burr breaks at right at the corner
and then the wires get exposed and they
just pretty much deteriorate pretty
quickly and so I get why because their
stuff just isn't that durable right the
other product it was actually tied so
like that the lightning cable USB to USB
lightning cable and then also the
magsafe power adapter they both had over
1,000 one-star reviews oh yeah i mean my
mind for my my work laptop is frayed
every every Apple cable i have is frayed
and it's what i'm saying i have to put
little pieces of tape around it and this
morning I know it's bragging about my
headphones lasting for a long time but
this morning the right side of my
headphones just stopped working what
after like two two and a half years just
out of nowhere oh my gosh but the head
but the microphone still work so I can
still talk through the microphone but I
just can't hear in 11 year so get it you
need you need to give a you need to give
a one-star rating for that thing man
that's that's what it deserves oh well
well no actually I'm giving I'm giving
the headphones a high rating because
they last me for over two years just
don't morning just a warning a tire
that's told yeah yeah so I have to give
that a good good review a good review ok
I'm also following up on just things
happening around in the Apple space this
is kind of a rumbling that has been
going on but according to The Wall
Street Journal apple and banks are in
talks on a mobile person-to-person
payment service mmm i'm trying to think
what
I haven't heard of anything like this
before um venmo venmo paypal so i
actually heard it was a Bridget Carey
story that Apple is in talks with venmo
I don't know if they're no talks with
venmo directly I mean that that could be
I know they're talking to the banks that
you know basically back these fight
these financial institutions that back
this up I it would be weird for them
here's why I don't think Apple would
even get involved with venmo venmo is
owned by PayPal PayPal makes their money
off of payments I don't see how it
benefits paypal to get scooped up by
Apple and les appels giving them lots
and lots of money you know if they want
venmo to be to support apple pay like as
one of the paint you know as kind of act
like the bank then that makes sense if
they're partnering it that way but I
don't see Apple taking over venmo or
replacing it right yeah yeah and right
now people are using venmo people are
using their mobile banking apps to
exchange money I think Apple pages wants
to be a part of that but quite honestly
they're pretty late to the race I don't
see people all of a sudden you know I
phones were prevalent people are using
Apple pay once in a while I don't know I
don't know if they'd actually start
doing it I found the headline from
Bridget and it is there's a question
mark there Apple talking to venmo ? so
you know it's a big guy I think that's a
click bait headline on it seriously cuz
there's it it's like oh well Apple it's
like really what they're trying to say
is Apple going to get into the mobile
payments game but instead they're like
Apple to acquire venmo it's like come on
come on that's that's clickbait man
you're all it worked we'll see ya
anyways Apple did acquire a patent um it
was granted to them by the US patent
trade office for a transfer of
electronic funds between electronic
devices so that's why there's all this
speculation there's all this rumbling
around it it's going to happen it's it's
not that hard for them to pull this off
and make an agreement with the bank so
we'll see I just don't see them being
able to rise and really take over apple
wants to be the wallet for everyone I
thought Apple pay would actually be
adopted a little more quick
Lee it is being used but it's actually
not being used as much as I saw as I
thought it would be yeah it's very
hit-or-miss like everyone I talked to
you they say they go somewhere and
there's an apple kiosk there to pay with
your Apple pay and then nine times out
of ten just doesn't work yeah the people
working there like we don't know it
doesn't work yet so so you know well
we'll see how it all shakes out this
okay here's another patent that I just
wanted to put this in the show because I
love the title of it you want me you
want me read it for you sure okay so the
story is that Apple has a new pan that
was great published it has not been
granted yet that would actually use
electrodes to dry out wet iPhones like
if you get moisture inside your iPhone
it would actually be able to expel the
water from the speaker and the
microphone cavities by using electric
charges and acoustics on the surface of
like the internals to get that water out
okay this is cool this is super you
sound so crazy to me but here's what the
name of the patent application is okay
liquid expulsion from an orifice Wow the
patent application is for liquid
expulsion from an orifice that could be
anything that could be so many things
that's a very broad patent filing their
course the pan has more details
following that headline I just wanted to
throw it out there but in reality i do
think this would be a great thing the it
might save your phone but Apple has you
know how Apple has that like water
detection sensor so they basically
wouldn't try and get it when you try and
get it repaired they're like oh dude you
got water in it you have to pay this
mount yeah that's redirect yeah that's
not gonna change that right yeah I know
it's not so it might help your phone but
even if it helps it it doesn't mean that
you're still you're still gonna have to
pay that extra money if you took it in
to get repaired anyways I know I want to
hear electrodes and water I just feel
like danger that sounds like dangerous
danger Will Robinson danger totally but
UK I've had the test where they test for
water and they're like oh you got water
in there sorry man you're like no I
didn't on your contract I dude i did in
and then you ache and then everyone
makes
the story I was in the shower with it a
lot I just leave it on my sink and then
they'll be like okay okay i'll give that
I so if you guys face that problem if
you directly dropped your entire phone
in a pool just say you shower with it
and the steam gets to it yeah I'm
putting a bag of rice while you're at it
right do that yes that helps okay some
two quick things software updates let
you guys know about the second TV OS
beta is out and the third iOS and OS 10
betas are out for developers fine-tuning
the current operating systems also Apple
music for android now available in the
Google Play Store Apple promised to make
their music service available on Android
uh when it launched but they didn't say
when you can now go to the Google Play
Store download the app and I do think
this is good for families that are like
mixed use families right not everyone in
a family believe it or not oh yeah they
don't all use Apple devices so it's cool
you might even want to be like give the
gift that keeps giving share your Apple
music account with like a friend or a
buddy who's on Android and maybe maybe
they'll jump over to the dark side I
don't know um this one is something
that's close and dear to our heart in a
movie update Steve Jobs the movie has
been pulled from over 2,000 movie
theaters which is shocking to me because
it looks like the the previews just
looked so good it looks like such a good
movie and how you know I'm shocked that
it's doing so poorly yeah it's a it was
projected to check this out man it was
projected to earn in a debut weekend 15
to 19 million dollars which is which is
you know substantial at least for a
movie like that but at this point in
time it's earned only 16 million so it's
pretty much hit that opening weekend
range but like a month later audiences
are not going to see it so they pulled
it from over 2,000 screens and you can
still go see it it's limited but you and
I have agreed right we're gonna try and
go see this movie this weekend right are
did you were you able to gonna do work
yes I have a babysitter tomorrow night
nice going I'm AMC theater in emeryville
anyone want to join me
there if you're listening practice or
the East Coast feel free I am also going
to be watching it with my baby boo we're
gonna go tomorrow or I think around two
o'clock somewhere in the Greater Los
Angeles area yeah so next week we'll
have our our real review of movie I do
want to let people know that know that a
this movie unfortunately now shares the
same fate as another really popular one
that I personally wanted to see that has
also been pulled over pulled out from
over 2,000 theaters Jem and the
Holograms I had no idea that movie even
came out seriously that's how no there's
no promotion for that movie whatsoever
ok hold on I need a I have I have the
trailer here ok this idea idea look this
up this is how horrible ok this is an
opening weekend movie ok after two weeks
the movie pulled in 2.1 million dollars
oh my gosh it averaged five hundred
seventy dollars per screen good for 15th
place in its opening weekend it's like
50 people per theater maybe dude how do
you know me I don't even I don't even
know why were we why do we need a gem in
the Holograms reboot or a movie anyway I
know the weird thing about is like kids
today don't know who Jim is yeah and
people who used to love Jim Lee cartoon
are not gonna go to a movie theater to
watch that I feel like Hollywood is just
making movies for all the
thirtysomethings now who like grew up in
the 80s you know like oh here's this
other movie that you might like so
they're like they're like hey kids you
guys aren't even watching TV or movies
anyways you're watching your stuff on
the internet so we're gonna peel to the
older demographic yeah secure people
still remember going to movie theaters
so yes just officially Steve Jobs and
Jem and the Holograms share the same
fate so really it's a related story sad
world okay um in a world that needs to
get better and needs to do better and
I'm glad that Apple addresses i wasn't i
wanted to see how the story shook out
before we put in the show
but a lot of people might have seen a
video from the Apple Store no Australia
where an employee told for students
exchange students but they were black
teenagers that they needed to leave the
apple store because actual employees in
the store were concerned that they were
gonna steal stuff there's an actual
video online that was posted I don't
know if we can discuss it and it's
asking they got so hot yeah seriously
had like the reason why I wanted to
bring this up and bring this the light
is first of all Apple address the issue
in a great way obviously we know Apple's
CEO Tim Cook is a gay CEO one of the few
and he is out in the community everyone
knows this so he of course probably
cares about issues of discrimination he
put out a statement that inclusion and
diversity are among Apple's core values
and pretty much we are open to everyone
is a long letter into Apple the actual
store manager on site after she heard
what had happened found who the kids
were went to the principal at their
school and apologized and invited them
back Apple sent out an official apology
that said this does not represent their
values which is a great move the
students they weren't all up in arms
after Apple made the apology they said
that they felt that justice had been
done because the store manager
apologized to them they told their
welcome there any time but to me I just
want to bring this to light because
sometimes people aren't night about this
type of stuff happens every day right it
happens all the time too much too much
and it's like very frustrating sad and
I'm glad though that Apple stepped up
they handle this the right way and a
store manager realize what was going on
and they weren't blind to it and it's
just a good lesson life don't pretend
like this stuff doesn't happen be aware
of it and don't let it happen again and
so you know III
I don't have a we don't have an apple
pie or a kudos to Apple sound effect but
I would give them a I'm gonna clap a
round of applause that's a good way good
way to handle it apples are you oh
you're doing the golf clap I did the
roundoff person oh I 10 round of
applause okay so anyways um good on
Apple for taking care of that Leo did
great 135 is actually the one who
brought it up to my attention on Twitter
but I don't like to just jump into
things and making an immediate
assumption and I'm glad that the story
came out and it was resolved so uh there
you go good on Apple hey let's get the
phone calls yeah all right let's do it
and we have a few voicemails and we're
going to start with this one hi this
essential do not have died 17 will have
a better like discipline may be at
AMOLED or a better pixels per inch do I
know this matter or not I might
basically there are rumors and rumblings
that your answer will be probably uh no
I didn't throw the story because it's
such a small rumor and speculation
there's a lot of things that go out
there but being chic whoa he's the KGI
analyst guy that has broken a lot of
stories in the past way early before
anyone else but he reported last week
that Apple is unlikely to adapt AMOLED
displays for the next gen iphones in the
free and in the foreseeable future but
they still like their TFT LCD display
tech it still is compatible with a 3d
touch technology which to me is still
huge potentially huge and I love 3d
touch i actually miss it on my iPad pro
but the quick answer is that according
to this report and it's the only one and
only claim is that it will not have an
AMOLED display coming anytime soon so
there you go alright and voicemail
number two hello my name is Eric Taylor
I'm from Detroit Michigan I just had a
question about the Apple TV and why do
you guys think there isn't a remote app
with the Apple TV why wasn't one
released you know along with it is it
something that Apple didn't want to do
or will they do in the future
alright thanks and I enjoy you guys you
have a google what's up Aaron from
Detroit thanks for that I think that it
addresses a big thing one of the
Bugaboos that I set out right of the bat
that I gave them a bad apples the fact
that they didn't take the time to make
their iOS remote app compatible and it
just completely doesn't work with a new
Apple TV now the reason or the thinking
behind it that you know I came to is the
fact that the touchpad remote on the
appletv first is like a clickable button
that you can slide your finger around
and navigate it and there really is no
equivalent on the on the iOS app they
they like the idea that anywhere you
press it would be treated like a bun and
if there was one device that is that
would work exactly analogous to the
touch remote that's with the Apple TV it
would really be the iphone success that
has forced touch because you could slide
your finger around it to swipe left and
right but then also you could push the
screen really hard to treat it like a
click on the apple TV if they're holding
out on us they should at least release
it for the iphone 6s so you got the same
experience they would have had to change
the interface a little bit to make it
compatible on current iOS devices
without 3d touch but at the very least
they should have done something and they
didn't so um that's why I think that
they didn't do it you know they oh they
also kind of do this with itunes where
they you know they don't build a remote
right away for the latest itunes version
and they'll build it later you know come
out eventually but they do lag sometimes
on building remotes you know remote apps
for their products I think you know it's
like not I just think at the end of the
day it's not their top priority yeah so
they just like a second look we'll see
if people complain and then we'll let
them know they're oh my you know what
might be cool is if we build a remote
for that like oh yeah okay let's do that
yeah but that'd be a good idea all right
next call I have eight minutes left on
my battery on my laptop okay okay here
we go hey my name is Peter in Arizona I
don't wondering have they said anything
about the Apple watch to is you can have
more features are babes who talked about
it oh come on that's too Apple watch to
rumblings are already out we were gonna
put this in the main rundown but we want
to save it for your call
Apple watch to development is reportedly
underway and targeting the second or
third quarter of 2016 according to a
Chinese media source udn quanta computer
is believed to be the company that will
be the Apple watch manufacturer it's
rumored to have still the same battery
life but a slimmer form factor there
were rumblings that a camera might be
integrated into it that has not been
confirmed but at least from what we know
yeah it it would get me mad just from a
standpoint of like I get it Apple
upgrades devices every year typically I
felt like the Apple watch should be
something that gets upgraded every year
and a half to two this would time it for
around a year and a half time line but
this the Apple watch still just doesn't
do enough yeah it's like such a you know
such a popular everyone was so excited
about it too you'd think they'd put more
time you know get another version out
faster I'm just glad that you know the
reality of the hype versus what it
actually is it's really died down a lot
and people are understanding oh it's
cool i do like how it looks but i don't
how about this a large majority is in
line with me that says that's all right
but i don't do much most people to use
it to check the time and get text
messages most people and they don't like
seriously right that's what they do yeah
i know what does fitness and health and
there's some people that use that way
but most people if you ask them what do
you use your i watch apple watch for i
have checked the time and I check
messages and it looks pretty looks
pretty on my wrist and I spent over six
hundred dollars for that oh yeah oh yeah
all right next next call whoops sorry
everybody I have five is a Brian and
Beecham this is jacob from the Los
Angeles area I just had a question about
the Apple TV so I have the 3rd gen apple
TV I was considering upgrading
proportion but my question was i'm not
sure if i'll upgrade because I the thing
I really like the most is the new remote
so I was wondering if the new remote
work on the older Apple TV thanks love
you guys show by all right all things i
have read and heard is that
a negative your new apple touchpad
remote will not work with the Apple TV
from previous generations the funny
thing is from what I know at least at
this point I don't think they're doing
it yet but I don't think they're selling
replaceable remotes yet I could be wrong
so someone has to correct me but I do
know you can program older remotes to
work with the new Apple TV so it works
in that direction but the direction that
he's looking for to take the new remote
and go back to the ol Apple TV there's
nothing that is that I've seen or heard
thats document that it does work if
people are listening and I'm completely
wrong on this and you can correct me
please let us know that's why this is a
show that involves you guys and makes
you a part of it but that's what I know
up to this point okay is that a bad
apple or is that a okay apple an apple
it's it's a par for the course Apple
that's like there I know by the new
thing you idiot we don't want to go
backwards compatible what does Apple
ever actually done that like never so
that that's just par for the course to
me okay last call and Brian this is
michael calling i had a question
regarding the ipad pro so now for
example the ipad mini 4 i have that one
and i can't open up certain pages on
like web browsers or online manasa do
schoolwork or other things well the ipad
pro be able to support those windows or
stuff that i have to open up online I'm
like I get these weird notifications
they can't support screen resolutions or
it's not supported by this device or
whatever it is random online stuff like
when I either school work or whatever I
do yeah that's my question all right
thanks okay so I don't know this one
hundred percent for sure because i'm not
sure what type of sites what type of
site honey and what type of plugins
there's need to be supported but i do
know that the surface pro 4 because it's
based off of a desktop operating system
and a full desktop class browser it'll
have a better chance
being compatible with almost every kind
of site pop-up plugin again whatever
site you're trying to look at it has a
higher chance to be more compatible to
service pro then the ipad pro because of
the nature of how it acts behaves and
how it's built from the ground up ok so
I'm so the ipad mini doesn't scale up a
lot of web pages that what he's saying I
don't even know exactly what the warning
or alert or you know denial message he's
getting is because I haven't seen it um
I don't surf those sites now I'm messing
with you man I'm messing with you but
yeah ultimately you'll have the best
chance of compatibility with the surface
pro 4 because it is really can be a true
desktop compatible device coordinates
him cook Tim Cook says you'll never need
it again though so um go right ahead on
that ipad know I'd really haven't
experienced that yet but that's that's
what I my gut is telling me just based
on what we know so I be tweet us a
screenshot of the great the area getting
exciting I love he's tweeting air you
won't get you won't get busted for
anything some people tweet a lot of
stuff Beecham like I know I know would
still want to see the letter X all up on
that screen man Twitter's the wild wild
west is it is um so there you go guys I
think that's pretty much gonna do for
today right that's it man awesome all
right we're gonna wrap things up I
