has it the show that rounds up the
week's biggest tech rumors you can vote
on what you think about the rumors too
in the interactive player if you're
watching I'm seeing at this week we've
got some new stuff possibly being added
to Google Play and 4k might be coming to
an apple device near you let's get
started first up Google Play for Android
might get some new features according to
the blog android police for example
you'd be able to edit reviews as well as
delete them from within the app the
biggest new feature though would be the
introduction of an activity feed it
would let users view and share a stream
of your activities as it pertains to the
Play Store such as ratings reviews and
Plus Ones and it would link through to a
Google+ profile thus helping Android
users discover new content and
potentially meet new contacts great
Google+ integration so now all of your
friends can see how much ridiculous
money are spending on candy crush not
that I spend ridiculous money on candy
crush and not that I know anybody who
actually uses Google Plus and finally on
Friday IDG News Service and other Apple
blogs posted news about a sharp 32 inch
4k display for sale and apples European
online stores for a measly sum of fifty
seven hundred dollars Apple's new retina
macbook pros are able to support a 4k
monitor and the upcoming Mac Pro can
handle up to three 4k displays we don't
know what the specific launch date is
for the Mac Pro and it turns out that we
don't know the availability for these
monitors either because on sunday night
pacific time macrumors notice that apple
remove the mystery display from its site
most likely the listing went up early on
accident and most likely the signifies
that mac pros are coming soon we hope
what do you guys think does anybody care
about 4k other than graphic designers
and video editors do you think apple
will eventually make its own apple
branded 4k displays would you pay 5
grand for a monitor don't forget to vote
in our poll and leave a comment that's
