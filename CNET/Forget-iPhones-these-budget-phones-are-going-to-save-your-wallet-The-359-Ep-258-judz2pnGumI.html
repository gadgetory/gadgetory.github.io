ready yet
get set it's the 359 podcast on BB G and
here in the seats we have the classics
the oh geez
we got Roger Chang and Ben Fox Reuben
and we are finally back at full steam
yeah
I'm still taking it in like I I've been
I've been in LA for three weeks they
changed things while you're being
changed yes I look a lot better on
camera right no no no no now that people
people can see more of the blemishes on
your face well there's that at least
you're welcome audience for all that so
what are we talking about the budget
phones whether or not you should give up
your iPhone for a cheaper Android phone
is it worth it it might be it might be
considering how much the item the next
iPhone is gonna Christ and we'll break
down the Tesla Model 3 which just rolled
off as best we can
as we can for some people right and
consumers are just getting it I think
we've got the full review yet but you
know Tim Stevens is taking a look at it
yeah especially this one's $35,000 so as
always they do a good product launch
sorry about that guys as always if you
have any questions about either of these
topics leave them in the comment section
Ryan will pick out the best and we'll
get to them in 3 minutes and 59 seconds
from 3 to welcome to the 359 I'm Roger
Chang I'm Ben Fox Ruben so we're finally
back after a bit of a pseudo hiatus I
mean we were back I was back last week
man kind of I was break up Thursday
doing it without you
all right but we're gonna be talking
about Tesla they were talking about
sorry Tesla Model 3 before that we'll be
talking about budget phones and whether
or not you should give up your crazy
expensive iPhone for a budget Android
phone which the crazy expensive iPhone
is expected to get even crazier and more
expensive Apple is expected to cram all
sorts of new tech into its 10th
anniversary
i phone but with it the price is
expected to go above a thousand dollars
I saw I could go above $1400 so that
makes these microphones just valuable to
consider bit of context they're like the
starting price for an iPhone right now
is $650 it's already fairly expensive
service charges and yet the the new
iPhone X iPhone 8 whatever could go to a
thousand fourteen hundred dollars
depending on your configuration which
you know ah son makes a lot of these
Android phones seem a lot more
attractive we're not talking about the
high-end guys right we're not talking
about the motors ease of the the Galaxy
s8 talk about the Moto G 5 plus or the
Moto e 4 these are phones that are
closer to 300 to $130 phones I've barely
heard of right one of these is plastic
what is it the e4 is a plastic phone
it's like retro it's rich plastic right
it's not gonna break when you drop it
which is nice there is that yeah but no
so look one of our columnist Rick
brought up you know temporarily gave up
his iPhone for a $180 Android phone it's
the Nokia $680 through Amazon's discount
program mm-hmm and you know he said
there are shortcomings but you can
actually live with this phone I mean it
there you know there's some sacrifices
you make but you know it's it's they're
not that bad right no would you consider
I'm just curious would you consider you
know taking that big plunge into Android
world it's yeah well they're definitely
getting a budget phone like this because
it's probably gonna get dropped in the
toilet a few times but I think it really
depends how much the iPhone price is
going to be it's also the expectation of
there are gonna be three different kinds
and the ultra premium one I probably
wouldn't be on the market for but at the
same time Samsung is doing a really good
job where like instead of not only
switching over to the Android world but
switching over from the flagship world
yep you know if I was really gonna
switch to Android I would probably stick
with like a Samsung Galaxy s8 or
something like that and get some of the
like the next you know the high feeds
and speeds right so thing our reviews
editor Patrick Holland you know broke
down the the to budget moto phones are
out there you're really looking for one
got kind of a premium feel to it
actually the the g5 plus is not a bad
option but if you want to save money the
e4 is definitely the budget phone to
beat and then next up we've got the
Tesla Model 3 yeah this was this was
like the big hotness that happened over
the weekend that Elon Musk started to
send out this is the first runs of the
Model 3 so now they're here and $35,000
electric vehicle which is actually a
good price considering past Tesla
vehicles have been way more yeah 67,000
plus whatever so we did our the Roadshow
folks put together a pretty good
comparison as far as putting this up
against the Chevy bolt which is also an
electric vehicle and the bolt is a
little bit more expensive as a base
model it's around like 37 v instead of
35 top speed is a little bit slower than
the Tesla Model 3 it's also a little bit
smaller but the range is a little bit
better you get about 238 miles per
charge versus 220 as you would expect
the 0 to 60 is better with the Tesla
Model 3 sure the big question for me
okay so like I went through a bunch of
those specs fine the question is is like
is the model 3 really gonna get a lot of
people to jump on board to electric
vehicles I think the price is still
prohibitive yeah most people I know that
it gets you closer into like the you
know middle class market but it's it's
gonna be a tough sell for most folks
yeah there are you you're marketing to
people who again need to have access to
a they could put their car into which
seems like a simple thing but it it's
not something everyone has yeah I guess
a jam party that's a good point you
can't park it on the street
no you need a garage which not everybody
had and you need a garage with a power
hookup like I have a garage in my
apartment complex there's no outlet I
can I couldn't plug in a Tesla there
yeah so I still not sure if this is
really gonna make the big transition to
electric vehicles but I mean I think I
think it's gonna go a lot longer way
than past Tesla vehicles for sure
the price is attractive I know there are
plenty of people who are really excited
about this but yeah in terms of actually
making it turning into a mainstream
thing yeah so alright yeah
did you like anything oh sorry that was
it basically I can do it for you and it
for me dude yeah if you liked any of
these stories
check them out on CNET I'm Ben Fox Ruben
I'm rod Jiang thanks for listening well
just cut out that part no let's keep it
very endearing I kind of like forgot how
we ended the show like I was gonna end
it the way we did don't say yeah so I'm
mad at both of you for not getting my
intro reference it was the intro to the
TV show all that with a song by TLC wow
that's a deep cut right there yeah help
me out I was kind of trying to place it
in the middle and then like the podcast
began and I forgot about yeah yeah we
must have ran way over 4 minutes because
I realize I was looking around like yeah
we got rid of the climb well you were
gone what it was Brian's decision oh my
god
yeah so we don't say that to the
questions Matthew or the deck that's
your nickname now yeah speaking of
iPhones is there a future to the iPhone
se yeah yes absolutely
they've already yeah they've already
released second iteration it will
essentially be unchanged and it'll look
the same it'll be smaller because it's
going after that that customer who wants
a smaller phone that cheaper phone and a
cheaper phone but it'll have probably
better specs you know a slightly faster
processor or whatever yeah all that
stuff that you've got being said Apple
is very very interested in continually
increasing its
average sales price for its phones yes
so you know I think the question in a
certain way gets it the fact that like
Apple is always trying to upsell you so
it doesn't really want you to get the se
and wants me to get like those super
expensive plus you know limited edition
whatever whatever this like third new
iPhone is gonna be there they're praying
everybody buys that one even though
it'll be in probably limited quantities
yeah clarify before we go any further
were you talking about the bolt with a
be fault bolt both will be just to
clarify the vault no sometimes laptop
speakers are a little in discerning okay
yes the Chevy bolt which is there that
one that one is it like a more direct
comparison I was you said that stupid
marketing decision on their part they
could have done a better job it wasn't
you it was I think yeah they felt like
they did a good job branding the vault
that that's what I think about when I
hear both its the vault was first yeah
which is why a lot of people still think
vault yeah yeah the next one is going to
be called so we are still on the topic
of the iPhone se and Adam wants to know
whether will there be 3d touch for the
iPhone se I would say no yeah I think
they're gonna keep that as more of like
a super consumer friendly not just
consumer friendly they're just stripping
it down so like all the bells and
whistles are on the main iPhone if you
want that you've got to pay up for it
for a reason yeah I mean like it's
gotten to the point where they're not
really even adding some of it well this
is existed since the Plus existed is
that they don't add a lot of those
features that are in the plus into the
original iPhone again because they're
trying to upsell you yeah it's
interesting that a lot of the questions
are about the budget iPhone se mmm-hmm
I'm scared that people are willing to
like switch from an iPhone and Android
or like if they want to go budget
they're just looking at the SEO out
there like is that is that is that your
budget option is it
tse cuz I would argue they're probably
better phones on the Android side from a
spec perspective Oh without a doubt that
more competition right so fancy you're
kind of getting less I would say you're
getting less bang for your buck mm-hmm
Kevin points out that the bowl and volt
both have to do with electricity yeah we
get that but it's still like fanatics
yeah
like trying to decipher it over gravity
laptop speakers on a podcast the old
family of cars I call one like though of
Bolton and the other the Zap or
something I don't know I don't know we
chevy parts a lot on the show so but
like sure that's the thing is that the
model
yeah we need Tim Stevens on it sits we
should have him on if he travels travels
everything everywhere he's not here and
when he comes he graces he Grace's us
with his presence for a few minutes
right he's off adventure I think it's I
think it's well noted though that even
though we don't talk about cars aligned
the model 3 was like they they do a
really good job with product launches
because I mean they treat it like a
product launch when was the last time
you saw another car company presenting a
car we're like you know everybody's
sitting up being like oh my god the
first run is coming out this weekend
this is they're really really good at
marketing these things which is partly
why we're talking about it is that they
create a lot of excitement around oh
yeah yeah you don't get excited for the
next Camry no but I should you guys
found that YouTube channel called
regular car reviews no I turned him on
to that at the Auto Show this year and I
think I might have blown his mind a
little bit it's a fantastic YouTube
channel if anybody's out there is just
like into cars and you want to like get
away from super high-end like the future
of cars and get into like not even a
good version of the history of cars I
say that it sounds negative because this
guy's channels incredible he's gonna
review like the Chevy Impala and it's it
sounds like such a dumb idea on paper
but it's hysterical and like he'll bring
in like a Yugo and crappy old models
it's it's pretty priceless if you have
in being like jokey or it's like I
resent sincere information but at the
same time it's a little tongue-in-cheek
yeah
I really enjoy it and I don't know
anything about cars so I don't know I
found it enjoyable a little shout-out to
to regular car reviews right yeah yeah
that's the thing with a lot of these
like everybody's car reviews is that
it's like the latest and greatest stuff
so yeah I don't I'm I'm currently not in
the market for a model 3 and I don't I
don't know that I ever will be maybe
eventually maybe one day so I myself
have recently made the switch from
iPhone to Android nice very well I was a
couple months ago but I have an unfair
perspective because I drowned an iPhone
that I had so I got kind of a purpose
throw a slash burner Android it's the
HTC One and as much as the operating
system Android is great that phone model
is a little old which which one I don't
know here you tell me because it could
be like the m9 or the ancient ancient
burner phone but I feel like I'm
operating within the realm of the the
budget phone conversation that we're
having right now maybe not at the time
when that was released by the driveway
it's basically kind of fresh at the box
itself ok well first of all if you can
share how much did you spend on it and
second did you miss anything from again
flagship I'm so it was actually a gift
as someone who took sympathy on me for
drowning my iPhone ok very necessarily a
loyal Apple is just lazy and I've kind
of been grandfathered in the only thing
I really miss about it is I'm still kind
of getting used to the notification
systems and it's a very minor detail
about that operating system but there is
a little bit of a learning period to get
used to that because it is different but
otherwise like it does all the same damn
stuff the camera sucks because it's old
but I can live with that own take like
aren't there little things that kind of
bug you but like with an iPhone user
you're trained to like DoubleTap your
home button to multitask and it's a
separate Android like it's not I don't
think it's better worse like they're
just like little things that you
remember doing your iPhone
your Android phone doesn't work yeah I
got you said that real quick though I
mean those are tiny little I might have
that we Anacortes I switch between yeah
I can imagine that'd be weird
is anybody out there in the chat
constantly going back and forth between
iPhone and Android I'm kind of curious
to see how you adjust and how your brain
kind of works or that because there is a
very subtle kind of interpersonal
mechanical things that are different
find shortcuts for how you use your
phone you find the optimal way to use it
and and then you switch the operating
system and it's just different of that
all those shortcuts are like worthless
so you've gotta learn all these new
things the problem is it's like
switching in from like every five
minutes or so it's like it's confusing
my brain can only handle yeah isn't that
your job
now I'm terrible by job all right before
we wrap it up for the day Roger tell us
about your trip Oh awesome
yeah just my wife to Harry Potter world
in general
water fan she just never went to the
park the park yeah what about comic-con
like what was alright there was a
comic-con the week before right dang a
comic-con was awesome it was my first my
first comic-con in San Diego I did the
Hall H line wait
that's like the thing to do if you're a
hardcore fan of comic-con is you attend
Hall H panels because that's where all
the big stunts are veiled you know I got
to see Steven Spielberg talk about ready
player one and the cast of Justice
League try to defend their movie you
know say it's not terrible Ben Affleck
basically you know saying like I love
Batman he's pretty good I think it's
pretty good I'm good so that line was
kind of crazy like I I think I was there
with like a bunch of people who like out
of a possible that group was in line for
about 20
eight hours and wasn't even at the front
of that hall it was like they were we
were kind of stuck in like the bottom
the back quarter of the room so the
media doesn't have to wait in there so
common causes are super media friendly
so like there isn't like a press line
for it you just have to go in with
everyone else so once you're in do you
have to wait in the line again like the
next day yeah oh yeah yeah no there are
separate lines you can't actually do it
physically because you'd have to have
friends who kind of like wait cuz for
folks who wanted to get into the
Saturday session they had to start
waiting at Thursday that is yes
that is crazy and comic-con's only four
days that's comic-con culture man yeah
you live same way here three days like
just walking the floor going to other
panels just sitting in line that sounds
horrible
yeah it's weird I mean I actually had
fun waiting in line because I got to me
to hold it bunch of people everyone has
very common interest rate you can geek
out about the same kinds of things so
that was kind of cool but it was like I
and I opted for my particular shift to
wait in the morning so like it was yeah
that's cool back into the chat
Danny Green following up on our question
says I kind of like helping people with
their Windows PCs and then like 95% of
the time I myself use Apple it's nice to
be able to like go back and forth well I
know people that are so indoctrinated
and do it so married into it that they
just like oh this thing you can change
settings yeah that is basically Apple's
whole business model is that they like
people that are like that like I give
her a install apps
why is everything all shiny yeah I don't
want to touch it
Fett says I missed the simplicity of
iMessage Android needs to get on top of
that one message service that works with
everyone else instead of trying to
remember which users on which account
that's true prom no third party yeah but
there's no like is whatsapp like really
like the venmo of messaging services
like the ubiquitous payment service like
everybody's already not everyone's odds
that no that's a terrible really all
right
i rescind by an agent like i would say
my my parents are okay well we'll get on
your parents know they owe me memos it's
like for like cool people no it's it's
like younger folks the youth right the
utsikt want to talk about their money
for some reason the Utes of America
still hate that idea on venmo I mean no
I like it because I like posting weird
messages you know just really thanks for
the thanks for helping move that dead
bodies venmo gonna be called in as
evidence just like Amazon echo is I
don't know I think it's already been
used
I think Alfred told me about that or
like really drug deals yeah and like
they they're like here's your weed
you're just going right to jail we're
like not even gonna have a court case
alright so we're gonna bring it on down
home Roger you're gonna go to New York
Comic Con to uh yeah I've gone last year
but as a fan I didn't go but we've got
enough people who go to New York
comic-con
that's like I don't feel the need to
weigh in I just like to go and enjoy it
alright fine I was gonna invite you
along alright so before we go one quick
