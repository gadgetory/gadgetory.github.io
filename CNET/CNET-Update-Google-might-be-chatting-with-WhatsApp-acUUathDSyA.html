Bridget Carey and this is your scene
that update google could be looking to
buy the messaging app called whatsapp
for a billion dollars what makes the app
popular is that it works across any type
of mobile device from Apple to android
blackberry and Windows Phone and users
can send text messages as well as images
audio and video and you don't have to
pay for it as SMS since it's all over
data through the app about 7 billion
messages were sent through the app on
New Year's Eve but as for whether or not
the app is worth a billion dollars that
much is up for debate also in rumor land
it seems the next Xbox console may not
be revealed until May 21st originally it
was reported that Microsoft would talk
about the xbox 720 this month but it
looks like it was pushed back to the end
of May if you want to be among the first
with a 4k TV sony announced its
releasing Ultra HD LED TVs starting at
five thousand dollars available April
21st at the CES show in january sony
showed off an 84 inch model for 25
thousand dollars so relatively speaking
this 55 inch model is much more
affordable the Mars rover Curiosity is
on a bit of a spring break for the next
month the rover will have no
communication with NASA because the Sun
gets in the way once every twenty six
months Earth and Mars end up on opposite
sides of the Sun so rather than have
communication disrupted NASA will just
pick things back up in a few weeks if
you're curious about the
much-talked-about SmartWatch called the
pebble watch we have the full review on
cnet the digital watch connects to your
phone interacts with apps it promises
instant notifications health based apps
fun watch faces but for one hundred
fifty dollars now at launch it doesn't
do a whole lot it receives messages and
helps you screen calls it plays and
pauses music from the phone but the
company needs to add more features
before it can be worthy of your wrist if
you do like tech toys you might find it
fun to be at the forefront of a new tech
category there are other companies also
trying to get into the wearable tech mix
on Kickstarter a product called link me
wants to be a digit
billboard of sorts for your wrist
scrolling in text messages and alerts
over an LED display in a bracelet link
me only lights up for the types of
alerts you choose but whatever text you
get I hope you don't mind them being
seen by anyone near you it also defaults
to a watchman no message is being
scrolled and the creator's have less
than a month to reach their $100,000
goal that's your tech news update you
can find more details on the show blogs
cnet com / update and you can stay
updated on twitter from our studios in
