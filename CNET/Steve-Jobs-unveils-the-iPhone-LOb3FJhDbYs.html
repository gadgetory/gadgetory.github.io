revolutionary products of this class the
first one is a widescreen iPod with
touch controls
the second is a revolutionary mobile
and the third is a breakthrough internet
communications device so three things a
widescreen iPod with touch controls a
revolutionary mobile phone and a
breakthrough internet communications
device an iPod a phone and an Internet
communicator an iPod a phone
these are not three separate devices
this is one device
and we are calling it iPhone today
today Apple is going to reinvent the
phone and here it is
now
so we're gonna reinvent the phone now
we're gonna start with a revolutionary
user interface is the result of years of
research and development and of course
it's an interplay of hardware and
software now why do we need a
revolutionary user interface I mean
here's four smartphones right Motorola Q
the BlackBerry palm treo nokia e62 the
usual suspects and what's wrong with
their user interface as well the problem
with them is really sort of in the
bottom 40 there it's it's this stuff
right here they all have these keyboards
that are there whether you need them or
not to be there so how are we going to
take this to a mobile device but what
we're gonna do is get rid of all these
buttons and just make a giant screen a
giant screen now how are we gonna
communicate this we don't want to carry
around a mouse right so what are we
gonna do Oh a stylus right we're gonna
use a stylus No who wants a stylus you
have to get them and put them away and
you'll lose them yeah nobody wants a
stylus so let's not use a stylus we're
gonna use the best pointing device in
the world we're gonna use a pointing
device that we're all born with were
born with ten of them we'll use our
fingers we're going to touch us with our
fingers and we have invented a new
technology called multi-touch which is
phenomenal it works like magic you don't
need a stylus it's far more accurate
than any touch display that's ever been
shipped it ignores unintended touches
it's super smart you can do multi-finger
gestures on it and boy have we patented
it
this is what it looks like it's got a
three and a half inch screen on it it's
really big and it's the highest
resolution screen we've ever shipped
it's a hundred and sixty pixels per inch
highest we've ever shipped it's gorgeous
and on the front there's only one button
down there we call it the home button it
takes you home from wherever you are and
that's it
let's look at the back on the back the
biggest thing of note is we got a two
megapixel camera built right in the
other side and we're back on the front
so let's take a look at the top now
we've got a headset jack
three-and-a-half millimeter all your
iPod headphones fit right in
we've got a place a little tray for your
SIM card and we've got one switch for
sleep and wake just push it to go to
sleep push its wake up and we're gonna
do it again with the iPhone in 2007
we're very excited about this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
