I'm Jeff Bakalar filling in for Bridget
Carey this week this is your cnet Update
invites for an apple event on September
9th went out today and yes this is very
likely when we'll see the next iPhone in
action the invitation teases a single
sentence hey Siri give us a hint so
obviously i asked syria about that hey
Siri give me a hint look deep within
yourself and you will find the answer
especially on sep tember 9th so what
else will be September 9th event bring
us rumors have been swirling about the
next iteration of Apple TV that is
definitely overdue and maybe a larger
iPad sure why not but back to the iphone
2015 is an S year for the mobile device
meaning historically apple doesn't
necessarily refresh the look of the
phone as much as they improve a few
things under the hood so here's what
we've heard the next iPhone will
massively upgrade its camera first the
megapixel count will jump from eight to
twelve also the camera is said to be
able to record 4k video meaning it will
join a very short list of phones like
the samsung galaxy s6 the front-facing
camera will also get an update including
a screen based flash not an actual LED
light we've also heard reports that the
phone will get a force touch display for
shortcuts in using iOS 9 and an apple
watch inspired animated wallpaper
switching gears towards other forbidden
fruit some new data about the in fair
encouragement site Ashley Madison is
beginning to take shape according to a
reporter at gizmodo the millions of men
who were paying for the site to get
hooked up with potential female cheating
partners were being misled about just
how many real-life women were actually
using the site aside from the numerous
claims that Ashley Madison was creating
fake female profiles the gizmodo
reporter concluded that there were only
around 12,000 women who actively used
the site so who's worse
the men who used the site expecting to
cheat or the site itself that fabricated
an active female user base essentially
planning to tease people forever I'm not
picking sides okay they're both equally
terrible I'm just I'm just saying there
is a weird sort of thing there and
finally Instagram appears to be
loosening its policy on the aspect ratio
of submitted photographs today you can
start uploading content in landscape and
portrait orientations now all we got to
do is stop vertical videos and we've got
ourselves a good internet again that
will do it for me today on update for
the very latest head over to cnet.com
