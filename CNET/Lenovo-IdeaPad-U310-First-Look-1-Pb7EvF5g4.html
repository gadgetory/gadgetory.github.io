back-to-school shopping season
unfortunately right around the corner a
lot of people are looking for thin
affordable laptops that are like the
macbook air but maybe you can save a
couple hundred dollars along the way
that's a good thing the good news is
that when it comes to Windows ultrabooks
the price has dropped last year you were
looking at maybe a thousand dollars
eleven hundred dollars and you're
starting to see once for as low as seven
ninety-nine case in point the IdeaPad
u310 now this may not really look so
much like an ultrabook in the sense that
it's not super thin it is ultrabook thin
at point seven inches but that's still
thicker than a macbook air and it weighs
about a half pound more than a macbook
air is that a macbook now a lot of
people are going to ask you that
question because it really does look
like a macbook it's like the return of
the white macbook here the keyboard the
large trackpad if you ever been a
Windows user and fantasize about having
a macbook like laptop maybe this is the
one for you and that size fits right in
between the 13-inch MacBook Pro and the
air where you're getting in here is a
core i5 3rd gen intel processor that's a
lower processor speed than you'd find in
your sort of high-end non ultrabook
laptops it's going to give you an
equivalent performance to what you'd see
in a macbook air you're also going to
get in here a 500 gigabyte hard drive
you do not get an SSD now a lot of
ultrabooks are packing those very fast
flash-based storage devices into their
laptops and they're expensive you know
when you want to about get up to a 256
gigabyte version it can add up now the
advantage to that hard drive solution is
that you're going to pay a lot less for
it and get 500 gigabytes but the
flipside is that it won't be quite as
zippy but it will function like a
regular laptop hard drive in this
instance you cannot upgrade to a full
SSD so you're stuck with that although
certain versions of this laptop will
have 32 gigabytes of flash storage to
zip up the booting process they can feel
a little bit faster there's also four
gigs of ram and there's plenty of ports
so it's a pretty solid package so what
do you lose in this package well you
don't get bluetooth and you also don't
get a DVD Drive no surprise you don't
get that in any ultrabook but a lot of
people don't use GV
drives anyhow keep it in mind the rest
of the package is okay I mean the
keyboards find the trackpad is big it's
not as great as a macbook air not by a
long shot and the battery life is very
solid but not spectacular we're really
going to get the most out of here is
that 799 price the bang for the buck now
be aware that there are other laptops
out there they're going to hit that
price and offer a surprisingly similar
set of components the sony vaio t which
we reviewed here at cna also look at the
dell inspiron 14z which has dedicated
AMD graphics and costs a little bit more
but again a very similar package there's
a category to keep an eye on probably
going to pick one of these would be a
great back to school laptop if it's not
the IdeaPad u310 and maybe one of those
others i'm scott stein and that's a look
at the lenovo ideapad u310 it is an
ultrabook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
