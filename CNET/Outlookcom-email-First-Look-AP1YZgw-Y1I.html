editor here at Cena today we're going to
take a first look at Outlook calm now
outlook calm is Microsoft's new
browser-based
email service it is free of course and
is eventually going to replace hotmail
right now it's only available in a
preview anybody can download it you can
use it on any machine you'll see that
even though it has a lot of Windows 8
touches some of the fonts the People Hub
you don't need Windows 8 to use it you
can move over to it if your existing
hotmail user you can jump on it if
you're new if you don't like it right
away you can move back but eventually
Microsoft will move all hotmail users to
this system so you want to keep that in
mind it's very minimal once design
really clean not a lot of clutter at all
it's going to look a lot like Gmail in
some ways but I think it's even more
minimalist than that when you open it up
you'll see that the inbox is pretty much
what you'd expect from any email service
you'll see a list of messages down the
front of course you'll see the usual
fields of the sender's name the subject
line and then you'll see the time and
date sent if it's sent in the last 24
hours you'll see the time but if it's
sent earlier than that you'll see the
date up on the top is the commands bar
you can't actually go over and change it
to a few a few different colors but that
bit of color is really the only bit of
personalization here and I still think
that's fine because it just keeps the
email INBOX just what you need to know
it's surfaced directly you can't add a
preview pane in Outlook comm so to do
that you just go over to the side here
click on the cogwheel and add preview
pane so of course what that lets you do
is that lets you preview as you go down
here in my box it lets you preview all
the mess all the content that's in there
I did like using the preview box for a
couple reasons one is that when you're
using the preview pane you actually get
independent scroll bars for the Inbox so
you can scroll down and see all your
messages and for this left bar with all
your folders but you don't have the
preview pane on you just get one scroll
bar here on the side so I didn't like
that also you'll notice that their ads
over here now these are a pretty
unobtrusive you pop on them you'll see
that your little picture pops up
Microsoft says it's not reading your
email for the ads I don't exactly know
how it decides what ads you get I saw
everything from a set of six jelly jars
to a Brazilian steakhouse to
random seafood plays so it was a really
random assortment and microsoft does say
that when you open a message so when you
open a message from your friend the ads
will disappear and I found that to be
the case but only when I was using this
preview bar so if I went to a message
that actually I just sent myself and
clicked on it you'll see that the ads
disappear but if I go back and I remove
that preview pane and I click on the
same email then you do see ads appear on
the side so not really sure why that's
happening I'm going to check with
Microsoft
now outlook.com does have a People Hub
now that's going to be straight out of
Windows Phone straight at a Windows 8 to
get to it you just go to this arrow and
you'll see a mail calendar you can
SkyDrive actually it is hooked in with
SkyDrive so you get a lot of storage
thanks to that and you have a People Hub
for finding all your contacts you can
integrate Facebook Twitter and other
social media services with Outlook calm
so when that happens few things so if I
get a message from somebody that I'm
hooked in through Facebook so just go to
this message from Jessica Dole Court
you'll see that her photo from Facebook
pops right up so I didn't have to insert
that manually and you'll see her latest
tweet and Facebook status updates you
can also tweet directly to her from here
you could send a Facebook message
directly you could write on her wall
directly so it does bring all those
elements together of course you don't
have to integrate Facebook or anything
like that you can keep them all separate
but another advantage to do that is you
can actually chat with the person as
well so Jessica we're in line I could go
to the here and chat away so it just
brings a nice way to do all of those
things in one area now on the left side
you'll see you have your list of folders
so that's pretty standard you see that
on most email services now below that
though is a quick view section now this
is something that's unique to my Outlook
comm what it does is it allows certain
number of categories that you can put
you can organize your email into now
they work a couple different ways there
are default categories for shipping
updates photos and documents and also
flagged now what happens is is when an
email comes in that alikom recognizes it
as photos attached or it has a shipping
update so like a tracking number from
UPS it will put them there automatically
now this isn't like a folder it doesn't
move them there so they remove they
leave the inbox they actually stay in
variable inbox they just have this sort
of category attached to them so if I
click on photos for instance I can see
all the emails that came with the photo
same if I go to documents and same if I
go to shipping updates the shipping
updates is nice because I'm not sure how
that it works exactly but I can go and I
can see here and there see I have FedEx
status updates so everything is just
organized they're now folders are just
as they sound folders are where you move
things to they leave the inbox mr. web
organize your emails so I can click on a
folder let go the sale click on work
messages here and then I'll show only
those messages that I put there so very
standard like exactly what you'd expect
with photos and videos outlook comm does
allow you to preview them directly in
the body of the email so I'll open the
open a couple of those up and we'll see
how they look and when you click on them
you will see you can get an instant
slideshow so you can scroll through them
the photos are big and it's a nice
player of course you can download this
group you could download them
individually or you can send them on to
somebody else if a message comes from
YouTube and you include a youtube link
here you see open that up and the video
will actually be in a box and you can
just play it right there so do a good
job with that and a couple less things
that Microsoft did add an Outlook comm
is when you're scrolling over an email
you can see you get these quick action
so there's quick action icons they only
appear when you're clicking up when
you're mousing over an email they allow
you to try to mark it as red
trash it or flag it so those are nice
because it just saves you a couple steps
from going up to a met going up to an
bar up here and trying to find a pull
down menu you can alter these so you can
do a couple others or like Marcus junk
or you can do send a folder or something
like that
once you flag a message a flag message
will automatically appear at the top of
the inbox so no matter where no matter
if it was sent two weeks ago or just
just now it will appear up top so that's
nice because it just brings those
messages right to the top you can choose
to hide it if you like but I do think
that's a nice touch as you notice this
this commands bar will change as you're
doing different things so when you're
just in the inbox it's only going to
show the relevant commands and then when
you're in an individual message you'll
see all the things you need to do like
junk removal or anything like that
Microsoft does promise a couple spam
filtering features when it tries to make
a designation between obvious spam so
things like a Nigerian you won the
lottery thing or what it calls grey mail
and Graham
newsletters their daily deals there are
the specials you get when you patronize
a retailer and then they start sending
you something every day some of those
things you may want some of the things
you don't so Microsoft does allow you to
do what's called a schedule cleanup
function so if you go to sweep you click
on there you go down to schedule cleanup
and then you can do things like delete
all the messages from a sender you can
delete all messages older than 10 days
or you can designate the messages that
you want saved and the messages that you
don't Microsoft does say that if you try
to but if you want to block an email it
will make an attempt to block all future
emails from a sender and attempt to
unsubscribe you now my only question
about that is if it makes an attempt to
unsubscribe you from an obvious spammer
does that just until the spammer that
your email exist and you're going to get
more I'm gonna have to wait and see I've
only been using this for a few days so I
can't really gauge its spam
effectiveness I only have a few messages
in it it was a brand new account for me
so obviously over time exactly how that
works but it's nice to see those spam
promises you know spam plagues everybody
we all hate it
so hopefully Smike restof will do a good
job at that so that's outlook.com I like
it in its first stages I think that has
a nice clean interface it's very easy to
understand there are some nice features
I like that click view I like those
instant action items just appear when
you're just appear when you're mousing
over your email and I like all the
Facebook integration and Twitter I know
that's not going to be for everybody but
if you have a real digital life and
everybody's integrated it's going to be
a great step you can get an outlook.com
account starting now so your email will
be so-and-so at outlook comm and then
moving forward if your hotmail users
you'll have to get here I'm Ken Sherman
