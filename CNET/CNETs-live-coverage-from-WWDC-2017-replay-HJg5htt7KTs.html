our live pre-show of WWDC 2017 we're an
hour before the actual pre-show this is
where we talk about everything possible
we're gonna set a few pieces of business
in order meaning how can you reach us
how can you be a part of the show and
what type of good stuff you guys have
first so first off everyone do we do we
all have the number memorized by heart
of where they can call us or will a
special graphic help us with is special
there we go all right if you want to be
a part of the show the number right down
here one eight eight eight nine hundred
see T white Chuck I just hate the number
now John Kim is on the phone lines be
nice to him if you don't know John Kim
he helps produce so much of our content
our videos you might recognize them in
such skits as a air pods the music video
so um he's running this phones for us so
be nice tell Jon um Seth say nice things
when you first call in like John you're
a great guy just lists the room off yeah
no idea what we're doing here exactly
hear us so we could say anything like so
here to talk about everything WWDC we
also have a few other pieces of business
um before we get into the meat of the
show let's all hold these up this is the
big WWDC 2017 big bingo card how are can
you play this game all right so we have
a link set up for you it's so easy it's
a tiny Earl or tiny URL backslash Earl
tiny Earl backslash WWDC to zero one
seven it's like the easiest you can do
the
is a randomly generated bingo card that
we have created and if you win I could
have our lovely friends here show off
some of the goodies we have 14 prizes
ranging from spec cases both sizes for
iPhone 7 and 7 plus also how about some
Belkin are these Thunderbolt lightning
lightning cables oh we all need those
there let's do it let's do a product if
you want that you want that okay so play
the game the best way to let us know if
you've won is using the hashtag seen at
live once we go we have to do this one
the keynote starts whenever you hear any
of these terms or see them announce exit
on your card and then you could do the
website you can actually hit a hit hit
the square until you know it'll it'll
use that once you do that then you are
good to go and so you can screenshot it
send it to us and then we'll just pick
like the top 14 people and give out
prizes it's gonna be real good like that
fun gonna be fun okay um now let's talk
about what's going on outside the show
let's get a sneak peek this is not
exactly live live at the moment but this
was just taken a few minutes ago the
exterior of WWDC happening in the San
Jose Convention Center ladies what do
you guys think about them bringing it
over to San Jose this year yeah name a
how do you feel about that it's too far
away
it's so fun yeah it's more of a
logistical thing I mean who cares where
they do it sir by far by far with a 40
40 minute drive far yeah Facebook dude
f8 down there this year so I think
they're trying to keep it in the Silicon
Valley I think for the attendees I look
I went to San Jose State University that
is blocks away from the college that I
attended but come on there's so much
more to do in San Francisco then there
isn't I feel bad for all the people who
flew in for this and ended up in sorry
no Ben
alright um I didn't realize how crazy
all want to talk about WWDC 2070 the
lines are completely filled
and lit up everybody y'all in y'all lit
AF okay that's the first time last time
we're gonna say that on this podcast I
don't know about that I don't know about
now that you said that I might use it a
few more times okay so um we know a lot
of things we're gonna see obviously WWDC
a revamp to the operating systems but
ladies let's just kind of go around in a
circle I would love to hear from you
what you guys hope personally what you
guys want to see I'll start with
whatever you guys want to go uh I don't
mind starting why don't I did have to
change my headphones because yeah
exactly what you just heard um I I want
to see a refresh of the MacBook Air I
think it's ridiculous that Apple just
kind of put it on the back burner I know
it's a favorite for a lot of people um
who use the air to get through college
and have a lot of allegiance to it so I
want to see a refresh on the MacBook Air
um even if it's just minor just keep it
alive and I have to say I'm most excited
for Apple to finally get in the Smart
speaker game good lord
gosh I mean it's so sad and we can talk
about this more but they set the stage
with Siri years before anybody else did
a personal assistant and then they just
kind of ignored it and let Amazon and
Google walk all over them so I want to
see a smart speaker that I might
actually want to buy okay miss Lexi I'm
excited about iPads no actually I'm not
come on I'm excited about iPads y'all
come on I'm the iPad loser guy who loves
that thing there's a market and his
morning all right okay you're left here
that's the 5% market thing I'm the
tablet naysay oh yeah however I'm
excited like Sharon says about Siri I
really want to see some excitement in
the series space I want to see how
they're going to answer Google
especially after i/o this year that they
announced a lot of interesting stuff
around the assistant and artificial
intelligence specifically now I also
want to know where Apple's going to go
with augmented reality or reality right
so they are really really behind in this
space in terms of what we've seen pretty
much see nothing from Apple so I want to
know if they're going to be working on
understand
headset are they working on a hololens
are they working on something integrated
with the iPhone like what are we going
to see in terms of the implementation of
those two cameras on the seven-plus like
what are we going to see I want to see
some augmented reality I want to see
some mixed reality it's something fun
something crazy you know I quite
honestly for me this is probably the
most exciting potential keynote we've
seen in a long time and the reason why I
say that is because we actually don't
know too much look we know everything
about the iPhone we really do we know
about 80% of the new iPhone that's
coming out in September but here at WWDC
we really don't have any real meat and
potatoes when we're talking about what
they're gonna do with iOS 11 what are
they going to do with iOS 11 for the
iPad there's some little nuggets and
we'll talk about those later what's
gonna happen a Mac OS what's gonna
happen a TiVo's what's gonna happen to
watch us like we don't really know know
and then in addition to that obviously
like you said you know we've talked
about on the Apple byte ad nauseam about
just how they need to say I don't want
to see a Siri the way syria's it needs
to be a whole new Siri if it new if it
wants to compact with what is out there
don't give us oh we added more third
party partners don't give me oh we added
a few more hooks to this information it
has to be significantly smarter it has
to be a different system so with this
this came from the acquisition that
Apple had a years ago of the company
that uh basically now has viv the smart
assistant which is integrated into
Samsung's bixby which we haven't seen
Apple acquired you know Siri and made it
their own but they have like you said
they haven't done anything significant
to it since its launch in what was that
was it around 2000 and old is it 2011
the 4s with the 4s yeah so 2011 so you
know we're waiting to see that I just
think though along the longtime CEO more
all the time that's like that's she's
millenniums in in the tech world so um
I'm I just want to see to me this WWDC
means a lot more than even an iPhone
keynote I think this is going to set the
stage of where Apple is going to fall in
line with artificial intelligence voice
assistance and where their platform is
going to be able to either compete or
kind of feel like a nice try you guys
are still behind this is I think the
lots of writing on this rapid just the
future of it because we felt they've
been behind
for the past couple years I think this
year is where you need to show us that
you're either caught up or doing
something even better yeah tell me tell
all those people waiting for the note
this summer that they shouldn't leave
their iphone tell everyone ready to
upgrade that they shouldn't get the s8
so I I think that to your point Siri
can't just be like Siri 2.0 it needs to
be true artificial intelligence right
now we have a fixed set of questions any
answers that you can ask Siri it doesn't
feel like you're really having a natural
conversation it feels very forest and
calculated so if Apple can actually not
just improve Siri in a superficial way
but actually make it like oh wow now I
really feel like this is the future of
artificial intelligence I think they can
keep a lot of people around for a bit
longer
absolutely okay so let's go hit the
phone lines we have look the keynote
starts at 10 a.m. we Pacific time we
have 50 minutes to hang out with you all
we're gonna be friends we're gonna take
your phone calls I'm going to talk more
because we want the show to be all about
you as well so let's hit up our friend
Matthew out in Detroit Matthew can you
hear us welcome to Cena alive hello
what's up man so this morning I wrote on
9 to 5 Mac wait wait did you read on
i-25 Macke right on cnet.com I'm just
kidding I'm messing with you see on CNET
via 9 to 5 Mac and just playing with you
go ahead yeah that an app was actually
leaked their name was leaked on to the
App Store named file yes sir
does this mean that for iOS they might
be introducing a file browser yeah
Apple's gonna act like they just
invented a file system I'm sure of it
yeah there's been a lot of I don't know
how much you've been following along
right yeah of course not they there were
renderings out of from a group named Mac
stories showing an actual Finder
navigation system that could potentially
be brought to the iPad that the thing
here is that this showed up as an iPad
app only so not for iOS 11 as a whole
but just for the iPad which would you
know be a huge help but the system needs
more than that for the iPad but this is
one of those things that
I'm quite honestly excited to see if
they have some level of file navigation
that shows us that the iPad is more than
just a large screen iPhone something
that androids had but I also read oh yes
that the the in one of their like
support apps a name was leaked that was
drag and drop for the iPad Oh drag and
drop we'll see I think I think that if
if this is the case I mean this is going
to help the pro feel more pro but again
I look I I need Apple to really impress
us with the iPad pro I'm the number one
like iPad really yeah you know I think
it has to go more than that but I think
it's you know look Apple needs to show
us some more than just steps in the
right direction right we we need to be
like dang that software is so
significantly different that now it
feels like this is a machine that could
potentially replace my laptop which is
what they kind of try and talk like it
will but it's not on the level of the
surface obviously not even close from a
functionality standpoint but we'll see
we'll see it but I think it's really
interesting and we have a shot up there
kind of with that what that leak looks
like so Matthew thank you for the
information my friend you are a part of
CNET live whoo thanks I had to say all I
want to be able to do is download a zip
folder and open it on my unzip it yeah

let's get him more calls we're gonna go
out to Ottawa with our friend Chris
welcome to see that live what's up what
do you want to talk about today Chris
poutine name Chris Chris okay here we go
yeah just eating something
wait eating what specifically fun good
it's early in the morning ah I can keep
that lunch time out here I was gonna say
man it's early for pizza out here but I
see what just I see where you're at
never a quick question about pizza have
this debate all the time when they make
Hawaiian pizza do pineapple should
pineapple be put on a pizza or not
this is a this is a sure what do you
think uh that depends if you want to be
fancy or not just got to do pepperoni
pizza you want to be basic you want to
be mate you want to be a basic yeah I
just ask one more thing about pizza do
you call it the cheese pizza or a plain
pizza uh we call it nothing yeah
pepperoni pizza that's really popular
here you might have heard of this Pizza
called pepperoni all right Chris let's
get your quest we're just having fun
with you welcome the show what's going
on
I'm good I was wondering since every WGC
is usually software-based we're looking
at some possible hardware software or
hardware updates what would be your most
favorite hardware update product well
are you saying in their current existing
line or just what would be my favorite
product to see
I hope mine would be the series speaker
that I'm quite interested by what would
yours be well I think that whenever look
Apple hasn't and people like God on me
for this Apple hasn't released really a
truly new product in about two years
like the Apple watch is just outside of
tears but literally the hardware that
we've seen from Apple at this point is
Apple pencil and air pods
okay and air pods really really good not
great looks kind of funky still not
gonna lie but this is Apple's new this
could be a new piece of hardware a new
platform look I have an echo I have a
home I really am curious to see how much
better Apple can do than that of course
it's going to have their ecosystem hooks
I don't subscribe to Apple music so that
doesn't that's not compelling enough for
me
but the series speaker is going to tell
us how Apple is just thinking about this
space so that's what I'm most excited
about I don't know if you ladies have
any other chime ins MacBook Air with
Retina screen is from like five years
ago you said this single Apple live show
we do um I guess what MacBook Air at in
the screen it's not gonna happen is not
gonna happen I need to just be a taste
with that and make yourself hearty
that's happening right yeah Chris what
are you gonna say buddy it's all there
it's possible hardware updates yeah I
never know yeah it's look this is one of
the few WWDC s where I think when I see
a lot more hardware Apple has actually
kind of almost banked up to this this
whole first half of the year we haven't
seen any basically new hardware so we're
waiting for MacBook Pros iPads Apple
watch iPhone iMac Mac Pro Series speaker
we're gonna get loaded in this back end
of the year this is just the start um
and to the MacBook thing we're
potentially expecting to see Mac books
and MacBook Pros getting upgraded that
MacBook Air though is kind of up in the
air I mean I think they'll keep it
around it's their most affordable
MacBook but we'll see if they do
anything to it I hope they do I hope
they do I'm hoping you know that the
sales of the MacBook Air are still very
strong so for them to just ignore that
would be money leaving money on the
table
i I yeah hmm I just want to see the
series speaker that's all I want I hope
that's a rumor that actually comes true
and uh you know because it's fine
really a new product from Apple we
haven't seen anything new
oh hello hey Chris um we'll have a
sharin finish up her thoughts and then
uh but thank you for calling we really
appreciate that okay now thank you so
much uh so it sounds like we have a
Skype call coming in but TLDR we haven't
seen anything really new and exciting
since the air pods or the watch so give
us something to give you our money give
us something that we can make videos for
so that we can get more views and we can
still keep doing this show thank you all
right got stein is calling us on the
line
OOP we don't have your video Scott Scott
right now you look like a white rather
icon do you not see me at all I have it
on let's see yeah no yeah this is like a
bad Verizon commercial guys let's let's
be real there he is
from inside the San Jose Convention
Center Scott Stein editor extraordinaire
always loves to give us a live look
inside Scott um thank you for joining us
you do look cool or Lance Lance bad way
wrong alright so Scotty 2 hotty this way
there we go this is great this is great
video guys I think the stream either
went really up are really down I'm not
sure but Scott tell us kind of hanging
in there tell it tell us about you know
just with the scene set it for us over
there at the San Jose Convention Center
so pretty pretty calm and smooth so far
a lot of people but we're getting in
here it feels it feels pretty spacious
so um men froze it's okay just gonna
come back at bandwidth they're in other
years I actually feel like it was like
close oh okay well you know a lot of
plow you know what you do is the cutest
video went away to if we can message if
we can message him and see if we can
just get them on a pure call let's just
try that in a bit but if not it's okay
landline oh no he's still trying it's ok
let's just wrap this up all right Scotty
yeah it's just mad but it's gonna be a
battle so call us back on the phone line
will reach out to you oh yeah okay let's
just kill the call for now okay it's
like trying I love you but we have to
let you go anyway so we'll see if we can
catch back up with Scott let's go back
to the phone lines and hear what y'all
want to hear
we've got Jordan from San Antonio home
of the Spurs who are highly respect for
the record Jordan just to let you know
what's up welcome to see that live
actually not first fan I just live here
oh oh third family so yeah just like we
just had to support the team me you got
it down here you got stun uh
my question is is that you know you have
we have WWDC it's early this year it
wasn't supposed to be like this really
weren't expecting to be normally have it
like later on which I've noticed I was
feeling WD BGC 2016 just happened and
you know and we see the integration I
was asking you what kind of integration
do you hope to see this year for the
iPad and what kinda Gration do you hope
to see but they're probably not going to
bring or they might bring what should be
a surprise to all of us well I think
that if they want this look the iPad has
an opportunity to when you talk about Oh
what are they doing in the creative
space that is leaving pros out you know
out there to figure out other solutions
I think if there's a way I know there's
third-party software that does it but in
Apple's own ecosystem to have the iPad
truly act like a second screen or some
sort of drawing tablet that can
complement the Mac OS if they can get
some of those hooks with those
third-party companies like Adobe to work
with it more effectively like that like
a true companion I think that's one way
to be like look our iPad pro is more
than a large screen phone that happens
to have split screen I think that's one
way that they can work on some of this
integration with the iPad tablet are the
iPad platform as a tablet to the Mac
platform again kind of trading more
hooks with the ecosystem if we see that
I don't know again what I just described
probably appeals to a very small segment
of the Apple user base but to me that's
okay I think those are the people that
they've forgotten that have been the
most passionate about their up about
their brand
because we know that the general
consumer in general loves Apple stuff
and just buys whatever like they don't
even know what a smart speaker is when
Apple comes out with their smart speaker
that's what they're going to think is
the smart speaker so I just think that
if we have more for the diehards the
people that are actually using these
tools is a day-to-day basis as a pro
that's some of the type of stuff that I
love to see and that's that's the thing
is that people who are really like Apple
we and we have we have to use these
devices for certain things
we have to go out here but I mean for
example myself I went out and I had to
go by surface because that's it's gonna
work for me you know and we I'm looking
for something that the iPad pro will
bring because like you said and I've
been hearing you say every single time
that I watch all your shows all you say
is that the iPad is just a large screen
is just a large screen iPhone and you
know and we're just looking for
something more and I think we haven't
got that I think that was okay when it
first came out right but I think that
the product has to mature over time and
it hasn't yeah and investing is that
Apple I think is lacking from innovation
right now and you know that's something
that hopefully they bring with iOS 11
and we hopefully bring some type of
hybrid or something close to a hybrid
with Mac OS and iOS for the iPad because
it's something we're obviously missing
in the iPad
Jordan you want to be on the show next I
mean you can just Jordan if I get sick I
know I know I got my Jordan you know on
my bench ready to step up six-man idea
right there baby I'm gonna make a lower
third firmer okay Jordan Jordan Jordan
Jordan on the phone lower third but
Jordan would it what do you think since
you know we're talking shop with you
what about the series speaker does that
I mean where are you at with that so
I've seen the echo and I've seen the
Google home and you know as an app
person you know I tried to not you know
look at what Google has because you know
yet if they truth to your yes no oil but
um you know I've seen Apple just do
these things and they need to do
something new they you know it's a
little annoying seeing them just copy
off everyone when they need to be
starting something that you know they
did really well with the computers back
back way back before and they did
something revolutionary with the iPhone
and which Android caught on to but you
know that
everything that they've been doing the
watches and you know and and the speaker
they're just trying to do it better and
I just think that some of these other
companies are doing a whole lot better
so Kisan a new prop oh yeah it's going
to be something new that we're seeing of
course hopefully do something great with
that but of course Google did that
before to you so well you know all right
Apple Apple likes to wait let everybody
else give a new product category a try
they did this with tablets and then they
like to Pam come in and then own it and
really define the category and have a
flagship product in that category so I
think that in many ways Google felt like
they needed to get in early and just
assert themselves there even if they
weren't ready with Google home and Alexa
did a better job but still they came in
very early so Apple now they I get the
sense that there is enough awareness of
smart speakers that Apple feels like
this is probably the right time to come
in and set the tone so hopefully we'll
see some I know so don't forget Apple
has the Bates integration and so what I
do is talk about is talk about how the
audio quality is Lexi are you being
sarcastic or oh look I'm not I'm not a
huge fan of the Beats Audio but I know a
lot of people are and that has huge
pooling powers now you gotta get that
base gotta hit that exactly so that's a
huge like a draw card big especially
because the audio from the echo and the
home is not that good I mean there's
talk about that Cortana speaker as well
that has like the Harman Kardon or like
audio but we haven't seen actually hurt
we haven't heard that I shouldn't say
we've seen it we haven't heard it so
there's a lot of potential for Apple to
really pull out all the stops you know
they have all the content with Apple
music they have all that stuff going on
with all the musicians around beats so
that could be a huge draw card
especially with people to like I don't
order smart speakers but hey it sounds
good yeah and dr. Dre is advertising it
and you know why not why don't I buy
this it's got series series in my phone
I know what Siri does
and great points Lexi I think we we also
should just not underestimate a lot of
people that just literally don't even
understand what the home assistant
speaker is right Amazon echo has about
seventy percent of that market right now
which is huge I don't know how much
Apple can take away from it but we'll
see you know again this is just kind of
showing us the breadcrumbs of how
they're thinking towards the future so
we'll check that out now it looks like
we have Scott Steinbach on our phone
line and so we're gonna we're going to
see we're gonna see if Scott is here and
clear this is all audio we don't need to
play around with that Skype with that
bad signal to San Jose Convention Center
Apple Apple Scotty what's up Brian thank
you for joining us a via phone this time
yeah we're doing it old school so Scott
oh we were asking you earlier if you
could kind of I know we can't see it as
much just we still have the standard
stage at WWDC but maybe set the scene of
how it might differ a little bit from
San Francisco if not that's okay too
yeah so um one sir I mean so many
auditoriums look alike you know
auditorium differentiation is stuff it
is they're all blending together for me
but it is um there's plenty of room
actually things have been very calm
going in there was a lot of more
importantly a lot of waiting room huge
amount of area when the boy first came
in maybe even a little more than Moscone
so I thought that actually it seemed
very calm coming in and we sat down
there are even powerstrips
so that's a nice thing it's not it you
never know if they're going to be power
strips or not when you're working
there's the there's the animated screen
there's a lot of like that same a stuff
that's on that's out on on the front
images of people walking around kind of
like you know avatar type art it almost
I think it's like reminds me of like a
Google i/o where they had animated stuff
there's well animated dancing figures on
the screen here iord animated dancing
things on screen it's got a you're you
obviously cover Apple a whole bunch what
do you want what do you want to see from
them at this WWDC we've been talking
about it how because we haven't had too
many leaks in general over all that this
this is one of the more exciting WWDC s
and also just kind of them showing off
how there
thinking about the home assistant and
ritual you know mented reality and
things that what is your feeling about
this keynote overall and what we should
expect here what you're excited about
yeah so I mean they have so many
platforms now when you think about it we
used to talk about iOS and Mac but
there's also a OS for the iPad which I
think really needs to be addressed a lot
more like how does that thing
how's the iPad become something that we
can use more for work and also I'm so
curious well what's gonna happen with
Apple watch there's Apple TV and then
there's series and rumors of the
speakers so basically I want like
synthesis I want I want to see how they
can talk about how all these work
together in a in a way that makes sense
so it doesn't feel too fragmented and
you're just getting into features and
each individual platform I think that's
going to be the goalie
theory has to be something when you're
in your home and you're saying like hey
Siri or you're saying okay Google
how do you know which thing is listening
or how things handoff from one to the
other and I think that's like that's the
challenge or like where does the watch
fit into that so that's what I want to
see I'm always curious about ar2 and if
there's um you know if there is anything
related a are like what type is it is a
Pokemon go level AR is just like google
tango say they are is this like leading
up the Sun you put on your head no
probably not but you know but I think
that smart cameras are really becoming a
thing this year like Google lens the
ability to identify things using the
camera lens and computer vision and AI
so I feel like Apple will probably have
something in that territory too that
will assist people with cameras I look
forward to hearing news about that yeah
I you know we're all here nodding our
heads listening to you about just how do
they tie all this stuff together I mean
they have the ecosystem advantage from a
standpoint of people that have typically
been in Apple's ecosystem stay locked in
there and can they elevate that even
more you know we this is this is an
opportunity to show us finally I'm
curious how the Apple watch fits into
this because you know they made such a
hard push for it and it's good ish I
wouldn't even say it's very good I think
it's good ish if you're an Apple user
but beyond that how much kit can it
really do more than you know home
kid is like one of those things where
you can use it to a certain degree on
your watch but people have found that
just speaking it speak talking your
smart home is a lot more effective than
tapping anything yeah and so we'll see
how they get all those hooks in it
should be a wrist remote that works with
other things in your home and that's
where Apple watch could fit in so yeah
they need to sort of explain that and
then you know theory looks differently
on Apple TV versus the phone versus the
watch it does some things and that's it
doesn't do others so that's the other
thing is like cleaning up and connecting
and making clear once you have a couple
of these things you realize oh it
doesn't work quite the same here or this
isn't quite the same so that's I hope
there's a cleaner connection between how
all these products fit together
all right Scott sorry we couldn't get
you on video my man but we appreciate
your call and everything get to it a
you'll be on site with a slew of our
CNET staffers covering everything inside
with our live blog as well and uh we'll
look for your coverage buddy yeah thanks
well you won't hear that air pod that's
probably the only thing you won't hear
about that is true but you'll be wearing
them so we can always count on that
wearing them I'm wearing them now we're
looking forward to the next Scott Stein
meme picture of you on the air pods Oh
the infamous Scott Stein if you might
have even seen it about even huh I'll
try to wear them as much as possible in
awkward situations yes
alright thanks God we appreciate your
work man okay thanks all right good
I love his point about making a cohesive
experience across all of the devices
people shouldn't have to memorize what
Siri can do on the Apple TV versus their
phone versus their watch it should be
easy in the sense that you can expect
the same experience no matter where you
go it should be easy and it should also
be a seamless thing so you can as you
saying carry across functionality so you
can pick up where you left off if you
were on your Apple TV and then have that
history available on your smart speaker
on your watch on your phone I mean it's
funny I had this exact problem last
night with Spotify it's kind of the
convert the experience didn't continue
over so I was listening on my mobile and
then I went over to my desktop and then
I couldn't access my listening his
a basic thing good basic human need we
need this like food water and oxygen no
spotter and spot if I pick up are you
lately
so if Apple can do something like that
and have the continuity going then you
know I think there other echo does that
great you know like you hear a good song
that comes on a radio station you just
go to your app you see it right there
you can replay it rewind it it works
awesome hey do you work for Amazon uh DJ
oh I just yeah I was just listening to
Amazon music all day the other the other
thing that I'm and we'll get back to
more of the calls uh that's Scott and to
your point is that because Siri doesn't
work the same on all devices you
actually use it less and what you know
you actually use it less I don't use
Siri on my Apple TV pretty much at all
unless I accidentally press the button
thinking it was the menu button i
literally that's literally when it pops
I'm like oh yeah they're Siri on this so
that is one of those things right
consistency across the bar alright let's
jump on the calls that just a little
reminder 9:36 a.m. Pacific time right
now the keynote is expected at 10:00
a.m.
we're expecting a lot of great stuff
we're going to get to more your calls
and we'll talk more shop about what we
expect to see at Apple we have this
young gentleman from Berkeley Samuel
waiting patiently for a Samuel what's up
welcome to seen alive hi I'm so I know
you guys think that we arms that you
guys are gonna have this mysterious
party is gonna come out but you guys
know what you guys think of a price oh
yeah I had a guess price but I'll let
the ladies jump in here what do you
think okay okay that's a tough one I I
don't think they're gonna announce a
price at all others right yeah I think
though when it if they're gonna have to
obviously feel out the market see how
the reaction is if they're gonna price
it if they're gonna do pre they've gonna
tag premium beats technology or
something like that
I think that's Apple and it's Apple so
they will be premium price tag
especially if they're gonna put beats on
it I think it's gonna jack up the price
a little more I wouldn't know I kind of
yeah if I was gonna guess I again don't
think they're going to announce the
price during the keynote however if I'm
gonna guess I'm gonna say $5.99
oh I was going I was thinking a second
what
that was like the big addition over your
shoulder is that the series fingers
holding in ceiling-mounted series
speaker series being home installation
I'm gonna walk around my house yeah this
is oh yeah my series speaker y'all let's
turn that dial up all right Sharon Brian
oh oh sure speaker okay I'm I'm thinkin
249 that's that's that's this money
price yeah cuz look also right now mark
it is yeah Google Amazon echo is 179
yeah Google home is at 149 yeah so 29:20
summary out so apples gonna go to 29 to
40 my 2.9 is any price don't forget
Amazon echo dot $40 and when it's on
sale
ya dirty yo that's like next thousand
potential oh oh baby ammonia premium
audio I'm so I'm like on this series
speaker on my shoulder y'all this is
tight the Seri boombox I think they
should not get it up boombox boo boo ba
I'm gonna stop that there's children
watch really yeah I mean they have to
really overhaul teary though they even
make it water so that's the swing Samuel
are you are you like fed up with this
you want a real Syria you want a real
Syria now where you at man yes yeah what
what about what about if the series
speaker was an added feature that came
with an over-the-air update well
actually it's not over there but an
update to your Apple TV I would go I get
it well I have an Apple TV there you go
so I think they needed an something like
that all right Samuel dot is the TV
thanks for calling man he's like yo I
have that I'm 12 years old dad what do
you boy you done with your life Shara is
the sky black on Apple TV dad I got
Apple TV son alright let's do let's go
to our buddy Calvin in Los Angeles or
Louisiana it says LA so I'm gonna guess
your SoCal what's up Calvin hey what's
going on what's going on here
you know what I was calling a dog he
does about the iPad true let's do it my
brother Anthony and I were talking about
how it'd be great if they
actually put Pro applications on it
something like Final Cut Pro would not
look like that because it seems like
they're just putting Pro on these
products just so you know I Christ okay
hold on hold on is this Calvin and
Anthony the brothers the brother yes sir
come on Bryan what's the background here
these are loyal listeners they like to
debate each other their brothers that
like to fight about tech climate in
that's right Dave a message in the
middle of an argument well chat yeah
they need a show man these bros need to
show that's what I'm saying you know
Calvin um with the iPad pro you're
you're preaching man this is exactly
what we're talking about I don't the
thing about it is I don't know if
they're gonna put Final Cut Pro on I
mean they could because it's basically
like iMovie deluxe uh-oh I said that I
sorry I said that out loud but they do
look they need more Pro apps from the
start even when they drop the iPad pro
the whole thing was like this could be
compelling if they release logic like a
foreign an iPad pro that's appropriate
if they release Final Cut Pro they still
haven't done that so maybe they'll make
us happy but we'll see about that I love
what you're thinking though that's what
they need to do like pros you know
really doing well like Microsoft or well
with you know that old thanks but I
don't know man we'll see why don't I
think the only reason that people aren't
completely flocking to the surface pro
yeah some people have their hang-ups
with Windows being quote unquote less
secure but look the surface pro is a
superior product right now if you ignore
ecosystem it just is and so people have
to admit that I mean it's beast and it
can run those apps so look we'll see
what Apple does I hope I'm hoping as an
iPad pro fan that they do the same thing
so thanks for calling Calvin tell your
brother we said what's up all right cool
take care ABT real quick can you shout
out the live block as it is happening
now the live vlog m so right now we have
our editors inside our live blog will
complement this live stream we do need a

let us rebroadcast it so we will kind of
do our talk shop that complements it you
can hang with us and if you want to
sometimes we take calls during the
actual show when they get to some of the
boring stuff that moves so so we'll see
well then we then we don't know wait us
RJ sir saying we don't have a phone
person so chat us tweet us you know live

we'll play them back um yeah just make
you know send up Sunnis okay videos I
mean I'll let Sharon filter through
those no no no Sharon Sharon can filter
through the videos I'm not gonna filter
through those videos alright let's go to
Memphis and talk to Louise Louise what's
up welcome to seen alive how you doing
doing good doing good welcome to the
show what's up what's on your mind I
want an ex about the Apple TV I know
early reports were stating that they
were talking about a 4k model or going
to another edition how you guys hurry
anything else about that thing I don't
think we're gonna see an Apple TV here
today I think we will see TV os I think
we might see the actual Amazon TV app on
the Apple TV a lot of people been
waiting for that I don't expect us to
see actual new hardware for the Apple TV
I could be wrong again you know we don't
always know everything although I do
everything out of a new Apple TV like
you said the 4k capability yeah that
would be that would be the hook um so
we'll see but I don't I don't think
we'll see anything hardware wise today
Amazon Prime supports four
kay video Netflix certain shows support
4k but if it's not there it'll be
sometime during their September event
typically when we actually see an Apple
TV Hardware Apple goes for the mass
market though most people don't have 4k
TVs and I would argue that a lot of
people don't really even know what it is
or what the benefits are that's true and
all Surya people that do have 4k TVs
they're thinking about bandwidth right
right and they're not necessarily going
to be choosing a 4k stream over a
regular 1080p if they don't have the
internet burn oh I I do agree with you
ladies to a certain extent I do also
feel though like out of any you know
obviously it's what for Kay's arguably
been out to consumer at least two or
three years now I think a lot more
people now 4k is just a feature on the
TV that they're buying now also gamers
gamers are really where everyone is
getting 4k TVs because these consoles
are supporting them so I think now is
the right time to at least throw out a
4k product from Apple but we'll see
we'll see you know why you don't you're
on for keeps I want a 4k TV
I want a 4k TV however TVs got so good
like five or six years ago that anyone
who bought their a TV between 2000 and
2010 I don't think they're necessarily
rushing to replace it even if it's 4k
even if there's 3d on it becomes your
said first one okay into the Kirby jump
3d you want the D rights D the day Steve
Steven doesn't want the D
[Laughter]
alright 3d that is uh Louis sorry about
that that completely went in a different
direction you still there with us my man
yeah
he's throwing up in his mouth not even a
space dr have a said you think that's
something that they go with cuz you see
more of these different companies trying
to load these devices up for future
proofing and you know apple still it in
ATP yeah you know what I think you're
you're on the money if we do see
something I expected to be sometime in
September when they do the Apple TV the
thing about it also is with HDR ok was
that the thing about it is with Apple TV
4k HDR these are basically companion you
know features that are on TVs these days
so it's it's going to happen I just
don't think it
gonna happen today but you're right on
the money an HDR there's not a lot of
content to be on dating right now your
game is the big one but in terms of
other content that you're going to be
watching HDR is very thin on the ground
and there's also different
implementations of it and it's hard for
people to kind of understand what it is
without seeing it it's really hard to
explain HDR when you see it you go side
by side with a non HDR and an HDR image
you go oh wow that makes such a huge
difference but trying to explain it it's
like well it's a higher dynamic range
which means you're going to see
basically more color bandwidth than you
get more detail and you know highlights
and shadow detail people like I don't
understand what that means and it's
ironic because there's more awareness
around 4k but it's HDR like you say that
actually has a visible effect for most
people yeah you're really only gonna see
the benefits in in 4k if you have a TV
that's bigger than 65 inches quite
honestly right so at least yeah uh yeah
yeah so anyways thanks so much for
calling Lewis we appreciate it thanks
for hanging out the Cecina live i the
thing is that I've been dying I have a
Panasonic Plasma from like five six
years ago I've been dying to get a HDR
4k TV but I'm not gonna pull the trigger
they're way more affordable this year I
mean that's your specifically Vizio TCL
they're putting out 4k HDR TVs that are
around basically a thousand fourteen
hundred bucks and they're greatly that's
you kind of got a jump on that well I'm
sorry what a fool Kay lost you for us OH
Aleksey and miss Lexie I didn't know
that's that's a decent sized yell bro
from 4k benefits of 42 inches
she knows yeah they are but it's HD it's
not H oh I wish no no I'm just saying I
wish I waited I wish I waited because
age I could have I could have fucked out
yeah but then I decided no it's way too
much so I thought well I'll get at least
one of the features that I was interests
and it was look it was a TV wanted
anyways and it happened about 4k that's
the point is a thing yeah I love how
Shawn was like oh and it had HDR did it
did it not for $350 it didn't did it my
bad
alright Beach can we throw the phone
line up on the on the bottom again if
you guys and gals want to call phone
lines are still completely locked and
loaded every time someone hangs up
someone calls in one eight eight eight
nine hundred cien et
you guys and gals are awesome I do want
to talk about a few things just maybe
some of the other rumblings or rumors we
haven't even talked about it directly at
this keynote we are expecting and most
likely based on the rumors seen the
first launch of the 10.5 inch iPad pro
right this has been a product that we at
least in the rumor mills thinner bezels
just slightly larger than the nine point
seven inch iPad we swear hoping and
possibly going to see that here at the
keynote also rumblings even as far back
as a year ago talked about the Apple
pencil will we see a new Apple pencil to
compliment the new Apple iPad pro I mean
we've done a music video about that that
we might show later in the show really
it's very happy have you seen this you
know about this at all um I've heard
about it shared has not seen it well um
while we talk about and take other phone
calls I'll kindly ask Stephen beat him
to find locate that video and in order
to educate her about the finer things in
really need a music video you really
need one all right let's get let's go
the phone line to see who's been waiting
the longest right now oh my goodness
Brayden from the NYC here at 40 minutes
good I'm Brayden what's up man welcome
to seen alive yeah I was wondering if
you guys have a idea is if I know that
like the echo they have the skills where
you can play the games and you can
enable all this other stuff do you think
that this Apple speaker will do it I
think that the thing about we have to
remember on Apple is Apple is very
controlling and who they allow to be
their partners Siri came out six years
ago they started just recently like this
year adding third party partners with
Siri integration okay and what did the
Amazon echo do they made their API open
instantly available people started
building stuff like I found stuff like
calm ocean sounds to go to sleep from a
dude that just put it out there like the
amazing ability to just open up the
platform can lead to great things and
sometimes not-so-great things but also
that accessibility helped the echo to
explode and just be more useful beyond
the direct partnerships they had I think
Apple is going to be just
is controlling on this I don't expect
them I'm maybe they'll surprise us again
I always like to say that to be an
optimist about like a MacBook Air with a
Retina Display yeah
maybe they'll surprise us heart please
right well I mean it's WWDC the whole
point I mean traditionally is to
introduce something new a platform or
hardware or both and allow the worldwide
developers to prepare to develop for it
so I mean I agree I think it's going to
be much more restrictive than Amazon and
you won't get random ocean sounds from
I've got off the shore of Antarctica it
helps me sleep
it helps me shoot for sure but it's
going to be 399 from the Apple Store
wait wait this is what's gonna be this
ocean sounds what cuz it will cost me
I'm gonna stay on my echo is it a
hundred billion dollars husband spent um
or they they paid out seventy billion to
developers which means Apple themselves
based on their 70/30 yeah revenue split
made thirty billion dollars off of apps
up to this point since they launched the
App Store seventy billion so that's they
created and they created it's a platform
for people to make yeah I mean then
Apple is said time and time again that
their services business I'm not sure if
that includes the App Store and
associated earnings but definitely Apple
music iCloud things like that if they
spun that off when its own to its own
company it would be a fortune 500 Oh
which is huge its massive so they've got
a lot of revenue in these businesses
these other side businesses of course
they want developers to be making sure
that there are going to be applications
and to your point Brian let's be an
optimist about it maybe maybe that's my
oh that's my was very happy
um so yeah Bradon that's that's where
I'd it sounds like you're actually
pretty curious about the series speakers
alright
yeah I actually haven't had Amazon echo
now and I have no excuse for light yep a
lot of smaller smart home stuff and I
was just interested in seeing their to
integrate all this we will see it was
smart speaker comes out
like I would put money on Phillips you
being supported because Apple has sold
those light bulbs indoors for years yeah
yeah so you're all set and yeah all
right thanks so much for calling Braden
appreciate it man thank you I think the
other thing is that when we talk about
developers developers conference homekit
was announced in 2014 is what I had last
read and they didn't really do too much
with it like quite honestly it was like
it was just there they're like we're
gonna create a new thing to make using
their devices easy this is when smart
home appliances or you know light bulbs
light switches we're just starting to
come together and everyone thought I
remember the headlines Apple is going to
make your home easier to use when it's
if they've never they've never made it
truly truly easy it's better but come on
again they need this if they want it to
make it better they need this series
speaker that's a start yeah but other
companies are kind of ahead of ahead of
them on that I just that whole dream of
an easily automated Apple home never
came to be and it still hasn't and it it
may not right away but we'll see what
happens today it's it's just one of
those things where you look back down
like oh they they had Siri in 2011 they
had a home kit in 2014 those are the two
leading platforms right now that are the
hottest spaces and they didn't work on
it and part of it is that they are
spread so thin they have so many things
going on and let's be real they put all
their passion to the Apple watch that
was a directive from Tim Cook and it's a
goodish product but they ignored that
other stuff and now they're trying to
play catch-up a little bit so we'll see
if they can make another jump i it's a
different company than it was before so
you have to also acknowledge how to not
pretend like it's something that you
know it's not but we're always hopeful
optimistic optimistic cautiously
cautiously optimistic up Beechum do we
were able to locate that iPad pro video
at all oh yes I do have we were able to
locate okay so well is this your iPad
pro song yes so so this is our desert
resources though I just want to preface
this Apple has been lacking on the
second lap all has been lacking on their
commercials um you know just not as
inventive as I like on the iPad
Pro and so yes people like this is so
old but we've been sitting on this for a
long time because I was hoping they'd
announce an iPad pro and like March but
they didn't but let's just let's just
let it speak for itself just for a few
seconds right for self it's a standalone
one yes oh maybe IP oh it's only 30
seconds I have an iPad oh I pay a pro I
have a pistol I have an apple missile
iPad pro Oh Apple pencil iPad pro oh the
cringe is on 100 that's gonna be in my
head throughout the entire Keen right
now well I'm gonna have to even keep
that handy because when they announced
the iPad pro you will have will have a
promotional video for it I'm speechless
I'm sorry I know the cringe was that
pretty high pretty high pretty high
that's that's that's what we got paid
for that I just want to let you all know
value for all y'all haters we got paid
for my I'm a sad soul okay let's go over
to the phone lines
gaben Orlando welcome to see that live
oh you see problems in the video still
probably enjoying it if you're
everyone's been actually really good by
turning down the volume um and just
waiting for the call gave what's up
welcome to seen alive hi um so my
question for you is so I remember when
the iPad pros first released and I
remember the surface pros out and they
had Windows on it so I was like I wanted
to know why would I want to know if ever
this is just your opinion with Apple
ever put I don't know even a different
version like a Mac OS X on an iPad pro
you're talking about the dream the big
elusive dream that I believe Apple has
he
that it's not going to happen I think
that everyone kind of wants to know is i
OS and mac OS going to come closer and
closer together to be this one universal
platform allow Windows 10 and you know
how you can basically transfer from one
device to another docking for example
like a surface book where it suddenly
becomes a tablet and you have the full
functionality Windows 10 just slightly
different interface tweaks I don't think
exactly I really don't think it's it's
going to happen I'm pretty pretty sure
that Apple has time and time is again
kind of given enough hint saying that
they are two separate entities and even
that I might visually come together a
little more that I don't think they can
emerge into that Universal OS that maybe
we're looking for I think the other
thing that really tells you all you need
to know is that at the latest earnings
report Tim Cook outright said the iPad
pro is not a replacement for a laptop
and so by just throwing that quote out
there he clearly sees them as separate
products he clearly doesn't feel like
that the iPad pro deserves or should get
some of the functionality that a laptop
has which is kind of blows your mind
like it do give us something we saw
earlier for those you who maybe tune in
later that Apple leaked out a files app
specifically for the iPad pro that which
looks like some sort of file navigation
system that we might see here now today
but that's still not good enough and
like to Lexi's point and really to Tim
Cook's point I don't think they're ever
going to do it at least in the next two
years I mean this is the chance to do
with the surface pro has been out for so
long I've been looking at thing I'm like
dude give us some of that on the iPad
pro just something right and we got
asked we got split screen drag so they
can either choose to surprise us and the
lightest or they can choose to kind of
have us go really you guys still haven't
done much we'll see maybe they've
they'll find some middles middle ground
but cautiously optomistic is the key
word first day yeah um I also wanted it
like cuz yeah I don't know I thought
maybe they would do probably not likely
but do you think they would ever come
out with like a touch screen MacBook Pro
did you hear did you hear Steven Beach
I'm laughing about Steven's ha ha ha
Steven talk to me about that no they're
they're totally against it they see that
the you know the the trackpad on the on
their laptops they see that as the
touchscreen and they've come out against
it like they don't see a future for that
so you mean even though I constantly try
to tap my screen my kids do too they
always try to scroll my screen my you
know and that's the future of an Apple
user you know like children who are who
are all using touchscreens on a regular
basis now guys that's what the touch bar
is for oh don't get me started on so
realistic and logical
wait hold on let me do you have your
thermos is the Apple kool-aid in your
thermos oh yeah I just wanted to check I
think there's actual Apple kool-aid in
her drink there's more juice guys but
yeah the touch bar I'm not gonna poop on
it more than I have because everyone
like gets mad when I get a little overly
critical but come on it that I have not
heard okay for example you just got this
new MacBook Pro recently you've had it
for a few weeks
how much better or more frustrating or
where do you stand with this touch bar
the touch bar is not as frustrating as I
thought it would be however I do miss
the function buttons and I do miss the
ability to easily tap through and change
my volume or mute or whatever I want to
do however which is a very basic
function very basic functionality that I
would hope that there would be an easy
way to access however I've kind of been
a surprised in my day to day application
application usage I there hasn't really
been a situation where the touch bar has
kind of got it wrong I have to say like
I'm in a music app and my volume and
controls are everything up are up there
I'm doing some other kind of editing and
then the right controls where I need
them to be I I think it's not as it's
honestly not as disjointed as I thought
it was just say you like it Lexi because
it's not necessary because it's not good
right it doesn't it but because it's
there and now this is the only way yeah
that's all you have to use it you're
happy and touched by now so I have to
live with this and there's not gonna be
any going back I don't think they're
gonna suddenly reverse and go oh you
know what we're gonna put function
buttons back in my favorite part is the
emoji No
here's Peter I just think that look and
also this comes from a different
perspective we have some of us have
these MacBook Pros for work but I'm just
telling you if I had to put my own money
down on it
I want a 15-inch new MacBook Pro with a
physical bar on the top I think the fact
that it doesn't have haptic feedback on
it is weird it does feel it feels it
feels weird without any type of haptic
feedback when it's on a keyboard which
are used to some sort of tactile
response I think that's one way they can
improve it but again it's disconcerting
to know that sure I get why they put the
touch bar only in the 15 and they let
the 13 have one that doesn't have one
and I think it's like a 200 or $300
price difference give me one that's $300
that doesn't have a touch bar but that
would be an admission by Apple that it's
not as necessary or what Walt desired by
their consumer base you know that I
think there's a lot of times where they
aren't hearing there they're different
like before they used to tell us what we
wanted before we knew we wanted it I
know it sounds very corny but it is true
now they're not even listening to what
we wanted the touch screen is different
Apple yeah totally like what how can you
do this to us
that is a different that is a different
type of company that isn't even
listening to what their consumers want
and still believing that we can show you
what you want when everyone is saying
not really it's a different thinking but
how much of this is concerned that they
don't want to cannibalize existing
markets like bringing together the Mac
and the iPad would essentially kill the
iPad so there it's time to admit that
Apple has a redundancy problem yes we
don't get all three or four or five
product types we need I mean what we
really need is basically like a surface
laptop yeah exactly that has the best of
all worlds and then you can get rid of
the iPad that's that yeah that that
started how many three four four or five
years ago yeah okay just want to put
that okay um Beechum how's the keynote
started yet has started I mean they're
just doing like flyover shots of the
crown stone okay okay what hasn't really
begun yet so what we'll wait and do guys
and gals is that once the keynote starts
we're
switch over again we cannot stream that
if you guys want to go watch it
somewhere else we totally understand we
have our post show which we will be
taking calls um let me just bang through
some of these calls now once the
keynotes starts and our team is live
blogging inside we're going to
transition with a little play-by-play
and talk about it as the show is
happening but we won't be able to watch
it directly so let's just get into here
thanks Gabe for calling I did hang up on
you because we were talking let's go to
Chuck in Philly
what up Chuck welcome to show package
chat but thanks a lot
oh I'm sorry I didn't write that that's
okay I was going to college in August he
wants a MacBook Pro and I hear the new
ones are going to have the KB Lake chips
yes question is they probably won't be
they will be announced maybe today but
won't be out until who knows when
October November December
so do you wait for one you just buy
what's currently available here's here's
what my take on it I think you actually
not only do you wait for it it's going
to come sooner than you think and the
reason why is that um Apple people that
were ordering recent new MacBook Pros
for some reason they're shipping dates
got pushed out to weeks and which is
actually not normal it's not like
they're running out of it and my hunch
is that these new new new MacBook Pros
with the KB Lake processor will most
likely be available within the next
month so I think I would just sit tight
and no matter what don't get the earlier
gen even if it you know that you said
it's for someone who's going back to
school yeah starting in late August
early can I make a suggestion
I would please suggest that you wait
until you see benchmarks because early
benchmarks on PCs have shown that there
isn't a significant improvement in
battery life nor does it significantly
improve speed so if that's the case on
the math book then what you might find
yourself doing is waiting for that new
laptop to come out and then getting the
last version at a nice discount whether
it's refurbished or otherwise you again
like I think that if the benchmarks are
what they've shown for the PCs you won't
be that impressed by the Cape you like
processor
KB like will give you a little boost but
it's more about battery life right
you'll probably get about an hour a
little more than that
more battery life out of it but you know
for me I'm just so the school about if
if they're just announce it I'm going to
get them in general I'm going to get the
new one unless it's a touch bar MacBook
Pro I'd be like give me one that doesn't
have a touch bar on it
interesting idea to save a few dollars
since my last year of college was four
thousand dollars and my son's this year
will be seventy two thousand dollars so
I congratulate congratulations
yeah you won
thank you very much thank you so much
for calling appreciate it
yeah times have change y'all 72 whoo all
right let's go out I'll take if I have
this correct eaten in Alabama what's up
Eton oh my god just has to be the best
Ivy's ever DC ever I could I leave I'm
actually talking to you Oh what up my
man we're talking to you
we're talking to you oh you're not
talking about the baby
I am currently watching the live stream
on my iPhone yes please oh it's
real-time DC 2017 has officially kicked
off but my question to you guys was um
my friend or else Alexandra is texting
me as we speak and we're having an I
guess a disagreement about a refresh of
the iPod product line
wait wait did you do it right are we
going prehistoric age right now are we
going back we really are they could give
up on all these innovations of give up
on the product - let it die yeah I'm
always fanatical all Apple products
though I think there's still a market
present well you didn't how about this I
will tell you there's always a market
for any Apple product but if you want to
go Apple's not gonna put any more money
into the iPod they're just gonna keep
the ones that they have really eBay is
going to be the next market for the
iPods and everything that we have plays
music shout-out to Darrell also you know
cuz he's your boy but um I think that if
you're a fan of Apple products sometimes
you gotta let things go too like if you
love something let it go you know and
maybe this maybe it comes back to you on
eBay you don't mean like like so you
know what I'm stoked that you know
you're here talking to us and we're
excited for WWDC but iPods Apple hasn't
even included it
in their earnings for at least the past
two years now I believe so we probably
won't see it but um thank you so much
for kama man we appreciate thanks for
being our scene everyone that argument
yeah all right all right
shout out to Tyrell okay so we're we're
gonna jump over to the live blog right
now there are people that are on the
phone lines if you want to wait and
there's opportunities for us to get you
within the keynote we will but right now
we're gonna jump over our live blog can
see photos if you want to jump over to
Apple stream it's all good you got timed
out it's all good we're hanging out with
you so right now they're just showing a
general video it looks like some sort of
a sketch of Scott signs describing it as
bordering on a Silicon Valley feel but
it's showing up an Apple data center
looks like there's Russian words in the
background some sort of like they're in
a different country somewhere in this
video how to ask you I'm gonna stay away
from any Russia comments a period for
fear of any kind of backlash for fear of
Steven Beecham talking about specific
type of news thang news bad news this is
all real news this is all real all right
so I think they're playing up on a fun
thing with a world with no apps and why
apps are important the apps is shutting
down my WWDC is here for there for you
and for the apps that's what we do
without apps that's true though I would
be okay without me enjoying my life well
how would you even get from point A to
point B bruh I don't know I mean how do
we be printing up pieces of paper you
mean you mean like this it's like this
oh yeah MapQuest while they're playing
this while they're playing this promo
video real quick before they start the
keynote our keynote bingo starts now so
if you see or hear them say any of these
terms or talk about them we have great
ones like it's always a classic Craig
federighi Air Force One Phil Schiller's
voice cracking the word tremendous
someone taking a picture with their iPad
just things like that dark mode a rumor
thing in Iowa's 11 so if you want to
participate
you get five in a row any direction
screen cap it and send it to us hashtag
seen it live and we've got gifts for you
spec cases and Belkin lightning cables
we got 14 prizes so y'all could be
winners and I better not see this stuff
on eBay I'm gonna track you down oh my
god I will track I will hunt you down
alright it looks like Tim is on stage
and says welcome to WWDC it's great to
be back in San Jose the heart of Silicon
Valley and right down the street from
Apple and our new campus shard Timken
our reporter on site one of our many
reporters says it's been 15 years since
WWDC has been in San Jose this is going
to be according to cook the best and
biggest WWDC ever are we going to get a
one more thing that would be fun they
they've killed that but sometimes I
think bringing it they do with this
right they did it one time yeah they did
with The Watcher right they did with the
watch it was like I didn't see that one
coming
remember this is the optimist WWD all
right so I got a heart we got hurt for
something cops
cautiously optimistic right that's right
cautiously cautiously so uh yeah they're
setting up the stage here I'm still like
I said before earlier ladies I'm super
excited about this WWDC I think we could
see week this is Apple's chance to
actually wow us one of the few times
it's a huge potential here and I hope
that they really step up to the mark and
something exciting happens yeah that is
out of the ordinary it is something that
the rumors weren't pointing to that it's
a product that truly makes us go yeah
okay Apple is actually I'm going to be
innovating rather than just following
and making like a very good product but
something that is you know two three
years behind the competition so crossing
my fingers there's gonna be something
good and something exciting here well
they did say biggest and best so it's
it's always it's always this is one of
the bingo spots actually it does not
occupy Tim Cook
yeah but Markoff Tim Cook on your main
go card you do X oh yeah you can do
whatever you want you could do swirly
sign didn't say good morning he didn't I
know that screwed me up expected one
maybe someone else might say good
morning but every key note he has um he
has said good morning they're talking
about just how many developers are
registered for
WDC 16 million registered developers of
those 16 million 5300 attendees there's
a there's a lottery system to actually
even get into WWDC so it's there's never
a guarantee I do also want to remind you
that the center spot here which is a
free spot on our bingo card is Warriors
up to Oh make sure you mark that
Warriors up to oh just in case you to
hear that warriors up to zero so they
always start with I always find that
Apple starts with the heartwarming story
when they open the keynote or anything
and this time it turns out that there is
a ten-year-old coda in the audience we
started coding when he was six and he
already has five apps in the absolute
what are we doing with her I was done
weighted wasted guys like it but a skunk
streak in my hair some kids developing
five apps
my kids are collecting snails outside
haha dude honestly your kids are badass
cuz they're interacting with nature yeah
I'm trying to give them stop killing
animals oh wow I'm just kidding I'm
kidding
yo y'all kidding joke joke not not
totally not true they totally not
killing snails totally not true
they're just motion to collect them now
alright Tim Cook is a transitioning over
and saying let's turn our attention to
four incredible platforms which is
uniquely expressed and designed for the
best experiences for where they were a
flash up on the screen TV OS watch OS
Mac OS or Knuckles watch chuckles watch
Oh Steve Oz I oz is Mickey we've seen
the platform's forward um that's why
developer conference is so important we
have a lot to talk today about today and
I do mean a lot six important
announcements to share with you this
morning
dang that we can already cross off TV OS
watch OS oh my finger cut guy you're
right yeah we can we can't bingo bingo
baby
I mean kind of Mac OS 10.13 though
which one you said watch OS watch OS t
v-- OS we got that marked off of - I'm
close I don't even tell me
come on Amazon video Apple TV hey you
know what the TV OS is our first thing
they're doing right now they might see
it we just launched the support from a
handful of video channels there's now 50
partners integrated into the TV app
these are Tim cokes words on stage man
Beach if you win this right out the gate
again hashtag Cena live with the winning
card yeah I mean I might kiss you but I
don't donate my Parmesan is coming to
the TV app and all Apple TV's hey did
you literally get five in a row already
brought ya know your friends ten point
five inch iPad pro is what I need ooh
well that's a that's an iOS that's at
the very end of the keynote man man good
luck with that that's not gonna happen
so prime video provides a wealth of
great content some great original
content like transparent Mozart in the
jungle and so much more we're pleased to
welcome Amazon to Apple TV this has been
one of the big holes in the story was
that basically Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook
sat down in a room and just like let's
just do this damn thing grinded it out
from the top and now we have Amazon on
the Apple TV that was reported by recode
maybe about a few weeks ago he's already
jumping over he's all you'll hear a lot
more about TV OS later this year sorry
y'all have happy it what let's talk
about hey I keeping let's talk about the
Apple watch all right
like yeah that was it TV OS so number
one selling Smart Watch by far evil yeah
yeah yeah button I never really sales
Figgis or we just have to take their
word for it I think that we can I see
way I see way more Apple watches when I
did before I I would I think once
they've got to the second gen in the
first gen was so much cheaper a lot more
people bottom like for like Black Friday
and stuff like that um Tim Cook is
saying Apple watch is designed to help
you live a healthier life we know
there's a lot of stories of Apple really
beefing up their team potentially having
a way for the
sensors in the future Apple watch
designs to incorporate being able to
measure blood sugar levels and more I
don't think we'll see that today because
that could be its own event I could be
wrong but they are going to tout about
watch OS and last year's WWDC watch who
has significantly changed to a version
of the OS that I felt was appropriate to
it it was kind of an admission that
their first run was a little misguided
and just not up to snuff
I do like watch O's are we add Watchers
watch this trace yeah well just trace
sees Quattro mijo let's start with Apple
watch faces they're going to quick ways
to glance at information so new watch
faces coming here we go the new watch
there will be a new watch face powered
by Siri intelligence okay this is this
is what we're hoping for and talking
about is that predictive artificial
intelligence that hopefully they take
beyond the watch I know they've tried to
introduce it to the iPhone but I don't
have you guys noticed the proactive Siri
feature I mean I don't notice a me in
your notifications yeah with directions
right like you should leave now for your
next meeting thanks of because there's
heavy traffic right but it's now just a
notification rather than necessarily
something that I actively have to search
for and that's it that's in I mean it's
it's useful however when I'm clearly not
in the vicinity of what it's not
intelligent about it I'm not in the
vicinity of where my meeting is I'm not
in my usual space for example I'm at the
airport and it's like you should get to
the office now you have a meeting I'm
like I'm knowing me the office I'm not
where I normally am this yeah day every
day maybe don't give me that
notification cuz I'm not gonna head to
the office for that meeting right I'm
missing that one right glanceable
information has been a big kind of hole
in Apple's operating system we know that
Google has they know a lot about us and
they've kind of mastered that but
they're showing off screenshots of how
as your schedule goes along this
glanceable information will show up of
course they're throwing in their little
breather like hey take a minute to
breathe like you know show me where I
need to go Thanks my brain does that
formula Suns yeah
ah hey we're talking on meditation each
other with more meditation and attitude
like that would exist you like the
sunset though notification tells you
when the sun's going down yeah you know
oh yeah it only matters when it matters
to you right it only made know when the
sun's gonna go down and my golf round
that's good this is throughout the day
whenever you raise your wrist the face
will dynamically update with information
for you there's a kaleidoscope watch
face with a trippy psychedelic animation
that might be even more psychedelic
depending on what you're doing that
night mmm
the lightest go really intimate I mean
I'm wondering it how this is going to
affect battery life all this all these
proactive notification well to me it's
like when you lift it up your Apple
watching how the cool jellyfish like I
was totally okay with that I was like
I'm okay with the jellyfish because it
looks dope right so and it didn't do
much Toy Story characters yes more
animated watch faces right yep mm-hmm
this is why don't like so 15 years ago
yeah yeah when was the last any story
quite honestly oh this is a missed
opportunity should have been putting out
cars
faces cars the movie is coming miss
opportunity come on you guys you want I
need a new marketing director are you
tired of Phil Schiller's voice cracking
all the time are you tired come I roll
out with scene that live all right let's
just do this already they want to talk
about Activity one of the most
frequently used apps on the watch you
might start off each day with some
inspiration
they're going to introduce monthly
challenges in the activity watch to
motivate you they're all achievable
because they're based on your real
history so this is again kind of
proactive intelligence and kind of
showing this in two ways glanceable
information as well as within the
activity app so step in the right
direction I think this is subtle stuff
that you'll actually end up enjoying but
not be like I can't I got this Apple
watch for its predictive intelligence
you know it's those things that needs
that should just be there yeah here's a
question that are so are you guys using
Apple devices in any way for to motivate
you to be more fit or they just
is it just more of a companion to how
you live your life well I I don't earn
an apple watch I think if I did have an
Apple watch I might be more motivated to
use it as a tool to help workouts to
help actually motivate me in that
respect at the moment I don't do I don't
use my iPhone for that either I mean
only because it's it's bulky I don't
know when I'm trying to run or something
with it it's it's not really something
that I want to be carrying and
constantly looking at and to track my
workout goals if I had to watch perhaps
maybe I would do that and I wouldn't
have the need to carry the phone at all
yeah but you know I I still just I just
don't want exercise with a tool I just
wanted as my music machine right just to
something to listen to music through and
that's all I want to use it for and
maybe a timer and that's it I don't
really want it to motivate me for my
workout goals and just for like get off
your lazy like I don't need the phone or
the watch to tell me that I can decide
myself away like right exactly
sure has it helped you or motivated you
to be like in the long run not even just
like oh no I tried taking it to the gym
a few times and it was just so much work
and I was that person like yeah for
instance I took it once into a class and
that was that person he was like
hahahaha you know and it's embarrassing
be it just doesn't really add I'm like
I'm doing all this work distracting
myself getting out of my headspace not
burning as much just so that I can track
it to what end I'm already doing the
work so what's what's the real benefit
I'm not sure it sounds like Apple right
now is trying to address some of that I
also felt like it just wasn't matching
the results weren't matching with what I
did not not necessarily calories because
that's so honestly hard to measure it's
going to take a long time before we can
actually accurately measure calorie burn
but even the time the you know the heart
rate I just it felt truly inaccurate
which is ridiculous no I agree you know
even though they did a test out in like
UCSF about how the Apple watch has some
of the most accurate heart beat you know
heart rate sensing from a step
standpoint from a movement standpoint
it's highly inaccurate I've taken it on
hikes I
we're Fitbit on the same wrist I look at
the distance that this hike is supposed
to be yeah
the Fitbit will be like within 1.1 of a
mile the Apple watch will be like a mile
off
you know yeah and for so I don't trust
it as much right and I know that there's
supposed to be a way not as opposed to
there's a way to condition it to learn
yourselves like it shouldn't even need
that yeah like it's it's supposed to be
smart enough to be able to do that so
look the whole Apple watch platform that
their time out here with health and
motivation they're talking about how not
only can it incorporate workouts it'll
be able to talk to some of the fitness
equipment at your gym back and forth
like data exchange between the two to
show your readout on their screens of
the workout fitness equipment as well as
the phone I'm sorry as well as the watch
I know people do desire that but I've
never felt personally that this is me
personally that the Apple watch is
actually made me work out more I think
it's biggest effect is people that are
unaware of how inactive they are it
might motivate them to walk a little
more but not come it's a companion for
people that already workout
people say oh yeah I like that if you're
already there but it hasn't been like
I've never seen my Apple watch and said
oh I should go workout today
right it's never been it's never
happened he's not inspired it's never
happened I mean you know any what Sharon
said like I see people like that at the
gym and they're busy you know they're
busy with their phone like aunt like
graphs and like paperwork and stuff I'm
like I'm sitting there lifting and I'm
like like they're too busy over there so
that's kind of funny they're also
showing off a new a new dock for the
Apple watch that can basically sit
vertically as well from what I believe
what we're what we're what we're looking
at here they're showing the demo
obviously of some of the functionality
that they're talking about they're
showing a real live demo so the activity
coaching but from what I read here um it
looks like there's a new dock another
new dock oh sorry
a new dock meaning there's the dock that
was was landscape when you swipe through
apps right a new dock functionality on
the phone right now that's right not not
a physical dock I'm sorry about that
that's what happens when we don't
actually watch the a keynote
we have a bingo someone go to bingo so
we got a bingo scene that live okay hold
on let me let me get let me get this
pulled up for you guys just so we can
shout out to Lee what about texting I
live is this our first one winner
chicken dinner
yeah looks like it hold on let me scroll
down here to most uh where's sorry I'm
getting there we got we got a we got a
diagonal one from top right - sure
where's the before used to be like most
recent oh this was Twitter's changed it
to the ones that they want you to see ah
seriously i sweet I can't get on to
tweet deck that's sequential okay well
but it looks like we have a winner I put
in hashtag Cena alive and I used to be
able to just be like most recent yeah
well lazy I feel like you win a Twitter
page okay
oh so it's Diddy tag Bryant on it okay
let's go here alright if you guys really
care about this and you want to see your
your board on the big screen just do at
Bryant ah yeah Lee Waterman
congratulations you are first winner I'm
gonna pick out this really cool pink
case for you with flowers I'm just
kidding we'll figure it out okay I'll
mark all that but the bingo card is real
bingo card is real here it's seen that
live yeah music I'm gonna start just
people might be hurting themselves if
they watch that alright alright so
someone say good morning I don't I never
heard it did someone say good morning
someone say they say good morning I
never heard that did he say the trusses
oh we have to trust hmm there there was
the best we've ever heard there's been
like four people it's kinda see the
thing is that there's kind of sometimes
loose interpretations fair favor right
yeah but good morning we didn't hear it
yeah well we did we would yeah that's
fine yeah but I'm a little bit but we
trust we trust mine so their time out
watch oh s four is a great update it'll
be available in fall Tim Cook is coming
up on stage the Developer Preview is
available today it'll be a free upgrade
for everyone across all watches this
fall
bottom line watch OS 4 gets a little
smarter more predictive and helps you
with activity stuff but that's it
nothing that would compel you to
you like what about the Toy Story watch
face oh right let's not do a castle
let's not forget the bear the headline
was buried in there I'm sorry I'm sorry
really apologize guys and gals
alright the Mack it looks like the Mac
is next up finally they're jamming
through this stuff which means you know
why it's because a lot of hard work a
lot harder stuff coming yeah so yeah in
kind of in a weird way it probably might
be a little disappointing if they don't
focus enough on or if there's not enough
software stuff I think they might be
saving a good chunk of time for
something new yeah you went and save the
best for last
that's a great song by the way Vanessa
Williams oh yeah yeah totally it's okay
I hope you keep jamming out that's okay
Craig federighi he's on stage Craig
Harris one market on your bingo card
Hair Force one let's talk about okay not
yet they didn't say um ah yeah Mac Craig
federighi yeah he's like he said let's
talk about our current release of Mac OS
Sierra or what we like to call ma close
Sierra
I need like a classical guitar go but I
mean that's really not me
yeah you mean a classical or
stereotypical I mean depends on classic
it's a classical guitar type of guitar
true I just don't want all my peeps
watching me like that's racist
that's racist oh then you Matt Goss Mac
OS is called high sierra no it's not of
course oh yeah really high so real high
sierra there's a photo oh yeah you tell
me it's right backless hi guys Sierra
this is hang on amazing oh this I
actually love it this is it okay so
Shara's just tweeted the support we
talked to the guys and we said this
might be misconstrued but they assured
us this name is Felipe oh so very
California
so California it's it you know legalized
this is Apple going to introduce an
apple vape yeah yes it's a smartphone
with Siri finally all are smart vapors
out there representing the like yes no
it's an Apple pencil vapor yeah Apple
pencil a baseball pain he took like yeah
okay okay we save that we're getting
we're getting crazy here already well
looky so also by saying MCOs Mac OS hi
Sierra it's not a significant upgrade
right this is going to be even smaller
incremental stuff you won't see any
major new revamps of features or UI so
that also kind of indicates that they're
going to start off a little bit with
severe Safari so I can I talk right now
but Safari is a serene browsing
experience did they really say that oh
yeah it's a word serene we should have
had that on the finger cuts I'm sorry I
didn't think they were bad warranty to
use the word serene in Aquino describe
sorry courage for an idiot serenity now
cease it's like the breed acid here we
go this is the best feature here we now
have autoplay blocking Oh No that's
coming to Firefox too
I'm sorry y'all I'm a fan of that I want
to keep my job I want to keep my job but
I'm a fan of that I just I wonder how it
works can you opt in if you're into that
thing I I would argue that a nurse it's
just check mark check bug check mark
right it's absolutely it's a check mark
because I think that people are actually
getting used to Auto playing videos
although I understand that for your data
connection its Bad News Bears
i'ma say I ain't not even on facebook
facebook in I mean yeah that's Facebook
a difference I expect in a facebook but
it's just like you know I'm not the
biggest fan let's just put it that way
but I get it and you know what here's
the thing advertisers are gonna have to
be more creative now as more at autoplay
blockers there or guess what just make
awesome content so people don't care
about the aspects like seriously that's
all that's how you do it
like the Apple pen
video that should autoplay I think we
might if we haven't already lost half of
our viewers
we might if we autoplay that crap but I
love making it we might we might um they
we actually have more viewers now than
we had oh hell yeah oh no it's just a
little downslope no no no just take down
when they showed Brian's face again
um collapse about Mac OS are a little
half-hearted here
according to char tip canoes inside the
room addition to talking about Safari
you there's privacy but your browsing
history is your own so it's not about
blocking ads the web behaves like it
always has Craig federighi is really
just trying to sell us on this
intelligent tracking prevention you know
a lot of people use the dust or desktop
the native Mail app for Macs so it
sounds like there are a lot of welcome
yeah improvements here like the split
view with the compose window on the
right that's very convenient oh that's
interesting instead of it popping up on
top yeah alright that's that's they also
said a storage space required for mail
up to 35% less hmm they're improving um
faces here this looks like they're
transitioning over to photos they're
going through this pretty fast facial
recognition in Apple's Photos app
they've improved that when you put
efforts into naming people it's now
synchronized automatically across your
devices that's interesting Felicity it's
what we say conversions I want to see
how affected this is because Apple
photos traditionally has been really bad
at facial recognition it has at least
three instances of me as separate before
wow it has me with no glasses me with
sunglasses and me with glasses wait wait
are you sure I'm three different people
are you sure the phone is just not
detecting that you exist in the
multiverse
well it's interesting cuz in this
picture of the people there's a girl
like blowing a bubble like a bubblegum
like how can it tell how can it read her
face based on the with the bubble in
front the eyes man oh wait picha Beecham
the eyes why are you why are you even
questioning apple faces technology why
would you question this is amazing that
they would put that behind which is
really really good at it oh my god guys
what printed photo books oh my god guys
Google did this this year hold on I need
I need a reminder I need you to rewind
that Apple did that with iPhoto
oh yes back in maybe arguably 2007 but I
think I think you thousand seventeen is
the resurgence of photo vocalises girls
done it and now apples like haha yeah
everything is cyclical is pegged pants Z
cavariccis come on start I got you bro
yeah z cavalry she coming back
Peggy ole pants there's a startup called
chat books that I would say has a
brought back the printed photo book you
laugh but they have like forty million
dollars in funding man no I there's a
laughing a Z camera oh I was like what
there's nothing funny about chat books
just look him up
z kaveri to like insane it was like
these like my old like baggy slash
tapered pants that everyone wanted funny
and then the trend might have lasted a
year when you were like in fifth or
sixth grade like harem it was like
there's a big deal um sixty four-bit top
to bottom security with built in crash
protection native encryption instant
file and directory cloning there's
breaking down how ultra responsive it is
this is stuff that's happening obviously
in the background i really find it
interesting that the thing that I didn't
like when Google announced photo books
recently is that it was so impersonal
like oh the algorithm does it all for
you and like you can edit it before get
a file you can you can but like the
basically with the press of the button
it made the photo book and I don't know
I'm sorry there's a part of me that
likes to like choose the photos myself
you know I mean how are you are you all
about sup are you stay personal me
yes I am because I still haven't printed
any not a single wedding photo from
three years ago if Google is like I got
this
I would buy ten different books well
this thing they got it I got this well
maybe maybe you should do your first
like my wedding I'm a millennial yeah I
need it all done for me it's in the
cloud it's in the cloud chair no
whereabouts in the cloud
um h.265 high efficiency video coding
will also be a part of this so that's
going to help with graphics overall
graphics GPU performance API for high
performance graphics is metal they
introduced that a while ago a few WWDC s
as well but h.265 2h two five six new
standard saves up to 40% with better
compression and this is also part of
write HD to 4k to 4k HDR you need better
compression to handle these large files
as well as for your video editors yeah
I'm I'm wondering what we'll see if
we'll see yeah we won't see any Mac Pro
stuff I mean nothing tells us that we
will but Mac Pro either end of the year
or early next year since they just
started it yeah they decided to just
start that project earlier this year
it's so sad so yeah the newest Mac's he
says they didn't define which ones yet
get the hardware acceleration for new
h.265 videos it'll be interesting to see
that their new version of metal 2
graphics engine a great opposition's
tremendous ap is 10 times better draw
call throughput thank God it's you know
it's always interesting though no matter
what yeah is that one let's put it that
way
the Mac will never be a go-to gaming
platform and they you know it's okay I
know that yeah they did I think okay
it's alright I was got Starcraft on it
they brought back Starcraft that was a
badass we got a couple more bingos I do
leave yeah oh my goodness have you seen
all these new ones I'm just getting old
it on TweetDeck
Oh your cheque card fan god Oliver ban
Wynkoop are they are they putting my
alright n-not guys guys if you want King
Brian if you want to be a part of the
big show you got to put out Brian's on
its who can show it off I got Jimmy
Schaffer up in here
we got Sammy Jacob Asadi we got Hamza
juicer we see star o got the bingo black
music
copying people yeah hurry all you you
said as reference on iOS 11 really they
did to iOS 11 yet they said iOS but not
iOS 11 that isn't that that didn't count
towards their bingo win though
oh you're right yeah it doesn't matter
yeah it's it wasn't part of the five
across wow Steven really getting
specific there yeah rules rules baby
you're looking out you're looking out
for sISTAR oh he thanks you did someone
take a picture with the iPad I'm sorry
all these to police for real all right
all I need is augmented reality cool so
I'm not gonna win I've kind of lost
track of I you know Dan Ackerman makes a
great point remember VR and AR or mix
reality apps and app development require
very very heavy-duty GPU power and it's
an area that Apple is getting very
seriously into they've built out an
entire team they've had they have
hundreds of engineers working on their
new AR platform which we probably won't
we might hear some about but not in
depth there's been plenty of stories
that Apple is working on some sort of an
AR type of glasses but it still a ways
out so for them to be competitive with
what is happening and how things are
changing because look it's not gonna
happen this year it's not gonna happen
in three years I might happen in three
years but there's going to be a point
where the phone is we wait we won't even
eat our phones there will be a point not
anytime soon soon but you know whether
it's our watch our glasses that'll be
the new phone there's gonna be a point
where are we implanted into our face oh
my god it's gonna take a while for
glasses to become mainstream really and
it's going to be acceptable because we
saw the backlash against Google glass
spectacles we really they didn't sell
that many at all they're sold at less
than
thousands yes really yeah so that's what
they it is that well I mean their
marketing campaign really shot them in
the foot they made a lot of hype but
then it made them really difficult to
access obviously and so when the I when
the company went public and the IPO came
out they had sales figures and then in
like the last two quarters basically
since they were were tracking sales it
was less than a hundred thousand was
like 96 thousand or something
hey bro uh can you go to my screen real
quick here Steve yep the guy corner from
NYC said de Brian's Hong really bring up
Zeke have a reaching wait a minute those
are cute I would wear the ones in the
middle I'll bring it on taking you back
I'm taking you back those are back man
they are everything's coming back I told
you cyclical pigpen pay PEG peg your
pants alright high sierra available
today for developers public beta in june
you know what's also interesting though
about the um oh no my brain literally
just farted yeah the the augmented
reality glasses
thanks for the fart sound effect i
appreciate that uh if there's it sounds
kooky but if there's any space where
apple can surprise us like you said
google glass looked horrible and they
they were trying to sell a beta product
which was not what it was you know
google learning from their mistakes
snapchat glasses not so great let's say
in two years apple drops it an actual
pair of glasses that not only look
stylish but can do things we care about
they might be the company that might be
there next thing like i could see it
right how things have lined up no one's
really mastered it yet hololens awesome
but still too big
i'm not yeah hololens um magically we
don't know where they're really at with
that maybe that's looking down the line
somewhere that apple could actually make
a dent and be like oh thanks i got it
they got us back again and i don't know
but i'm saying just how things are lined
up yeah it's harley and there's a lot of
other companies doing a i'll glasses
that are really quite exciting and quite
good but these are really for
applications that are industrial they
use foreign governments and they're not
useful for consumers at all like you're
not going to drop three-and-a-half
thousand dollars on a pair of AR glasses
that you can't do anything with because
there's no consumer application right so
apple could possibly get that yeah while
we're hanging out and talking uh looks
like they're talking about new hardware
for the imac they're jumping over to
max this is a we did not expect to see
IMAX itself but they're going to be
putting in the best Mac displays ever
500 nits measure brightness 43 percent
brighter 10 bit did the rain 1 billion
colors they will be loaded with the
seventh gen Intel Core KB Lake
processors this is a lot of people asked
about IMAX and we did on expect to see
them here today but KB Lake is coming to
the iMac family the 21.5 inch will get
up to 32 gigs larger size can have up to
64 gigs of memory fusion drive is
standard on all configurations and
solid-state drive options up to 50%
faster and 2 terabytes ooh
iMac lovers are gonna love this and look
USB ports at the back not USB see or do
they have both yeah but but they're not
going exactly serve the USB seems
interesting to see good is an
interesting thing to USB see hey you
guys still tuning in okay
second we're still there oh we don't
have an IMAX quite it wasn't on the
radar which is great this is did we talk
about surprises we don't surprise you um
and they're time out the faster graphics
up to 80% faster performance the
entry-level iMac will get an Intel iris
plus graphics chip let's see what they
talk about the higher-end one that
there's a 21.5 inch iMac with a retina
4k display it's also going to be moving
over to discrete graphics AMD ready
Radeon Pro it there's a typo it's Radeon
not radio but you know they're typing
only fast radio Pro Radeon pro/5 555 and
560 new system is three times faster
graphics and lastly they're 27 inch iMac
Radeon Pro of 570 and 575 yeah up to 8
gigs of VRAM 5k display as usual on the
large screen 27-inch iMac and it was
great yeah
the discreet graphics is a big day yes
and also on an iMac yeah an iMac is huge
deal and also talking about the direct
quote is a great platform for VR content
creation
oh yeah bad very sure make sure what the
is that an oculus next to it or what
what VR
vive survive Aviva Aviva Viva um
Industrial Light magics John Knoll is
coming to stage to talk about how the
power of the new iMac will aid in this
process he says I've always done my art
and development on a Mac this is
interesting because you know right now
people for the most part people aren't
using Mac's for this type of production
content I don't know if there are too
late in the game where you're gonna see
people I know they use Mac's for you
know for design for graphics um you know
even the graphics and for the video
games but actual building vr stuff other
than you know you're wrapping up your
360 videos and whatnot it's not like the
professional industry is saying the Mac
is the platform to choose for VR content
creation I haven't heard that yet no
it's right up there with Mac's not being
the best platform for playing games yep
yeah but I would I mean is there a
correlation between now if max can
handle VR production does this also mean
that they may be able to hand handle
games a little bit better than they have
true mm-hmm it just depends if
developers exactly I'm on board I'm on
board that's true well the discrete
graphics is definitely gonna help a lot
there and we're seeing some actual VR
demos on stage looks like it looks like
they're saying that this HTC vive rig is
actually for the first time all powered
by a Mac that's awesome
oh that's they're only showing vive
Hardware there's no mention of oculus or
any other VR brand right now but they
did say that it is being all powered by
a Mac I think earlier they did talk
about unity and unreal but I don't know
if oculus was name-checked there no I
didn't see oculus I did see unity in
unreal have you guys tried the Star Wars
demo for the vibe oh it is amazing it's
incredible and if they can get that
going on an iMac
that's huge she beat him and I spent a
lot of time with each other so I'll say
things that he's heard five times and
he'll say things that I've heard five
times like that
it's a true III didn't want to fake and
be like oh no tell me more about it
yeah alright so they're showing a demo
of um on stage of her in a virtual world
being run it's a looks like it's just
it's some Star Wars I don't know what
planet there looks like um Darth Vader
Darth Vader's uh hide court his home
base yeah where he recharges you can see
his tower in the background okay great
so all you need now is to buy a new iMac
so you can enjoy VR this is VRS problem
you have to have so much equipment and
it's so expensive to get it off the
ground that's but I mean is this is this
demo necessarily targeted towards hey
now you can do VR oh is it more like hey
developers hey Studios right yes all
right
we now have support and it's gonna be
easy to do it and it's gonna be actually
functional right they're throwing in TIE
fighter there she's she's basically in
this virtual world and throwing in
iconic Star Wars vehicles ships Darth
Vader and having fun playing with it fun
this is the demo time man let me see if
anyone wow that's pretty cool guys looks
like he's in Hawaii Darth Vader's in
Hawaii right now well since we're on the
Mac I'm just gonna take this call real
fast hopefully Aaron is ready to roll
from Indianapolis Aaron I know that
you're watching the keynote and you're
hanging with us we're gonna take your
call real quick what's up welcome seen
alive hi out today doing great
what's up nothin less'n just watching
the keynote right now and actually on
like a little iPhone 6 so yeah but
anyways I'm just was curious about our
if that was going to bring great bass
coming to the iPhone I hope so I hope so
but guess what that would be so cool
they didn't show it in Mac in their demo
Mac OS they never mentioned it there at
all to me that's a second feature that
should be on both Mac OS and iOS and
because they didn't put it there it may
not but maybe they'll surprise maybe
they decided
some reason only make it mobile and
which would be really bad - yes yeah but
we'll see so we just wanted to jump in
real quick since they're just kind of
hanging out with VR right now but thanks
for calling we appreciate you waiting so
long yeah no problem I I've been
watching you guys to show since the
beginning I've been an apple of an Apple
fan first for so long and I love you
guys were - even individually and stuff
like that and uh Alexis should be the
the the next series voice that are
Australian the voice is amazing so yeah
hey uh hey Aaron I I can't help you but
give her her Twitter handle but not
phone number Twitter handle mine oh it's
okay I'm single for a long time that's
alright hey bro single mingle love
yourself love yourself right exactly
exactly
awesome alright thanks so much man
thanks for calling alright problem
alright we will get back into this
keynote here
um again they're kind of just going over
the specs of the matte IMAX the 21.5
inch entry-level starts at 1099 the 21.5
inch 4k starts at $12.99 and they have
we have not seen the announcement of the
high-end Mac yet oh here we go $17.99
for the iMac retina 5k 27 inch okay you
know it's not as high as I thought it
would be yeah you know what it is though
once you load it right like more ram
you'll throw up another you know six
seven hundred bucks and on there also it
looks like we're going total Mac refresh
kb lake is also coming to the MacBooks
so get ready you can also mark your
bingo card I mean I like it we have 14
winners for our bingo cards so you have
a pretty high chance of a single top we
got a lot of bingo has already happening
I can see them all all right um so just
for your record according to Shara Apple
cuts the price of the entry-level
13-inch MacBook Pro from - $12.99 which
is $200 less than it used to be that's a
much more reasonable price and a great
entries first
it's a 13-inch with again a physical
physical barbar fungal yeah yeah
function function keys volume brightness
that makes so much more sense thank you
oh yeah for coming to your senses Apple
okay so originally $14.99 now $12.99 for
the non touch MacBook Pro non touch bar
MacBook Pro it's good I would recommend
that highly already yeah that makes me
wonder what if anything is going to
happen with the MacBook Air because now
those two are getting a little close
more than just the regular old MacBook
right where is that gonna fit into I
mean this that's the 12 inch that's the
super skinny the super shiny Mac's
getting you on the gold when it comes in
the gold finishes oh it's so beautiful
yeah it's just not powerful enough for
me to actually give it a shot it's so
light though is it is lighter than it's
a beauty no doubt no doubt
oh it's called the iMac Pro iMac oh man
wait hang on yet another product yes I
know that our time line so to your point
more redundancy yeah so is this well we
don't know exactly because we're not
listening this but are they saying this
is separate from the iMac 5k this is a
its own beast yes it is a different
thing you'll first notice it's the same
great design as our 27-inch iMac but
it's seriously AB a - space grey finish
oh that's cool
that is cool Scott sign sense it's an
iMac but badass oh alright looks like
they're gonna jump into the video right
now it's cool because the information
that we get inside actually comes out
before the actual yeah we go so we just
get it a few moments before so we can
talk about it and you guys can all watch
it which is why you could do both so
they have they showed a mouse that was
like Space Gray is this space great this
one I think this one is yes that is
space gray sky that new MacBook Pro that
you're rubbing and likes bragging about
no I've already scratch it is quite
scrub it is it's fair I don't know how
it got scratched but it just did wonder
if you can bump it out so they're
talking about performance into this new
iMac Pro
the team had to rethink the thermal
architecture it's greater the increase
greater than an 80% increase in cooling
capacity will ship with an 8 core Intel
Xeon processor Oh daddy like run I got I
bought I bought the first iMac the new
27-inch iMac I was crying when they
released the 5k display like a little I
think about ours around this and I'm
like you Jeff but this iMac Pro in this
piece I have a pro I have an iMac I'm
gonna stop iMac parole oh just be just
down on the nightshirt Sharon this this
is a brain this is a worm in your brain
that will not leave for the next week it
hurts it that's hurt um it's also going
to ship with a freaking 10 core Xeon
processor model if you want Wow and
AMD's Radeon Vega graphics and a cool
little swirly animation that looks cool
up to 18 cores ok they kind of went
crazy there 16 gigs of VRAM video ram
virtual alright so is this to tide us
over until the Mac Pro comes out
probably 18 cores ela processor that
since I want to see a side-by-side
comparison of this versatile Pro yeah
here's the thing right the garbage they
they this the the fact that this exists
is because they wanted to ignore the Mac
Pro race was the replacement basically
safe for them not doing any updates to
the Mac Pro this is better than the pro
then the pro is gone why do we need the
prize all those poor people that well
the reason why is because there's still
a lot of yous don't want to customize
external cards video cards audio cards
and different wanted to configure
options other than that mm-hmm so this
is the thing I think the pro the power
on this is like damn this is sick but
then you're like well I don't most
people that need this much power need
more expandability yeah so it's it's
gonna catch me it's a little a lot it's
a little it's a tweener
it's a tweener but I think that someone
like me who kind of got over the fact
that a Mac Pro isn't going to exist in
the way that I wanted to would be
interred in this but then now that
but why are you to wait a year plus for
the new Mac Pro you'll get this I think
some people gonna buy this actually
exactly plus it's oh oh
first time ever 1080p face FaceTime
camera
give me 480 what's up um you could
change the settings yeah I can just put
a piece of scotch tape over murder the
power of this iMac you could
theoretically hook up to 5k displays and
to raid arrays for the hard drive so it
has it looks like on the back here for
standard USB and then for thunderbolt so
there again this is the iMac pro this is
again it you know exactly what Apple was
thinking for the longest time and why
they were ignoring the Mac Pro which is
kind of sad it is you know they come out
with this okay
that's it makes it kind of like for
people that are pro users they're like
exactly it's a stab okay what are we
talking cost wise I really want to know
if we kitted out fully to the extent
that we can make it and one raisi as
possible whoa we got the press oh you're
gonna beat you to it
I'm gonna wait hold on $17.99 was the
iMac priety been looking at it is it
like $24.99 starting no I think it's
gonna be thirty seven ninety-nine
what is it at no 4 9 9 9 oh I just want
doodoo in my pants that's not gonna
happen
that's quite a bit okay
available in December and that's the
configuration with the 5k display the 8
core not even that's the minimum
goodness that's the 8 core cool that's
just the 8 core minimal entry 32 gigs
memory one terabyte is one terabyte yeah
10 give me like Ethernet this is 5 grand
and we gonna put eight this did look I'm
not here to hate but I'm gonna this
doesn't make sense for most people
that's the point yeah this is not its
foot game is it's for people that I do
your developer developers intensive
applications right and that's what I did
and Dan Ackerman says that this is
actually a good price for what you're
getting here reviews gaming laptops that
cost more or as much as much
that makes sense so alright alright it's
a steal oh hey I'm I I think it's cool I
the space gray to make it pro dude this
is like if a company is buying it for
you oh yeah oh yeah I ain't gonna buy
this with my own money
mm-hmm I mean me yeah no I'm gonna
enroll in school just so I can get that
discount I mean for you young people
that want this it's time to go ramen
dinner ramen fresh fish ramen lunch hey
you had a few spices got a meal that
chicken cost money that togarashi little
flavoring about man
I love toka Roshi that cost money that's
not a bad point there the student
discounted 10% for serious you enroll in
the three units okay it's gonna cost you
a couple hundred dollars you save five
hundred let's go let's go let's get
let's get crazy here farm-to-table get
some chives in your backyard get some
green onions your backyard a little
macro but a Thai basil up in there now
we're talking okay okay
Thai basil nice man thanks I mean I know
you'd appreciate that
chef Sheeran all right oh I always love
it oh I always have it well bingo Oh
what did I win guy oh yeah you bet you
it what do you win I don't know high

I put the disclaimer that people in the
life you know cannot not win fine I mean
I do have a good I do I do have a rose
gold USB decided okay I need a lightning
to headphone dongle please thank you
meet a dongle everybody needs one of
those I've been asked that a lot
hey guy I got it got two giggles from
the ladies it's not man or throw up in
the mouth I mean one of the other all
right iOS 11 their time out how messages
added iMessage or sorry messages added
stickers in iOS 10 a redesigned app
drawer so absolutely accessible right
there at the bottom of the screen this
is gonna be interesting
look a lot of this stuff is going to
hint because of the form factor the new
iPhone will change and most likely not
have any type of physical home button
we've got to see some sort of hints
that here getting people ready getting
but it's actually kind of useful when
I'm afraid when I do like swipes that's
gonna be a problem yeah okay
all right iCloud looks like the big
story with message is that messages in
iCloud will now be synchronized when you
sign into the service I'm pretty sure
they already are
I thought yeah I'm thinking it takes a
little while but it does sync huh I mean
I don't know if there may be are they
over viewing yeah we were not oh end
they stay in sync maybe that's the
difference oh so it's not loading it
back loaded yes most likely and also
like live syncing be yeah and when there
is a delay in which you haven't signed
into a device for a long time it has the
last history rather than the most
current messages maybe that's what
they're referring no real talk real talk
be careful what you put on your iMessage
uh real talk be careful what devices you
sign into with your iTunes account real
talk
live syncing everybody real talk turn it
off clear your photos immediately Mike I
like uh yeah last real talk two step
authentication hey Beecher wiser face
read Beechum's not even in this
conversation his face is red not when I
was homesick on Friday and someone
logged into my computer at my desk and I
got a notification of my phone I'm like
what what happened what did like call
someone to be someone on my computer but
then I was just like just forget it
whatever ah but at least it gives you a
notification of that I guess but if you
have messages pulled up as an app but I
thought I'd turn it off it might have
been like some update sometimes you have
to turn that stuff off I'm telling you
two-step authentication people do it
okay here's the big thing started jump
in Apple is now offering pay to pay
person line
person painting Apple now Bank by God
Apple you know Apple Wallet Apple pay
yeah didn't completely take off so who
said I belong I think that I use Apple
pay a lot actually is an untapped market
there and it's really this is really a
part of Apple's big push into obviously
p2p payments is huge but they really
want to kind of replace banks eventually
I don't see it happening I can see it
happen well the cool thing is you can do
it directly in the message out well I
want to know if it's like venmo where it
holds your money in this virtual account
that you have to cash out of I hate that
that that seems to mean you'd like it to
just transfer directly to what mine does
I wonder you just log into your bank
account that's how I don't know maybe
yours much differently you have to still
enforce it out yeah yeah I wonder though
if that's a function that is agreed on
with like the banks it's not like
there's someone that's putting that road
block that you still have to physically
move it from this platform into our bank
like for whatever reason right now yeah
is there any way other than working
check with your bank square lets you do
it do you like to be like 50 Cent's okay
but it does like well that's gonna be
interesting to see how thank you baby
works well I'm okay with just doing it
myself I gotta pay 50 cents I mean it's
worth it so next up here we go they're
going to talk about Siri more than 375
million active devices use it monthly
being baked into the messages app okay
hold on I think they're jumping on how
many times is it baked today yeah
they're making it a big upgrade to it
that's Siri voice were used we've used
deep learning to make it more natural
seven voice I wanna know what Siri
sounds like now Siri has a great new
visual interface as well we'll pry it up
provide follow-up answers with just a
tap that's a classic Google feature oh
yeah follow up answers and translation
which is also another classic Google
feature yes coming in strong
appreciation powering that interesting
interesante
and they can transition initially
English to Chinese French German and
Spanish right now Siri translation is in
beta according to the Scot Steinman he
puts beta in parentheses Sirikit can
down new more than ever with iOS 11 you
can do task management in OmniFocus as
third-party app connections bring up a
QR code in WeChat Siri not only
understands your voice it understands
the context we've heard this before from
other company so we're gonna try and
figure out what more can do that again
they need to play more catch-up than it
I don't think they're gonna come out
with some ground bass need to be smarter
play catch-up yeah help help us make a
calendar appointment based on something
we booked on the web Google does that or
just automatically does that yeah have
that have it you know what's crack know
is that when you have the Google app on
the Google assistant now an iPhone it it
goes into your email and it says your
package has been shipped and it gets the
notification to you before you get the
email oh that's I happen to be know like
crazy so because it's using the tracking
so ladies just a quick thing I'm
assuming we'll see a lot more in the
series speaker but that's all they
talked about Siri that's it they're
jumping over to camera already which is
kind of interesting so we'll still have
like theoretically and an hour to go
oh just an hour I want more time with
you don't you want more time with me so
anyway so you know back to keynote so
next to the camera our customers now
checking one trillion photos per year
take a lot of video oh interesting it
looks like they're doing rolling out a
new image format for basically
compressing your images so they take up
less space but still have the same
quality presumably it'll be interesting
it's close good HEV C for videos
hei F for photos so everyone who for
some reason bought a 16 gigabyte iPhone
even though we the three of us here we
told you not to do this I start please
you'll be happy we work for this website
called Sina at least if you don't listen
to anything we say just don't get the 16
gig iPhone just don't do that no it's
not needed
oh okay
here we go this is something interesting
now so they're talking about depth
information and this is what I was
talking about with the dual cameras on
the 7 plus yeah
it's got to be something extra here so
they're starting to hint at capturing
the depth from the 2 cameras with the
depth API oh the depth API okay well so
for now Scott's saying the depth API
will allow the dual lens portrait mode
to roll out to other apps not just
normal that's cool and that was
hopefully something that it's expected
however where I want to see more they're
also they're also talking about with iOS
11 you can take a low-light photographs
using HDR so so even more so low-light
while using that high dynamic range oh
that's interesting nor how well that's
good well that's all right yeah see you
for the pudding right like HDR now is
really generally only full lighting
there's bright situations so you have
enough light in order to take a couple
of different exposures at once so if
you're in low light keeping that stable
is gonna be a tricky job without a
tripod I'm not gonna hate but it sounds
almost made up it's like I'm you know
you know like oh we just you know we
turn on the each star while it's low
light like oh how does that work I just
did it you're not gonna get no camera
shaking ah yeah it's gonna I'm
interesting interesting
I believe it though there I believe it I
believe it I just like to mess with them
so it sounds like portrait is coming to
movies as well as life so motifs perhaps
okay this is all hinting that and maybe
it was obvious already but if it wasn't
before it is now that all of the next
iPhones will have dual cameras yeah
just type in iPhone 8 camera you'll see
every you'll see every image possible
what do we think of also like the move
to portrait vertical video so they're
talking about you can now watch the
effect in portrait mode why are we
moving towards vertical video
yeah beautiful it's a thing that's how
we're just doing it now I think it
sounds ridiculous but people do not want
to rotate their phone I know
lame I will not rotate my phone I will
not rotate my phone I will not rotate my
phone oh it has a lot to do is so social
media I believe and YouTube's doing that
now to where you can go full screen with
the know with an upright phone it's just
it's just following consumers behaviors
you know sure whether we like it or not
I don't want to admit that's the case
because it makes me sad it makes me it
hurts me inside someone that likes to
take photos that and watch video I think
we should see ya right now I think we
should just mess with people in the
understand what they're doing we're
gonna do the next live show in vertical
video and you're gonna be pissed we
should know we should have beach and put
some like I don't know how it even do it
you know we try yes just like it just
like a title cart no and so yeah we just
put lines on both sides to be like this
it'd be like this dude I want that
should we could do that right when you
go to the movie theater you're gonna be
like oh oh my god it's so wide and then
everybody will go back to movie theaters
again that's true it's a conspiracy
they're doing by doing they're doing a
new a control center update now this
looks interesting it looks like a lot of
stuff is going on I don't know if you
have a screen of this Beecham but it
looks like there's a music player
there's your utilities it's almost like
widget II widget style right actually it
looks Center is such a message yeah I
keep you know what I keep deafening
myself every time I'm listening to music
and I'm trying to access something from
the Charleston to slapping across and
then accidentally swiping all the way
only I do that all the time
look at the insane this control center
does not look it looks more jumbled like
I see the big panels with that thing
right there that shot right there yeah
that right there yeah the eyes just
glaze over when I why can't the music
player just be a rectangle that is
across a shrimp a strip instead of like
a box in the corner without swiping it's
too much thing user interface design is
something that Apple usually gets very
right but looking at that it is very
confusing fumbling all over themselves
with the Apple watch though
Tamizh right in line damn hashtag real
talk um the you you can 3d touch the
control center to go directly into them
for more detail like it'll pop them up
that's what we saw when Wyatt Wyatt goes
into the large screen it's like do you
know how many people I I just love doing
this
showing people 3d touch for the first
time no they have it I'm like push it in
like oh wow God like I was I am still am
I was all about 3d touch but it's like
people don't know / use it and it's you
know part of moving things forward is
changing the behavior of how people do
things right now people are comfortable
using at least in the US long long ago
in Asia it's already been done using
their phones as wallets right that has
taken time for people to get used that
behavior this whole 3d touch thing it
because not all apps can use it it's not
truly again consistent mmm like people
don't use it don't know where to use it
when to use it the only time I use 3d
touch to two main things when a message
notification pops up
I can push right into it right yeah so
it doesn't take over my screen anymore
and then Shazam yeah I don't want to
open this damn I'm like oh it's just
like Lissa peek and pop on a Shazam and
then just pick and pop pick and pop
that's the fun they called it pick it up
yeah so when I go like this think about
a good pop big aha pika pick up a pop OH
where's Pikachu oh I thought we were
gonna see something rude endo related Oh
still come um how many of you use
memories I look at that crap all the
time yeah all the time
memories have you ever not really that
often there well you know I'm gonna I'm
gonna say just try looking at it you
know maybe try once a month and I think
you'll end up using it more than you
think probably like I probably cuz I
have nieces and nephews and you know let
me milady go out like to some cool place
and then I look I'm like I'm not like
saving the video but I'm looking at him
yeah right are ya I'm looking at him
barmy Brian I thought you didn't want
Google and Apple to curate these things
forever
you are the number-one photobook is
different photo books is different
that's like hard to me if it's virtual
it's okay well it's like a video sure
because I'm lazy for sure yeah like I'm
not gonna edit a video of like what
happened in my yeah at the winery or
something but if it's a book like some
like if I gave you a gift as a book yeah
and you knew that I just pressed one
button to make it that's like heartless
it is heartless
there's no soul in that love whit is the
damn soul fair enough that's a good
that's all I'm saying alright but I
agree your point was actually well made
I just needed take it to the level I
love watching these like after a
vacation or a little trip or something
these are a lot of fun to watch I
suppose if you have kids yes yeah uh
slam dunk
it's like thank God or food your food
shots those are my babies
yeah yeah I'm yeah Google was doing this
a long time ago though but apples doing
it too and it's pretty much exactly the
same almost down to the font and the
music seriously yeah because they can
yeah I mean the Facebook ripped off
snapchat in five different ways just the
new networks than you norm everything's
gonna be the same non-proprietary
livestream from everywhere that's true
and it looks like they've also ripped
off boomerang because there was a
factory you can loop and reverse give
them gifs as you and this is why you
haven't heard a mention of the oculus
because Facebook is Apple's one of
Apple's biggest competitors so I mean
yeah they're just gonna rip off their
features one by one zactly other quick
things um they didn't go into it too
in-depth but they said let's talk about
stickers and I immediately kept
scrolling nothing on stickers map maps
has a mail mode in the new maps detailed
floor oh sorry Malmo Kerry's sorry boy
detailed floor plans of malls we let you
browse by floor malls in Boston Chicago
and Hong Kong um can we get this for the
CES convention please oh yeah I love you
read well can we get this for the CNET
office yes yes please good
well this is something that Google Maps
does yeah for indoor mapping has been a
thing to people to talk about for
but now you know Apple Maps let me let
me speculate a little bit here Becky
let's get Becky ar this is laying
groundwork that's true
there we go that's all integration I
like it they're also talking about Kabul
Shara just mentioned carplay real real
briefly so people have been asking us on
the podcast a lot about you know what's
going on with carplay and it's so going
on with what is going on we wanted to
bring the same level of safety to
everyone who doesn't have one of the
kinds of cars that has carplay okay
here's what's going on with carplay
either you are you have purchased a new
car that happens to be carplay
compatible in the last couple years and
you have it or you don't
that's all that's why we haven't heard
much about it because I mean I don't
know how to use and I don't know anyone
who has in the car this is the rental
car I was in a rental car with carplay
in it and it was still we had to use
like you're still touching in it still
you just want to get your phone out and
do exactly the same thing as you don't
want to do on the screen it's not as
efficient as they would like I just want
to be able to mirror my phone that's all
yeah because using your phone exactly
the way you would when you're not
driving while you are driving is a very
safe idea oh wait wait hold on you make
a point
wait well so here's the thing good car
play they did add a feature called do
not disturb while driving so that you
won't be I guess alerted retracted by
notifications that you no matter what
are going to press even though yes once
in a while you do that while you're
driving I'm sorry it happens it is not
safe to do that I don't recommend it but
one thing I find interesting is that
with Android Androids car platform the
phone when you plug in and basically
becomes completely useless and stuff is
done on the screen and we're right now
in carplay your I your iPhone plugging
the system you could still use it like
it's still active which is very
distracting right but you know yeah so
um this do not disturb mode is may be a
way that they are addressing it but it
works to say you know it's working the
same stop sign is saying it I wonder how
well it works with the Apple watch is it
the same as
talk to it we'll see oh that's a good
question I'm gonna move on at home kit
now uh announced in 2014 for the record
there's always a market section there's
a long time ago
there's oh something happening about
speakers there's one here's here's the
setup yeah here it is one category
really close to our heart that we wanted
to add to home kit that's speakers I
just want to see your price I want to
see when it's available I want to see
what it looks like
rumors have said Oh rooms cartridge can
I know the joke was they're gonna
repurpose the Mac Pro shells come into
the speaker that's exactly how I
imagined change it so it's a fabric
grill rather totally that's totally I
mean they they got to do something with
all that extra metal yeah and it's not a
speaker it's it's talking about
controlling speakers with airplay - yeah
turning up volume through a new airplay
protocol which gives more finite um
control over that on a single panel oh
can you airplay to multiple speakers
that aren't necessarily the same brand
it says right here multiple room audio
supporting iOS 11 that's great there you
go thank you very much well you tooth
was never able to overcome this
challenge so it makes sense for airplay
to tackle it wow that's great
hmm do I have any airplay but if you buy
beats oh hey here's a here's a nice
thing they just added now your Apple TV
can be played too from an iOS device or
Mac anywhere in the home so you're able
to from what it looks like your Apple TV
can be seen on any like on your Mac
screen on your iOS screen so that wasn't
the case before no like I couldn't
mirror a you mirror from your MacBook to
your Apple TV but what if from what I'm
reading what if you wanted to mirror
your Apple TV and have that sit back
experience like at your Haute you know
yeah on your computer screen like an
Apple TV talking your Apple TV to your
MacBook screen oh like in a different
room of your house
would you want that I think it's kind of
cool actually I'd want that as long as
you can have multiple instances of Apple
TV
yeah like different different videos
from different rooms right
yeah the multi audio right Chris jumps
in here multi-room audio control is
going to be a major crowd-pleaser right
now just go by oh yeah please make this
a reality oh yeah by the end of this
keynote I'm like seven thousand dollars
deep drop five grand on it I'm mad yeah
we should maybe do something like that
like what do I want from the keynote and
just keep on adding have a running total
telling it's just like all right Apple
music time only pumped guys mm-hm they
now have 27 million customers I don't it
doesn't look like those are I'm not sure
if those are paid sir
yeah looks like paid subscribers as of
December earlier that our last year
Apple had to over 20 million so they
moved up to 27 million if I recall use
Spotify it 50 or 60 million yeah
combined 50 million pains yes correct
that's not combined so yeah the total of
all Spotify users is higher yeah right
okay
Apple music they're talking about this
and Phil Schiller is going to be coming
up to stage with their kind of new
revamps to Apple music you know what I
really want to that sucks
I totally suck yeah I really want to say
just a better looking iTunes just clean
I change you got that everything they
just break it out make it cleaner make
it seamless make Apple music look better
yeah it's not that hard
don't be that hard so it is and it is
it's hard it takes we've seen this
historically over a span of six to ten
years it's hard clearly Jilla
oh but we can't tell if his voice cracks
I know somebody please tweet us and let
us know I'm just gonna mark it cuz I
guarantee you it happens once it's on
the bingo card for a reason
it really is just gets excited guy he
really does oh we have a reference to
Pokemon bad
with people in Hong Kong playing Pokemon
go still so ya know I've seen people
play I do I hope you have they still
going oh yeah
Scott Stein said pink pokemons go bingo
card checked off we do not put on the
bingo diet on here but maybe it's on his
one maybe yeah he won his own personal
one that has just tears on it he's had
he had I Mac Pro $4,999 you really
didn't want to check that box off so
Apple is highlighting the fact that
their App Store is a trusted and safe
place for all users we know that this
past year has been a very tumultuous one
when it comes to vulnerabilities and
hacks so Apple this is Apple's chance to
reassure everyone that they've had their
App Store locked down for a long time
here's the thing that developers are
most likely going to cheer about we
can't listen in faster app review times
a majority of apps are now reviewed
under 24 hours most in one to two hours
that's pretty good cuz a while ago a
while ago for developers I mean they
were complaining like they didn't hear
anything for like days yeah and they're
like what's going on with my app so so I
wonder good I know how big that team is
or if they have robots doing it now
that's a lot of apps to approve it is
within one to two hours yeah but hey 100
billion dollars in revenue they've got
to invest in it yeah that's where that's
where their income is sorry Scott Stein
is chiming in that this is a really fast
paced keynote I would agree it's like
one more thing it looks like they're now
doing phased releases so when you submit
an app you can choose if you want it to
be phased in over time so you don't
overload your infrastructure and your
servers all at once so you know when
there's a big release to an app that's
actually quite useful you know it you
know everyone's like slamming especially
when there's a new iOS update or
something like that is probably the most
common thing I can think about it's just
like being slammed so everyone's trying
to get at the same time so if you're a
developer and you want your app to go
out not everyone is going to be hitting
your servers at the same time so
hopefully would reduce load and make a
better experience and I think that's a
smart thing and I think developers would
hopefully react well to that this is
also interesting they're going to do a
complete redesign to the App Store
complete it starts with a brand new tab
called 2-day guys it looks like Apple
music yeah I'm to that you know what's
you know what's harder about this look
at how look at that that redesign I'm
whoever paid for that top spot paid a
lot of money because you're literally
looking at one freaking app yeah oh
they showed injustice to dope I'm all
about that it like sold now it's like oh
we're games were an injustice to dope no
but look it from a Content standpoint if
the today tab you see one app that's got
let's do this realistic duty yeah hey
you're right though that's a that's a
money spot right there it is
and that's you know there there has to
be something about the organic nature of
finding stuff that surfaces the top
that's not going to be like Oh top
downloaded based on major XYZ Monument
Valley is a known thing you know
injustice too is a known thing all these
things are showing Airbnb I've never
heard of that app but like it's like out
you know I I like getting exposed to
stuff that like you may not have known
about or just show me more than one tile
exactly come on it's an app store oh no
it is the app store like the one app
store once done you're not gonna you're
not buying death Road to Canada down
here I don't know I really don't know 99
credits under the section of prep for
zombies when we are somebody epochal
another just creating stupid alright is
part of the app review process I can
make up my own app category all right
Wow oh I just it looks too much like
Apple Mia they were like you spend more
time I'm just I'm just saying this
doesn't this isn't compelling though for
me to like click around it's one tile
exactly I go in and I go I'm not
interested in this top app I'm not gonna
scroll by how many times you want to
scroll yeah yeah you might be
you're like wait that's only one what
else is there so you're like well I'm
here like you can scroll sideways on see
like there's two rows that you can even
scroll to on the crab doors while you do
that but it's further down it's buried
underneath that top slot right there
which is the today which is probably
going to be things like yo yo okay how
many apps can I find from here like I
can find apps on apps okay apps on apps
I got one app one it's called App Store
for a reason yeah some like we said I
would say I would argue though that if
you use snapchat or Instagram stories or
anything like that you might already be
accustomed to one thing at a time and
then diving into the experience more so
maybe they're taking a page out of that
design book but even sap shots of
branded content you can look at a lot of
different things that's true yeah yeah
like it's that it is so modest to big
blocks lately snapchats interface sucks
we friends
pottery yes really Wow like after two
three years using it you're still
wondering where's but but you're still
using it
ish nice yes oh man okay well that's the
App Store like I have to say you know
just just going back to money spent on
the App Store and whatnot I have
definitely over the years become more
comfortable spending more money really
yeah on digital goods like apps I think
that if they offer enough utility I mean
you know we spend art so much of our
time on our phones so why not invest in
that time I'm kind of interesting
because we're talking about the app
experience on the app store
I'm very much a person that I go in I
kind of I've read about an app somewhere
else and I'll going to download that one
specific app yeah and I generally won't
spend time exploring and seeing what
else is out there because I don't like
the experience of just aimlessly
browsing you know I was in exploring so
this is going to make me even Lester
right to go and dine and find it I
should just acquire product because they
haven't figured out yeah what's the
first thing you do when you go to app
store I usually go to top free look at
the list yeah free right and see what
there is I just go to injustice - yeah
where are you searching whatever you
want I just I just do that
top free is like Facebook you do um
record I'm not not being paid by
injustice - or Warner Brothers for the
record emotion - yeah damn amazing game
okay on to the next I hold on
I do have twenty bucks with the from
Warner Bros in my pocket right now okay
okay so yeah I don't know that that apps
or thing as a developer who's trying to
get your app discovered I think you're
probably even more frustrated when you
see that interface right now yeah oh
yeah
it's funnier I just wrote exactly what I
said I only had to the absolute download
apps I already know I want and he's
wondering how many people actually use
it to discover new apps oh but did you
did you know you ever wanted Angry Birds
I did it no I know feds and and me was a
bad experience a positive so looks like
they're wrapping up they really spend a
lot of time out of everything again it's
for developers this is a developer
school on the App Store I I'm I wanna
I'm actually really curious I don't know
if we have any developers that are
watching this right now with us um will
prompt it but at the end of the show I
want to hear what developers thought
think about this yeah cuz they're the
ones that are gonna be the most affected
by this I'm really curious so I'll throw
out a tweet also just to see if people
can let us know what they think about
that alright federighi is back
herefore is one back on stage alright so
yay let's talk about machine learning
there we go getting smart here we go
this is what we want this is what we've
been asking for it's the way that we
will get a cohesive consistent
experience across platforms but let's
see how else to use it don't let us down
yeah please don't make this like don't
make it another redesigned App Store
machine learning has helped us redesign
store the surface exactly what content
you want for that one app my goodness
okay so we have machine learning
powering face tracking detection this is
you know Google launched or announced
Google lense at Google i/o last month
and that's very much also machine
learning what can what can we get out of
this photo and how can we tie it to
things that we know so your face is one
of those things that can be recognized
and identified so what is Apple doing
with this I don't know but it sounds
like they have they're announcing an API
which will allow developers to use it
however they like so bring on the space
swap apps yeah yeah here's the thing
when I see all this stuff is like
honestly and they'll have to prove it to
us with how they apply it is that
believin better than Google at doing
these things I make you better at
snapchat yeah seriously like the this is
again you know companies have certain
wheelhouses that they're experts in and
no matter what you can't be an expert in
everything I think that's been proven
you just can't be an expert in
everything so with this technology they
have it's more about how they use it
with their platform but is it actually
when it comes down to us the end-user is
it actually better than what's out there
exactly and just quickly I know that
diving into a on right now but I want to
know how this processing is done because
I know Apple in the past has made a big
deal about all this processing is done
on camera or the facial recognition to
power like grouping faces together in
photos you know is this now being opened
up to developers I'm going to sit on a
cloud somewhere or is it still going to
be on device would love to know about if
it's on device we need a new chip
because it's you know remember that
Apple announced the motion coprocessor
yep because they were really leaning
into health so if they are leaning into
AR and machine learning and AI and so on
give us a chip so that we're not killing
our battery life and that everything
runs more smoothly well I'll tell you
smartypants that they are actually
developing according to many reports an
actual AI base chip for exactly what
you're asking for to save battery power
and through
all that onto the chip well I'm trying
to say is showing an round of applause
share breakfast round of applause um
they are when we talk about AR they are
announcing AR kit which will have
developer tools for AR apps and
additional tools so this is their first
foray into outright saying we are we are
putting we have home kit we got AR kit
yeah we got Sirikit all the kids less
Google's was name something very similar
to right was in a VR kit or something oh
just a couple weeks ago I don't want to
be totally wrong but so they're showing
kind of like a demo an iPhone using a
camera and how it can identify different
things not only that it can add objects
like putting a coffee cup onto a table
it's kind of funny how this is stuff
that you know we've seen but the Apple
audience isn't maybe necessarily as
familiar like yeah yeah yeah right well
as the demos that blew everyone's mind
playing Minecraft on a table yeah you've
seen this at Facebook's developer
conference you know couple weeks ago as
well this is you know you this is
basically what he's showing now is kind
of like snapchat esque you can do 3d
objects in your world I was talking
about how the shadows can be moved
around though and reflecting based on
where you put the object and the
lighting is changing accordingly and
again it's okay look to me whether
they're not on the cutting edge or not
Apple has so much power the fact that
all these iPhones
however hundreds millions of phones are
in people's hands a developer has been
wanting these tools so they can make
stuff to make money on Apple's platform
so whether it happened two three years
ago or whether it's happening now and
this is a necessity for not only moving
the technology for it but to have these
developers make some more make their
living by doing these new things yeah
yeah yeah it doesn't necessarily saw
extremely impressive demos of playing
Minecraft on your coffee table it
matters that now apples doing it because
linked to this point right Scott sign is
wrote here Apple boasting this will be
the largest AR platform in the world
which could make it soar and that's the
thing right smartwatches although they
haven't completely taken off who has
sold the most amount of smartwatches
Apple right and so that's all the most
thank you
Apple right so they're using that muscle
that they have to to push this stuff out
a little you know quote-unquote
mainstream although again we are
insulated by this tech bubble world we
like seeing our expose this like three
years ago that we like always yeah we're
like whatever but it it makes it has
ripples beyond just our little like
bubble yeah this is interesting because
if you think about like the other
technologies in this space that are for
consumers like google tango you need a
specific fine yes and this is the the
point is now anyone with an iPhone 7
plus I'm assuming this is the demo is on
a seven plus it looks like I'm assuming
anything with two cameras is going to be
capable of doing this which is it's not
even going to be something that you need
to think about all I need to buy a look
they are enabled phone your own will be
a are enabled as is yeah and so you have
access to all this functionality whether
or not you know it or not
yeah and that's that's gonna be that's
kind of going to be that killer feature
that's why you know we are frustrated
when Apple isn't the most innovative but
the power their platform allows them to
delay things hold them off and put them
out the way they want and then sometimes
push it forward like Apple pay out of
all I don't know what the numbers are I
know people aren't constantly you know
doing mobile payments but if I see which
one people are arguably the most
comfortable with in their brand cachet
name it's most likely Apple pay I know
samsung pay is way more versatile works
on old-school credit card terminals but
I don't see or hear people talking about
Samsung pay unless I really into tech
and then re that they're going to be
able to use that which is what's your
that is the best yeah yeah yeah it's
ironic because Samsung has the absolute
best yes
mobile payments highly you don't need
the the credit card reader doesn't have
to be compatible so it yeah you're right
it's the power of the brand so now
what's going to happen
is because again this is a Developers
Conference because developers know that
now they have an easy road to get there
AR their VR apps out there to millions
and millions of people that's who
they're going to develop for shoot at
they're showing some demo on on the
stream now it looks like it kind of
looks like some sort of game enact
reenactment I think it's this is
something about is this Peter Jackson's
you production company yes we not AR
they're doing a demo where they're
basically laying down a 3d game map on a
table moving around and watching the
interactions there see like this is see
why people's this is a moment where
people brains can't be blood they're
doing this through an iPad without a
head gear right there
this is another mind-blowing this is I
haven't seen AR before and they don't
actually I'm actually quite surprised
that Apple's called it AR because
there's a lot of confusion about it you
know it hasn't really crossed over as a
term at the same time I think we would
be making fun of them if they didn't
call it a no that's true I think it's
expecting them to call it something oh
how about they'll call they are they'll
just call it Apple reality Apple reality
y'all stands for Apple right don't blow
your mind Apple reality oh man I have
one single request
I want tamagotchi to come back in AR
tamagotchi was pretty epic yeah that was
pretty fun it brought out the worst in
so many people is like how much they
care about a living I just like ritual
water and diet like I'll clean it up and
not feed it and like I did that I'm a
bad person obviously hey of Z cavariccis
could come back tamagotchi come back you
huh my god with your Sims I want to live
with my sins
um I go outside to meet some people
sharing I that's the best advice I could
give to you right now she but I love you
better people first thing out with that
a better world
[Laughter]
are they still showing off the demo
right yeah looks like team cookies back
on stage and then the actual demo is a
little
within our live blog so streams yes so
check this out
we're at 11:40 it's been an hour and 40
minutes into the keynote we got about
roughly I don't know if they plan to
make this at one end at 12:30 I don't
know but uh interestingly enough at this
time uh it looks like Scott sign says
iPad time now let's see let's see this
iPad time you guys are honestly you guys
aren't the biggest fans of tablets or
not yes or no it's kind of just like a
thing yeah it's it to me it's not a
Productivity device it's like if I'm on
a plane and I want to watch a movie and
I know that they in flight experience is
not gonna be satisfactory I'll bring a
tablet that's pretty much the only time
I'll ever have one on me
yeah can I could I suggest you ladies
into getting into reading comics oh
right I heard there are comics but you
know who don't like necessarily yeah
what hey I I think how about this real
quick before we tell the iPad top 5
comics go well I could give you the top
ten but comics don't have to be
superhero based Marvel EDC comics
there's independent stuff that it will
blow your mind I read a lot of comics
there's a lot of stuff in here but you
don't don't think like why do I got to
read about Superman like characters
you've never heard of that have
intricate grown-up mature stories that
are like mind-blowing that's cool look
up saga saga saga it tonight a minute
from you actually I would I would if you
would give it a shot I want to hear what
you think
did you watch it yeah yeah it's a mix of
Star Wars meets Game of Thrones meets
Romeo and Juliet Oh
literally that the best way to mix that
up down it's been out for now I think
maybe six years but it's it's my boy
okay let's get back let's get this you
know but for all y'all watching the UH
Villette know saga from image comics
Brian cave on Fiona staples topic cream
of the crop right there but there's so
many more this is not a comics podcast
I've had broke into it iPad pro is weld
you for a good upgrade Tim Cook says
when we introduced the iPad pro just
eighteen months ago it completely
redefined what you can do with an iPad
sorry about that dress um surprise
anyways there's two models to buy today
the 13-inch twelve point nine inch and
nine point seven nine point seven is
most popular today today we're going to
introduce an all new iPad pro thank you
here we go mark it out ten point five
inch Retina display is the first iPad
pro they said with a ten point five inch
Retina display looks like an iPad pro it
weirdly um let me see here I think we're
little oh yeah we're a little bit behind
but you can tell there's another picture
of each I'm up higher that's a black
trim yeah you can tell the bezels there
are significantly smaller and they're
talking about how they're been able
they've been able to reduce the borders
while still keeping it at one pound is
that how much it weighs currently um
it's roughly roughly try to keep it
around a pound okay I think when they
wrote when they released the updated
iPad like they kind of went backwards um
that that iPad actually started way more
like it was a nine point seven inch they
kind of went backwards it's like their
cheapest most affordable iPad got it
they've done a lot with the line which
is very confusing and hard to explain in
five words which yeah tells everything
neither weighs just a pound it's the
first iPad that can a full screen
keyboard on the display as well as a
smart keyboard
I'm trying to figure out oh so you've
got it's just a standard with keyboard
right but then you still have your
add-on physical keyboard it also looks
like the keyboard yeah okay I mean
twelve point nine inch had more than
enough space for that
so HDR we were talking about that
earlier today is coming to the iPad pro
excellent 600 nits of brightness um are
they talking about all the iPads are
just this they're talking about just
this ten point nine ten point five inch
would just oh yeah true tone display
wide color gamut ultra low reflectivity
so this is for looks like twelve point
nine and ten point five is that correct
I just need a they're showing two iPads
there on screen yeah it looks like it I
think those are the two ones
but that looks the size difference of
that image yeah they're talking about
automatic basically they're bringing up
the fact that the ten point five inch
has the same display as the twelve point
nine that's what that's what I'm
gathering here they're not saying that
they're releasing a brand-new twelve
point nine inch iPad pro yet all right
so the pencil well it's not getting an
update but it's being better supported
with just 20 millisecond latency oh
that's a lot that's even better there
they had a 50 millisecond latency which
was best in the industry 20 milliseconds
that's ridiculous that's pretty awesome
actually
it really feels almost like you are
writing on paper like a pencil you did
it hold on we'll just wait for this
product announcement to be finished then
we'll go we go there will be video there
I have been iPad oh god oh I pay roll
okay that's all that's all the scare
people
um they this oh there's a display
enhancing technology called Pro motion
all the motion all of your motion
content on your screens will be smoother
and more responsive so um promotion also
assists the Apple pencil so this is
basically recognizing how the screen
works and that is 18 in the pencils 20
millisecond Lancie that's hot
that is hot but again this is not
anything interface changing its
performance changing okay um well rhyme
aches a good point he says here that
Apple is focusing on 4k and HDR uh
they're applying it to everything except
for the Apple TV
yeah that's September I'm going to bring
up a crazy thought yes please give us an
actual TV why not maybe that's what
we're waiting for here well I think that
man you much like Apple realized it was
a little creative a lot crazier to be
ambitious about let's make our own car
in a few years yeah which they
completely scrapped then the dynamics of
the TV industry although more similar to
computers and monitors still not that
easy just to jump in and just get into
when you have a lot of these factor
reason I've already manufacturing places
that have already cut deals inventory
levels with Samsung LG Sony I'm sharp
have a hard time getting glass for their
iPhone exactly so landline getting
panels TVs so that it looks like this
ten point five inch will be powered by
the a 10 X chip 6 cores 12 cores GPU 30%
faster CPU performance um let's see what
else do they have here
traffic's performance 500 times faster I
don't know what they were comparing that
the original I come on I fall of course
it's gonna be a hot one as fossil and he
fell just like natural progression
technology 500 times they're gonna show
off a pro at photo editing app called
infinity photo Oh interest not Infinity
Blade but in 54 remember the game they
always does every baby blade we got
infinity photo now physic I think this
is um a third-party company
yeah competitor ash Hewson of cereth
okay is here to talk about a pro photo
editing that sounds like a game of
thrones name I mean if you're if you are
into Lightroom or you know Photoshop
whatever same company uh but it I think
that over the past few years we've seen
a lot more competitors in the space
which makes me so happy
yes at some point it's either you paid
five hundred dollars or you didn't I
just remember the first time I saw a
third-party app that gave control over
curves and levels I was like that wasn't
that was not Photoshop it was like oh my
gosh I'm not like I no longer tied into
the Adonia ecosystem it was just so cool
and yes almost as good as doing it on a
desktop I mean come on yeah especially
if all you're doing is editing it for
Instagram web use specially you know
some people like and a lot of time doing
that point I've got my own professional
IG filter Pro oh yeah it's called Shauna
she just takes my pictures spices
my ig crow it's like I don't got time to
do this she's like oh she's a Shelby I
can tell when you use a filter you need
to customize it yeah yeah if you can do
yeah you can tell you can tell she's
like oh you use the filter here let me
do this and I'm like wow that really
looks way better than mine you were
probably still using like hefa from mm
oh my god Brian that's the spirit ex-pro
- I thought that was the coolest filter
when I first came I'm like oh my god it
makes my photos look like dude yeah it's
the worst filter ever I know when you
look back at some of the photos
investigator Graham came out I think
this is interesting yeah we thought it
was great I know but like it was so bad
now there's now a hide tool seeking
archival of like iiving that one no it's
like I want to keep it it's like I made
the sushi look like garbage with ex-pro
- like that because we had crappier yeah
yeah green screens of crappy cameras so
we to a point Moss the fact that it was
such a bad photo in the first place make
it look even worse yeah this is pretty
crazy they're showing off with this app
using again these are tools that a lot
quite honestly not a lot of people are
exposed to that's kind of the problem
right like so what he's showing is how
much like in Photoshop he's literally
completely outlining Johnny Depp Jack
Sparrow and a building this kind of
Pirates of the Caribbean a la movie
poster slash photoshopping slash image
doing some interesting stuff with hair
mapping and mas I don't know I'm a very
cool I'm not gonna lie i'ma check out
infinity photo once I get a new iPad
after mine was stolen aka loss aka
stolen still to be determined like my
iPad pro and my pencil tool and the
pencil oh all in the case that's not
stuff you know I would if I was in
tickets I got my air pod stolen your
your ear pods it like stolen from me yes
uh you know at some point I was entering
TSA security that's all I know is
exiting
I don't know man well when did you lose
them mmm and Mars that's funny I found a
pair of March oh you went all the way to
the airport just watching this campus
called lost and found lost my ear pods
guys I didn't honestly didn't even
bother filing a report because I know
someone snatched them and there's no
lockdown on air pods yeah yeah yeah yeah
there's I mean how can they um so
they're so this cool infinity photo app
I'm honestly would like to check it out
available today they're also talking
about battery claims and the cameras for
this new 10.5 inch iPad pro a 12
megapixel camera rear 7 megapixel
FaceTime front-facing camera we don't
need a good camera on the back it's just
gonna encourage people make cars we will
take photos with an iPad oh stop wait
please we've talked about this for years
and it's not getting any better
don't encourage view I don't I don't
understand why a lot of companies used
to take pictures you know let it like I
went to the I went to the doctor the
other day and the nurse like took a
picture me for their for their records
or whatever it's used an iPad yeah yeah
did you select did you like you know
they know I ain't having that company I
better her personal life Oh sir uh can
you give me Tim coughs here let me let
me take the iPad pro while you do that
weird weird awkward all right um ooh
dongle time yes so here's one of the
most unknown things about the iPad pro
so they're talking about they're going
to be supporting fast charging have
great USB 3 charging charters if you buy
this has happened with the original iPad
pro you can buy a USB C charger and it
charges the Apple iPad pro 2 half times
faster but how to tip right there why
did I I mean I've been looking out for
like a year then like seriously but it
does cost you but it literally charged
it like boom otherwise you wait like six
seven hours you're like this sucks
slower process over lightning so yeah it
supports the faster charging through the
USB see connection but so that's
actually they never that's yeah they
never really promoted that they should
that's
selling feature like they're not gonna
give us wireless charging but they can
give us fast charging line USBC on
Android phones in the pixel come on they
also surely they also surely won't
bundle that with the iPad pro they gonna
make you buy that and how much is that I
think it was like AI think the kit with
the cord and the charger I think it ends
up being spent like 80 bucks you know
what seriously spent about 70 80 bucks
just to get that yeah come on plus the
hundred dollar pencil oh yeah plus the
$5,000 iMac Pro come on so it so I'm
sure I'm honestly confused here hmm
because we're not watching this and I we
can't hear this and this sounds dumb did
they actually update the iPad pro 12
point 9 inch as well or they're just
showing them side by side oh can we
different it can anyone tweet me that
the implication is that they're phasing
it out that would be yes someone let us
know can someone just tweet me like it's
that their cuz they're showing the
pricing of the ten point five inch they
look like they're putting it
side-by-side with the twelve point nine
but are they doing anything different is
the twelve point nine getting any is
that actually a new twelve point nine
yeah it's a few fresh with those
features that yes talking about this how
let you boy I need to know this
immediately because I need a new iPad
pro this is Hall that's this is
basically completely purely selfish room
there there's nothing that's purely
selfish all right looks like this I'm
specific I pad Paige beaches in iOS LS
here we go here we go whoa alright that
app switcher is yeah I need a
compatibility chart for iOS eleven here
whoa
okay okay so much like the desktop right
you can see like a bird's eye view of
your apps it looks like they're getting
that with the app switcher drag and drop
like our gentleman who called in is
coming to the iPad nice I can drag
images you can drag text it's a drag
fest
this track thanks Craig federighi and
they have that new app that they quote
unquote accidentally launched today
called files it's a universal file
system
you can do nested folders spring loading
this is very Mac this is very Mac OS
type of stuff being brought to the iPad
queue every Android oh never being like
you suckers have had this forever
literally literally prefer Android day
one pretty much you know one thing you
guys have also had is multi-user support
Oh like that Apple still refuses to do
most likely to sell more iPads so jerk
this is a Dee move we talked about this
Beecham yeah yeah okay so it that's it's
starting to feel a little bit more
laptop like mm-hmm
will is it good enough to replace a
laptop not we don't know yet probably
not I mean it's getting very close as a
user who is a hardcore iPad pro user I'm
happy to see this stuff but I don't
think it anyone says I gotta get iPad
pro because of this exactly and that's
the thing because you're in the market
for an iPad pro I mean you're not gonna
go out and go well I'll buy this and
then not buy a MacBook right you're not
gonna be doing that you're gonna be
going I need this and potentially a
desktop or a laptop right it's not gonna
be this is my one and only machine I
mean that's the thing I got a spec it
out because the surface pro has so many
more options but it's also way more
expensive because it is a laptop tablet
hybrid it's you know you can get an
entry-level twelve point nine inch iPad
pro for around like eleven hundred you
know if I was gonna get a surface pro
I'm not gonna buy the entry-level 1499
one I want you know the faster
processors I want more hard drive space
and it ends up being like around it
twenty five hundred three thousand
dollar machine for what I'd wanted that
exactly and that's also like a price
consideration like yeah yeah it would
really need to be my primary computer
laptop if that's how much I was going to
drop on it so getting closer though I
mean they're obviously trying a little
bit harder to compete with Microsoft
Microsoft you know is this year more
than ever is taking matters into its own
hands a developer creating its own
laptop so apples probably feeling the
heat a little bit
I mean I think it's again if you're a
user of this stuff I think you're happy
and I mean I'm happy when I look at this
up but I still know the surface probe
it's just so bad so so it is and the
keyboard is so much better oh my gosh
yes it is very tactile it's got great
feedback on it the iPad pro keyboard is
embarrassing yeah I'm sorry it's like
you're like basically typing on this
table mat yeah and it's like clunk it
just feels dirty and I reduce to it you
don't I returned it right away and I was
like you know I'll buy it and just to
use it but I was like no this sucks this
sucks
I don't know I realistically though the
people that are looking at this are most
likely as we've said time time again
already in the Apple acres yesterday
they're not really even knowing that
there is an alternative out there the
surface variety and they're probably
alike windows what's that I don't want
to I don't like I've did Windows that's
years and years ago I decided that Mac
OS and iOS and that ecosystem is where I
want to be and so why do I want to go
back to Windows there's a lot of
residual damage there I'm sure for
people that kind of grew up with this
and then they they're just like they've
gone over to the Apple side and even
though we know there's alternatives they
don't even want to know because they're
so tired right Apple this isn't about
acquiring new customers not Sarah this
is about retaining and keeping that
brand loyalty really valid yeah and
making it very aspirational you know
what I also when you talked about kind
of like some damage from like previous
generations what I find interesting is
that my niece's who are 13 no 14 and
turning 14 11 shout out to Jane and
Calissa alia
they're their generation is actually
more impressed with what Google's doing
yeah they talk about like Oh Google's
way better at XYZ there I they say
without me without me getting into their
heads apples behind Google's doing cool
stuff
I think the Google pixels up cooler
phone than the Apple iPhone right yeah
and that's and I'm like is this just
what you guys think or your friends
saying this stuff and they're that
younger generation thinks Google is but
you know that those teeny Bob they think
that Google's coolers doing more things
now she still has an iPhone right right
but she thinks that Google is actually
doing better more exciting things and I
wonder when you talk
about that generational transition of oh
there's going to be a generation that
feels like Oh Apple just isn't
innovating and other companies are it
takes time to slide up but that that
that type of thinking will exist I mean
we feel it all the time oh yeah you know
we're so funny because we old but I was
saying I was like you know we're all
because you've just dropped in
teenyboppers and they listening as a
generational reference so you know I
mean it's so true the generational thing
is huge I mean just look at the success
of snapchat for example and you know for
our generation you know I used to act
out a lot but it's still confusing and I
still don't think I hundreds and get it
right whereas like I see people that are
you know school age you know like early
20s just so naturally doing it I go out
to concerts and I just see people using
snapchat primarily and then switching
over to Instagram yeah Facebook
primarily going snapchat for us to share
those immediate moments and then switch
back to another platform like even if I
get it it doesn't mean I want to use it
and I think that's partially a
generational thing yes I totally get it
but I don't want to use it it's all the
time brands are - that's where the
people are you want to communicate with
ah like if everyone I knew was on
snapchat how do you snapchat exclusively
but they're not well I mean I'm still
using my space in a friend I'm from you
know French turret yeah I might your top
eight am i your top I Brian come on I'll
have to see I'll have to see the latest
updates I'll have to check that and okay
so they're they're also talking about on
the iPad pro uh marking up marking up
like documents so this is a thing can
you believe this is the thing where the
iPad pro didn't have the capabilities to
mark up right and they had a pencil like
on launch so they're talking about that
as well in the iPad pro there's also a
built-in document scanner so goodbye to
at least a dozen how's that musing the
camera basically using the camera that's
grilling heaven art it's good by all
those Microsoft I mean I use PDFs camera
damn yeah they're all gotten really you
say is that how they advertise it
PDFs get a pro Oh quite the absurd oh
that's PDFs gonna prop trying to make
something extremely boring cool really
honestly that out I don't want to check
out this ABS but sometimes in these
shows we come up with ad campaigns for
companies indirectly I want to use it
what are you using uh Lexi to scan your
PDS oh I use Peter skin a pro you like
but shizzle my nizzle
it's like Snoop Dogg will be the actual
face of that TV commercials I would jump
on it you can thank Cena alive later
alright guys that's great yeah Snoop
Dogg gets money out of it they get money
out of it oh there's a new keyboard what
called the flick keyboard mm-hmm did you
also see this that their time out um I
don't know it harkens back to the Newton
there's basically a hand writing
functionality that smooths out the
curves that makes your hand that will
help to make your handwriting more
legible on the iPad pro I that's kind of
cool yeah I want to see this in action
my goal I what it why are we wanting to
keep handwriting why don't we want to
just convert straight to text I mean
that there's things I mean I've already
cold call me call me devil's advocate
here but I don't quite know if I'm gonna
write something by hand I'm probably
gonna write it true because I want to
convert it to text there is evidence
that handwriting
helps you retain come into memory that's
exactly what I want to do but we don't
know if if you and also need it to you
also need to be reading it back in your
own handwriting yeah oh like the way you
see it the way that you wrote it helps
also in writing in other words should
they just convert it to type text yeah
well I mean I actually want to see my
notes the same way I wrote him ya know I
think about when I think about it that
when I want to search when I want to do
a control if you know when I want to
find something quickly and I'm like I
know I wrote it down somewhere but what
page was that I don't remember I did I
draw a star next to it like how hold up
this is OCR what if it's smart enough to
well it wouldn't Reese was it it
actually
underlined as the characters are to
search like well then I'm interested I'm
necessary
that new iPad those new iPad pro
customers yeah exactly you can no but
you can replace what was that app called
again sure what was it called you can
replace you give you have Scanner Pro I
love it I love it
well yeah so Apple has also I mean if
you've noticed been investing a lot in
its Notes app I mean it improved it so
much so adding OCR which is something
that Evernote has which means that you
can search your handwritten documents
would be huge please please that's
something that it would make me excited
yes it makes me interested in it I mean
as an iPad pro user this is all pretty
sweet yeah I'm doing um as a past uh-huh
yeah FOMA sorry mama okay okay we don't
we're not supposed to agree on
everything I know the wound is still
fresh but oh yeah but I love it I can't
feel my face when I'm with you
damn
send the house on fire yeah isn't it fun
we have those to refer to yeah thanks
for full write-up and you guys were
actually singing enjoying it not
cringing this is this is progress
let's cringy when you were in that video
I believe I think I was in the bossing
somewhere yes yeah look see getting
sloshed in the bar okay see that studio
this - what's an apple juice apple juice
was exchanged so they're summarizing up
here right now we're really excited
about what we're doing with the iPad
this year and really excited about iOS
11 this year the files app was
absolutely necessary for all of these
new functions I mean you can handwrite
and scan but not save these documents it
would be ridiculous though I'm also just
for doing the obvious thing is I'm also
I'm also just feeling like they
put they finally made it people at least
are interested in the iPad pencil or the
Apple pencil so confirm actually more
worthwhile like it you pay 99 bucks for
this stylus I mean pencil but it's like
they actually added a lot of
functionality that can help make it more
useful as also the response of time is
that's pretty much like you won't even
feel that now yeah 20 milliseconds
you're not going to feel that just out
of curiosity can you use it that potty
stylus with the iPad pro not obviously
to get a bunch of the same functionality
but just for the basic tasks of drawing
and sketching and things like that you
can but it won't be nearly as precise so
that um app gosh what was it the one
that originally created okay paper
here they've had a stylus for years yeah
I had a lot of jokes that I didn't want
to go into so I'm just gonna leave that
with you moving right on up there I just
so many opportunities thoughtful and I
want to be respectful some once in a
while but I had to let you know that I
wasn't gonna be respectful but that I
chose to be respected in a way you just
ruined it because he's not going you
didn't hear the joke
in fact trust me inside voice alright it
looks like they're showing a video now
of the iPad pro to my 5 inch promotional
video people using it in public
um and so we're gonna let them enjoy
that okay one more thing
what's up no I mean Oh kiss back on
stage dynamo fee Oh
lasting oh man I need to change this
video card out one last thing that's
gonna be the next one last thing it's
got to be the series speaker this got to
be decision yeah what else is live
they've been hinting out at the whole
time exactly they said it's the biggest
ever come on don't let us down oh let
you see our attention to music what a
listener you're getting your boom box
yes yes beats boombox pika-pika
499 series speaker yeah if it looked
like a boom box that might actually be
cool really
[Laughter]
this is really embarrassing sometimes
it's cool sometimes it's not that all
right um they're saying today the iPhone
has become the best portable music
player in the world it's even better
when it's paired with Apple music really
come on no sorry I shouldn't use those
gestures here
you now have 40 million songs in your
pocket I can't help myself so this is
ridiculous oh whatever
music oh yeah we have such a great
portable music experience but what about
our home well here's what's interesting
they're positioning more as a music
device right now not a smart speaker
yeah totally intro this beats
integration it's all about that right
Apple knows the obvious which is that
most people although many many more
people are adopting smart home devices
more people listen to music and honestly
very good point when I have the Google
home out even though it's sitting in my
drawer now but when I did have it out it
was really only play music and listen
write headlines news headlines and
podcasts yeah that's what is really the
prime yeah okay and set timers and check
the way they have music in podcast we
have the technology so apple says a like
we did with portable music we want to
reinvent home music Phil Schiller's
backup stage to talk about this I have
some interesting points that we can
follow up about this because Phil
Schiller had some really interesting
comments slamming both the echo and the
home just a couple weeks ago in general
so here we go let's let's hear what you
did it again there are certainly a lot
of companies hard at work making
products to enjoy music at home but none
of them have nailed it yet I mean if I
would say Amazon would not call it a
primary it's if it's about sound quality
if it's about sound quality 100% agree
yeah if it's about sound quality but is
it um so he said that the team has been
working on a breakthrough home speaker
yeah remember one Apple released that
big home speaker they did before
it was like a three hundred dollar
speaker it was an apple really it was a
big one I can't remember the name of it
it was back in the old school days so oh
it needs to rock the house free from
distortion what am I telling you guys
see Brooke the house it's gonna have
this massive sub in it and it's gonna be
able to rock but just just the base does
amaze just the basement I need anything
else in the music it's also they say
secondly it needs to be spatially aware
it's going to fit in different rooms in
our home like every speaker yes every
speaker remain like a yeah like it can
be the size of my room
third they say it needs a musicologist
I'm sorry oh thank you a great degree
that you can get this means that dr. Dre
and I mean I'm gonna come out and be
like what's the professor where's that
we need a toxicology you know guys we
almost forgot about Dre where we're
working on this speaker for the late for
later this year but we wanted to give
you a sneak peek of it this morning
we're gonna start showing a video of the
speaker close-up don't tell me it's just
a promo teaser video oh with something
like covered okay hold on um we're gonna
give it a few moments to see no guys it
has a name it's called Hong Kong speaker
it looks like the macro we covered no do
I win the bingo yeah Josh are you in the
bingo of life that's amazing I recovered
Oh No look at the video is even showing
the curves here it's it it's a suit it's
like the UE you a boom yes well it is I
wasn't big it is right now it looks like
the Metro seven inches tall Oh Shara
covered in a seamless mesh oh I'm still
gonna try it out I ain't gonna lie I
mean I might wreck right now I want to
try it I want to hear this so called
sound quality is supposedly better yeah
I want different colors that doesn't go
with my you know with your anybody they
laid out they might offer later colors
additionally later it has a sari here
I'm gonna jump you it has a big woofer a
four inch woofer that is forward-facing
so better better Dee
per base fuller sound as we turn up the
volume it's free from distortion I
thought they didn't even have one on on
hand so how do they it's mine it's
packed with speakers and microphones
there is an a8 processor chip inside
perhaps the biggest brain in a speaker I
think that's a really cool point how
they can use their older processors on
their phones that can handle so much and
put it in these you know I don't want to
call a lower entry device but just maybe
not a sophisticated advise yeah but
still have all that power that that is
interesting that they can take all those
returned iPhones in a but that she's
here recycle hey Bessie do you guys see
any buns on it I haven't seen by yet
yeah I mean this is great there's no
mention of Syrian in it yet either is
not not not yet way they're setting it
up they've got talking about the
microphones they're talking about you
know echo cancellation things that are
hopefully gonna be useful for some sort
of voice integration the thing the thing
that I love is I just want to see
everyone's you know because Twitter is a
bunch of it's white-hot steaks that are
just completely ridiculous
oh there's white also I just can't wait
to see what people are saying about the
design because you know it's like it
says they're getting murdered right now
it's a joke as a joke oh I was gonna say
because I actually think that of all the
ways they could have gone this is not
offensive that oh no I'll actually
actually like it tonight it's it's
subtle it's just that it looks you know
like one of their products that is
pretty much you know it looks like the
Mac Pro so when and we've seen a lot of
this actually historically an apple
recently where their design yes to be
cohesive with the message of what
they've done the past right stuffs not
it's not I don't want to say risk-taking
but it's not like you've when was the
last AP product that you said that
design is amazing I don't think we've
seen anything like that just the iPhone
problem right iPhone um let me think
about oh the iMac that very thin iMac
yeah that was good but you know so this
just kind of stays in line with what
they've had before it's it's cool I mean
it's not it's hard to make something
that's elegant but not ugly but still
also neutral and generic I think
especially for the home yeah exactly and
like to that point they were talking
about a device that was going to be a
fit into any room in the house like I
could see that in a bathroom I could see
that in a kitchen and it's inoffensive
and it doesn't look like an air
freshener yes sitting renews it is that
what the air freshener that the Google
home looks like yeah I can use it like
it straight up looks like a Glade plugin
yeah oh yeah absolutely
hmmm I would say that of all the smart
speaker designs the echo dot is probably
my favorite but definitely does not have
the sound quality yeah that it has the
right right now it has the you know
pretty tinny yeah
but you have the ability to pull your
tooth plug it in so it depends if your
primary function if your primary use
case for this is as a smart connected
speaker then you're gonna probably want
the dot unless they're going to come out
and say I'm appliance yeah we heard that
Siri this is really interesting because
based on the sensors it has and we'll
see the thing is like okay how how much
does this really matter I I guess it
does matter a lot but we'll have to test
in different environments intelligently
and automatically it detects the space
it's in it uses that information to
change the sound maybe whether it's high
vaulted ceilings our ceilings a more
narrow space versus a wider open space
or maybe there's things that could be
obstructed I don't know it'll be
interesting to see how that helps um it
shoots and beams in different directions
of the audio so yeah it's room aware for
space and sound they're saying if you
love one you should see what it's like
when you set up - hold on wait today is
this a new technology we've never heard
before never had surround sound called
Sonos he's like you could put one on
your left side yeah one on your right
side yeah ideally that is stereo
surround surround 5.1 4.1 sound stereo
2.1 okay our 2.0 just don't don't hate
on me all right I mean they are really
focusing on the music so okay so here it
is as you see those magic words haze
Siri as you say those magic words hey
Siri it can help serve up music so yes
there is Siri yes there is a glowing top
much like
Google home or even Alexa although it's
going to be a little bit more like that
I go Lyla that looks cool that cool it
locks cool from the top it's like an
open it's like an egg there's like a
futuristic nest like with a blue egg in
it you know so here's the question you
know here's the question is it only for
use with Apple music because that I
implied alien songs - what's your air
playing it they're playing something to
it yeah but not natively not negatively
saying hey Siri play me something
something on Spotify this is like the
Google Maps conundrum where it's like I
don't want to use Apple Maps I don't use
em Joanna has a subscription I want to
give you X and amount of dollars for
this speaker but I don't want to be
again tied into an app that I don't like
that doesn't have the music I want on it
yep that glow that glowing thingy on the
top does does look kind of fun but
you'll never see it because it's on and
it's integrated so deep that you won't
actually see the glowing ring or any
it's like hey for eye candy guys gonna
show you this really cool glowing top
you'll never see in person well and that
that's why you know part of Google homes
design is clever because it's slanted
yeah and so you can kind of glance
across the room to make sure she's
hearing they're also saying it has a
great and hope helpful home assistant we
talked about its music hook so you can
say things like play this song by you
know the normal stuff that we're used to
play beats 1 radio play I'm poppy so
that stuff is there but they're talking
about how it is also grateful and
helpful as a home assistant we'll wait
and see in a few moments how much it
knows but like you said when the caller
came in earlier about obviously there's
going to be Phillips integration
typically Wemo Belkin Wemo platform is
one of the first ones that is compatible
what are some of the other ones like
honeywell nest oh yeah irma sets those
are some of the core goals are always
there any cameras so it sounds like it's
we don't know how limited or complete
the Siri experience every other said yep
all of the features available so I'm
going to guess home kit is also
available from a brief look at that list
it looks like it's pretty much the Syria
that we know
don't love that much on the firing just
accessible through the speak yeah
and Dan Ackerman makes a great point
from CNET is it not the full Siri or is
this just a list of predetermined skills
that's unclear because they aren't
talking about and again when we talk
about a predetermined list think appletv
predetermined list of what you can do
not the full serie yeah and so that
that's interesting to see as well you
can say are the lights on turn the
temperature 273 degrees as they're kind
of going through some of the smart stuff
this is a screenshot that someone should
take of all these kind of different
commands that are on their text Eric
meet me at the Kabuki theater at 7:00 is
one of them set a three-minute timers on
there how long will it take to drive to
Tahoe so a lot of the stuff that we're
used to seeing but clearly integrated
with your Apple ecosystem what we don't
necessarily have is the power of Google
so the reason why you know I think
despite Alexa's integration with way
more devices Google home as a day-to-day
assistant is a lot more helpful because
it has the knowledge graph of Google so
Apple I mean man I I don't know how
they'll make up for that gap in
knowledge literally and it might take
some time if they're rolling out you
know a new AI platform and you smart
write your own learning platform that
takes time to build their own library of
that stuff they can't just all of a
sudden you know Google has exactly been
curious for god knows how many here's
right so and it's like would you rather
have a seamless integrated Apple home or
would you rather sacrifice a little bit
of that integration to have a more
probably like innovative and advanced
smarter speaker you're so talking a lot
about encryption so it's never listening
to you yeah you know when you're when
you're not when when you haven't said
hey Siri it's not listening to you all
your what you're saying is encrypted
it's all local it looks like when they
say local recognition I don't know how
much is actually being sent and being
processed by servers versus just
specifically just ie of your device is
private to so that's pretty cool
home pod pricing 349 3
that's a less actually yeah that's now
now I will argue that if this is truly
like an amazing speaker true yeah
then and that's how much you would be
paying us 300 bucks really good
Bluetooth speaker very example you would
not find that out of the ordinary in the
Bluetooth speaker akut for a really good
quality one
but given the functionality with Siri
appears at the moment to be somewhat
limited yeah it's a lot of cash
especially if you can get as you said
Sharon a dot for like what don't litter
your head oh well you can know every
root connector house and if you yeah and
if you already have Bluetooth speakers
lying around you can already hook them
on yeah and get a better quality audio
any but you know what it is about making
these smart speakers really easy to use
and understand and for a family of Apple
users I think it's hard to make the leap
and figure out how their current devices
integrate with Google more election
totally it's just to know that oh it's
all under one hood it's all in this
ecosystem of it that I think we just can
never you can never underestimate the
power of an ecosystem
you just can't and you know when when we
look at this because we know the
landscape of what's happening just
generally in tech it always it always
comes back to what your ecosystem oh
yeah you know and so there there it is
here as well just the power like there
will be plenty of people that will buy
this because they want it to work they
want to know know that it's going to
work here's a question though do you
think the explanation that Apple has
given it well basically based on what
we've read in the blog if you think that
was enough to make people understand
what a connected speaker is compared to
seeing a demo from the ads from Amazon
and echo or the Google home for example
well I think that's why they focused on
it as a music player as a music yeah
speaker which I mean that's that's
actually a big gamble for them because
they're really hoping that enough people
want a connected music speaker right as
opposed to just a smart assistant
speaker at home
and then it's like oh and by the way
Siri also works
I think the gamble the big myths here
that I'm really feeling and seen here at
WWDC is look they like you said they
didn't they're not necessarily focusing
on the smart aspects of Siri did we
really learn that Siri is that much
better than it was before we that's
that's the biggest takeaway for me right
now yeah that's the biggest opportunity
for them to show us that like the
virtual assistant artificial
intelligence this is what our vision of
it is moving forward there's there was
nothing like oh my god so we did get a
few things just to touch on the new
voice which we haven't heard yet maybe
it's better and the conversation feature
so you can continue the conversation but
is she smarter but is she's smarter I
don't think she is
I died I again look I can't I always
have two premises I can't make Siri okay
I'm not that smart so people like do
okay why don't you make a better series
how many times I've heard crap like that
what did you make an iPhone okay yeah
why don't you make one you can't make
one either you can't make one so again
though that's at a Developers Conference
that's the type of stuff that I thought
I'd hear a little more because it tells
you how much smarter is Apple's iPhone I
I think the most exciting at least from
a moving forward thing is what they did
with the iPad pro in iOS 11 I think
those some of those features stand out
the most um but yeah I don't I don't
think they made it Examiner at all well
from a developer's standpoint as well
like you're gonna see this new product
this harm pod right and then you're
going what do I do with this as a
developer why I put it in my phone but I
can't develop anything for it
like what where is that that disconnect
was huge for me
yeah Developers Conference where you're
focusing on you know they're talking
about things you know hardware
improvements that are going to make
things like VR a reality on Macs gaming
discrete graphics things that are
actually interesting to developers who
are making applications for the platform
and then you go oh and here's something
you can put in your house but you can't
make anything for it right I think maybe
it's very early for them it is yes for
that it is and you know I am never gonna
complain when a company shows us shows
us something early
but again you know whether this home pod
is that great or not I don't doubt that
it's probably the best sounding home
speaker because really the you know
they're they aren't that great sounding
yet I'd actually don't doubt that but
again it's the brains underneath this
stuff I don't I don't know if Apple got
smarter they're they are products
company but man you just know when you
see what every other company is doing
from an AI standpoint I didn't feel like
we're moving that much the Apple didn't
make that much of a jump that I was
hoping for not enough to warrant this is
the best WWDC ever this is the most
stuff that we were ever going to show
you I mean it is the most stuff not
maybe not the best stuff is this the
best most stuff is that oh is that a
best most yeah okay so it looks like
apples wrapping up we're gonna keep the
phone lines open let's just hang here
for me like 15 20 minutes to talk a
little bit talk a little bit of shop if
you guys and gals want to call us I'm
sorry there were some people that were
waiting on the line then told keynote
and finally gave up cuz it's hard I get
it but you can call us the phone number
there right there one eight eight eight
nine hundred see and eighty two six
three eight
oh he's gonna take these calls hot whoa
we're gonna take these calls hot so if
you're calling just hang on but the
lines are filling up we're gonna take
about five and then we'll talk a little
more wrap this up but welcome to here we
go welcome to CNET live please tell us
your name and where you're from and I
know people that are calling and are
wondering are they talking to you well
I'm talking to you so just say hi hi yes
who is this is Jim from Minnesota what's
up Jim from Minnesota welcome to the
show I'm guessing you saw the keynote
along with us is that correct yes I did
i watch the whole time with you guys yes
you are a beast I love that uh so you
called to talk listen let's hear what's
on your mind I mean the keynote just
wrapped up wrapped up what sticks out
things you liked I just lay it on us
um I kind of disappointed from a
developer standpoint let us know why
it's please um so I'm disappointed
because I first I don't like the store
because a lot of small developers won't
get a chance to be noticed right away
that's a huge thing for me because it is
a huge selling point for Apple to market
that product hunt is your new best
friend yeah but like exactly speaking
the Gimli exactly that's the first thing
I saw I'm like how our developers gonna
get seen it's so much they've narrowed
that that funnel that pipe I would it
let's jump over to the home pod
I'm the Mac Pro I'm sorry the home pod
fabric Mac Pro what it would as a
developer I mean they didn't give us
enough but what did you think of that um
I didn't really I honestly I didn't like
it that much I mean they obviously
haven't spoke about giving any
developers any development things to use
I developed on the Amazon echo I um they
let us you know have that right away and
they said there's a bunch of different
applications you can do this is the
ecosystem this is how it's going to work
and then they said something new is
going to be coming very quickly
following after which was really really
nice with Apple I haven't heard anything
from them obviously they don't even have
the hardware in place right now they're
just showing you what this is going to
be but I don't think they're even making
it currently I think they're going to
make adjustments to it but honestly at
home for personal use I'm using like
what a $45 Amazon echo dot with a Sonos
play five generation to like that's all
I need it can hear me across the room it
plays amazing sound I just think that
the price point this is currently set at
it's just not worth it they're their
business period the series a big thing
they're basically just like wait wait if
you haven't yet purchased a smart
speaker wait for us we're coming don't
worry
yeah the I mean Amazon has done a
fantastic job with their AI like I can
ask my echo dot a bunch of different
things it can actually go out there can
find things there's apps being made now
where's the echo dot eventually is going
to be able to you'll be able to like
tell a wireless camera if you detect
motion the echo dot will respond to you
and say hey there's motion in this
it's going to work forward and backwards
but right now you just have a list of
things you can say to Siri and every
single time you say something it didn't
get that it didn't understand it's just
really it's awful well this is a gym
thanks so much we're going to jump
through the calls but thanks so much for
the inside I love your perspective as a
developer you know it's funny when
you're like oh they didn't really tell
us much about Siri and it's you know how
we can use it as a developer and we're
like yeah it's a developers conference
maybe yeah I just want to be clear I'm
very excited for Apple to create its own
smart speaker and enter the race for
sure it's a matter of like it's the
context of the show and and the amount
of catching up or not catching up they
did during that announcement so in and
kind of calling it a music just
basically a speaker but you were okay
with that one they fer cuz the
positioning of it right now I understand
it from a business perspective why they
would do that that makes sense but it's
not we know that we as tech experts know
that that's not what they're creating
here they are creating a smart speaker
so yeah it must have been very
disappointing for developers to not get
access to it yes and they will
eventually have one quick question yes
you got to cut you out I'll go ahead I
just wanted to know to everybody who's
listening do you think Apple had a wall
of just random names that they threw
darts at when they named all their
products uh-huh it's well well well
first of all you know that first of all
the dart wall there's half of the room
that all had eyes on it okay there's
like I blank I this and then and then
the other in naming that home pod the
other half just had pot at the end
because they're like well the iPod is
our history it's our music product right
we have to keep the pod somehow in there
that's not a pod that's a speaker but
okay we'll call the pod and then they
had all these other names on it right
but let's let's all get guess a sound
pod was probably one of them music pod
boom box smart pot Jim you want to throw
your name in the Hat you want to throw
out a name with pot at the end
ooh I would just say the pod pod pro-pot
Quatro I have a bro
I have a Popeye's Oh bro why am i doing
yes it's catchy
hey it's engrained in hey Jim thanks so
much for calling we appreciate that all
right and thanks for watching
awesome all right we're gonna jump over
again we're gonna kind of keep on
getting through some of these calls and
just see where you guys are at I'm gonna
take on this call welcome to the show
name where you're from and let us know
what you want to talk about what's up
brother what's up hey ladies hi hello
who's this how you doing oh I'm just
talking about that home power situation
yeah
child through a throwback that's all you
know how we used to have phone calls all
right Amazon's doing the same thing
everybody is doing right back to the 90s
that's always going on right now grace
time use a really nice nineties kids are
running things right now oh yeah it's
true yeah so what happened it was truly
happening is is that they're really
really trying to introduce something
because what's happening is on the
podcast on that situation what they
trying to do is like grat learn you know
machine learning trying to grab people
in so they can analyze everything we're
going on first and about 325 is it 325
334 t9 price range is for people that
can afford that range yep cause if they
can do a lot of learn machine learning
and all that type of situation right now
for that stuff that's what they're
trying to accomplish right now all right
that's their main goal yeah are you a
customer you someone that how does it
how about this does that appeal to you
or not you know as a consumer whether
you're the applicant or not you saw what
they just announced does that product
right now as it stands appeal to you
like would you buy it or you're more on
the fence or you're like no no it's not
that I won't buy it is just that it
peels for somebody that is looking more
towards you know somebody is you know
certain amount of income and they're
looking for either flexibility they're
looking for you know somebody that can
basically touch you know like alright I
could just talk to my speaker I'm good
just kind of like the Amazon echo yeah
but the Amazon echo has a learning and I
think they threw in they have some form
of more machine learning then you know
and apples trying to get into it but
they haven't there's a lot of they have
a lot of wealth and they people are
aware of that of their wealth and that's
what's happening and they're going into
that motion and saying we have to first
introduce the audio aspect and the
microphone inside the speaker itself for
the whole pie and that's the first thing
they need to do in order to get the you
know the machine learning first yeah
well you know what density but you guys
know you guys are aware of it yeah we
and we'll see we'll see where it goes I
think that thanks so much for calling I
think it's it's a great point of like
yeah Apple prices it at a certain point
specifically because they try to cater
to a specific audience purely based on
their price point they've always done
that quite honestly they've been a
little more um actually more competitive
in general but still not you know
competitive what the rest of the market
is putting out there so I you know even
there Apple watch they drop the price
you know to make it a little more
affordable I think what is it at 229
which I think the Apple watch to 248
launched the original one came out of
like 349 and I'm like and that's like
come on are you serious and so they're
aware of it but at the same time when a
new product and it's a new platform that
comes out they like to price it high
they like to appeal to basically their
high-end users which tend to have more
disposable income and they're they're
not they're not bashful about at all
they've never been so thanks for calling
we appreciate that I'm gonna take in the
next line welcome to see net live this
is Brian Sharon and Lexie welcome to
show what's up where you what's your
name are you from hey I'm Justin Amash
you from Canada Oh Canada
what up Justin welcome to the show what
do you want to talk about
um I want to say from real quick I was
actually really disappointed with
majority of the show I I thought there
would have been a whole bunch of updates
to the OS there was barely anything for
developers there's barely anything for
consumers Maps barely even has showcase
yeah I agree with you you know when we
were talking about earlier in the show
they were speeding three through things
it felt like they were speeding through
things it was and we knew that they had
a lot to announce it felt like they were
showing off a few features that
consumers like you me might might or
might not care about but it didn't cater
to the developers and I'm not asking
them to get into a nitty gritty like
session about Swift and coding and and
whatnot but I don't know if they and
maybe these workshops on the side a lot
of times after the keynote it's the
workshops that happened behind the
scenes that appealed to developers and
teach them about these hooks I don't
know if that's going to answer any
questions specifically about the home
pod they're there I most likely will not
have any type of workshops off the side
about the home pod you know and when
there's new hardware you want to know
how you can develop for it are you I am
an iPad pro user did you like any of
that stuff they're showing off with a
pencil you're like yeah just not for me
because you don't use an iPad pro um
personally I don't use the the pen
myself but one thing that stood out for
me is that I absolutely loved with the
whole filing system and again that was
the only thing that really stood out for
me really all right well I think that we
can count your vote as a disappointed
WWDC keynote viewer is that correct that
is absolutely correct all right thanks
so much for college and we appreciate
all right thank you for sure awesome
thank you okay we're gonna jump in here
let's try and get this call here welcome
to see that live welcome to the crew
you're on what's up hello hey I'm fine
hello what's your name where you from
yeah I'm come on yeah my name is Anton
Colin vapor yeah I'm calling from India
Bangalore India Wow
also if you turn the volume on your
computer down and just talk to us
through the phone then you'll be able to
talk to us like real-time what do you
want to talk about after this Kino
so I'm talking about a consumer point of
view it's a real disappointing for me as
I was really expecting a lot more
changes in the is 11 as it marks a tenth
it marks a 10th anniversary for applo so
I was expecting a lot of changes in a
indigent face in iOS 11 oh you wanted to
see me be a new design yeah a new design
a new interface does a lot there was a
huge rumor of dark mode and yes yes many
many people were waiting for dark mode
but it didn't came out so I was actually
waiting for dark mode till the last
moment but it didn't came out so that's
a real disappointing and and of course
new a new interface a new new iPhone
design because it's basically the same
same interface since 6 to 7 years now
and there's not a huge under not does
not huge amount of changes that has been
done yet so I was thinking about some
new overall new changes but that thing
came out there's a a very very little
change that has been done from iOS 10 to
11 so that's the thing and talking about
the VAR project and so those things are
also a little is similar to the project
tango and the proactive say rating is
also similar to Google now that is now 2
years old thing so there's not anything
that much noon is apart from the MacBook
Pro and all but there's nothing on new
innovative innovative what about what
about the $4,999 I'm Mac Pro I mean
can't we all get around that can't we
all just dig into our wallets and just
come up with 4999 obviously I think that
for video AR VR professionals I would
think that this show is very exciting
for them they're you know so but for the
general consumer base besides a smart
speaker I think you made some great
points there I mean talking about kind
of the interface design and the lack of
options that we've been thinking about
wanting a lot for a long time such as
dark mode I mean I mean just interested
to know like urine I'm assuming you're
tied into the Apple ecosystem quite
deeply like is this making you more or
less excited for an upcoming hardware
release like the iPhone later on this
year are you going to be thinking about
upgrading knowing that it's going to
look like iOS 11 except the outsides
going to be different well actually he
would answer if I didn't accidentally
drop this whole time I don't want to
interrupt you I wanted you to continue
on with the question and then I would
break the news to you tonight so um
we're sorry but yeah so you won't be I'm
gonna that's an email and on that note
yeah on that note everybody uh we have
to run there are so many more you guys
that guys and gals that called we're
sorry that we can't get all them the
lines are still full but we're going to
wrap things up here at Sina live make
sure you go to our breakdowns we have
people inside the WWDC keynote that will
have first looks at videos of whatever
they're showing us over there maybe
there's a home pod behind glass I don't
think it's behind glass I can see people
tweeting they touch it there's also
stations for some video ooh I don't even
know so anyways thank you all for
