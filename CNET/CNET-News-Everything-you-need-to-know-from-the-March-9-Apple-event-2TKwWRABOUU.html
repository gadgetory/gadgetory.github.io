broadband connection and an apple device
there will be brand new HBO now channel
on Apple TVs and you can enjoy HBO on
the big screen and you can watch HBO on
your iphones and ipads as well we will
introduce our new product in early April
for 1499 a month so we are lowering the
price today to 16 on the new macbook
weighs just two pounds this is the
lightest mac we have ever made and eve
at its thickest point it's just 13.1
millimeters thin as you can see the new
macbook is twenty-four percent thinner
and when you open it up you're struck by
one of its most dominant features that
keyboard it has a full-size keyboard it
goes all the way to the edge that
actually defines the size of the
notebook well the perfect size display
to match to that full-size keyboard is a
12 inch display with full edge to edge
cover glass and to be beautiful of
course it's a retina display one
connector supports USB data display port
power hdmi vga all through one connector
the technology behind this is a brand
new standard called USB see an apple
along with the number of other companies
have all worked together to create this
new industry standard here's the cable
for us bc it's a third the size of a
standard USB cable it's easier to use
because it's reversible no more trying
to dive underneath and figure out which
way it goes and it's the most versatile
connector you'll see adapters from Apple
as well as many third parties to support
all these different interfaces all
through one connector now I'd like to
turn to the newest addition to the Apple
family and of course I'm talking about
the Apple watch Apple watch is the most
personal device we have ever created
it's not just with you it's on you
so you might like this traditional face
it's absolutely gorgeous or you might
like one that's available in a variety
of different colors or one that is just
fun but this is just the beginning
because the fact is you can add many
details to the face that you choose you
can add things like the date you can add
the world clock you can add a stopwatch
you can even add your next meeting so if
you swipe up from the bottom of the
watch face you can see things like
whether your calendar glances allows you
to control your music and you can even
check your heart rate you can also with
the built-in speaker and microphone you
can receive calls on your watch I have
been wanting to do this since I was five
years old the day is finally here now if
you go to lunch or want to pick up
dinner on the way home you might go to
Whole Foods well you can use Apple watch
to actually pay for things while you're
checking out I've got my credit cards
right inside my watch to bring one up
all I have to do is double tap the side
button and it brings up my credit card
and then I just put my watch near the
merchant terminal and I've paid that's
it I'm done super simple to pay with
Apple watch the 38 millimeters starts at
only 549 and ranges to 10 49 depending
upon your selection of the watch band
