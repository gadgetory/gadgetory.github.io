smart bed by Sleep Number it is the new
it bed by Sleep Number that starts at
one thousand dollars for a queen bed and
goes on up for there it is designed for
people who are just getting into the
mattress industry buying a mattress for
the first time and they want to figure
out how to have a better night sleep in
the smartest way possible so the bed I'm
sitting on right now has all sorts of
built-in sensors that give you biometric
data about your sleep so that includes
heart rate breath rate how restless
you've been how long you stay in bed if
you get up in the middle of the night a
lot and it gives you a report the next
day so you can actually get sort of a
score as to how well you did at your
sleep and give you sort of suggestions
on how you can maybe improve it going
forward another new thing that they've
introduced here at CES is the Sleep
Number API they have an announced
official partners yet but they do plan
to integrate with other apps so that you
can actually say if I exercise in the
morning they might notice a trend that
says maybe you sleep better on the days
where you get a lot of exercise and
they'll let you know that maybe you
should exercise a little bit more so
that you can get a better night's sleep
it also has a traditional Sleep Number
technology so you can lay back and
actually just settle in and let the app
decide what your perfect optimal sleep
balance is so the mattress just designs
itself around your comfort level and
there are actually two different zones
so if you have a partner in the bed next
to you you can have your zone and they
can have their own zone to the new it
bed by Sleep Number is not available yet
but it will be this summer so stay tuned
for updates we especially are interested
in sticking one in the cnet smart home
to see just
trouble and smart it really is Christina
