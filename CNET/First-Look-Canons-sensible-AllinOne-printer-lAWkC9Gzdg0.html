cnet.com today I'm taking a first look
at the canon pixma NX 372 home office
printer it takes the same general shape
as I've come to see from the Canon Pixma
line you could see the control panel
embedded on the front here there's also
an auto document feeder on top that's
for scanning documents tax but unlike
most all-in-one printers the cartridge
Bay actually sits below the scanner this
one is actually the first to put it
behind the paper output tray Canon calls
this new method of loading ink
cartridges fast front and it lets you
simply pull down a door to expose the
inks this particular model is pretty
cheap at just $80 retail so you'll only
get one cartridge for black ink another
that houses the tricolor ink set based
on this limitation I would not recommend
this printer if you want to print out a
lot of photos first of all because the
quality won't be as great as competing
printers with five separate ink tanks
and the other reason is because the more
photos you print they're more ink
that'll get drawn from the single
tricolor cartridge what does that mean
well you'll end up spending a lot more
money on consumables in the long run
that said this is definitely a good
printer if you're an individual using it
for a home office you get all the
day-to-day print scanning and fax
functionality but you can also use
canons really generous software suite
that also includes a new feature called
HD movie print this is pretty cool so if
you happen to be using this with a Canon
HD video camera you can actually use
that software to pull HD quality
snapshot photos out of the film you can
also edit video images with the software
to prepare a clip for capture and canons
easy print photo e.x software also lets
you print calendars custom templates and
stickers again though try to limit the
amount of full-color creations you're
printing since the dual ink tanks will
quickly run out so just to recap the MX
372 will definitely work for users that
value cost and features over output
quality but amateur photographers and
offices should keep shopping for a more
capable machine maybe one that uses five
separate ink tanks to bring up photos
and presentations to that professional
level you can read all the details about
this printer and more on cnet.com but
that's gonna do it for me I'm Justin you
you just took a first look at the
canon pixma MX 372 all-in-one thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
