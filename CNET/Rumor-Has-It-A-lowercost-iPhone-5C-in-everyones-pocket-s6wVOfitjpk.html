has it the show that rounds up the
week's biggest tech rumors and you can
vote on what you think about the rumors
too in the interactive player if you're
watching on CNN this week Apple's at it
again and it seems that Nokia wants to
help you find yourself let's get started
first up Lumia smartphone owners will
find it easier to find things that they
might have misplaced if a new rumor pans
out the verge citing anonymous sources
reports that Nokia plans to unveil a
proximity gadget for its Lumia lineup
the sensor that's called a treasure tag
could be attached to all sorts of items
like your keys your wallet a bike a
purse this sounds like similar devices
that work with Android and iOS but this
would be specific to the Lumia line
you'd then be able to track down the
location of the item directly from your
smartphone using bluetooth 4.0 and NFC
once you're close enough the tag would
emit a sound to pinpoint the exact spot
it's like a game of hot and cold but
with your phone I can imagine that this
would be useful for lots of people but
the problem that I have is that I lose
my phone so I guess I'm screwed next up
among the millions of iphone rumors one
that keeps popping up is that there
might be a low-cost addition to the
lineup that's being referred to as the
iphone 5c maybe c for cheap and as
apples fall product reveal approaches
alleged images of the new iphone parts
are appearing with greater frequency the
latest is this photo of packaging for an
iphone 5c which appeared on the Chinese
way phone discussion forum and reports
citing worker abuse at apple supplier
pegatron inadvertently mentions an
iphone with the plastic cover and even
further protective cases for the alleged
iphone 5c are already up on Amazon who's
going to buy a case for a phone that
doesn't even exist yet but I actually do
think that Apple will produce a cheaper
iPhone that way everybody can have one
but how would a cheaper iPhone be any
different some might even say that going
back to a plastic back would be better
no more shattered phones which lead to
shattered dreams what do you
ice think is Apple working on a cheaper
iPhone don't forget to vote and leave a
comment and I'll ask the cnet council
what it thinks the cnet Council is
composed of five editors who cast their
votes anonymously their opinions are not
an endorsement by Cena or CBS
Interactive obviously because these are
rumors folks and the cnet council's
verdict is yes three out of five cnet
editors think that there will be a
lower-cost iPhone but that it won't be
for the US market interesting that's our
show everybody please share your rumors
that rumor has it at cnet com or call us
at 1 800 750 cnet and tweet us and tune
in next week for more tech rumors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
