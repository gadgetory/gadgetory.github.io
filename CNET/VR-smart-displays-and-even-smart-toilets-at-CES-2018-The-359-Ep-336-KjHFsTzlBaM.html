to you live from the CES 2018 see that
stage in Las Vegas Ben are you we're
writing about some interesting news
yesterday with Google and smart
assistants and you got a little goodie
here for us yeah check it out this is
the Lenovo smart display it was just
announced yesterday it's one of four new
smart displays which are Google
assistant enabled touch screens that you
could basically do anything that you
might be able to do with smart speaker
right you've also got what yes it's very
much it's very much like an echo show so
the things that you could do with this
that you wouldn't be able to do with the
smart speaker or look at photos actually
do like recipes like you can watch the
recipes see you to do early look at it
we got so yeah yeah it looks very much
like an echo show but the speakers on
the side instead of the bottom also it
also looks a lot like a tablet but you
know I talked to them a lot about this
and there was a big intention to try to
make it not a tablet it doesn't have 4G
LTE connection it always needs to be
plugged in and everything that you see
on it you kind of have to or its you're
able to see it from afar this isn't
meant to like have you hold it and be up
front all day because it is it's bulky I
mean you can you can tell by lifting it
it's a little bit heavier yeah and it's
got this back design here that allows it
to go this way that way but it's book
it's definitely not a tablet you can't
like carry this around like that like
I'm good but it's that'd be really weird
that's not the point at all yeah taking
the bedroom or the kitchen it's very
much supposed to be like plugged in so
like you or is it portable too no it
needs to be there I go on button you
have to plug in some interesting aspects
on this there's some you know some parts
that's done with privacy yeah yeah so
this is an actual physical switch that
you can use to hide the camera you
switch it off is it like actually cover
the case yeah you'll see a little red
cover over it to show that it's the
cameras no longer working yeah so that's
just like an additional
peace of mind kind of thing because like
it's my functional yeah able to mic the
microphone there's also a switch for the
microphone so I think there was at least
an awareness that people are concerned
that there are gonna be these always
listening always on either microphones
or cameras and so they're trying to at
least make some effort to make people a
little bit more comfortable with this
stuff whether people actually want to
shell out to buy this thing this starts
at $200 there's a bigger version for 250
will we'll see but there are a lot of
bets on whether people are actually
going to purchase this funny timing of
this announcement considering at the end
of the year there was a little bit of
problems with Google's relationship with
Amazon yes there was a bit of a dust-up
with Amazon the timing of this is
definitely a little difficult or a
little awkward with Google and Amazon's
relationship anymore on Amazon's
products yeah yeah well removed YouTube
from the echo show which is a lot like
this product it's a computing device and
also from fire TV displays or from fire
TV streamers Amazon decided to bring
back Google chromecast streamers to
amazon.com that was a central problem
that Google had and that's why they
wanted to pull YouTube in the first
place and now there are negotiations so
I think you is gonna come back but now
if you want YouTube on a device like
this you might have to buy this for now
and right now right now outside of the
the convention center in the parking lot
both Google and Amazon have a little
display
Google was I think the first one we're
outside right now actually there's the
the Google booth hey Google they believe
the treasure chuck is right around there
amazon treasure truck is right around
there but yeah that's a pretty big deal
that like Google not only decided to
like show up but show up pretty big yeah
and I mean I don't know if it was there
but I remember either one of them having
this big of a present this no I think a
lot of what they're trying to do is
really show that like hey we're at CES
because we want to be good partners it's
like you know
maybe it might have been like we're the
cool kids we don't want to show up to
CES like we can do our own events but
there are all these other major players
here and to create these ecosystems
Google and Amazon I think need to show
up and keep showing up to say hey we're
here to be your partner
right because you hear them all the time
at these shows but it's about the
physical showing up is what you mean
like like last year
Amazon elects oh we've saw it a lot now
okay still a big part of the show I mean
so many products on day one we're about
does it have the Google assistant or
does it have Amazon Alexa I know what
struck me is interesting was hearing how
much of Amazon Alexa was in the bathroom
for the Kohler
have you have you heard about this
toilet know what tell me that was your
smart toilet I knew it I knew this bug
on there what there so we have a video
of some of the smart things oh my gosh
they're putting a lexan tile 'it's so
you can have it flush hands-free and
also you know have it warm you dry you
off give you a little spritz all right
Amazon in the faucet when you want to be
a faucet you could change the
temperature too it's in the shower so
okay I kind of like the toilet though
that thing looks pretty awesome you want
to warm it for you you can do that yes
does it warm my butt I mean not everyone
likes a warm toilet come on I don't know
I it's one of those moments where I'm
like have we reached have you reached
that moment where the amazons ever but
yeah it's about we had the assistant and
I think some of those products also were
able to work with Google's assistant so
it's gonna be a bit of a battleground
there - I don't know is it really that
hard to flush a toilet I understand the
interest if your hands are on your phone
right maybe yeah you could just push the
button your phone you get to go right I
wanted to talk about also some of the
favorite things we've stuff because I'm
a couple press days we've had wheezes a
lot of quirky stuff out there there's a
lot of weird stuff favourite things from
each of us I'll start off add unveiled
one of my favorite things that totally
terrified me
was a smart luggage that was able to
follow me around wherever I went it had
facial recognition technology in the
suitcase
yes here it is oh so this is the CX won
by a company called Ford X this is a
prototype but it worked I was surprised
how fast that got it set up it was able
to map my body and then as I was in the
back area just kind of walking around
it's like seven miles an hour's chasing
me a bit I'm trying to run away a bit it
doesn't recognize you doesn't have to
recognize your face but I recognizes
your body well here it's able to kind of
like pinpoint me and they're not really
talking a lot at this stage about how it
can make sure another blonde you know
five foot five girl doesn't walk away
with it but it kind of locks onto me and
if I like zip out that wristband is
supposed to also help if I slip out of
you know range of the you know it's
gonna video getaway or another or
someone picks it up from behind
I guess my wristband will also give me
an alarm but yeah cameras and all the
things facial recognition it's serious I
find that facial recognition thing isn't
going more and more things I saw this
really awesome concept car the Bosch
booth I mean this is this was their
vision of what the car will look like in
four or five years but take a look at it
it is it's got crazy lights that
actually will change colors depending on
if it's self-driving versus manual
driving but the coolest feature which I
didn't actually to try yet is some
called air haptics it's the idea that of
haptic feedback but with your fingers a
couple inches off the screen
so you don't actually even have to touch
the screen you're just in the air you're
feeling like you're touching buttons
it's like when it is like Minority
Report air keyboard exactly the idea
being that you you don't necessarily
need to take your eyes off the road and
look at the dashboard you could sort of
feel for it and different tactile
responses for radio if it fires it fires
off ultra ultra sound signals basically
mimicking or creating the illusion that
you're pushing something it's crazy and
I don't know if it's entirely safe but
it's crazy
that all right without you event there's
this thing called hip air I knew it so
basically it's like these air cushions
for your hips and it looks really goofy
it looks really weird but the thing is
is that's a good that's a good look yeah
but like here's the thing every now and
then there is a piece of technology that
actually comes along that might actually
be able to help people out and isn't
just like a must-have or isn't just a
nice about this is this to me it could
actually be somewhat beneficial if it
actually helps out one person then fully
fully on the company way to go
so does it activate as you fall or on
the leaps out yeah it works like an
airbag all right so it's it's but maybe
they're bad wife maybe they have to work
on the design or at least make it a
little less green like you know it does
it really have to be so obvious looking
I think that's the reason right like you
see someone with like a fluorescent
green Patti you're clearly in trouble
right something went wrong in their life
that this green balloon is activated
yeah my favorite is the headline that we
could you know help I fall in I know you
can't get up yeah class right well we're
gonna wrap it right now you can find the
359 on iTunes SoundCloud Google Play and
