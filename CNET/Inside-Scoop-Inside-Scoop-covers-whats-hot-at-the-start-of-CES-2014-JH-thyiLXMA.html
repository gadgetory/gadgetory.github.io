stage CES 2014 we're live here at the
stage at the Las Vegas Convention Center
I'm Donald Bell she's Bridget Carey and
we're going to get to the news lots of
it plenty of it we're gonna be talking
yesterday was pressed day which we'll
see maybe had more announcements than
I've ever seen yes so far so we have a
lot to talk about already especially if
you didn't join us yesterday so we're
gonna recap some of that stuff I think
most of the stuff we saw yesterday from
press day was television related i'd say
at least a lot of the big announcements
tvs are always big at the show tvs are
big of the show last year was the kind
of the big debut of 4k this year they
they mean it every every TV we're seeing
this year is 4k more 4k better 4k may be
cheaper for K although prices really
haven't been attached to any of these
TVs yet but we we heard from Samsung we
heard from LG or from Panasonic we saw
TVs from all of them the most notable
all seem to be these curved televisions
without the transcript I'm gonna get to
that one I think I even before that
there is a Dueling 105 inch already
curve permanently curved displays from
Samsung and LG that were nearly
identical they might differ on price
once we learn what the price will be if
anyone needs a hundred and five inch TV
curved or not delivered to their home
probably a wall will have to get knocked
down in order for that to happen but the
the other thing we saw was samsung had
for the people who couldn't quite were
on the fence maybe about what kind of
television they want to be curved or no
my flat you want curved they had a
transforming it was like an 85-inch a
more reasonably sized TV I suppose ya
still too big for me but a bendable TV a
transfer button and it goes from flat to
a little curve you know
fun gimmick are we are we that desperate
to find something new to sell us on now
for tv's if you can't make up your mind
it is interesting because maybe you
don't want to go all the way with a curb
TV if you're not sure if you're going to
like it or not so they had that middle
ground that maybe if you have a you know
curve is supposed to be immersive if you
have a big audience you can flatten it
out every time I talk to someone about
the curved TVs here the follow-up
question is so why does it matter and
I'm it doesn't it really doesn't it's
like it's like the bell bottoms of TV's
now it's like it's really it's gonna be
a fad right I think from like a cinema
file perspective if you're really
getting that like that really thin like
21 is it figure the aspect ratio but
like the cinema aspect ratio and you're
getting the curve you might have a more
movie like experience yeah but otherwise
I don't know it's just kind of a trend
all right so you probably already heard
about all the television stuff but what
we haven't talked about a lot yet are
the phones of CES and there's a reason
for that there usually isn't a lot of
interesting phone announcements at CES
butlers either come from one-off
announcements from like a samsung or
their come from Mobile World Congress
which happens pretty soon after this but
we do see phones here we do get some
interesting phone news I think one of
the most interesting bits of information
we got is that AT&amp;amp;T has just announced
they're sponsored data program for
companies this is a get free data the
deal is here is that ATT is opening up
the possibility for say like a yahoo or
cnet to absorb the cost of delivering
data to a customer so like if I a cell
phone customer maybe has a very limited
tier data plan on their phone they don't
want to waste any of it going to you
know a Google or Yahoo or whatever that
that company Google or Yahoo can absorb
the cost of providing that data to the
customer so that they can go there
without incurring any data use
interesting way 482
make a little more exactly so they get a
check from that company sponsoring it's
like a 1-800 number for websites
delivered to mobile devices yeah so also
it'll be interesting to see who takes
him up on that it starts and starts
testing that out you know right like
browsing on the web I think the there
ATT is claiming this is a way for them
to ease congestion of their network but
then the BS call on that people have
already made is that it still is the
same data it's just that they're getting
paid from a different source yeah I mean
data's where they make their money yeah
so interesting well it'll be we'll see
if that becomes a trend whether or not
companies bite on absorbing the cost or
not for sponsoring data to customers it
seems like an awful idea to me but I'm
not a corporate fat cat so I don't know
there was some other what mobile news of
a different flavor that I came up last
night under we caught this about
t-mobile were their CEO John Ledger
tried to crash the AT&amp;amp;T party last night
I mean it was like a Macklemore
performance is macklemore ryan lewis and
he ended up getting tickets apparently
from macklemore's agents so after
getting kicked out no actually well I'm
not sure all the details but but i know
that when he got there he ran into our
CNN executive editor roger cheng who
quickly tweeted a picture of john ledger
crashing the party and not 15 minutes
after that tweet went up ATT security
came by and escorted him and his team
away and he's he's there wearing his big
old pink you know t-mobile shirt all
proud you know being Batman like it
usually it wasn't too incognito yeah so
um yeah then he got back in I think
macklemore ryan lewis's publicist god
man yeah well it's still one of those
things where it's like it's that cool or
not I don't know but it is show that
t-mobile has likes to likes to you know
shake it up shake it up and they're also
having their own announcement on
Wednesday so I have to keep tuned to
that one of their uncarrier
announcements to see how they're going
to shake things up again with how they
charge customers all right one of the
cooler actual pieces of hardware I've
seen from CES Jessica dual-core has a
piece on a blackberry styled
physical keyboard case for the iphone
this is really interesting because it
provides for all those blackberry people
who can't give up their keyboard this is
the this is the answer supposedly
Jessica dual core is actually pretty
excited about it it's got a lot of buzz
even before CES everyone's been waiting
to see what it's like in person and it's
it's supposedly just exactly styled
after the blackberry physical keyboard
so it gives you that tactile interface
for your keyboard it's so exact that
blackberry is actually yeah they're
they're gonna have to deal with that
lawsuit now for the fact that the
keyboard is too much alike yeah there
was a lot of a hype about that because
everyone's like Oh finally a good
keyboard for an iphone yeah yeah maybe
maybe that'll take off or not lot to see
i also like this this is a phone from
cat like the the manufacturer of like
construction trucks and equipment a
super ruggedized phone that can just
take a beating we've seen these kind of
year after year this is like the updated
version of it the specs are nothing that
you would go out and buy for necessarily
but if you want to look like a real be a
Karen a phone around this is like the
ultra testosterone phone of the year
yeah you could probably you know run it
over with construction equipment all
right two more stories here another big
trend here at CES 2014 are the wearables
yes the pebble steel watch did you get a
chance to see this yet oh this thing
looks so slick this is the pebble 2
point 0 pebble was big last year at the
show and now it's comes in metal yeah
well so it looks like it's slim down it
kind of looks like a big like a like a
toy it look like a toy that was strapped
to your wrist this one goes incognito
and I don't think it's going to trip off
the nerd alert when you wear it around
we'll see it's got a lot of apps now
they didn't have an app store before now
there's apps already from foursquare in
yelp and ESPN and it works with Mercedes
cars so they're really kind of showing
how your SmartWatch can actually make
sense to you for glancing at information
very clear right and then for the more
fitness friendly or at least fitness
focused wearable tech there's the razor
Naboo when I did not expect to see
because razor is like more of a gaming
peripheral company but they've got the
Naboo
hark tractor with two screens yeah
that's the big innovation here one that
just kind of tips you off that
something's happened the smaller screen
and anyone you want to get more
information you flip it around you can
actually read a text message or a tweet
or whatever I kind of like the best of
both worlds fitness and also your
texting I can show Twitter messages on
it too yeah you know of course I thought
its finds the name they picked Naboo
nope he's not like the Star Wars Naboo
nab you all right so that was all the
news from before CES has even kicked off
because we are here right now on the
first day there's going to be even more
stuff to talk about stick with us here
at seen it all day that's it for the
inside scoop tomorrow morning we're
going to be back with the latest news
every morning here at CES and stay tuned
for seeing it live from CS there's a
whole lot more coming today including a
torture test the 404 team is here and we
have that pebble steel SmartWatch is
going to be on the show at 3pm if we
have the next big thing super session
followed by my own attack of the drone
show we're no drones will actually be
attacking people but you still come and
see it you can't miss that so stay tuned
