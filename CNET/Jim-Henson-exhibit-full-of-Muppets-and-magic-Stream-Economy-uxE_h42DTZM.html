to start the music it's time to light
the lights if you're a living breathing
human being you have heard of the
Muppets and their creator Jim Henson and
we're here in Los Angeles California at
the Skirball Center checking out an
amazing exhibition called the Jim Henson
exhibition imagination unlimited let's
go so we're inside and the first person
to welcome you to this exhibition is of
course the one and only is Kermit
it's the best way to be welcomed and
even though there's not a puppeteer he
feels alive mind blown
early role like that's so cool and
there's some clicks with actual role in
the Jimmy Dean show you know Jim Henson
wanted to start a nightclub this is one
of the concepts where you have this sort
of crazy multimedia experience when you
went out at night maybe that's a club I
would go to
oh my god this is like amazing it's Bert
and Ernie and he even has his rubber
duckie rubber duckie yours on one I
totally remember it I can sing the whole
thing right now just like Miss Piggy
too-cool-for-school couldn't make it but
she sent her gloves in her place if you
have really good vision that can
separate all sorts of things at once
definitely check this out which is every
weapon show playing simultaneously which
is a lot a lot fortunately there's not
sound coming from each individual
episode it's just a nice soundtrack for
the Muppet Show we've passed the Muppets
and now we're into immersive worlds
which includes of course Keira and Jen
Wow all I can say I'm so impressed by
the detail that you can see in every
single puppet everything that you're
looking at there's so much happening and
is definitely one of the reasons these
puppets come to life on screen the
amount of work and care and love that
goes into the costumes for the puppet
hair and the way their expressions are
is really impressive do you know how
many labyrinth fans would kill to stand
here in the presence of these costumes I
feel so honored we look at Jim Henson as
a social change agent his ambassadors
for change just happened to be made out
of health he used his platform as a way
to advocate for social change so he
wasn't just teaching educational
curriculum he was also trying to teach
children and communities lessons about
diversity and about empathy and activity
if I could describe this exhibit in one
word I I would I would choose joyful
I know Ashley said I couldn't be here
but it's me me piggy and thank you so
much for coming to the Jim Henson
exhibition imagination unlimited it will
be ending on September 2 so here's your
gum</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
