is Microsoft's new surface go at least I
hope it's the surface go I have not
actually even opened the outer FedEx
package yet
but it arrived on the right day and it's
from the right company so I'm assuming
that's what this is we're gonna go for
it and find out always very satisfying
to pull that little fedex strip let's
see what's inside oh we got a mouse okay
I don't mind a mouse you don't have to
buy this separately if you actually buy
the surface
go a little card there keyboard this is
always controversial Microsoft Surface
keyboard cover controversial because you
have to buy it separately usually and
here it is I was correct we have lucked
out this is the Microsoft Surface go
it's a smaller less expensive version of
the surface tablet the surface pro is
the most popular version wrapped up in
plastic I am gonna pull out my handy box
cutter and see if we can get into here
without doing too much damage probably
all I need now we're gonna pop open the
box and let's see what is inside
now of course one of the issues with the
entire surface line is you get some
stuff in the box other stuff you have to
buy separately so this is the smaller
10-inch tablet itself and it's got a
very similar kickstand to what you get
in other surface products also in the
Box is power adapter always need that
you can also I believe use USB C to
power this but you can use their
magnetic custom power connection as well
in here a little paperwork very Apple
life the way they pack that in there and
that's it for the box because if you
actually want to make full use of your
surface you need the type cover which
comes in a separate box we can open that
up also and these have cost cost and
extra I think 99 to 129 depending on
which model you get this is a fancy one
with the Alcantara fabric on it there it
is and it's got that fuzzy back and kind
of fuzzy fabric you front and you just
clip that on magnetically look at that
and now you have something that looks
and feels very much like a laptop and
you go further and add the new mobile
Mouse which is a small mouse that will
work well with this small tablet I'm
gonna pop that open right here
actually I saw this before it's actually
a very nice-looking miniature Mouse and
it all matches up color coordination I
always like that we're gonna turn this
guy on and start testing it for our
review but in the meantime that is what
you get in the box and what you have to
buy separately in their own boxes or the
new Microsoft Surface go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
