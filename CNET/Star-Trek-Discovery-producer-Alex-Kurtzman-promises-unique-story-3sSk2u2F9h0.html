is really interesting and special and I
think pays tribute to a lot of what Trek
has done and in many ways is actually
doing it in a new way to have Sydney
quoi and Michelle as captains of our
ship is really really exciting and
different and I love stories that are
based around strong women and we have
some very strong women on that show
having you know Sydney quest she's a
very special very very special actress
and is bringing a like a flavor to the
character that I feel like I haven't
actually seen in Trek and that's really
really exciting
her story is very unique and draws on
some really interesting things in Trek
lore I think fans will both appreciate
and I am certain will be a cause of much
debate you know if you're a fan of Trek
you're gonna see a lot of things that
that harkens back to the original series
and elements of the original series I
don't I'm not just talking plot I mean
the spirit of what that show was we're
gonna be revisiting a couple things on
Discovery that I think people will find
familiar and without spoiling anything I
think you know we are adhering to a
timeline and sticking to the rules but
also um I think finding some new areas
and avenues of exploration that have
been only alluded to but never fully
explored
you've got a room full of people with
very different and very devoted
relationships to Star Trek in that
writers room so it's being you know and
I think that carries on a pretty proud
tradition of Trek being written by fans
you have to respect Canada as it's been
written you know you can't say that
never happened no no that doesn't you
can't do that they'll kill you Star Trek
fans will kill you
no you have to respect you and you have
to you have to understand the timelines
and what the different timelines were
and what the different universes were
and how they all work together and you
have to keep very meticulous track of
who when where and why and we have
people in the room whose soul and the
writers are whose sole job is to say
nope can't do that it doesn't try it but
to work you done out there on YouTube
Federation space I'm trying to save you
I'm trying to save all of you
I think that at the core of
Roddenberry's vision and this is why I
believe it has endured for as long as it
has is the belief that human beings will
always find a way to persevere and
connect to each other and that there is
an optimistic outlook to where we could
be going and now more than ever we need
that desperately so he gives you hope
Star Trek gives you hope</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
