show you the front the projector and
here's the the rear
now let me talk through some of these
features i'm going to start first with
the projection we made a lot of
improvements this device again listen to
our customers we doubled the lumens
that's the brightness we added HD and
now we have a beautiful up to 120 inch
HD projection at 200 lumens that's not
all and we asked our customers what do
you want out of the projection they said
auto focus no problem we gave it to them
we added auto focus we added auto key
stoning they're not familiar with auto
key stoning stability no matter the
angle that is projecting to be able to
have that rectangular view auto key
stoning was added brand new we also
anted anti-glare this version has an
accelerometer and there's a lot of cool
things that you can do with an
accelerometer I think you'll get an
example of some of the use cases in the
next room of all the things that s pro
can do but one of those things is it can
detect motion so we can automatically
detect when I'm moving it around so I'm
as I'm panning it will dim the projector
and will not glare in somebody's eyes
anti glare is brand-new we added that as
well and those are just some of the
features that we've added to the
projection capabilities of this advice
so now I want to move on to the UI user
interface has been upgraded to a 5 inch
android touchscreen display we learned a
lot and we learned is it has to be
user-friendly it has to be intuitive a
user has to be able to get to the
projection capabilities that they want
the network settings all the things that
they expect out of rejecter upgraded ZTE
redesigned to skin on top of Android
brand new with s pro 2
now android has the capability of taking
Google Play applications web
conferencing software file sharing
applications so you can take content
literally from anywhere around the world
that's the beauty of a smart projector
this device also has the ability to take
advantage of local capabilities an hdmi
port to connect to your computer it also
has Wi-Fi projection capabilities your
smartphone your tablet your computer can
all be protected wirelessly through this
device now I've talked about a lot of
features but of course the most
important to customers as they're
projecting mobile is usage how long will
it last we made a lot of improvements
the battery we effectively have doubled
the battery and it now has a 6300
milliamp hour battery through a
combination of a battery capacity
increase as well as optimization a lot
of work engineering work to optimize the
battery we now have up to three hours
worth of streaming and projection from
the s pro 2 and last but not least want
to talk about a great feature for the
business professional because well as
you're walking into a meeting you place
this advice on a meeting room table and
you no longer have to worry about
plugging in computer the other thing
that often happens in a meeting is
dialing out to somebody audio
conferencing and video conferencing now
all in one one device to handle all the
needs of that mobile business
professional great features and again
it's through the power of android that
we have the ability to take advantage of
skype or WebEx or goto meeting or
anything that you want for your
communication needs that's pro 2 this is
a great device and I know what you're
all thinking how can you get your hands
on one

product but any time I get a chance to
learn more about technology it's a great

these products you see today especially
