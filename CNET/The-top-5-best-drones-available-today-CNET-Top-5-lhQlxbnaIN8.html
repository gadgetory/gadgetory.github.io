are the top five drones is selected by
CNET senior editor joshua sunshine
goldman at number five the 3d robotics
solo for now this is the gopro drone you
can attach a GoPro camera to the solo
and tap right into GoPro video on your
phone plus the 3d robotic solo has a lot
of programs cinematic lose built right
in with the push of a button or a swipe
you get really fancy shots without doing
much work at number four the parrot
bebop drone - the video quality on the
bebop drone - is not the best but a
software update the image processing
should make it better what sets the
bebop drone 2 apart is its body the
thing is made out of foam and fiberglass
it's really hard to break on top of that
the propeller stopped when they come in
contact with anything that means it
won't hurt anyone or anything it hits at
number three the gji phantom 3 standard
when I asked sunshine why this drone
should be in the top 5
he explained it's too good a price to
not be on this list the DJI phantom 3
shoots great stable video even in high
winds thanks to skimble it's the best
beginner quadcopter you're going to find
from unboxing to play at number 2 the
unique Typhoon H why is a typhoon H
awesome obstacle avoidance the typhoon H
uses sonar sensors to keep it from
running into large objects and also has
a sensor that helps the typhoon H fly
indoors without using GPS this drone
also features carbon-fiber retractable
landing gear which gets out of the way
so you can shoot video in any direction
when it's flying at number one of the
DJI phantom 4 nope it's not cheap but
the DJI phantom 4 is the best drone you
can get right now so why did it beat out
the typhoon 8 as number one it's smaller
than the H and features similar
anti-collision tech the phantom 4 is
faster and has better image quality
overall the phantom 4 is just better for
anyone from beginners to professionals
those are the top 5 best drones right
now but things could change
GoPro announced a drone called the Karma
once it comes out we'll review it right
here at sea
and see if it belongs on this list I'm
Maya's actor and I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
