well maybe you should try folding it up
into a backpack this is the air wheel
III and it's a foldable ebike well maybe
it's not a bike because it doesn't
really have any pedals it's more like a
scooter because you just put your feet
on the rests and ride away so you can
fold it up into a backpack neatly with
all the components holding into
themselves and then you can put it on
this included bag the whole weight all
up is around 27 and a half pounds or
12.5 kilos it can take up to a 100 kilo
or 220 pounds of weight on it and you
can go around 12 miles an hour or that
is 20 kilometres an hour it has a bell
it has a light it also has a USB port so
you can recharge your phone while you're
riding and it gives you around one hour
of ride time to charge it up it takes
around two and a half to three and a
half hours sitting on a charger I wrote
it around the holes here at CES it's
indoor use pretty much only rather than
designed for outdoor use it's got a lot
of good pickup it's fun to ride it's
nice and small and compact I carried it
around on my back it is heavy but it's
not really designed as your everyday
commuter it's more designed for things
like warehouse runs indoor runs for
security guides and maybe shopping
centers it is seven hundred dollars and
the airwheel III is available now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
