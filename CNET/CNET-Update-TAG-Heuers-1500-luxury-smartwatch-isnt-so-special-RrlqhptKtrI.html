high-fashion makeover I'm Bridget Carey
this is your CNET update luxury
watchmaker Tag Heuer just released the
first luxury android-powered SmartWatch
it's the Tag Heuer connected and as you
might expect it comes out of luxurious
price fifteen hundred dollars tag worked
with intel on the processor inside so
it's not a purely Swiss made watch of
course but with the price you're getting
a watch that does pretty much what other
Android watches can do there's four gigs
of storage and accelerometer to track
steps Wi-Fi to keep you connected when
the phone is far it's made of titanium
sort of feels premium there's a scratch
resistant sapphire crystal touch screen
which the cheaper Huawei watch also has
the battery life will get you about a
day of use and well really you're paying
for the name it doesn't have a GPS
there's no NFC for mobile payments but
there is one unique perk if you can call
it that after the two-year warranty is
up you can pay another $1500 to trading
your watch for a normal mechanical watch
at least that one should last you longer
it's available now online in the US and
in Japan next week other countries in
Europe and Asia are gonna be able to buy
it by the end of the month if you're
looking for android smart watches made
by watch brands later this year fossil
is gonna release the fossil cute founder
which also runs Android wear and it's
powered by an Intel processor
it'll cost two hundred and seventy five
dollars and in other news about
expensive gadgets Apple's iPad pro is
gonna go on sale Wednesday and hit
stores later this week Apple first
showed off the new large tablet in
September it's nearly 13 inch screen
will support Apple's pencil
pressure-sensitive stylus and Apple also
made a detachable smart keyboard for it
both are sold separately the iPad pro
starts at eight hundred dollars but if
you also buy the pencil on the keyboard
you can add another two hundred and
seventy dollars to the price tag you
know 2015 is turning out to be a strange
year for consumer gadgets we have super
expensive smartwatches and Apple's
making tablets with styluses
and Blackberry is now making android
phones if you haven't already heard the
brand new blackberry Prince Mart phone
is actually an Android phone with a
physical keyboard you just slide up the
5.5 inch screen to reveal four rows of
backlit keys the print packs and more
privacy and security features that other
Android phones it's $700 when you buy it
unlocked but ATT is now selling it for
$250 on the contract and for Reisen says
it'll also carry the phone soon that's
it for this tech news update and there's
more at cnet.com from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
