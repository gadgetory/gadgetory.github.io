robots helping fulfill your orders this
holiday season a mega mobile gaming
truck is up for sale on eBay and I want

are making some really awesome 8-bit
light art Oh what's your dad yeah it's
gonna be awesome tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internets
welcome to tomorrow daily the best Keith
talk shows own universe I'm your host
Ashley sceva joining me as always
punching the sky on a Monday kill
anonymous hey how's it going it's great
yeah to some really long weekends super
long weekend yeah I didn't go to do
something but you did I'm producer Logan
did yeah thanks a lot i got my evil
selfie shirt on thanks for inviting me
sorry it's just you know it's really
hard to take you places it's true the
line it's just putting him in the
stroller as a nightmare it's like
horrible I'm a kid it's the worst uh so
it's December first and I'm pretty
excited because that means the holidays
is here which goes right into our first
story so let's hit that one so we all
know that amazon delivers stuff in a
their chain of like delivery is crazy
good we all know this yeah today i was
going to order something and it's like
if you order within the next hour you
get it today yeah i don't say like you
get a 9pm which is madness well amazon
just unveiled their next-gen eighth
generation fulfillment centers these are
their warehouses so therefore film and
centers are the place where all your
stuff comes from so when you are things
on Amazon these so these are the robots
here they are their little robots and
they're helping out they're adorable
they're super super adorable um they
look almost like a Roomba except I
remember that brings you stuff this is a
company called kiva systems that amazon
actually acquired a couple of years ago
they acquired them in 2012's a robotics
company they can move really tall stacks
of people's stuff around the warehouse
we're just kind of awesome it's what
you're seeing right now there you see
this one's gonna move out it's got a
whole rack full of product there's like
a pan or something in there some kitchen
product um so there are 10 of these
centers around the u.s. right now
there's major cities I'm assuming uh
well not necessarily actually a lot of
times these fulfillment centers are in
suburbs of major cities Oh affordable
space perch it will space I mean it's
like they gotta have these huge you know
hundred thousand foot warehouse I mean I
heard a thousand square foot warehouse
is crazy so they but they're here and
they're eight jet these are their eighth
generation fulfillment center they also
have this other thing called
which I really like it's this arm called
the Robo stow what we're watching the
robots kind of run around that the the
robusto arm is this gigantic yellow arm
that is like in the middle of the
warehouse and it pulls out large like
taped up you know they put like a
plastic sort of wrap around multiple box
oh there it is there it is yeah here you
go so it can pull out like giant chunk
of people's products and bring them down
one of those in there is there multiple
ones of those in there look at this
place yeah see these are the kinds of
facilities this is the type of space
that they need an Amazon to make sure
all your stuff gets it's really amazing
kind of see the insides of these places
and realize like my s microSD card came
from there and like nobody lost it it
came on time it's like really I'm always
appreciative after seeing exactly how
they go through and process all of these
things you really don't think often a
lot about how awesome the process and
hire stuff gets to you so is she with
the speed that they do it the robots
yeah that's that's this is basically I
sent this to inefficient its food for
thought when you're buying stuff on
Cyber Monday yeah and especially just
even for the holidays like you everybody
buys stuff and you know you do see a lot
of people get obviously very upset when
their packages don't come on time
because these are gifts for the friends
and family and loved ones but you also
to remember like this is a huge process
for a lot of these companies to transmit
and even just get everything how do
things just not end up in the wrong
boxes all the time how do they not get
right people I mean it's really amazing
and a testament to how great shipping
has kind of become even though obviously
we've all had issues with my terrible
shipping across all carriers like
there's nobody in particular but I
always have bad experiences but it's
really amazing that it doesn't happen
more often if you watch something like
that it's just how do they not just lose
my little frustration-free packaged
micronus you don't get it on time ya
know it so it's always comes next day
and now they want to do drones so let
yeah who knows how drones might work
with that but I guess 15,000 these
robots are at Amazon center piece of
thousand eight each one or I no no I
think it's spread out all over so it's
probably about 1,500 be very curious to
find out the robot to human ratio in
each of those well there's a lot of
people that get hired for the holidays I
think I saw an article saying that they
were
higher you know thousands of new people
to help fulfill at amazon a thousands of
new people to help orders and then a lot
of those people actually end up getting
hired full time so that's cool it's
temporary and a lot of people end up to
now rolling out a new a full-time job
right what some time Jeff medical dental
all right so this story you said I can't
have it but i think i might you can't
but we'll work something out this is a
little tiny story to kind of like just
you know if you're a huge gamer and you
like being on the move this is called
Charlie pass now basically Charlie
passes is this dealer a seller seller a
dealer Giada seller who is selling a
giant gaming trailer that has 25
consoles in it and it's a mobile gaming
trailer and yes they can play the video
games cuz they each other Alana day they
have their own monitor so here's the
breakdown 24 people can fit in it it has
25 xbox 360 consoles sorry not next-gen
20 I it has 24 I'm sorry has 25 24 inch
1080p monitor okay so we could game in
high def yeah you can game it high def
with and then they it has turtle beach
headsets and tritton headset so
legitimate headsets good yeah good
headsets not just chintzy stuff you can
get a best buy for networks so and all
of this is available for forty nine
thousand dollar forty nine thousand
forty nine thousand dollars sorry I
wasn't make sure you heard that it comes
from a struct I'll write it comes with
the truck AKA 2006 ford f250 4 door
turbo diesel truck okay so come to a
track they said it's worth the trucks
were the 18 thousand dollars okay so
that's you know you're adding value
there well ok so that's the starting bid
but what if i wanted to just say you
know what I'm gonna buy it right now
obviously kale and I clearly rich
billionaires yeah I secret rich
billionaires of course not so secret
anymore but ok I'm ready I just want to
buy it now I would click on the button
how much well that's why I got only got
forty nine thousand i have the price
what if there's a buy it now what is the
buy it now seventy nine thousand dollars
wait with oh the beginning bid was yet
opening benes 4879 thousand dollars
right out the gate they may have 80,000
they just loan us because we're not only
cuz we're doing great
uh something else to think about is that
there's 1,000 games in the light the
xbox 360 library that they're offering
that's pretty funny games okay so let's
say I buy this okay let's say I pay
eighty thousand say I just can't wait I
got to just buy this truck and trailer
so pay 80 grand then I got to upgrade to
xbox one I'll games for that we're
saying it's gonna cost 10k to upgrade it
to the xbox see that's too that's that's
it's an extra value that it's an extra
cost that I don't know that I could take
but I was a billionaire Charlotte pet
Charlie passes trying to tell you you
should rent it out for birthday parties
and smart and participants experts are
gonna say Charlie pass don't tell me
what to do all right I want to go across
the country and play like Forza on the
way yeah love you man sec 03 amazing um
that actually brings us to our hashtag a
day oh alright which I really I like
this one I think you guys are gonna come
up with some really great wacky ideas TD
trailer is the hashtag of the day we
want to know if you could have a trailer
filled with one thing only to entertain
you for the rest of your life what would
it be to entertain you for the rest of
your life okay what do you got um for me
I think it would be I think it would be
I will be a console but I don't know if
I could pick um maybe like a playstation
2 cuz you have to do right now you can't
do them like the potential so so ps4 we
may be like 10 games that are to be
really really good that's probably a
game no just entertain you ok you can
have a chat I was gonna trailer full I
was gonna say you could have a trailer
full kittens yeah gif kitties of ya of
uh Lisa can I have a pool in there i
would that would be only thing but
filled with like different like a
different substance so like maybe Joe
then you just want to suck the trailer
below the yellow yeah tell him with
jello and then walk into it that's the
only entertainment kills gonna half the
rest is like walking around I don't want
to pay for a trailer full of gross jello
and he's only gonna get more disgusting
over time yeah let us know what I saw
your trailer with and have a good time
with and yeah yeah and how much you pay
for it I keep it clean folks keep it
clean I shouldn't have to tell you but I
just you know some of you out there
might have some more adult proclivities
but
we won't read them out a lot on the show
we might enjoy them we might laugh we
will probably laugh we'll definitely
laughs I'm gonna think about that for a
while while you do the next one okay let
me tell you about these barcode
paintings these are pretty cool these
are little robots that can make these
awesome 8-bit paintings out of long
exposure photography so okay light
paintings which is really neat so here
they are these are the little robots
they are called phi mios and this is
from Switzerland this is a company
called thymio thymio robots and so
here's the design so you can see they
showed them really quickly and then
they're going to do this long exposure
photography these robots are running on
this these strips of paper ok so these
strips of paper have black and white
gradients on it and the gradient lets
the robot correct course quicker and
continuously like so very very quickly
will it do that and and as opposed to
getting way off track and then having to
come back to a solid black line so there
there's another light sensor underneath
it that reads a barcode next to the
gradient line that tells the robot what
color it should be and when to turn off
and stuff yeah and so the robot moves
along the line and changes color based
on commands and so here you can see some
of the this is lights right this is long
exposure so you can see is Allah it's
this light light art so is it mario
created by a robot it's a me mario haha
so that definitely paintings made and
it's really really cool because all of
the software and templates for these
tracks and these you know these designs
are all available for download for free
so Tommy is like um apparently and I
didn't know this this these little
robots are actually really popular in
Switzerland I was about to ask yeah so
how do you get one of these robots and
like there are a hundred and twenty-five
bucks for a robot and they apparently
have a very deep continually developing
community like so there oh wait people
are always developing for these robots
like they're relatively inexpensive in
terms of like programming your own robot
and apparently very popular with Lacob
kids so like these are good like starter
robots to have kids like program little
like programs and stuff for these robots
that's fantastic it's really neat I
don't know what everyone else at anybody
else is done but well the price of them
is really interesting because they're
designed by EPFL in switzerland and so
they don't actually make money like they
don't make a lot of money off of them
it really the point is is to get them
out there to help educate like which is
really neat I'm very noble cause but I
mean it's got to pay for you know
obviously like the robots production and
everything so there is a price tag
attached to it but it's really neat that
they're they're not you know this major
corporation that's like squeezing every
day more profit out of these robots
jeebus but now they just want people to
learn and then in the process maybe you
know make enough money to make another
you know level robot or whatever in the
future so it's pretty neat well that's
cool yeah I'm gonna have to check out
what really it's called them and like I
said it's called fine me o th why am i
oh so if you want to check that out if
anybody has one let us know and yeah but
you had one that sent us a video because
their stuff stuff yeah you do but for
right now we're gonna take a quick 30
second break we'll be right back with a
back at her hackett that feels like it
was literally tailor-made for kale ooh
um and then we also of course have your
user feedback from not only one but two
shows last week and and of course our
phone target for the day so don't click
away tomorrow daily
welcome back welcome back to the show
kale I you seem really excited yeah
because you know me well enough to know
what I like and I get excited I'm
excited so to hear that there is a
Kickstarter tailor-made for you has to
be really exciting oh of course so let's
just jump right into backorder hackett
guys there is a pizza bed Oh Dennis
exists so the pizzas so long world that
girl just like I'm all right so what is
this okay so this is a Kickstarter um
it's technically it's it's the house
decoration so get this for your
bedspread but there it is this pizza bed
right there what I have to kick-start
where they just make this well I think
because you gotta you have to digitally
print the fabric which can be expensive
so one of the things that I'm always one
of the etsy sites that I really like is
actually just to go off on a slight
tangent is this really cool clothing
maker who takes NASA and like high res
NASA images because their public use
yeah and she sends them off to a fabric
printer and digitally gets Prince of
like nebulas and like all kinds of crazy
stuff that we have to take in high def
photography for in space and then makes
like infinity scarves and dresses and
things from those prints good Christmas
gift really really cool so um so this I
would imagine is in the same vein so
let's go back and let's check this out
so here is the pizza bed gone on the
website so here's the the fitted
mattress is marinara sauce no way yeah
of course it's a real pizza so it's um
it's the greatest thing ever so they
have this little diagram so they have
the marinara sauce fitted sheets oh my
gosh sheets and then of course you have
to the crust the crust is your pillows
and then the duvet cover is is pizza is
it your cheese and pepperoni topping so
you're kind of a topping a little bit
you are yeah it's a little bit of a hue
you're the human topping inside the
pizza under the cheese though so I guess
you'd be some kind of like I don't know
like an onion you know I already have
troubles getting in trouble getting out
of bed so and now it's a pita now you
okay so give me the details give me the
details of this okay so here's the price
if you want the actual it comes in a
pizza that comes in a pizza box the
original pizza bed see that's part of
the Kickstarter they gotta get it okay
so um if you want the full set the early
backer twin pizza bed so just for twin
size bed is a hundred bucks okay what's
up oh yeah if you want a full or queen
size pizza bed is 125 bucks that's early
early backer yeah if you want a king
size bed early backer as 150 those are
really good prices reasonable
considering if you go to like Bed Bath &amp;amp;
Beyond a king size bed set is like three
hundred dollars yeah again any
organizing about thread count ladies and
gentlemen um but still ya know that's
super cool I love it I mean it's
beautiful guests like if you have guests
that stay over and you planned your
pizza you're like you're getting pizza
tonight like it seems really funny
course are they um ok so what they want
is they want they want a lot of money
they want a hundred twenty-five thousand
eight hundred and forty-eight dollars
that's a very specific why not just ask
for 126 okay so how much they got right
now but they just started this so they
only have 3,300 almost 3400 so you guys
anybody interested in pizza bed now's
your chance this is not happening you
know you could do you could back this
and print out the back our thing and
give it to somebody as a gift for the
holidays that's true I could do that and
say well that's what you can do whenever
it gets delivered which is you know
supposedly I don't know next well
January 2015 so it's not not that far
off for februari the early backers it's
like deliveries in like two months I
like all of those uh this and then the
printing the you said that was like that
see the person that printed out yeah I
love all like giving somebody one of
those gifts cuz it's gonna be like
something interesting different like I'm
not gonna get are the person who has
everything yeah it's for the person that
doesn't have a pizza you have some other
options too if you'd like to help the
pizza bed come to fruition but don't
actually want it's pretty much like a
shared a pizza bed you could do this
which I really like you get pizza themed
tattoos you get little cards this is
pizza handwritten thank you note the one
thing
I really liked is the hundred dollars or
more you get the ultimate pizza bed
topping which is a handmade cross-stitch
dressed in pizza pillow God erudis rest
in pizza rest in pizza I want to put
that on your tombstone gonna make a
little note that what I'm dead note to
self when kale meets his inevitable doom
put rest in pizza on his grave it's
great on your headstone I want to make
sure it is in the shape of a slice you
should have saved this for like a pizza
episode like on my birthday or something
I'm sorry well then it would have been
over by then Kickstarter and over but
yeah pizza bed so there you go also
thank you to Alec who sent this to us he
he was the one who alerted us to the
pizza beds existence yeah we have like
one actual user submitted story like a
day so it's pretty cool people are
actually like sending in to all ideas
and stuff so Thank You Alec but now it's
time of course for your user feedback
now you are today's user feedback
everybody just wants pizza no I'm
kidding so last week we asked you guys
use two different hashtags on two
different shows TV meme to tell us what
meme you'd want to see come to real life
and TV fans tell us what show you would
want a whole website dedicated to with
lots of in-depth coverage so let's do TD
meme really quick okay we got two really
good ones Caleb sent us a tweet and said
because who doesn't want free Wi-Fi
everywhere all the time hashtag t do you
mean that's great I love that what's a
good one and then Kylie wrote jason said
i love a way to let people make the rage
comic faces for real oh yeah just like
flip it on yeah just slip on and then
all of a sudden your face turns in drew
my only Pony thing yeah it smile upon
anybody with all the trophies yeah are
you if you're listening you're missing
some you're really missing out on some
great visuals okay so TV fans we asked
you guys to tell us what TV show or
franchise would you want a whole website
dedicated to in honor of Mystery Science
Theater getting its own website and also
you know Simpsons world has launched and
that's like pretty exciting for a lot of
people I've got some for you too became
you do some YouTube and then we'll get
into tweaks uh free think Cosmo not says
TV he says adventure time that's a good
one great answer any website would be
trippin
it would be really trippy but it also
have like a lot of little nuggets of
like fun facts and like they would make
it really the scroll bar on the side
should be Jake looks like it's a lot
gated body I'd you scroll down I like
okay uh do you want me to do another one
I do Lamar okay PQ 7x + 21 an excellent
user name says Stargate I'll be pretty
cool I happy like me do you have to have
one that's deep by a Star Trek would be
another really good so many different
series David Robinson says Chuck needs
an official site I love child be good
sean MC ad says all things Hitchcock
that's a really good oh man he stuck
with my Twilight fives it was that man
even just one even just a site dedicated
like vertigo would be um no oh yeah I
would you just deep fall into the rabbit
hole last 1i got his mark Cook says the
leftovers deserves its own site that
would be another really good one go
modern choice to like good good
contemporary because there's so many
like yeah like very lost desk well thank
you youtubers um yeah live admin on
Twitter for TV fans hey-soos wrote us
and said a Highlander website with info
on all immortals movie and sure Laura
and apologies for sucking move ha ha ha
ha tag there can be only one hey just
knows what's up I like that I like that
he's like I demand also apologies Rick
wrote website for DC Comics animated
shows and insider news favorite includes
Batman the Animated Series in Justice
League yeah like that i like batman
animated sir nobody said nobody said
Star Wars it seems like a really big
University you'd want to like they're
trying to like be like lay off that cuz
I feel like it might exist but I don't
know I feel like well see i feel like
star wars could do because they do the
holocron library that's like their big
thing but they have people i'm sure who
are employed is like Laura master like
even blizzard has like creatures literal
little job is like lore master of
Warcraft like they know everything about
Warcraft I want that job it's a pretty
awesome gig so um yeah I would imagine
that would be a really good one too but
I think they have something kind of
similar but we need to just be able to
have this like fully interactive kind of
encyclopedia that you just go to one
site yeah you like instead of like
clicking to unlock the website you like
activate a lightsaber and then it opens
up I mean three up in the hills I'm like
