electronics show may still be two months
away but 15 companies here in Las Vegas
are vying for their golden ticket to not
only win $50,000 but also remote boot
space to display their new product or
new website a new software package let's
go inside and see what impresses things
that really mean something to you all in
one dedicated device videos documents
and more on this passion each company
had five minutes to present their
product he's got two eyes not just one
followed by another five minutes of Q&amp;amp;A
from the panel of judges I know I had
him here I stepped on them soul so I
understand what you're saying I'm
looking for somebody who's going to have
a kind of a you know a real world
product that that is a too fanciful that
is actually practical and that works so
i think this for them was a way to get
smaller companies who might have gotten
shuffle under the rug to get a little
bit of spotlight and you know he judged
more on merit than on marketing or on
the size of their boot there was a wide
variety of ideas and quality amongst the
presenters what tagle allows consumers
to do is go into a retail store make
offers on items that they want to buy
via their mobile phone get immediate
confirmation on that bid purchase it
that check out and walk out with it the
same day we've synergized everything
that's already off the shelf that works
use a simple browser system to take that
boring interface of a captive audience
who's on there for 30 minutes no one has
exploited that median for information
feed and just because the concept sounds
good to you but doesn't mean the judges
are going to love it the really fun
interactive part of I stage is that the
audience gets to vote to using these
little calculators you can assign one to
five stars for every company one be the
worse by being the best and the winner
of the audience choice gets a booth
space at CES maybe not the fifty
thousand dollars as well but hey this
CES that's pretty awesome in its own way
the first award I'm going to announce is
the fan favorite award promotion and
display congratulations thank you very
much and now for the judges pick
congratulations to Boxxy you can see
what your friends are watching you can
see what people recommend to you and it
takes all the media that you have
whether it's on your laptop or on your
desktop or on an as storage appliance in
your house and if it's all the artwork
it's all the lyrics the subtitles
everything about media has built with
this visual interface we have oxy why
boxy I think of all the companies
presented here today they did they have
a product that's available today for
consumers to better consume content but
tell me what you're most excited about
the booth space or the fatty check oh so
the fatty check I didn't want to talk
about this yet because they didn't want
to jinx it but we're actually taking
half of our check and giving that to the
XBMC community and the other 25k you
guys are going to aruba for a few weeks
well red or black that's the question
better fire I guess we've got a date at
the roulette wheel well there you have
it friends we have PDT as the fan
favorite and boxy as the judges favorite
cnet will be sure to check in with both
companies at CES in January but now I
got to get myself to the roulette table
$25,000 to play with I'm cars to boy in
Las Vegas cnet com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
