relatively large sensor of bright fast
lens and wrapped in a small sleek body
it seems like Sony made a lot of
intelligent decisions about design and
future trade-offs when they created the
cyber-shot DSC rx100 compared to many of
its competitors it's relatively
expensive but it really doesn't feel
overpriced for what you get my only real
problem with the cameras design is the
lack of a grip that combined with the
slippery metal body means I'm constantly
in fear of dropping it and forced to
grip it extra tightly which can get
really tiring if you shoot one-handed a
lot over and over again we've seen
companies drop the grip to make the
camera seem smaller or shiny or
something or only to add it back in a
subsequent generation it's nuts as with
other cameras that have one I like the
control ring which you can program to
operate for one default setting such as
Zoomer shutter speed and to use it in
conjunction with the function button
where you can program to access up to
seven more settings in addition to the
function button you can also reprogram
the operation at the left and right
navigation keys on the back dial as well
as the center button and there's a
memory recall option on the mode dial to
select from three custom setting slots I
found the movie button on the back a bit
hard to press the location demands it
because it's right next to the thumb
rest and you don't want to hit it
accidentally the rest of the controls
have just enough travel to keep from
being difficult to operate and one of my
favorite things you can tilt the flash
for better results while the camera has
a nicely rounded shooting feature set
I'd hardly call it expansive the camera
lacks a hotshoe viewfinder and
articulated LCD and even if you're
willing to trade those off for the more
compact size it also lags geo-tagging
and wireless connectivity it does have
features like soft skin effect in
autoportrait framing which I kind of
think are out of place in a camera for
more advanced users I'd rather have the
ability to manually invoke macro mode
which as with Sony's point-and-shoots
you can only do automatically for filter
junkies the rx100 offers a
full with a few very nice ones but you
have to scroll through every variation a
rotating cornucopia of 33 slots when
there are really only 13 filters and
that gets seriously annoying the camera
produces very nice low ISO sensitivity
shots with the lovely tonality the one
possible issue I encountered is that
bright highlights on yellows can get
completely blown out and I couldn't
recover the data from the raw files and
Sony's image data converter software
they might be there if you have better
software the autofocus works well when
shooting video and the lens is
sufficiently quiet while zooming audio
comes through loud and clear and doesn't
sound too compressed or tinny the camera
is also significantly faster than its
competition for all but continuous
shooting but frankly with viewfinder
lyst models burst shooting is mostly a
point in prey process anyway well the
rx100 is pricey and imperfect it's still
darn good it's got a compact elegant
design generally excellent photo quality
a bright fast lens and speedy
performance all of which make it a great
package if you don't mind spending a
little more money I'm Laurie grinning
and this is the sony cybershot DSC or x
100</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
