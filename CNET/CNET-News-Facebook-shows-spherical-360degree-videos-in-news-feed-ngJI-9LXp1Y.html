transition where we're starting to see
traditional video blend with even more
immersive content now when you think
about virtual reality a lot of people
first think about gaming but I actually
think that video is going to be even
more engaging in a lot of ways so these
are our spherical videos you can move
around within it and you can change your
viewing angle and that's possible
because the videos are filmed on up to
24 different cameras at once now this is
a new and much more immersive type of
content it's not something that you just
consume passively you're actually
interacting with it and you feel like
you're there so soon we're going to
start supporting spherical videos and
news feed people already watched more
than three billion videos a day in news
feed and it's some of the most engaging
content in our system we're going to
bring spherical videos to oculus -
you're gonna be able to put on your
headset and just feel like you're really
there so we're actually experimenting
with live spherical video here today we
have a spherical camera filming at our
headquarters down in Menlo Park so after
the session is done I'm you can head
over to our humorously and ironically
named teleportation station to get a
sense of what our crew down at Facebook
headquarters feels about FA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
