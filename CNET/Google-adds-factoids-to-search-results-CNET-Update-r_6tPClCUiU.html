kills off unlimited data stragglers and
some folks dream of tweeting to aliens
I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update your google search results will
now look a bit different google has
launched the knowledge graph project and
it's designed to give you more
information about a topic and help you
find related items for example if you
search for kings you could mean the
hockey team the basketball team or that
TV show now a box will be on the side to
help you narrow it down to one topic and
when you search for something specific
like say the architect Frank Lloyd
Wright you'll get a fact box with info
about him and his work within a fact box
you can keep digging deeper into more
fact boxes and if there's wrong
information just report it to Google
this new search data will roll out over
the next few days you can't always count
on iphone rumors but here's one that's
looking pretty solid the next iPhone
will have a larger screen The Wall
Street Journal has spoken with sources
that confirm Apple has ordered larger
screens from manufacturers in Asia it'll
be at least a four inch screen if not
larger and we've seen a few other
reports recently about Apple ordering
larger screens the iphone has been the
same 3.5 inch screen since it first
launched in 2007 and in other stories
we're watching Verizon customers that
have been grandfathered in a thirty
dollar monthly unlimited data plan will
lose their unlimited data if they
upgrade to a 4G LTE phone a verizon
executive broke the news at a technology
conference saying that eventually every
3g unlimited plan will be phased out and
customers can move to a family data
share plan facebook is reportedly
seeking to add diversity to its current
board of directors which are all white
males would be nice to see a woman on
the board because you know only 500
million facebook users are female
scientists have been working for years
to communicate with extraterrestrial
life-forms but ever thought about sunny
to tweet to an alien it's an
experimental art project that two guys
are hoping you'll help fund on rockethub
a team is asking for 8500 dollars to
build a device that can transmit tweets
to a distant planet if they raise the
money all you need is to
use the hashtag tweets in space and your
message will be sent among the stars i
wonder which twitter client they use on
planet GJ 667c see when Windows 8 comes
out later this year it will be easier
for parents to monitor their child's
computer use parents can get weekly
reports describing what websites they
visit what programs they use and what
games they play and how long they spend
on each thing it's the next best thing
to hovering over a child shoulder that's
