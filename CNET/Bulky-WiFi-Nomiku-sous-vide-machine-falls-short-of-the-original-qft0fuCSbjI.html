companies we saw to create a product
just for home cooks who wanted to
sous-vide recently nama coup has
released a new version of their sous
vide circulator with Wi-Fi connectivity
the Wi-Fi lets you connect to an app
called tinder where you can use recipes
that other people have uploaded and it
will automatically send the time and the
cook temperature to your nama COO unit I
didn't find that the app was very robust
it was kind of a nice to have more than
I have to have and the actual nama KU
Wi-Fi itself is a lot less attractive
than the older model without the Wi-Fi
it's bulkier and it's a little harder to
use especially the turn wheel when you
want to adjust the temperature when it
comes to cooking the nama who does do a
pretty good job the meat and veggies
that I cooked with sous-vide came out
pretty well
I took the temperature of the water bath
while the nama coup was cooking the food
to see how consistent it was with its
set temperature though the Nava who did
stay within one degree of the set
temperature it tempted to run about 0.6
to 0.8 degrees hotter which doesn't seem
like a big deal but sous-vide cooking is
all about precision and so the closer we
can get to the set temperature the
better the nama khulafa is going to sell
for two hundred and forty nine dollars
but you can pre-order it on the
Company's website for $199 but when you
take a look at all the other sous-vide
products out there a lot of them have
connectivity that's a lot more useful
and helpful than what the nama
concurrently offers unfortunately this
product is not at the head of the sous
vide path</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
