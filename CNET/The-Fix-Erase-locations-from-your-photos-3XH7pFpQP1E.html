photos on a smartphone instead of a
traditional camera is that the photos
are embedded with the GPS location of
where your photo was taken it's great if
you want to create a map of where you've
been or if you want to quickly tag your
photo on Instagram or four square but
what if you want to photograph a
location you'd like to keep secret like
your home well I'm going to show you how
to strip the GPS location off of the
photos you take with your smartphone so
that you can share them online without
announcing your location first off know
that you can globally disable location
embedding on your smartphone if you just
don't see any upside to it on the iphone
you can go into settings privacy
location services and either shut it all
down or just switch off the camera most
people at least like to keep location
running for use in navigation apps like
maps on Android it can differ slightly
from phone to phone but you can try
going into settings and then location
and then turning it off on the HTC One
here you can also manage the camera app
specifically by going to the camera
settings and unchecking the box for
geotag photos how can you verify that a
photo taken with your phone doesn't have
any hidden GPS data on it that could
give away your location cora doko is a
free app that you can get from both the
iphone and android and unless you view
the location data within your photos and
see it on a map from here you can delete
the data and save the photo is a new
file to your camera roll
for iphone users there's a slightly more
polished app called dgo so dollar 99 and
pulls the same trick as quartered oak Oh
only you can select multiple images and
you can share the untagged images
directly to connected services such as
Flickr or Facebook so next time you want
to share a photo you took around your
home without divulging its precise
location to every burglar and weirdo in
the world now you know how to strip the
GPS location data off your photos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
