I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update the google glass connected I
where is evolving beyond an experimental
product the Explorer model will no
longer be available to purchase after
Monday and google announced that the
glass project is leaving the labs to
become its own team with a new boss the
man behind the design of the ipod and
the nest thermostat Tony Fadell is now
in charge of the future of glass taking
glass off the market and ending the
Explorer program doesn't mean glasses
dead the future just isn't crystal clear
Google teased in a blog post that as
glass graduates from the labs we're
going to see future versions of it the
head gear has faced some scrutiny since
it launched in 2013 the $1,500 gadget
gave us the term glass holes as we
worked around the social etiquette and
privacy issues that come with wearing a
camera and screen over your eye but we
also came across some cool examples of
glass as an instructional tool for
hands-free video recording doctors use
it during surgeries cyclists can get
real-time directions during a ride but
aside from being used during a specific
task it's still awkward to go around
town walking with it on your head having
it alert each of the same notifications
that you can get on a smartphone and so
people are more comfortable with face
cameras the SmartWatch has become the
more widely accepted wearable tech in a
few months Apple is going to release the
Apple watch and we have some more clues
into how it will work thanks to a leaked
iphone companion app screenshots were
published by the blog 9to5 mac and if
these are accurate it reveals that there
are many settings you can control about
the watch from your phone you can have a
red dot appear on the clock when there's
a notification you could track a stop on
your watch face it can speak aloud text
so you don't have to read a tiny screen
and instead of typing on the screen
it'll just dictate your voice into text
or you can send an audio clip message to
reply to someone to use Apple pay you'll
have to type in a 4 number passcode on
the watch this year tech isn't just on
your head or your wrist
even tech for your toes at CES we saw
the sense aura smart sock preparing to
ship in late 2015 it has pressure
sensors in the soul that send data to a
removable anklet and that syncs with
your app so you can check your cadence
and striking pattern as you run we also
got to see the digit soul it's a
bluetooth connected insole that tracks
your steps and activity but it can also
warm your feet on a cold winter day a
pack of two costs two hundred dollars
