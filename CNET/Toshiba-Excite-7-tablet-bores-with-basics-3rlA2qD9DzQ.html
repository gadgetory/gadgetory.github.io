is the Toshiba Excite 7 tablet now this
is a pretty basic budget tablet
nothing too special about it its design
is similar to other Toshiba Excite
tablets with a plastic body that has a
textured back panel and thick black
bezels on the front the bumpy back works
better to help grip the device on the
smaller 7-inch than it does on the
larger Excite tablets but the overall
look and feel of the device is rather
inexpensive most of the ports are
located on the top edge of the tablet
with the headphone jack that also works
with microphones volume rocker micro SD
card slot and micro USB port the power
button is on the right edge and the
stereo speakers are located on the
bottom the speakers are awkwardly
located in the place up easy to block
and unlike the rounded back the front
edges are rigid and can slightly dig
into your palms if holding the tablet
towards your body the 3 megapixel back
camera produces fuzzy photos and washed
out colors and the same can be said for
the 0.3 megapixel front-facing camera
the Excite 7 has a 1024 by 600 pixel
resolution which is well below today's
top tablets but even for a budget tablet
at its starting price it's still a bit
low pixels are obvious colors are gold
and despite the fact that it has good
viewing angles glare is a frequent
nuisance the Excite 7 has audio
enhancing features built-in but the
speaker's still sound tinny and flat no
matter what type of audio they're
playing the Toshiba Excite 7 houses a
1.6 gigahertz quad-core CPU 1 gigabyte
of RAM and a gigabyte or 16 gigabytes of
internal storage
performance-wise for the most part II
ran smoothly the crashing apps and
lagging was a frequent occurrence
especially if multiple apps were open
the touchscreen also had a hard time
recognizing swipes and gestures on
various occasions gaming performance was
smooth as long as a lot of other apps
aren't open and as expected larger games
take a long time to look there are many
7-inch tablets below $200 that offer
basic specs
average performance the Toshiba Excite
sevens 159 starting price doesn't
overshadow its laggy performance
inconsistent touchscreen and dual
display when it comes to budget tablets
these days you can find something better
in the same price range
