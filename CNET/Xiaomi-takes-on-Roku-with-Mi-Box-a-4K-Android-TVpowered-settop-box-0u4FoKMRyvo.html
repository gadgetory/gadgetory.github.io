Android TV based product this is the
launcher this is the Android TV launcher
this is what you see when you power on
me box up at the top here you've got
search and voice search I'll show you
more of that in a second then you've got
a row of personalized recommendations so
these are recommendations that the
system is making from all the different
apps that you have running on here
basically the more content you watch the
better these recommendations are going
to look like one really important thing
about this box is that it supports 4k
resolution not only that but 4k at 60
frames a second the other thing that me
box supports is this new video format
called HDR we're all familiar with HDR
from mobile photography so me box
supports HDR out of the box in one of
our partners that we're showing here
today is Ling TV so you don't actually
have to have a cable set-top box for
example you can watch your USB n for
instance directly from your Mii box if
you have the this link TV app Google
Voice Search is built right into Android
TV as well so for example I can just by
pressing this button here the microphone
button on the remote I can say what's
the name of that movie where Jim Carrey
gets his memory erased and it will
answer Eternal Sunshine of the spotless
mind I can start watching it right away
another cool feature of me box because
of Android TV is Google cast right so
it's a feature that a lot of people
already know say I'm watching a video
for example on YouTube I can literally
cast that video from my phone to the TV
by just pressing this one button now I
choose the box and it automatically
casts it over there so I can continue
watching the video that I was watching
on my phone now on my TV so you get the
box and you get the Bluetooth voice
remote together the chips together of
course with the charger as well and with
an HDMI cable that's the basic kit and
then of course we are introducing the me
game controller which is an optional
accessory of course it works with me box
but it also works with any Android
device so I can play for example
bomb-squad
which is one of the games that we're
showing off here it's a multiplayer game
you can play using the game controller
you can play it using just the remote as
well all games come in through Google
Play so you download them all via Google
Play directly these are all going to be
Android TV optimized games
