kind of like a lot of great
opportunities in my career I just got a
call to my agent saying hey there's you
know Microsoft on Xbox or starting this
new IP and they're interested talking to
you about it and remedy and entertain
was gonna be involved and I know remedy
I love remedy games
I beat Max Payne on the set of x-men too
so this this short story Google corner
break it's basically about a time travel
experiment that goes awry and Jack Joyce
our lead character and Paul serene who
is their best friends at the beginning
basically are gained these abilities
through the this experiment going awry
and really what the game is about is
stopping the end of time so there's like
these huge stakes it's a science fiction
action-adventure shooter along with an
incredibly in-depth in game in
live-action in game show so this was a
totally different experience and you
know the motion capture process is in
one way it was like really challenging
because you're working in an environment
where nothing is there I mean I'm sure
everybody's seen it now you wear those
suits and you have a head cam and you're
in sort of a blank or empty warehouse
and it's just actors and a few basic
props and that's it for me what I care
about it like the story is huge and
exciting but there is real relatable
drama like to me the idea of two friends
becoming the worst of enemies is like
something that I want to explore and
know about that's like just good drama
so when you put it in the midst of this
gigantic science fiction adventure I
think that's something people are going
to like really enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
