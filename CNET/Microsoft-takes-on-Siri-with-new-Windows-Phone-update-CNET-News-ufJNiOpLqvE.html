for st. Louis Missouri I'll try that
again audible play Game of Thrones
playing game of thrones next chapter
heard you say next chapter somewhere
beyond the sunset across the Narrow Sea
layer land of pause heard you say pass
so as you can see not only was I able to
launch the application using speech
after her glitch there but I also was
able to give it a command and control
its behavior when I started it then from
within the application may not be able
to see but i was using UI in the
application i was able to give it a set
of commands to control its behavior like
next chapter and pause but we didn't
stop there either we want do something a
bit more complex search heard you say
search what would you like to search for
Apollo I found one result in your
library failure is not an option Mission
Control from Mercury to Apollo 13 and
beyond would you like to listen to it
yes given my aircraft test flight
background that could pause heard you
say pause so it might have been is easy
to see there but I basically had a
conversation with my app I started it by
asking it to search and we continued
with a two-way interactive conversation
this was not just with the phone but
this was with my application
and then i can continue to have that
calm two-way conversation and i got to
exactly what i wanted to without having
to touch the screen we are excited to
see what developers to come up with
because this is available to every
developer we have the ability to have
speech-enabled applications that can
have conversations with each end user
and they can go use their creativity to
take this technology to the next level
as as priorities showing on my screen
here we are excited to announce that
audible is going to be available for
Windows Phone 7 5 that you can go to our
marketplace and download it later today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
