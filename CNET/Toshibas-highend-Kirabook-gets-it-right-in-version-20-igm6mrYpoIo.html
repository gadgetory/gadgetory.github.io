look at the toshiba kirabook this is the
second generation of toshiba's super
high-end machine they came up with this
idea of a whole new line called the cure
book to sort of compete with some of the
other super high-end laptops out there
at the time most notably the macbook pro
with retina display because this was one
of the first pc laptops that we ever saw
with a better than HD display it had a
2560 x 1440 screen in a very thin very
light magnesium alloy body now the first
generation had a couple of missteps the
base model which was still like sixteen
hundred dollars didn't have a
touchscreen on it even though it had a
higher res screen and when you wanted to
move up there was closer to like
nineteen hundred dollars which really
did seem crazy because even though it
was a very nice looking thin light
laptop it wasn't that much of a game
changer design wise now this new version
makes a couple of improvements on the
inside the outside actually looks the
same although i think it's i think it's
aged well really inside we've gotten
current generation intel haswell cpus
and that gives us slightly better
performance sure but actually better
battery life which was one of our main
complaints about the first generation
kirabook now i feel confident using this
guy all day long and now for sixteen
hundred dollars you can get a new core
i7 cpu the big 2560 x 1440 display and
of course it's a touch display they got
rid of that non-touch option which was
not really even that much more or less
expensive i think compared to a lot of
the other sort of thin hybrid and
ultrabook style laptops that come out in
last year since the original kirabook no
one's really done anything that's
spectacular design wise so coming back
to this look 10 months later I go you
know what it's actually aged well and it
really is a very small and very thin and
very light for a 13-inch laptop
ironically like it more now than I did
then I'm Dan ackman and that is the
toshiba kirabook
