familiar design i'm dan ackerman and
we're here taking a look at the brand
new HP spectre x360 now the x360 line is
something HP is done a couple of models
in and it's basically their version of
dare I say the Lenovo yoga design we
call it the the fold back hinge or it
goes all the way back 360 degrees like
that so even though we've seen this
design before in terms of being able to
fill the hinge back HP says it's version
is new because it has a new hinge design
that has a set of interlocking gears on
each side which means that it opens very
smoothly and evenly and it stays in
whatever position you put it and
certainly playing around with it it
feels very stiff and stable and very
smooth so you can start out like it's a
clamshell laptop you can flip it around
I call this sort of a kiosk mode good
for presentations almost like you have
an extra monitor here some people can
flip it around like a table tent like
this I pretty much never do that and
then of course if you fold it down like
this then you have a tablet you still
have the touch pan and the keyboard here
but they're deactivated when it's folded
like this and of course the touchpad is
one of the extra-wide style ones we've
seen on HP laptops lately it's nice to
have that extra real estate even though
it's got a very premium look and feel
the spectre x360 starts out pretty
reasonably 899 for a current gen core i5
cpu with a 128 gig SSD hard drive and 4
gigs of ram this is a step up model with
twice the ram and twice the hard drive
space but that's only 999 that's pretty
good later on they're going to have a
model with a quad HD touchscreen this is
just a regular 1920 x 1080 but that's
pretty much all you need I'm their neck
i'm going to edit the HP spectre x360</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
