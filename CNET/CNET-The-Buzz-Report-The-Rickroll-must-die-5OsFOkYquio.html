report this week a special episode
dedicated to stamping out a scourge on
the Internet but first it's the gadget
of the week the gadget of the week is
the Samsung instinct this sprint phone
made its debut this week at the CTIA
Show in Las Vegas and let me put it this
way you know how like you totally want
an iPhone but you don't want to be like
everybody else who gets an iPhone but
you really want the pretty and the
touchscreen and you need 3G and you'd
like it to have built-in GPS and total
support for corporate email and a little
bit of tactile feedback when you're
typing on the virtual keyboard and you'd
like it to be available on Sprint
sometime around June for like under $300
yeah now you have that and now for the
news this week was April Fool's Day
which resulted in a collective feeling
of boredom and annoyance at the
customary collection of web pranks
insider jokes and Google tomfoolery this
year's day did do us all a possible
favor though YouTube briefly replaced
all its featured videos with links to
rickroll which if you don't know what
that is it's the practice of tricking
you into clicking a link that turns out
to be the video for Rick Astley's never
gonna give you up many speculated that
by going nuclear with the rick roll on
its front page youtube has effectively
killed the meme hope springs eternal but
actually I think that YouTube used the
nuclear option out of sheer self-defense
I mean the rick roll has become such a
widespread internet annoyance that
google rightly feared no one would ever
click a youtube link again if things
were to continue in this thing actually
I'm not sure that Google and YouTube's
efforts are even enough I think there's
still some chance that the rick roll
could continue and let me be perfectly
clear here my friends the rick roll is
ruining America time is being
irrevocably lost people's lives are
being ruined we've even seen like death
threats here at scene it I swear on the
soul of my father that the next person
to rick roll silat will not reach the
top line you've got workplace vandalism
look what it did to Carolyn McCarthy of
news-dot-com and just look at this
testimonial from one ricktum who was
scarred for life from repeated exposure
to the rickroll so I was just dreaming
peacefully and all of a sudden Rick
Astley was in my dream and he was
singing and I woke up I'm I couldn't get
back to sleep and it was like my own
subconscious rickrolled me my friends it
is time to take matters into our own
hands the Rick rolls time has come it's
so bad that this week we got an email on
our internal mailing list that said
here's a muppet Rick roll what you
cannot announce a rick roll and don't
even talk to me about that one that you
launched and it takes over your browser
with an endless series of pop-up windows
rick roll virus much the rick roll is
over and it has to die and there's only
one way to make it die roll it charlie
ready to make the trip
that's right the rickroll has officially
jumped the shark all future rickroll
works are now declared derivative and
all ye who would roll another will be
declared lame and behind the times
die rickrolled i i'm mollie would this
been the buzz report i'm feeling quite
good about all this thanks for watching
that's right the rick roll has
officially jumped the shark i spit a
little bit let's go back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
