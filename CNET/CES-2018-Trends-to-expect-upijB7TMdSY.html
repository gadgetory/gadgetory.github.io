Consumer Electronics Show on the planet
es 2018 the Expo in Las Vegas kicks off
January 7th and goes on through January
12th with about 4,000 exhibitors from
around the world showcasing new gadgets
for the coming year now there are always
plenty of surprises but here are a few
trends were expecting to see there could
be more buzz than usual about phones one
company's teasing that a major
manufacturer will have a phone with a
fingerprint sensor under the screen
there's also a rumor that Samsung may
tease its next major phone the Galaxy S
9 but that could just be a video clip
teased at best count on 5g wireless
speeds to be brought up by a few
companies as networks are making the
upgrade over the next couple of years
and with the rise of Virtual Assistants
expect more devices to use voice
recognition and pair to Alexa Siri or
Google's assistant you could see this in
headphones televisions or more smart
home gadgets voice control in fact maybe
leaving the home and following you more
to your car and workplace it's always a
big show for televisions with plenty of
jaw-dropping screens with jaw-dropping
price tags
the most notable televisions will
probably be just concept technology like
the roll-up screens we've seen in the
past but there could be fresh buzz
around micro LED technology it uses an
array of very small LEDs that can get
very bright and can produce absolute
black when the LEDs are turned off
individually and what about virtual and
augmented reality well this year there
are fewer exhibitors from VR and more
companies are showing off AR why should
it is
anyone in VR compete with Facebook and
oculus maybe smaller companies see
augmented reality as the place to shine
for eyewear and goggles I'm Bridget
