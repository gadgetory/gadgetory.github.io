Akhtar smart home gadgets are exploding
but some of us don't live in places
where it's advisable to just start
removing thermostats or replacing locks
some of us like me live in apartments or
others in dorms where we'd like our
homes to be as smart as any other home
so these are the top five smart home
gadgets for nomads
well not nomads but people want to take
their smart tech with them let's get to
it
at number five is a smart smoke and
carbon monoxide detector yeah I'm
talking about the nest protect I know
what you're thinking I as I'm not
hardwiring that well listen pal you
don't have to there's a battery-powered
version that costs the same as the wired
version also if you're thinking long
term it could be a great companion to a
nest thermostat in the future coming in
at number four remote outlets using
something like the Belkin Wemo switch
can turn dumb devices into smart ones
the device hooks into your home network
and works with your phone so you can
remotely control things with an on/off
switch if you're curious about
applications for such a thing
think about lamps or fans if you think
bigger you can actually have things turn
on and off based on weather or other
events by using IFFT that stands for if
this then that if you have no idea what
I'm talking about
search for CNET IFTTT you're gonna find
some awesome stuff
number three is a smart air conditioner
if you live in a part of the world where
it gets hot or humid or both an air
conditioner is indispensable why not get
smart with it check out the quirky plus
GE Aero smart a/c it syncs to your home
network and pairs with your phone it can
use geofencing to find out when you're
near to turn on the air conditioning as
need be and if you're on a budget the
app will also give you suggestions on
how to run the unit differently to save
money at number two is a camera it's
always good to have an eye on your place
at my place I've got a drop camp since
the device no longer exists why not take
a look at a successor the nest cam it's
incredibly easy to set up doesn't
require any hard wiring the wide viewing
angle makes it really easy to see plenty
and its small size makes it easy to tuck
on a shelf before we get to number one
let's take a detour and see what you
guys thought on
I asked what your favorite smart home
gadgets were Brad mentioned he loves his
August smart locks
Patrick liked his wiving scale which is
an interesting pick for a smart home
gadget I mean it's not portable so it's
a home thing connects to the internet so
it's smart so it is a smart home gadget
anyway let's get to number one at number
one our colored LED light bulbs I know
this seems like a strange choice but let
me walk you through an idea so many
places are painted white stark white
painting a wall requires permission from
the landlord or somebody else
alternatively you could just paint the
walls and repaint when you leave or you
could get some colored LED bulbs now
take a look the Philips iris table lamp
its function is to bathe an area in
whatever color you want I've got two
near my TV and it really adds the
experience plus it makes those white
walls not appear so boring why paint you
could bay the wall in light what about
robot vacuums like the neato or the
Roomba I didn't include them on this
list because they're more about home
automation than smart gadgets am i
splitting hairs about devices that
specialize in things like picking up pet
hairs let me know in the comments
section or on twitter i'm a daya's for
more top 5s like this visit top-5
