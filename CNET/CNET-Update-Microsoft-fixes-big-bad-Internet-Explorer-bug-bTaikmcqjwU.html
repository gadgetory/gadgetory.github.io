again I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
seen that update Microsoft has fixed the
serious Internet Explorer security flaw
that made it possible for a hacker to
hijack your computer the update was
released Thursday for all versions of
the internet explorer browser and
there's even a fix for windows XP even
though windows XP isn't supported
anymore Microsoft was feeling generous
to offer a patch to protect the 12 year
old system you see without the patch if
you accidentally click on a bad link you
could load a website that automatically
installs software to give hackers the
power to take control of your computer
without your knowledge so make sure you
have automatic updates enabled on
Windows to get that patch entity of
Windows XP you got lucky today with this
patch but it's seriously time to move on
that system was designed for a different
age of the Internet and there's no
guarantee it'll be protected the next
time someone discovers a new bug right
now XP is on about twenty six percent of
computers that's according to the web
traffic monitored by the group net
applications it's the second most
popular desktop system and it's likely
because it's used by many small
businesses that don't have the resources
to easily upgrade but there are a few
other updates to talk about in the world
of apps you can now finally chat with
someone on snapchat the app group
popular as a way to send photos that
disappear in 10 seconds or less after
they are opened but now snapchat has
evolved beyond fleeting photos you can
hold a conversation with someone with
texting and real-time video calls you
can save a chat by taking a screenshot
or tapping on it to save it and when you
both are in chat mode you can press the
screen and hold to share face-to-face
video gamers should take note that the
PlayStation 4 console just got an update
the system added many new features
including share factory it lets you edit
your gameplay video and add cool effects
before sharing it with the world
streaming quality also improved
and you can adjust the brightness of the
light barb and if you need to do some
grocery shopping you could pick up items
from groupon a new service called
groupon basics offers some basic
household items like vitamins soap and
tissues but you'll be buying it in bulk
so I hope you need 92 dollars worth of
tissues but at that price groupon
doesn't charge for shipping so yay
groupon is trying to take on the costcos
of the world since you don't need to pay
for a membership fee to buy in bulk
amazon also recently got into the
grocery game with amazon prime pantry
that's your tech news update you can
head to cnet.com for more details from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
