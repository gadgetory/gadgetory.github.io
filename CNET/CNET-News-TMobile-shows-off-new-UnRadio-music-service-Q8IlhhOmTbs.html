be some sort of a free streaming service
given out in Seattle today they just
picked the wrong location when they
guessed it so let's just talk about
music freedom talk about a pain point
and a trend a hundred and thirteen
million people stream music on their
mobile devices now that is up twice
since last year and in the last couple
of years the streaming traffic on our
network has gone up six-fold so talk
about a coming attraction how about this
sixty-seven percent of streamers do
their streaming on mobile devices
remember that trend in the beginning and
what's happening here now how about this
a huge percentage of people forty
percent and growing say that they limit
their streaming on their mobile devices
because they're petrified about data
bucket overages and charges that they're
going to get from the carriers major
fear major pain point so what do we do
we free you and back to the first point
why because we can because of our
network because of the data capability
and this is a trend so music freedom
means that every single note from right
now starting with the top seven or eight
which account for eighty-five percent of
music will come free not against your
bucket and even when you exhaust your
high-speed data bucket you will still
stream music free at a high speed our
view is let's just give all the top
streaming services all of them in fact
these six services represent eighty-five
percent of the streaming music data
traffic on our network let's set the
data price for all of these services to
zero let's have full speed streaming
let's have no data overages no caps
unlimited let me ask you a question
when was the last time you heard 18t or
verizon even utter the word unlimited
come on they view it so totally
differently and that's what we're
excited about tonight and by the way not
only these top six services but also a
couple of our of our closest partners
services like milk music from Samsung
and also an app that we're very excited
about coming soon to all the app stores
from our partner sfx beatport music and
EDM sensation coming soon will be
included in our program and so we set
out to do something really special for
these customers because in many ways
there are very best customers and we
scan the landscape for an internet radio
service that we could provide for these
customers probably not surprised for
free and we didn't really find it
because what we found was internet radio
itself as John said has a few pain
points involved in it there are some
things that people aren't getting from
their internet radio and so we sat down
with our crosstown friends at Rhapsody
and we created together and asked
Rhapsody to create Rhapsody unraid EO
being announced and launch tonight from
this state with our friends available in
all of the app stores available in all
the app stores nationwide tonight a
totally new internet radio product that
takes things to a totally new direction
it's five dollars a month for the public
but you might not be surprised to hear
for our unlimited 4G LTE customers on
our newest plans it's free it's included
and for every other t-mobile customer
it'll be available at a discounted price
of four dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
