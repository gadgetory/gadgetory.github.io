hopper first we started with the most
powerful hardware the hopper comes with
the most powerful processor available
for a satellite receiver a 750 megahertz
broadcom 7420 chipset we then added
three tuners and the largest hard drive
a 7200 rpm two terabyte drive and all
this we packaged into a small sleek box
that's forty percent smaller than a
competitor's latest receiver the hopper
is a hybrid box and supports both
satellite and IP video and comes built
in with many connectivity options
including Wi-Fi with an adapter it also
has mocha bluetooth and zigbee RF / CD
the mocha is used to communicate and
create whole home video distribution
Bluetooth enables Bluetooth devices to
bed to the hopper for example you can
connect stereo bluetooth headphones and
enjoy your programming without
disturbing anyone else the whole home
functionality is built on a
client-server model so one home needs
just one hopper and multiple thin
clients that joey's which have no
satellite tuner the joys have an equally
fast 7 50 megahertz processor and
support all the features available on
the hopper you can see how small it is
compared to the size of a dollar bill it
also comes with multiple mounting
options and mounts behind your TV for a
clean hidden installation and also has a
zigbee RF or CD remote the hopper was
built it on the fast simple and
intuitive user interface you'll see a
full high-definition user interface
stunning graphics tile-based navigation
that makes it really easy to find your
favorite movies and TV shows let's look
at the guide it comes with all channel
logos and super fast scrolling
that is enabled by the 7 50 megahertz
processor and you'll see that the entire
user interface is fast and responsive
let's look at the DVR the DVR
personalizes your TV it has you it has
your favorite shows and your favorite
movies so we created a new user
interface that has poster art it
organizes it by title or you can it it
automatically puts categories behind it
or you can create your own folders to
find your favorite recordings the hopper
also has a new on-demand user interface
so if you connect the hopper to
broadband you get thousands of movies
and TV shows easily on the hopper also
has unique filters through the few
clicks of the remote you can find action
movies family movies new movies or old
movies only with dished do you get tru
TV Everywhere the capability to watch
live TV and your recordings inside your
home and outside your home and is now
available with the hopper with a sling
adapter you can extend the hoppers whole
home capability outside your home and
watch all your life channels and your
recordings on a pc tablet or mobile
device as we saw shows from ABC CBS NBC
and fox are the most popular shows
during primetime so with the hopper a
customer can set set it to automatically
record all four networks during
primetime in high definition using a
single tuner that's correct records all
four networks in high definition using a
single tuner call this prime time
