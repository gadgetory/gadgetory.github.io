look at the canon pixma mg 56 20
multifunction inkjet printer so in
addition to printing and full-color this
machine can also scan and copy documents
however if you're a multitasker and plan
to scan a lot of documents you may want
to look for a more office friendly
machine because a lot of things about
this printer make it better for personal
use so first of all there's no document
feeder on top here so you can't throw on
a stack of papers to get scanned you
have to do it one by one using the
single sheet manual feed tray on the
bottom there's also a lot to be said
about what you don't get on this printer
things like a lack of a media card
reader and a USB port may also be a
deal-breaker for photographers so it's
kind of tricky to review this printer
because although it delivers on its
promise to output high-quality photos it
does so at a pretty high cost of
consumables there's five ink cartridges
in there which means it can really
handle a wide spread of colors but at
about five cents a page for just black
pigment ink alone you'll be racking up a
lot of refills if you print too much so
this printer is much better suited for
at-home use with users that plan to only
print light graphics documents and text
but don't print enough to warrant the
investment in a larger laser printer or
office friendly multifunction printer
you can read more details in my full
review on SEANET but that's it for this
video I'm Justin this is the canon pixma
and g56 20 inkjet printer thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
