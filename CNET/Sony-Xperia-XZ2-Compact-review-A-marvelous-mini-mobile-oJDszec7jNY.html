it's also small enough to use with one
hand you don't really have a lot of
options in fact you have only one option
and it's this it's the Sony Xperia x10 2
compact at only 5 inches and with these
skinny bezels it's got a very small
footprint overall that means you can
easily type you just one hand and it'll
slide into your jeans pocket without any
difficulty whatsoever here it is against
a galaxy s 9 plus their pixel 2 XL and
the LG G 7 as you can see they're all
way bigger and therefore not quite as
snug to use the compact is still packed
with top tech so we'll easily keep pace
with larger flagships it's got qualcomm
top snapdragon 805 processor which gives
a blistering performance it's got a
camera that takes solid outdoor shots
and it's Full HD screen resolution makes
text looks nice and crisp the battery is
only ok however and its design is as
dull as a paving slab on the streets of
rather 'm the thing to consider then is
where the size really is that important
to you larger phones do make playing
games and watching videos that bit
easier so if you do plan on doing that I
would look elsewhere but there's no
question but if you want a small Android
phone that still got the power of a
flagship this is the one to get nothing
else comes close but what do you think
of the exit to compact is size that's
important for you or would you prefer a
larger screen do let us know your
