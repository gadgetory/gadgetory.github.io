welcome to tomorrow daily the best
speech talk show in the known universe
I'm Ashley sceva Jeff Kannada is away on
assignment and will be back on Thursday
so let's hit the headlines a filmmaker
is giving us a glimpse into a potential
augmented reality nightmare with his
most recent short film ke G Matsuda
short film hyper reality is a day in the
life of a young woman named Juliana the
short film is set in a future where
augmented and mixed the reality is
everywhere from gamifying Life to
interactive apps to advertisements it's
a much darker look at the possibilities
of augmented reality even though it's a
colorful short film but it's also not
that far-fetched when you think about
how technology has been used thus far I
won't spoil the ending but you should
definitely take seven minutes to watch
it then ask yourself we all love magic
leap in hololens when it's in its purest
forms but what happens when technology
like this is used by everyone everywhere
slightly creepy uh Doctor Who fans if
you're out there which I know you are
you might love this sonic screwdriver
before we all get too excited it's not
exactly like the doctors beautifully
designed tool but this is kind of neat
this is gauntlet a wearable made to trap
and manipulate levitating objects using
acoustics the University of Bristol in
England is responsible for the project
creating a variety of handheld devices
that can be used to pick up small
objects without touching them and then
rotate or move them as needed this
project could help in handling dangerous
materials in the future or even be used
to move small doses of medication or
tools to target locations inside your
body it's really science fictiony stuff
and one that I would imagine the doctor
himself would be interested in if you
guys want to use hashtag hey TD and talk
about our headlines you're more than
welcome to since I'm the only one here
this week until Thursday I get to pick
what story we deep dive into and I am
going to pick hyper-reality
think there's a lot to dig into here
it's a seven minute short film but
really it begs a lot of conversation
it's super thought-provoking and I think
Jeff will have a lot to say about it and
I hope you will too so use that hashtag
hey TD and tell us what you think of
hyper reality and if you think it's a
possibility of that being said that's
our headlines let's check out our phone
talker for the day our phone talker
fruit of the day today is Matthew who
took this picture on his galaxy s4 he
writes into the show and says hey Ashley
Jeff and everyone else when I think of
spring I think of the cherry blossoms on
the National Mall in Washington DC
however DC isn't the only place where
cherry blossoms exist here's a photo of
the road that leads to my office in
suburban Maryland during peak blossom I
took this photo on my Samsung Galaxy s4
you have my full permission to use this
for your show keep up the good work
first of all Matthew
what a gorgeous Drive you have to work I
mean that looks amazing and I can
imagine even in other seasons it looks
equally incredible so nice work on the
photo if you guys want to send in your
picture you can and just email it to
tomorrow at cnn.com and do all the
things Matthew did which is tell us tell
us what device you took your picture
with tell us a story about your picture
give us permission to use it on the show
and if your name is remotely difficult
to pronounce tell us how to pronounce it
that is it for today's show
if you'd like to share it with somebody
send them over to tomorrow daily comm I
will be back tomorrow with a brand new
docket of science fact meeting science
fiction but until then vegan humans see
you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
