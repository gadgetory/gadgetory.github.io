emojis I'm Bridget Carey this is your
CNET update the world is always crying
out for more emoji icons we just can't
get enough of the texting cartoon images
because sentence structure is just too
time-consuming
the group responsible for setting the
standards for these icons is the Unicode
consortium often people submit proposals
for new icons but they won't just add a
new icon for the sake of it there needs
to be a good reason for it to aid in our
communication for example requesting a
monkey in a cowboy hat could be cool but
we don't need any more monkey emojis
thank you very much anyway a team at
Google has come up with a proposal to
add more women with professions to the
pool of icons these new emoji would be
programmed by mixing two existing emoji
codes so a businesswoman would be the
code for a woman and a briefcase a
doctor could be formed from a woman and
a medical symbol and using a microscope
would create a scientist this continues
on for all sorts of jobs and there would
be a male version for these professions
as well
the motivation for the proposal was part
of a push to improve the representation
of women in the working world as an
awareness movement because women can do
more than get their hair cut and get
married but that's not the only emoji
petition getting attention this week the
condom maker directs is asking for a
condom icon although the world already
uses eggplants and peaches to talk about
the birds and the bees the company
argues that a condom emoji would empower
teens to talk openly about protection
remember kids practice safe sex teen
that leaves me with an awkward
transition to the next story
it's about Disney now it's time to say
goodbye to Disney infinity as the
company is discontinuing the video game
that required parents to buy up physical
toys so kids can bring them to life to
play in the game Disney announced it's
no longer going to self-publish console
games disney infinity first launched in
2013 it was a spinoff of the Skylanders
concept what made Disney infinity meet
is that characters from different movies
and times could interact with each other
including Marvel and Star War
characters and there's another change to
tell you about but this time it's about
this show from now on CNET update is
coming to you in a new format updates
will be shorter and there will be more
of them each covering one story you'll
still find update in the same places but
now the reports are just in a more
stable format and you'll be seeing much
more of me let me know what you think of
the changes over the next week you can
email update at cnet.com and you also
know where to find me on the social
medias from our studios in New York I'm
