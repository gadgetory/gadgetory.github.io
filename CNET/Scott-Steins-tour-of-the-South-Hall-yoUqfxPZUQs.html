show floor is open everything's crazy
and I'm going to give you a sense of
some of the stuff that's going on in
drones drones wearables VR this behind
me is parrots booth parents got a ton of
drones and this is the disco drone their
new one it's a fixed-wing drone and it
looks like a plane it has quadcopter
design inside the difference between
this and other plane drones that this
goes 15 miles an hour can fly for 45
minutes but if you stop controlling it
it's not going to go zooming off into
the distance it goes into a circle mode
and waits and hovers and you can also
command it or let it automatically come
to you and it's meant to be for
beginners to you so I don't end up
landing us in a tree and not knowing
where the heck my drone is plus this can
be controlled with an iphone or VR
because of course VR and you can put
those headsets on and see through the
camera that's mounted into the disco
drone and see where it's going so let me
show you that that's over here they only
have demo setup because I wouldn't be
able to fly this drone like through CES
maybe next year take a look at this
people are actually seeing what it looks
like over this booth
someone's actually piloting it right
over here trying to demo file and that
is a that's that's someone wearing the
headset so you can actually put it on
and that's what's going to feel like if
you are piloting a drone in VR
telepresence at the beginning of
something that we're going to see a lot
more of that's not all the drone that
son all that parrot has they also have
agriculture they have a flower pot come
check this out right over here last year
Harry had plants the parrot pot a self
irrigating system that would be able to
water your plant that's finally going to
be coming out and it's right over here
plants at CES do you ever see plants in
the show in Las Vegas no you do not the
parrot pot so there's a transparent one
that actually shows you how it works and
it will actually self water it will
recognize your plants needs care for
your plant and do it robotically I can
actually press this button and try
watering it and look at that it's
actually shooting water out now into the
pot it fills up over here the actual
paraquat will look like this it's not
transparent it's a optimizes water
efficiency it will recognize more than
8,000 plants to make sure you're not
over watering your cactus or under
watering your exotic jungle plant carrot
pod and there's a lot more to show in
fact right behind us there are smart
watches Huawei which made one of the
better android wear watches last year
huawei watch is trying to get a little
more fancy and we're seeing that as a
trend this year women's watches so while
we watch is trying to bling these things
out with a little bit more crystals and
gold color while we watch we see this
from the spit we're seeing this from
Fitbit can these things be turned into
jewelry would you buy them as jewelry
that's what everybody is banking on
huawei is a huge up-and-comer in phones
and in wearables and we'll see if we can
would find it where are the watch is on
this floor I don't really know but we
can see for their deep in there but you
can see up here there's actually models
that are wearing them parrot is one of a
bunch of drone companies that are here
parrot also has little little tiny
drones but you can see this thing flying
back up here disco that's one of the big
trends at the show vr you're seeing a
lot of companies throw VR at things to
see if it'll stick you got oculus you
have HTC vive you got samsung gear vr
google cardboard and you got to be able
to do fun things the more robots and the
more drones that we have that connect to
VR you might start to feel like you're
going places in virtual reality and I
think that's a train you're going to see
probably over the next year two years
three years or people going to hope that
you buy into I want to try flying this
in montclair actually and see what
happens so let's go check out over here
and actually see if I can use I want to
put this headset on my head go check
this out
so again
put it on
we're one of these here yeah and I don't
even know where how you would set up
that rig and actually be able to control
that over here perod also has a couple
of other drums you got the bebop 2 these
are quadcopters you may know about these
take a look over here this is the parrot
sky controller now this is what you
would actually use to control it you've
got little little ribs here and sticks
this disco the head sound see if I can
actually get a chance to put this on
here gonna grab a can I put the sign to
give it a divot of world should come
pick us up yeah okay yeah great so so
for a second and we actually put the
sign and check this out so you can
actually see what you're looking at and
then keep it on your head and now you
could actually move around and pilot it
does a simulation this is not the actual
disco drone flying you can actually see
what's happening when I'm moving around
i'm launching myself in the air I'm
flying it's hovering and it feels like a
video game this is a video game but you
actually would be piloting a real disco
drone in the real world if you were to
try one of these things so that's disco
drone and VR in action and that's what
we're seeing right now at CES drones a
lot more to come and see us 2016 i'm
