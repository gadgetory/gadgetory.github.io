the 359 podcast itchy boy DJ Bobby hill
and I'm here with Raja Chang and Ben Fox
Ruben for the recording of the 359 where
you're going to hang out with us while
we ramble about some news headlines for
for relevant minutes and then spin you
off into the ether unless you want to
hang out and chat guys what's going on
today
dude with the pay the king of Hill
people now I guess so
crap yeah and Danny don't worry there's
a show today there's going to be a show
every day until just I don't know the
early grumbled well until we go in
hiatus until we go on hiatus which may
be so it done soon we're still
discussing but there might be short
summer breaks and some of us will be
around yeah so some of us get to take
vacation is that what you're saying yeah
that's how I like it would that be right
a bit less ominous I would Roger just
I'm not taking vacations by the way I'm
just working out the west coast I was
still working accessibility where we're
pairing the fire made haha we're going
to take a break how you took it
I'm advice won't be around you can fit a
lot but I think that's you baby that is
not be I thought around like alright
alright back on track yeah when are we
talking about the original iPhone or we
posted our original iPhone review today
with special annotations you should
definitely check it out Ben and I got a
little share a couple memories about
where we were maybe we'll be able indira
George you can share yours sure I was a
little late to the smartphone game but
fine ten years ago so really trying to
reach back deep remember what the heck
right was all I can hear you use but
also I did want to say this is a bit
controversial I want to make the
argument that do your iPhone was it
quite as revolutionary that we all think
feel free to disagree with me we're
going to be talking as well a little bit
about Silicon Valley the show which
wraps up its fourth season yesterday
don't worry we're not going to go too
heavy to spoilers I think we're going to
talk a little bit about just our general
impressions yep questions about the the
season
stuntman TJ Miller's accent yep so if
you have any questions about this we're
going to take a little bit easy today
leave in the comment section Brian will
pick out the best and we will get them
in three minutes and 59 seconds and
standby I'm just setting up our little
timer here and here we go in three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang I'm
Ben Fox ribbons to commemorate the
upcoming 10th anniversary of the iPhone
launch
CNET has republished our review of the
original iPhone the anniversary just
cleared is on Thursday where we've got a
bunch of stories kind of leading up to
the anniversary you should check it out
see net but we wanted to talk a little
bit about our own I guess history with
the iPhone or I guess more specifically
mine yeah yours do you not remember what
happened during dance-along hey was I
mean I wasn't a tech reporter back then
so like my first iPhone and my first
smartphone was the iPhone 4s okay well
so it was it was a little later for me I
was rocking flip phones well I mean to
be fair my first that the one I owned
was also a 4s I was also an Android user
before then but I did have the original
iPhone actually had it take a year to
before and actually launched so are you
special thank you I was no work that at
the time the Dow Jones Newswires in wall
street journal' so we got walt mossberg
obviously had to review the journal but
i had one for dow jones as well and yeah
i was like the first time that my beat
seemed kind of cool because everyone
kept coming over to like check out the
phone I wasn't really supposed to show
it for day or two but it's Connie even
like even when it uh even when I had
launched when I was at bars people were
like coming up yeah I definitely
remember doing my first look was really
cool it was very interesting but yeah it
took me a couple years until I actually
Gove into it but wanted to ask you what
did you think of the phone like was it
this revolutionary product like you were
like oh my god this is changing my life
yeah well look there are certain things
about it that are revolutionary I can't
really dismiss the fact that in terms of
the user interface a pinch to zoom the
the fact that it's all touchscreen it's
not there are any buns I've attempted
tons and tons of smart phones before
then you know palm trios and
Windows Mobile Phone or Windows Windows
Phone I can't really call effective
become rebranding it blackberries
obviously I was a heavy blackberry user
for years and this fella was just
completely different the only thing is I
would quibble with exactly how
revolutionary that particular one is I
argue that the the following model the
iPhone 3G 3GS 3s whatever the second one
was that it came out with the App Store
which really kind of opened up what you
could out with it that was really the
price of a lot lower if you remember
this original auction was eccentric
bucks it was ran on 2g so super slow and
it really did like iPhone I needed
calendar email the browser all that was
fantastic like it definitely stepped up
what a smartphone could be but in terms
of like really opening it up to what
this is I feel like the second
generation iPhone was actually a bit
more revolutionary yeah and now it's
basically the same product year after
year alright just put a little time we
have I just want to talk about our
Silicon Valley we got wrapped up its
fourth season yesterday what do you
think I thought it was a great season
finale I kind of didn't realize it was a
season finale while and I was like wow
this is a really good episode and then I
realized afterwards it was because they
were wrapping the whole thing up a
little sad to see TJ Miller go
personally yes don't know how the show
is going to stand up without him because
I know he's like the catalyst for so
much action although you saw this season
they kind of sidelined him fairly alone
in the way he left the show I mean he he
was kind of plot device right he kind of
brought back Ganon yes and that was
really it for lunch for spoilers sorry
then he just sort of faded away sorry
about it's true it's true yeah I would
have liked to see a more impressive come
you know exit but maybe that opens the
door for him to come back for like an
arc or something like that the other
thing you know when we we actually we
talked to some of the stars of the show
earlier before the season began they
sort of hinted at more sex and also more
women more female representation I mean
it was a sex definitely there was some
that don't have sex mostly off camera
right what but they were somewhat
critical to the plot in terms of actual
like female representation the show
those of layering right we were talking
about this
where there was actually less yellow
representation knew what the hacker
character was introducing Monica didn't
do that much did Lana couldn't do that
much so I don't know anyways too much we
don't have time to talk about it but for
more on these stories cuz I'm gonna
see that Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox ribbon
thanks for listening
avi in the chat says I still remember
this fabulous tech from the
out-of-the-box design and the idea of
Steve Jobs we got a couple of
reminiscence I'm glad we don't have
Alfred on the show today because it was
made before he was born
we had some relevant parties and a nice
to get Roger on the show because usually
Alfred is too busy dancing and
breakdancing and algae Tom Holland to
dance off just and how do I look I'm
after this weekend he was at a junket
okay what does the Spider Man cast he
was actually hanging out not real mom
okay thank God I thought I saw the tweet
it was like this cramped panel and yeah
I was sitting in like the fourth or
fifth row okay
but you know that's cool right yeah
anyway so I sent along your comments and
we want to hear how you remember you
know where literally the title of the
other show where were you when the
original iPhone came out I remember I
was just about to actually start working
for this company ah
ten years ago it was a long time yeah
the thing that I liked about the review
by the way so we review our own review
with genius annotation yeah which I
thought was really great
one of the things that it mentions in
the review that I got a kick out of was
it shines as an iPod like that was one
of his basic one of its main vision
value and replay which back then was
definitely an appeal right like I was
that's what you thought a babble you
thought their products right that was
easily my biggest sell point just as a
user because I had I don't remember the
model of a make but of some crappy flip
phone with a cab waiting stripe on it
right sure someone else had it but I
remember just wanting like oh I hate
carrying an iPod and a phone yeah I'm
gonna consolidate this and that was a
sell point for me yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah the other thing that I wanted to
point out from the review was Kent
German who wrote the original review
said it didn't
live up to the hype which he was kind of
right yeah I'm kind of wrong about yeah
you know is that it wasn't there were a
lot of things missing from the original
yes that kind of maybe justified that
explanation but at the same time
it really was a revolutionary device
that changed so many different things it
definitely changed the way we looked at
what a smartphone could be because
before then it was they were kind of
clunky they're harder to use they're
definitely it was definitely more for
white-collar workers monks who didn't
mind like tapping the tiny little icons
and I mean honey screens that were
giving them didn't mind typing on
physical keyboards and there were a lot
of companies that kind of poopoo the
whole idea of the iPhone right the
radical a bomber famously right Palo the
palm CEO at coggan was like he doesn't
like she doesn't know what he doesn't
know what smartphone business is like it
yeah yeah so there's a lot of skepticism
going into that launch and then grant it
was a really expensive phone right it
was at least first-generation I thought
it was definitely more of a status
symbol it didn't really hit mainstream
awareness until I'm not mainstream
availability until really the second
generation when the price dropped and
introduced with subsidy so the phone was
it like $700 you could probably argue
that the iPhone single-handedly was
responsible for like people just staring
directly into their phones for way too
long
like even like while they're sitting
across from their day to dinner yeah
well they're at work where they're at
the zoo well I mean each whatever think
about where we are now and the things
that we can't even imagine being without
that they're just standard fare anymore
like you didn't really have video on the
original iPhone it was physically
possible but it was a hoops to jump
through to get it to happen
the idea of that front-facing camera not
there when I flash on your camera lash
not there and now it's like oh my god
like that's kind of the fun part is
thinking about we thought this was so
fantastic so fantastic right a screen
and the it's colorful and it's basically
like when Windows and also a really GUI
was a 3.5 inch screen or what was hub it
was not just current not very big it was
like it looked amazing at the time it
looked massive at the time it was like
this this revelation in as a phone
because it was
was this touchscreen right but at the
same time you look back at it now and
any lie
ready clunky Eli Eli says Roger it was
$500 with this subsidy okay so well no
that's the thing
there wasn't a subsidy for the original
iPhone actually it was a profit-sharing
model that they had with 18 t they would
actually take a cut so there was
actually no subsidy for that original
phone subsidy came in I think like six
months later when they started realizing
that is way too much for people to spend
on phones because before that for most
consumers they were spending pretty much
nothing or you know fifty bucks on a Sun
right because it was subsidized they
were cheap flip phones or you know quick
messaging devices and they were they
were very cheap so to go from paying
nothing to paying $500 I'm huge stuff
nowadays like really blink and paying a
thousand bucks for a phone
look it's crazy but back then it was
definitely different so do you remember
when the phone escaped the AT&amp;amp;T world
because I remember that was one of the
critical reasons that I didn't I was
like three or four years later that I
why I jumped over to AT&amp;amp;T between that
and the fact that CBS got a little
discount there no it's okay yeah you get
a little Park and before I move any more
forward I want to kind of revisit some
other people's memories in the chat I
had a samsung something but I don't
remember what it was that's because I
had my company basically give me a
blackberry and yeah I dropped my own
phone service and just used a company
one for a while mm-hmm and then yeah I
had I had to return a lot of phone I had
to send it back oh this is just a review
unit so I only had it for yeah month or
so but yeah then like I that I would get
every sort of every new version for like
a month but I never actually owned
wanted to like you I think I bought the
4s so that's when I was a Dow Jones with
the Wall Street Journal they gave us
BlackBerry's and during you know we're
instances when there was like a breaking
story and I had to be like out on the
scene having that physical keyboard was
clutch yeah there was no way I was going
to be able and granted this is like very
specific for reporters but there was no
way
going to be able to like write several
paragraphs to submit on the I know
people can do it now yeah I don't I
don't know I can actually almost by
memory now seriously such type of my I
see I see people doing that like when
I'm doing and I'm not I'm not quite good
at it like our intern last year lamb she
could do it really well yeah there's a
lot of is a lot of younger folks are
basically born raised on a touch
keyboard right so enough funny because
like I remember when I was going to
school it was mandatory to learn how to
type type you know yeah oh yeah I
learned that Whittle school you think
there's ever going to be like a class
where they teach you how to type on a
non tactile they're going to teach you
how don't you use that because it's like
because I'm or decides exactly as screen
sizes are all different like I guess not
that's kind of a silly but it was out no
this is where we are now by the way via
the Verizon iPhone went on sale in 2011
so it sounds like sort of around behind
that I got it two years yeah because I
had the 4s for a couple years and then I
switched over to the six which I still
have you probably got it that year but
like in the fall
yeah introduced the 4sj I believe so
yeah Matthew Dodger says what about the
time the iPhone 3G wasn't actually on a
3G network whoo so it was that ATT was
that ATT buh last I think so
I bet if I'd the way I personally
remember correctly yeah yeah it wasn't
great because it'll work talk with it
though I will because there were a lot
of fun after phones freaking awesome
right and then you know an early
adopters were super into this is this
was some no it was really it was really
an agent he took a brunt of it like they
wanted the full crisis communications
mode after that like it was a big black
eye for them just the fact that service
really did it really was terrible it
couldn't handle the sheer amount of
traffic that those iPhone I think halls
would drop to you know like the phone
calling function which is like why you
have a phone right or at least it used
to be wasn't that good either
yep Kent mentions that in a story yeah I
mean there's look even so I would argue
even now like in terms of stone antenna
technology that it's never been like
cutting edge actually a lot of Android
phones real objects
hmm all right Garrett in the chest as
ten years later has the iPhone
progressed enough isn't that the
question we are working on a timely
point I think we're going to get our
answer in September October 1 you know I
thought I'm prepared and prepared myself
to be disappointed I think we all are I
think it's gonna be it's going to be a
big shift from what we've seen over the
past here you know the rumors I heard is
they're going to add a new port for a
headphone on it oh my god so so Jimmy
don't they're going to call it they're
gonna call it headphone classics I can
market that for an extra $100 you know
what's up there is their problem is when
when the first iPhone came out there was
zero market share they had nothing to
lose so they're gonna go all out right
now they've got it's got a massive
market share they've got a base of
millions of users and when you create
for a base of millions of users you
can't be as nimble you can't take you
can't take these you're totally right
it's just that it's it's a little sad to
see it not only as a tech reporter but
as just like a regular consumer
technology I mean that and and one would
assume that that's how Apple may
eventually someday get beaten out you
know yeah that some nimble competitor is
going to take those chances that Apple
just refuses to oh yeah it's possible I
mean like I don't even happen even
innovations from other phone companies
all the time ran like a wireless
charging mod mods
exactly I mean the problem is they don't
do as well that's the thing is that you
know that killer thing hasn't really
come to the fore quite yet I might argue
that like Google assistant maybe at
least a start of it because boy is
Google assistant way better than Siri
yeah people really start interacting
with their phones in that way a lot more
than that could be a really that could
be something that really hobbles
the iPhone eventually Eli in the chat
says by the way I remember in that the
time mostly everyone agreed that the
iPhone was so limited
they were table specs comparison with a
rock seriously I know what tattwa never
remember that view I don't want to
remember that Oh pretty good line that's
that's rough man
all right we should probably cover a
little bit of Silicon Valley before we
wrap it up for the day I don't know
anything about the show I'm great you
should wash yo I'm it's funny I'm just
slow on all things because you guys can
either elevated but by the way speak you
ladies did you watch glow yet actually
yes I did start glow this weekend I
watched the whole thing to em so today I
did all like I just thought the weekend
watching it was pretty amazing
it is great yeah as a former wrestling
fan pro wrestling fan really appreciate
it like that they actually treated with
respect it wasn't like it was an
afterthought for sure I have a lot of
friends who are interested in that I
don't know much about wrestling I like
Alison Brie I like Marc Maron and
they've kind of given me like a bit of a
precursor education into what it's
really about
yes I know nothing about the history
Connecticut fun yeah it's also do it as
the show goes on I was going to say as
of right now it doesn't it's not that
relevant in the first couple of episodes
it didn't you don't see a broadcast or
anything right right I'll still behind
the scenes yes and it kind of it's like
that for a while but it I love the
soundtrack the eighties music at one
point they incorporate stand bushes dare
from the Transformers movie in a really
awesome way you got their touch
different you got the nudge yeah anyway
Stan Bush song I know all right well
we're gonna talk about Silicon Valley
Oregon Valley I haven't watched well
season and what's going to happen
without TJ I feel like there was a bit
of a reset like we're going almost back
to status quo ya Yin that's right
between uh between Gavin and Pied Piper
right like that's true I hadn't lol
after all they're all the drama
throughout the whole season the arc with
Ganz leaving you know just you've now
set it up for the classic Gavin versus
what's the the main character say Thomas
Middleditch I get a little bit and
remember it's character today right now
right but anyway those are those two
characters potentially fighting it out
yeah so there's I mean the opportunities
for the show to keep going in that
direction and figuring that whole thing
out
yeah be pretty interesting um yeah it's
kind of I just think of they were they
kind of like they were
wait wait should we give a spoiler alert
yeah I mean like yeah my lawyers we're
trying to avoid spoilers I was just
going to say like in terms of his
character it was almost like a pseudo
Breaking Bad transformation like you see
how corrupted throughout the season and
sort of finding a little bit of
redemption there at the end yeah but
only a little
only a little I kind of liked like the
bad version of that guy yeah all right
well it was like as you're watching him
get more corrupted like he was getting
more self-destructive like the same as
Richard Hendricks Richard Hendricks God
why did we brain fart there Richard
Hendricks is here oh yeah that was a
long time do you want to talk about your
your like your interaction with middle
didn't come tune to which by the way I
didn't remember his real name so I
bumped into him at a number then which
language Jenny would shop and I was like
Richard Hendricks what's up which is
probably like really bad to do like I
gonna throw a possible such of faux pas
whenever coming up to an actor and not
even talking calling them by their first
name right I said hi to him and was like
hey I'm with the Mussina you know can I
give you my card whatever it was pretty
lame
yeah appropriate it didn't get it and he
was just as awkward from from the very
little that he actually said he seemed
pretty much just as awkward as he was
did it look like he just wanted to get
out there yeah he did not want to talk
to me and I just kind of lingered as
long as I could and asked him to sign my
sandwich Wow actually it's so funny cuz
I uh I ran into Zach woods
Jerrod like a block away from our office
Briana I didn't I didn't talk to him I
just saw like he was sort of like
staring at a wall or down the floor to
the wall like that sounded rather lame a
sidewalk and it was like shared and then
like I didn't really wanna bomb who keep
really focused on whatever the stare net
so I just walked up yeah yeah I'm just
not in a Russian thing
cool story bro just have you guys and I
read that cool I know sorry alright
