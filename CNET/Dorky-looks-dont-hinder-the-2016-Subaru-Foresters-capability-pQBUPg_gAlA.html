giving coupe styling to their SUVs and
sedans and well even Kunis the 2016
Subaru Forester looks refreshing
wakeboard
during the last recession sumer who did
embarassingly well when other automakers
were flailing I think it's because
people were in a practical mindset and
Subarus are eminently practical most
Subarus get good fuel economy they come
standard with all-wheel-drive
and they have roomy cabins with a lot of
cargo area the Forester in particular
has a straight roofline which makes for
a really open and airy cabin now
Subaru oddly classifies this as a
compact SUV I think it fits a little bit
bigger than that that slots between the
outback and the XV crosstrek in the
range I'm driving the Forester 2.5 eye
Limited which means it has a 2.5 litre
four-cylinder engine under the hood
that's good for 170 horsepower 174
pound-feet of torque it's a modest
amount of power but it gets most jobs
done that's made it to a continuously
variable transmission I find this engine
and transmission combination mostly
livable although under acceleration
here's some rough engine noise now
super-secret sauce is their
all-wheel-drive system the Forester
comes standard with it and it's been a
big selling point for the last decade in
this limited trim Forester I have what
Subaru calls ex mode if I push this
button down here by the shifter that
engages a special traction control
program designed to go slow over
slippery or off-road surfaces I wouldn't
take the Forester Boulder crawling but I
did have it coming down a pretty steep
rutted rocky road and it did alright
from the dashboard here I have the
Subaru StarLink system that's right it's
called StarLink that's a 7-inch
touchscreen here that does navigation
phone stereo and some limited app
integration this navigation system looks
pretty good and on a long drive it was
actually giving me route alternatives
when there was bad traffic ahead so I
like that I've got some limited app
integration here too I've got my iPhone
plugged into the cars USB port it's
running the StarLink app so that gives
me some information functions there like
news plus I have aha
and Pandora it's nice if you used those
services and one more high-tech feature
here that I really like the Subarus
eyesight system up stays two cameras
mounted above the windshield and these
do a stereoscopic image of traffic ahead
this gives me adaptive cruise control
lane departure warning and collision
warning adaptive cruise control system
here I really like how it works really
cool thing is that even if a traffic is
completely stopped it'll bring the
Forester to a complete stop as well
the base bottle Forester goes for twenty
three thousand two hundred forty five
dollars delivers that's what the 2.5
liter engine all wheel drive and a
manual transmission bump it up to twenty
nine thousand six hundred forty five
dollars for the limited edition then add
two thousand one hundred forty five
dollars to boot up CNET style with the
navigation and eyesight package that
comes out to a total of thirty one
thousand seven hundred and ninety
dollars I'm not all that crazy about the
foresters looks but it is a really
practical road trip car an eye sight
system takes the stress off of long
distance driving it gets good fuel
economy and that all wheel drive system
can take you to places than other cars
might not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
