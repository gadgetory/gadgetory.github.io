music I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update bad news for Pandora addicts
the free service is now capped at 40
hours a month so if you hit 40 hours
you'll either have to pay 99 cents to
keep listening for the rest of the month
or pay for a premium account without ads
and that costs four dollars a month but
there is one way around it there's no
limit if you listen from your computer
web browser so it might not be a problem
for people who like to listen at work
pandora is blaming this change on the
increased royalty costs Spotify is also
evolving the service wants to be more
like a social network reports say
Spotify will have buttons to follow
other users and artists it also updated
its iOS app and it announced it will be
available in ford vehicles with sync
applink but you'll need a spotify
premium account with an iphone to use it
and tune in has a new recommendation
feature to an inn is an app and a
website that lets you listen live to
radio stations around the world and it
also placed some podcasts on demand on
the tunein homepage there are live tiles
that update with songs and shows going
on right now based on your favorite
genres the Mobile World Congress the
mother of all mobile trade shows wrapped
up in Barcelona and there are a few
highlights worth keeping an eye on
general motors announced that late next
year GM cars will be mobile hotspots
connected on AT&amp;amp;T 4G LTE network so if
you have a data plan that works with
your smartphone and your tablet
eventually your car will also be using
your data plan your next smartphone
might have a screen made out of sapphire
but it would be sapphire crystal grown
in the lab rather than the gemstones
used in jewelry because that would be
crazy expensive but why you sapphire
because it's the second hardest material
next to diamonds and it won't scratch a
company showed off an iphone with a thin
sheet of sapphire adhered on top of the
screen and our editor Jessica dull court
couldn't get it to scratch after
smashing it with concrete this isn't a
far-out concept sapphire is already used
in the iphone camera lens cover but the
biggest buzz at Mobile World Congress
came from the new operating systems
trying to take
Android Cena editors awarded the Ubuntu
touch tablet as the Best in Show and the
new firefox operating system was the
runner-up Ubuntu was unveiled this week
an editor said it had a slick elegant
interface that makes use of every side
of the screen it puts content and
contacts front and center so you don't
have to keep hopping back to a home
screen of apps but it's so new that no
phone manufacturer or carrier is behind
it yet guess we'll have to wait until
next year that's your tech news update
