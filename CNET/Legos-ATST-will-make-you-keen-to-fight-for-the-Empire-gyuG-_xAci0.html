star wars lego this is the lego star
wars a TST Walker it comes with three
figures the eight EST driver himself the
rebel trooper and Bay's malbis one of
the lead protagonists in the new film
it's very poseable and it shoots let's
build this is actually Bay's malbis he's
got a backpack which is connected by a
chain to his blaster I've noticed that
there are really a lot of special bricks
in this set I've never seen this before
this special ratchet II hinge piece I
have finished the legs aren't they
brilliant it's walking and we've done
some cool stickers
the cockpit of the 80s t is on we have a
lovely stick on display area movable
guns
this is a very good model this 80s di
love the rotating head with a little
knob on the back as you can see he is a
little bit ganguly and a little bit
top-heavy which you may have problems
with and he is balance ball it just
takes a little bit of getting used to
the hatch at the top is fantastic to
reveal the driver absolutely love that
one of the cheaper sets in the new rogue
one series I love the opposable legs the
best you can actually make it walk like
a chicken and you can also use it if you
want to recreate return of the jedi
scenes if you have a little Chewbacca is
you want to pop in there in the meantime
though stay tuned to seen it for much
more
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
