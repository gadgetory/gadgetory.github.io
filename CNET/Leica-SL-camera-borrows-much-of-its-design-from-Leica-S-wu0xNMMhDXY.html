mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera
the Leica SL and while there's a lot to
like about this camera there's some
really annoying aspects to it as well
I'm Laura Green enforcing it and this is
the Leica SL it's certainly one of the
fastest full-frame cameras around and
it's the closest to the speed and
responsiveness of a DSLR that I've seen
going with a mirrorless design allows
Leica to reach a maximum burst of about
11 frames per second though with
continuous autofocus and auto exposure
that tests out to about seven frames per
second for JPEGs still faster than all
of the Sony's but not quite up to the
nikon d750 and the autofocus is quite
fast as well you don't get some of the
size benefits of mirrorless though it's
huge it's not heavy until you add on the
DSLR sized lenses but it has an
exceptionally nice viewfinder it's big
and bright and it has the same novel but
intelligent menu design system of the
Leica s medium format model most of the
design is very well thought out but it
has two real drawbacks one is the grip
which has to be the least comfortable
I've used in years as one of my
colleagues described it you need action
figure hands for it the other negative
is the placement of the front adjustment
dial and function buttons both of which
are set a little too far out for comfort
and while the control operation is nice
and mostly I love the joystick I
constantly press one of the buttons with
my nose when using the viewfinder and
the joysticks a little too sensitive I
kept accidentally moving autofocus
points as for features it really has
about everything you need except an
articulating LCD the photo quality lives
up to the like a standard though you
probably want to underexpose a bit in
high contrast scenes and it's not
obviously better than Sony's the 4k
video is also quite good with a lot of
room for grading if you shoot with
like--is log l profile in very low light
though it's much noisier than even
Sony's
- the question becomes how much is the
better performance and alike a badge
worth to you because those are its two
main differentiators over its
competitors more detail you'll have to
