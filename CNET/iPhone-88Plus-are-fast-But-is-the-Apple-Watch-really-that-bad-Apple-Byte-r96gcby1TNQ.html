to the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple it's the
week of reviews for the Apple watch
Series three and iPhone 8 so let's just
jump in now the biggest talk right now
is surrounding the Apple watch Series 3
which had a majority of positive reviews
but a few pointed out a major issue
where it's LTE connectivity just isn't
good enough when it comes to switching
off from its connection to the phone and
then using LTE the verge is lorne good
says sometimes it took many minutes to
find LTE sometimes it didn't work at all
isn't it quicker I'm service out here
yikes now got to the point where Apple
issued an official statement saying we
have discovered that when Apple watch
series three joins unauthenticated Wi-Fi
networks without connectivity it may at
times prevent the watch from using
cellular we are investigating a fix for
a future software release so Apple is
gonna fix this the question is how long
will it take to get that fix done and it
makes me really wonder did they really
just test this in Apple headquarters and
didn't see this coming at all like this
is new to them now we already know the
battery life is going to be poopoo when
it's only using LTE with a one hour life
for talktime you know what that's
expected but it's got to work on those
small trips to the store or supermarket
or working out and if it's not what's
the point and let's be honest when
mostly you got your first Apple watch
you were playing with it constantly and
touching it so much in the first two
weeks that the battery drains super fast
and then it normalized after it fit into
a normal routine after you got over the
honeymoon phase kind of like in real
life
now I'm getting mine this Friday it's
the device I was most excited about from
the keynote so I just have to find out
how well it really works or doesn't work
for me and just another thing watch OS 4
is a whole lot slower on a first gen
Apple watch just be ready for it it kind
of reminds me of what it used to be like
to get a new iOS on an older phone back
in the day
alright the iPhone 8-inch 8 plus reviews
are in and positive across the board
with the power from its new a11 Bionic
chip true tone display and wireless
charging but the real star is the camera
on the 8 plus and it's really a preview
of what you can expect on the iPhone 10
now we sent seen its own photographer
James Martin out with the iPhone 8 plus
where he took over 2000 photos
James said with a new sensor HDR
delivered better details in highlights
and shadows HDR is always on signaling
apple's deeper commitment to
computational photography with the
iPhone 8 plus that's different from the
iPhone 7 plus which gave you the option
to set HDR to auto off or on and you
know what those pictures do look very
nice now the question is who should
upgrade to the eight or eight plus like
generally if you're an owner of a 7 or 7
plus there's no major gotta have feature
difference to the eight or eight plus so
it's not worth it to make that jump
you should be fixed on the iPhone 10 if
the price doesn't hold you back or wait
until next year's iPhone dosac ease and
really most people have their eyes set
on the 10 but going from a 6s or lower
to an 8 is a big jump that's gonna make
a huge difference so for you that's
worth it but then there's the camp that
just buys the newest top-of-the-line
stuff like me and you know what Apple
likes that group a lot but I did skip
the 4s because that phone was not worth
it at all all right now when a new phone
comes out everyone loves the benchmark
test and I can tell you the iPhone eight
eight plus and tenth absolutely just
destroy anything the Android world has
to offer now you can see the geek bench
for single core score performance here
that hits above 4000 for the new a 11
Bionic based phones and then the
performance from the current crop of
high-end Android phones that's not even
close now let's look at the multi-core
performance where a 11 based phones hit
pretty much a score of 10,000 and
compare that to the multi-core scores of
the best Android phones they have to
offer
again Apple just obliterates them and
the reality is that this isn't an
indication of real-world performance and
day to day use but it feels like Apple
is future-proofing itself and giving it
a lot more room to do a whole lot more
with this new architecture in the future
now applicant Bragg here but when it
comes to Gigabit LTE Apple is a no-show
and they chose not to be able to tap
into the super high-speed carriers are
building into their networks today there
are 10 Android phones on board right now
including the galaxy s 8 then Note 8 LG
v 30 and others that can reach this
theoretical peak
speed of one gigabit per second now
that's fast enough to download a two
hour movie in 15 seconds
Apple confirm they do support LTE
advanced that has a theoretical peak
speed of 500 megabits per second you
know what that's fast but not anywhere
close to a gigabit now carriers are
making a big push for this and we'll see
it being rolled out to more and more
markets next year we know it's not
broadly available right now and surprise
Apple was late to 3G and LTE as well but
this is important remember the modem
Fiasco from last year's iPhone 7
Qualcomm chip can hit the gigabit speed
Intel's current modem chip can't you
might not care right now but you will in
a year or two when your iPhone can't use
gigabit LTE because this is tech that
will actually make your phone faster
later in its life all right if we're
looking forward and beyond iPhones and
Apple watches and to the next generation
of Macs reports from digit times and
patently Apple says Intel has delayed
the launch of its next-gen Canon like
processors until the end of 2018
putting their release a full 18 months
behind their original target now this
will likely have Apple move towards the
less efficient coffee like processors
for the next MacBook Pros and it would
also require them to stick with lpddr3
ramped limiting the memory of the
machines to 16 gigs now that was a big
knock on the 2016 MacBook Pros Canon
Lake supported ddr4 would have increased
that max memory to 32 now Apple could
skip over to Canon Lake and make the
jump to Intel's ice Lake processors but
that would happen in late 2018 to 19 and
there's nothing I can do about it so you
know what that's a bummer
but before we go let's leave on a high
note with CNET's own Scott Stein who's
playing with a new AR kit IKEA app which
is amazing and using it to place a
variety of furniture pieces under ground
at the New York City Subway that's just
great
alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show you can email us at the
Apple bite at cnet.com or tweet me at
brian tom thanks for watching we'll
catch y'all next time for another bite
