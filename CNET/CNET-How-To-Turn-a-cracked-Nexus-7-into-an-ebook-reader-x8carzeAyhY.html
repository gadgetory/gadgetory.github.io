tablet is a fantastic value with it you
can browse the web check your email
catch up on videos play games and
generally distract yourself for hours at
a time
unfortunately sometimes these things get
cracked one bad fall on the screen can
suddenly stop working and for something
that relies entirely on touchscreen
input that's basically the end of the
line or is it I'm Donald Bell and in
this how-to I'm going to show you how to
salvage an Android tablet with a broken
screen and turn it into a dedicated
ebook reader this Nexus 7 is perfectly
fine I didn't break it for the purpose
of this video but I'm going to get this
thing going so that I won't have to use
the screen at all now the first problem
is that your broken screen may be partly
responsive to touch or maybe not
responsive at all so to get around this
we're going to temporarily rig up this
thing we're going old-school USB mouse
you take the mouse you connect up to
this which is a USB OTG adapter you can
find these for a couple bucks online
connect the mouse to the USB adapter and
then connect the microUSB end to your
tablet now you should see a mouse that
you can move around and click and drag
and navigate around your tablet with no
touchscreen required next let's go into
the system settings and make this tablet
easier to unlock without having to swipe
on the screen click the app folder and
locate settings click it and open up
security the first setting here is
screen lock now we're going to set this
to none now this is gonna leave your
tablet totally unprotected so if you
have any sensitive accounts or email
still on here you'll probably want to
delete them the upshot is that you can
unlock this tablet just by tapping on
the wake button no pin number is no
swiping
it just turns on now back to the home
screen you'll need to pick or download
an e-book reader app that you'll want to
use now the key feature we're looking
for from this app is the ability to use
the tablet's volume buttons to turn the
pages instead of relying on the touch
screen now you can do this with Google's
own playbooks app you can also do this
with the Amazon Kindle app
or a more open option you could try cool
reader which is free and supports every
open eBook format Under the Sun now to
get these working the same trick applies
in every case you open up the app locate
the app settings and look for an option
for volume button control make sure it's
selected and then back out to the main
menu find a book that you're gonna want
to read and give it a shot by tapping
the volume buttons once it's working
open up a book that you plan on reading
for a while and then unplug your mouse
because from here on out you can use the
volume buttons to page forward and
backwards and you can use the sleep
button to switch the screen on or off
you'll still want to keep this mouse
around whenever you want to change books
or if you ever run out of battery and
need to relaunch the app so it's not a
perfect solution but at least you save
this tablet from the junk pile so that's
all there is to it hopefully that'll
give you a little more mileage from your
cracked Android tablet for more videos
