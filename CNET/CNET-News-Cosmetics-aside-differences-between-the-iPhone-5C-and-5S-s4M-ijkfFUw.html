casing of the new iphone 5c easily sets
it apart from its shinier sibling the 5s
and we're going to replace it with not
one but two new designs but how did the
two phones differ on the inside and
which one is right for you if you
wouldn't be caught dead without Apple's
latest top-of-the-line phone the 5s
starting at two hundred dollars for the
16 gig model is the phone for you but
don't expect huge changes the 5s is a
lot like the iphone 5 that came before
it with the exception of a fingerprint
scanner and a couple of internal things
otherwise the screen is exactly the same
the look and feel pretty much identical
what you will get an apples premium
model is a fingerprint sensor built into
the home button that simplifies
unlocking your phone and itunes
purchases power users will approve for
the fitness fanatics a motion sensor
that helps track your movement improved
camera features such as slo-mo and a
dual tone flash and a faster 64-bit
processor good news for gamers the lower
end 5c doesn't offer any of these
features but it's a perfectly good
choice for many users the 5c is almost
identical to last year's iphone 5 with
slight changes but most are cosmetic if
anybody has ever wondered what a
mid-range device from Apple would look
like it is the 5c so the big story here
is color and material they moved away
from aluminum and they've gone to
polycarbonate which is a fancy way of
saying plastic the 5s and 5c both sport
and improved forward facing camera all
the better to snap selfies with both
models go on sale September 20th but
only the 5c can be pre-ordered the other
consideration is memory the cheaper
model isn't available with 64 gigs of
storage the 5 c's starts at a hundred
dollars for the 16 gig version there are
also many Android devices comparable to
the iphone 5c including the Moto X and
the HTC One mini it's the same price up
front a one mini is a little bit of a
larger device but they kind of have the
same basic shape they're very finely
tooled so they're both beautiful devices
to look at the HTC One mini is actually
more cream
him and look and feel then I think the
iphone 5c is with a plastic decisions
