Macintosh happy birthday Apple Apple has
reached middle age
the tech giant responsible for the
iPhone and iPad turned 40 on April 1
from humble beginnings in this Los Altos
California garage Apple has become the
world's most valuable company currently
worth 584 billion dollars what is iPod I
haven't had one right here in my pocket
my effect in 2001 the iPod and iTunes
Store helped redefine how music was
consumed then came the iPhone but in the
years following the death of co-founder
Steve Jobs many wondered if Apple could
innovate at the same pace for Tim Cook
it's he's doing a lot to keep Apple
growing in the markets it's always
already in and kind of looking at some
other areas like the Apple watch but he
hasn't really taken Apple into a drastic
new product or done something really
revolutionary in the way that Steve Jobs
did while the iPhone remains a
successful business newer products like
the iPad and Apple watch haven't sold as
well an Apple car could be on the
horizon codenamed project Titan Apple
has reportedly been sourcing test
facilities for the vehicle there is also
areas like virtual reality and augmented
reality I'm sure we're gonna see
something from Apple in this area at
some point it's definitely getting all
the buzz everybody's trying to jump into
it Tim Cook said it's really interesting
and he doesn't think it's just a fad
also in the works is a streaming service
for watching selected channels on Apple
TV but deals with networks have stalled
for now it joins the forty-something
Club alongside other big tech companies
like Microsoft and IBM in San Francisco
