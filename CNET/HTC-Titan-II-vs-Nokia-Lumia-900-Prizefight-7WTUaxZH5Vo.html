and in the smartphone world windows
phone 7 is making a hard charge so we're
facing off two of the best it's a prize
5 punch out between the HTC Titan 2 and
the nokia lumia 900 our judges for this
fight our senior editor dry and boom
boom bennett senior editor Jessica dole
pineapple court and myself Brian got it
going on Tom that will take all three
judges blind scores in average them out
to the nearest tenth each round the
final prize fight score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
decimal system it's five rounds of
ground and pound verse 1 in design the
HTC Titan too has a classy design that
takes cues from its previous smartphones
it features a massive 4.7 inch screen
and the phones curved edges make it feel
slightly more comfortable to hold it's a
great-looking phone but really it lacks
originality now the Nokia Lumia 900
takes a unique approach with its
minimalist polycarbonate unibody design
that comes in different colors and looks
like a piece of modern pop art it
features a 4.3 inch AMOLED display and
it's screen looks great no big surprises
here the Nokia Lumia 900 takes this
round with a 4.7 and the HTC time to
gets a 4 next rounds controls and user
interface both the time to in the Lumia
900 run windows phone 7.5 with a clean
and intuitive UI that's fun to use I'm a
fan of the Live Tiles interface that's
super customizable modern and really
doesn't play copycat to any other phone
OS on the market with bing search
integrated as its own button to access
anytime now the learning curve for
windows phone is somewhere between
Android and iOS so it's a good place to
be now the HTC Titan tues power button
is at the top and it can be a little
awkward to get a hold of because of its
size where the Lumia 900 s power button
is placed on the side now I know you'll
have to get used to it but I like its
placement for these larger phones so i
don't have to shift my hand to reach for
the top the Lumia takes this round with
the four and that's
gets a 3.7 it's after two rounds the
Lumia 900 leads by half a point next
round is features both of these phones
are 4G LTE beasts on AT&amp;amp;T with 16 gigs
of storage the standard Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth support but no removable
battery and no expandable memory slots
which some of you probably aren't too
happy about now the biggest
differentiator between these two phones
is the Lumia 900 s AMOLED display with
clear black technology that has the
lowest reflectance out of any glass
screen on the market and it looks
stellar when you compare it to the
tie-in to the Lumia 900 takes round
three with the 4.3 and the Titan to gets
a 4 next round is web browsing and
multimedia both phones use Internet
Explorer with its hybrid address and
search bar at the bottom it supports tab
browsing and you can pin favorite
websites directly to your home screen
the HTC Titan to makes a statement with
its 16 megapixel camera with a dual LED
flash that's loaded with features galore
and options for burst mode shooting my
favorite panoramas and it also shoots
720p video now the Lumia brings an 8
megapixel camera with the dual LED flash
as well and 720p video that does a solid
job but just can't compete with the
Titan tues features plus multimedia on
both phones looks great with the
slightly smaller Lumia 900 screen
display more vibrant colors when
compared side-by-side ACC's tattoo still
takes this round with a 4.3 and Nokia
gets a 4 go after averaging four rounds
HTC has closed the gap but it's still
behind the final round that decides it
all is performance and value both of
these phones are snappy and the windows
phone 7 you I doesn't feel laggy on
either device call quality might vary
depending on where you are but for the
most part both phones were solid
performers now the biggest difference
here is the value and at 199 with the
two-year contract the HTC Titan two
falls in line with many of the top
smartphones on the market but the Nokia
Lumia 900 said let's just screw it and
brings one of the best values for any
phone on the market today at $99
with the contract and that's just a
great value for the phone you're getting
the Lumia 900 takes the final round with
a perfect five and the Titan to gets a
3.3 so let's average out all five rounds
if you were keeping score the ACC time
to just couldn't connect with any
punches while Nokia's Lumia 900 took the
lead and held onto it with a knockout
punch in round 5 taking this battle 4.4
to 3.9 and is your prize fight winner
the Nokia Lumia 900 is a flagship phone
for windows phone that does the platform
proud but we all know it still has a
long road ahead to prove itself in the
market i'm brian Tong thanks for
watching we'll catch you guys next time
for another price by what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
