smartwatches don't sell there's a brand
new Apple watch yay
that sums up most people's responses to
pretty much any SmartWatch the time has
arrived to dive into the five at number
five small screens how much
functionality can you cram into a tiny
screen let's look at what happened with
phones shall we phone started out with
tiny displays that grew and grew
then smartphones got huge do people need
huge wrist cuffs like Lila on Futurama
not necessarily and that brings us to
number four interfaces aren't there yet
how do you interact with a watch a
series of swipes risk gestures a bezel
that turns to select things maybe you
talk to it all of those are ways to use
smart watches today and that's the
problem there still isn't a great way to
use these things at number 3 battery
life the purpose of any watch is to tell
you the time when you're concerned your
SmartWatch could die on a daily basis
the function of the watch part of the
SmartWatch comes into question at number
two they're pricey smartwatches suffer
from high prices for several reasons
first it's not cheap to put a
touchscreen computer on a lightweight
wrist wearable device secondly it costs
money to make them look not cheap is
there a magic price point for a
SmartWatch where all the flaws can be
overlooked maybe but there's still just
one giant problem there's no killer app
this is the simplest reason why
smartwatches haven't taken off like
smartphones smartwatches
lack a true compelling reason to exist
when the majority of the functions can
be replicated by that other device that
most people carry on them all the time
their smartphone go check out more top
5s at top-5 Genet calm a Maya's act hard
I'll see you online
it's an average it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
