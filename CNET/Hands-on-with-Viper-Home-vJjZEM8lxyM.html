appliances and this is a review of VIPRE
home security system VIPRE home is
pretty similar to the OP link and ice
smart security systems we reviewed
recently except that this starter
package cost 229 and the other two start
at 199 the interesting thing about VIPRE
home though is that it's from VIPRE if
you've heard of VIPRE before it's
actually known as a car security company
I think that's something that really
sets them apart because you can
incorporate home security and car
security now into one handy app the part
you see here in front of me is some of
the starter kit from VIPRE home and some
added accessories the starter kit
includes a motion detector a door or
window sensor and the hub that connects
directly to your router it's pretty
basic if the system senses a security
breach a door or window opening or
motion when they're not expecting it
it'll send you a notification and it
does that incredibly well this DIY kit
is also really really easy to install it
took me about 15 minutes tops to get
everything up and running since this
basic sensor package is 229 I would
probably still recommend uplink or
iSmart
for the starter kits and they're only
$1.99 but if you want added accessories
like the camera the monthly fee for
streaming video and getting
notifications is only $9.99
whereas off link is $19.99 iSmart does
come with a camera but based on our
tests it doesn't perform very well in
addition to the camera you can get more
motion sensors more door or window
sensors a siren and even a key fob to
control things remotely overall though I
think the coolest thing about this
package is the app and then it can work
for your car and for your home it's
really the most comprehensive DIY
security system we've come across
thanks for watching I'm Megan Willerton
