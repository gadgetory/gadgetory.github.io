sending emails to customers who pay for
its G suite services saying a redesign
for Gmail is coming this is according to
multiple online reports Google confirmed
to see net that it is in fact working on
a major update however they're still in
a draft phase Android Authority
published images showing what Google
could be working on the compose button
on the left is now a capsule shape
instead of a rectangle there is a
sidebar to the right of Gmail messages
which looks to have shortcuts to
calendar Google keep and Google Tasks
and emails themselves there are smart
reply features similar to that of the
Gmail app there may be three different
views in the new Gmail default
comfortable and compact right now
Google uses comfortable cozy and compact
views the verge also published its own
images of the redesign and they look
pretty much the same as the Android
authority pics these images show the
option to snooze messages like in Google
inbox you can also see an expanded
sidebar where Google Calendar is visible
to the right of messages that layout
would suggest that you could do the same
for Google keep and tasks overall it
does not look tremendously different
compared to the current version of Gmail
from a visual standpoint however it
looks like it could be more useful
especially having a calendar right next
to your messages for more keep it here
at CNET mi as a colonel see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
