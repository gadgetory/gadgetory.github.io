with the Wii U game we have the first
dedicated screen in the long history of
video games the call today we can see
destiny is independent screen which have
always relied on the TV screen right now
we'd like to make a proper introduction
to the Wii U gamepad itself so let's
start with a quick guided tour the Wii U
gamepad offers simple and intuitive
control the touchscreen works with your
fingertip or more precisely with the
included stylus there's the familiar
plus control pad and a B X&amp;amp;Y buttons
games featuring a deeper more immersive
experience will frequently employ the
left and right analog sticks each has a
button underneath which is activated by
pressing down on the stick on the back
side of the controller are trigger like
ZL and Zr buttons they sit comfortably
under the index fingers when holding the
gamepad
acting as de facto triggers in many
shooting games
the L&amp;amp;R buttons are on the shoulders and
between them is the infrared transceiver
motion control using the accelerometer
and gyroscope is built into the gamepad
as is a rumble feature the built-in
camera and microphone will be used for a
variety of software applications
including voice and video chat
there are stereo speakers a headphone
jack and volume control that can adjust
sound on the gamepad or on your full
screen TV
finally the home button it can suspend a
game to check for updates or connect
with your friends
so that's a quick guide to how you'll
manipulate your experiences now let's
take a look at where those experiences
begin and there's Nintendo Direct over
the weekend mr. Iwata unveiled what
you'll know as miiverse it's how you
interact with your gaming friends and
this is the first thing you'll see on
your TV screen when you turn on the
system you might think of it as Main
Street a place where people congregate
creating constant commotion your own Mii
is joined by others who play on your
home system here two are your game
friends as well as people you've already
met from around the world and also many
newcomers you'll also notice that those
Me's are gathering around individual
tiles you might think of them as
billboards on that Main Street they
represent both your personal tastes and
the entertainment that's trending
globally on Wii U and those knees don't
just congregate they communicate each is
equipped with a wide range of rich media
engagement for socializing and providing
information the first comes in the form
of speech bubbles you can see or send
simple text messages or you can use the
stylus to write your own words and even
draw your own illustrations a lot like
Swapnote you can even share a screen
image from the game you're currently
playing these interactions can also
display recent activity and recent
scores you've even got the option to
display facial expressions within the
bubble that reflects your current state
of mind and because this form of
interaction is browser-based while this
may not be available right on launch day
you'll eventually be able to join me
verse from your Nintendo 3
yes your PC or from any smartphone or
web enabled mobile device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
