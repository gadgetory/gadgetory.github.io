tracking you online I'm Bridget Carey
this is your CNET update firefox has a
new tool to stock websites from spying
on you the internet browser gives
private browsing a boost with a new
setting called tracking protection when
you have private browsing turned on it
means your browser history and your
cookies are not being saved but some
websites can still collect information
about your activity through elements on
the page like advertisements or social
network buttons that means websites can
still create a profile of your habits
but tracking protection mode will block
that information from being collected
you'll see a shield icon when it's
blocking a website from tracking you and
that means certain things on the website
may not load properly some ads may not
show up at all and the site could appear
broken you can turn this off when you
need to if you have trouble navigating
you'll find this in the newest version
of Firefox for all systems meanwhile
Samsung is facing some privacy problems
with the galaxy s6 edge smartphone a
security research team at Google found
some serious flaws in the code of this
Android phone in fact there were 11
security issues in total some made it
possible for hackers to gain access to
your phone if you visited a bad web site
or a malicious app could have gained
access to your private emails the Google
team is working with Samsung to fix the
bugs most of the worst ones have been
patched the findings were published
online and speaking of phones Microsoft
is looking for volunteers to test
Cortana on the iPhone Cortana is
Microsoft's voice assistant on Windows
similar to Apple's Siri and Microsoft is
taking applications for beta testers in
the US and China to use the personal
assistant on the iPhone but it won't
have as many features as it does on
Windows for example you cannot say hey
Cortana to wake it up to start voice
commands on the iPhone at least not yet
back in August Microsoft released the
beta app of Cortana for Android and
here's some news for Pinterest fans get
ready for the app to push you to shop
more on the network the Pinterest app is
rolling out a Pinterest shop page
highlighting items posted to the network
that you can buy directly on the site
from brands big
and small it's rolling out over the next
few weeks pinterest began putting buy
buttons on pins back in june it was
first just for iphones but now it's also
for android users that's it for this
tech news update and there's more at
