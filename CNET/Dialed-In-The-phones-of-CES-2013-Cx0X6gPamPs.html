the dialed in podcast at CES we are
alive here we've got the whole cell
phone crew I'm Jessica's all court
senior editor at cnet joining by Brian
Bennett yes Brian Ben and I also review
phones for cnet com we've got kent
german inland law and what we're going
to do we're going to tell you about all
of the phones that we're seeing here so
basically you guys what have you been
seeing in terms of themes what's showing
well I think we're seeing a lot from
minor players or at least players that
we don't really know a lot about we
don't usually hear about it CS you know
but traditionally it's been motorola HTC
nokia nokia nokia a big thing last year
Samsung we have one from sony ericsson
well to their kind of the same phone and
then we saw a lot from alcatel and
huawei and CTE so a lot of smaller
players that were used to dealing with
in the United States they don't really
have a huge presence with a lot of real
of high-end smartphones but they did
make a presence here definitely what
else are we going to see in terms of the
designs in the upcoming year well I mean
I can say that I've seen a lot of phones
especially leading up to the show that
have flush screens and edge to edge
panels and also a lot of phones with
glass you know back plates which can be
a little dangerous especially the way I
treat my phones so it's interesting
because it's sony ericsson xperia z i
keep on a colony to end for some reason
you know it does have the glass on the
back which you know that came out on the
iphone and that got a lot of you know i
think people now complain but they said
you know it's really dangerous there's a
lot of people breaking it so it's
interesting they made that choice right
because it makes it look premium but
then if you put a case on top of it
you're kind of covering up the thing
that you wanted to see in the first one
case on it because it's just gonna glass
it's gonna break so i don't know what
there's nothing there but it's
definitely gonna fall and it's gonna
break absolutely a lot of other things
that we've seen our colors that's like
really surprising that we don't just see
black and white and with the ZTE grand s
it comes in a lot of finishes there's
like a matte and glossy finish but
there's also yellow red pink and
mint blue and Xperia charger blazer yeah
last night when I looked at the lenovo
k900 which is a new phone from Lenovo
announced yesterday that has a fast
intel processor they had a copper one
and actually you might think it's really
got Ian you know I got just too much
light but it was actually pretty cool i
liked it i don't know but it was sort of
a special version they had to be in a
box and i did get to touch it at one
point but it is one black I've ever seen
a copper phone before diamond-encrusted
yes copper no I would hate for it to
turn green though you know copper turns
green when it's out in the Sun for too
long so anyway but I did like that I
thought it was pretty cool so we're also
seeing a ton of really large screen
phones for example I've got this huawei
ascend mate right yes 6.1 inch screen it
is massive it is the size of my face you
could just put in LeBrons hands to make
it look really small back what is the
word we're not supposed to call it
phablet I like it one of our long it
dialed when we have dialed in podcast
one of our most loyal listeners hated
the word phablet and said that we
couldn't use it but it is kind of a word
though it's but I don't think there's a
better way to describe these things out
there tabloids the phones it's my
favorite portmanteau like the perfect
combination of those words it is quite
perfect I wish I thought of it myself
first I almost did but I think the point
is that we're going to start seeing
these things they're not just going to
be an anomaly anymore they are going to
be the phones that we see on the market
a lot of 5 inch screens a lot of 6 inch
screens 5.5 5.3 and a four-inch screen
or 4.3 inch screen or 4.5 inch screen it
is going to seem a lot smaller yeah i
mean remember when smartphones first
come out you know there were three point
five 3.75 to think how small that is now
I mean that's just soon well yeah the
first many iphones for 3.5 and that was
I I look back on something I had written
in 2007 talking about how that was an
enormous display yes and back then three
was the minimum and now it's sort of
like four is the minimum so it is
interesting right because we definitely
have the touch also high high resolution
so 1080p HD is going to be the standard
for premium phones there were a lot of
them out there they're coming right I'm
not just to mention the grand s again
this is a full HD phone again here are
the colors but this is like the yeah
it's the it's like everyone everything's
look
like a little bit of the Lumia a little
bit but all these colors and it's the
edge to edge screen I are talking about
and it's just kind of big it's really
big but a lot of people like that and
now we're seeing like the original
iphone it's too small so everyone so I'm
wondering why it's taken so long to kind
of cut down on that bezel right a lot of
the times the screens were smaller you
have a lot of housing on the side of it
you didn't have an edge to edge but it
seems like that's something that we
could have had years ago we're only
seeing it now really component the
manufactures are getting better making
components smaller things like batteries
things like antennas I mean antenna you
know usually it takes up so much space
because you sit around all the sides or
it's down at the bottom or maybe it's up
at the top and they're making those
things a lot smaller they're making the
sim card a lot smaller with the micro
sim and the nano SIM so and that of
course helps to make the battery bigger
but a consequence of that also is that
they are able to take that display and
really bump it up and make it nice so
also quad-core processors those are
going to be the new standard for
high-end Android phones in Windows
Phones they just announced support for
multi-core so we're seeing dual-core
with those you're going to see a lot
more quad core nvidia and paul com had
some quad core news samsung also is
developing a chip there's a new player
called mediatek well they're not new to
chipsets but they're new to quad core
they're out of Taiwan so we're going to
start seeing some phones like that too
there's an alcatel phone that was
announced here that is not only the
thinnest phone on the market right now I
think it comes in it for the next week
for the next week it's and then there's
to be something else but yeah it's like
0.25 inch thick it's really really slim
and that also is the first one to have
this MediaTek processor and processors
are important of course because it
matters on how smooth the video you're
watching is or the game they are playing
and how quickly your tasks actually
complete so that's going to be a big
selling point so we've actually seen a
lot of the handsets why don't you share
with us some of the favorite ones that
you guys have seen well the first one I
saw was a sony ericsson xperia z and i
think Brian's got a kind of a special
demo for us here it's pretty exciting
here we go this guy's is the this is the
Sony Xperia Z was announced at the show
here it's actually one of the nicest
Sony phones I've seen a long time
as you can tell it has that same edge to
edge panel here very flat the buttons
are flush with the sides of the phone
and also on except for that at start
back yes that's the power called out
this power button here to you know
highlight it with a you know a big
silver circle I don't you can see that
from here that guy's an audience and
online you probably can't tell but this
is actually a really classy looking
phone with some interesting details on
the edges that you really see it up
close Sony is usually very good with
their displays they always have been and
this is a great example of something
that you really bright really bright
rich and vibrant you know the thing
about display of course is how does
affect the battery life how to spec the
processor but I think this one has a lot
of promise I want to know how this
fishbowl is going to affect battery life
basically one of the features besides
this being a quad-core Snapdragon device
HD resolution screen all that it also is
water-resistant so technically you could
drop this phone into this thing of water
here just like this it's on there it
goes I call it well you know you know
I'm not gonna sit here for like 30
minutes yeah i think we wrote a liver
unfortunately that's true but you know
you can see that it's going to be fine
hopefully there won't be in too many
bubbles coming out of it as it sits
there so we can take it off green still
on screen still up on everything
basically this is water resistance not
waterproof but it's supposedly will you
know can survive a little dunk and
that's good especially if you know
judging how many people actually use
their phones in the bathroom which you
know i'm not admitting i'm just saying
that people just maybe not in the pool
though if you drop it in the pool you
might have a little problem you don't
want to go diving with it you don't want
to go snorkeling this snap phone you
don't really do much with it underwater
anyway so that's true yeah listen to me
as I can't make a call I've stream your
fish encounters what about Lynne I'm Lou
you away I have the ZTE grand s right
here now the specs are very good for ZTE
phones I mean it has a quad core and a
5-inch screen it's nothing that we
haven't seen before on other phones but
this is high-end when it when it comes
to ZT it has the whole new realm or
they don't usually go for the highway
yeah it's a in the u.s. it's usually
known for the the mid to entry-level
phone send them metro pcs or cricket or
additionally other prepaid phones and
small android phones but that's right
like this yeah this is like in the fray
for the for the high-end phones in the
US and there is no carrier announcement
yet and there isn't oh sorry there's no
carrier announcement or pricing but as
you can see it has a really nice screen
and it ZT put on its users user
interface there it's called me favor
usually we see like a really skinless
kind of Android experience this one is
running jellybean so it's so you do know
it is running like a recent version of
Android and it's just really a really
nice phone on the back there's a 13
megapixel camera which is you know
really high and yeah and this basically
it so it's really good it's it's a
unibody construction so it's very solid
and if we get an availability on that
one I don't I can remember um it's going
to come in China in the first quarter or
either the end of the first quarter the
beginning of the court the second
quarter and after that it's going to hit
the US but we don't know when that will
happen what was the thing they said
during the press conference about
traditional Chinese design like there
was a release before that came out and
said that it was going to show like the
traditional chinese style and we didn't
know what that meant and so later went
during the press conferences said that
they were inspired by chinese like
traditional Chinese ink colors for for
the colors of the phone so mystery
solved I guess yeah but I would like to
see a document written in right if I see
like an ancient Chinese scroll in pink
and yellow like call me and let me know
because that'd be really good I'm so
actually you brought something up the
camera megapixels we are seeing a lot
more of those too not just eight
megapixel cameras but 12 and 13 and just
because you have the megapixels doesn't
mean that your photo quality is going to
be good either because there's so many
things that go into actually making
quality photos or imaging there's the
lens size all of that good stuff really
quickly this xperia z also has a 13
megapixel camera and it also has a
backside illuminated sensor so it has an
HDR mode that also works and while
you're shooting video as well as taking
stills which is something that's pretty
interesting to see I don't think
other phone that I know can do that
right now yeah thinking about it's
interesting about the megapixels is that
is think that something's creeped up as
well used to be I was working at seeing
it when we had the first 1.3 megapixel
camera so i know old dates me but you
know there was all vga and then we had
the first 1.3 and it's like oh my god
that's so cool and then it came out with
two and then that was the minimum and
now we're really up this high I you know
do you think at this show we saw a lot
of you know what's happening in phones
right now it's just a little bit that
feature creep where features are kind of
being thrown in the phone there maybe
not really tested there maybe not really
work all that well and they certainly
have nothing to do with making a call
which of course is what a phone is all
about do you think we're seeing back not
anymore no that's like a tertiary
feature now I know making call is but
did I didn't seem like a lot of these
phones had features that we really
haven't seen before true i think that
most of the time what we're seeing is
sort of everybody kind of coming up with
the new standards in the new high level
and status quo here at the show we don't
get a lot of time and we definitely
don't get the lighting to go out and
actually test things like the camera so
uh all of that comes later when we can
actually take it back to the offices and
get some real hands-on time with it so
right now the specs sound good but what
is that actually going to do when it's
in your hand performing it that's what
we find out after CES and that brings me
to a phone that really grabbed my
attention it is called the yotaphone we
have a little bit of video and that's
not yo da right it's not a star wars
reference it's actually yota I got it so
there's a Russian company yota devices
and they make this its prototype they
just announced in early December what is
so interesting about it I don't have it
on the stage but I do have the video and
the video is playing now is it's got
android on the front looks like an
Android jelly bean smartphone very
high-end specs you flip it around to the
back and there's an e-ink display and
it's that's the technology these on a
kindle exactly so it's sort of like a
paper display it looks really
monochromatic almost like faded
newspaper stuck on as a sticker it looks
really bizarre but the concept is really
cool and it's interesting to me because
this is something that nobody else is
really working on nobody has really
thought to do this that could be a good
or a bad thing in the end
but the idea is that it's really low
power so if you're running out of
battery or if you want to conserve your
battery you can sort of put the thing
that you want to look at all the time on
the back like a map or maybe it's a
picture of someone or a boarding pass
makes sense to me too because a lot of
times you want an e-reader just for
reading books in direct sunshine you
know you can't do that with a lot of
these tablets or larger phablets or
whatever you know it's hard to read on
vacation so this way you can actually
have two devices in one and it seems
like it doesn't look very much thicker
than a regular phone right i mean it's a
little bit thick but it's not super
thick it's no thicker than the thickest
out right now I think fan of that eating
technology bit fortunate probably I
going to see the phone for a long time
right well it's supposed to come in the
back half of 2013 to Russia first and
then other markets the company is in
talks with US carriers but it could end
up being vaporware it could end up being
terrible in real implementation but
what's exciting is that they're doing a
lot of things and they're adding other
design elements to that nobody else is
really trying and so they are going to
kind of push this forward I think other
people other companies are going to see
their design and start thinking more out
of the box so that we don't get a lot of
phones that are beautiful but all look
the same we will get something different
something we just never seen before
which we always like right we love it so
what about phones that do we see
anything here that is actually yes it
will come to the United States or you
know like we will actually able to hold
it in our hands in the next year yeah so
I've got some of these Huawei phones
here this is the huawei ascend w1 in the
US it will just be called the w1 it's a
windows phone it's in fact their first
windows phone 8 device really colorful
might remind you of some other phones
that are out on the market looks a
little like a Lumia don't you think and
therefore also like the HTC windows
phone 8x but it is it's a really
nice-looking phone and I think this is a
trend that we're seeing is that windows
phones are going to be colorful bold
statements that's kind of where they're
going right now it's just a tile
interface in a way so exactly so um and
we saw the Samsung a TV Odyssey that
wasn't a phone that was announced here
but it was actually announced it a wind
a microsoft event in new york in october
but is rising in cisco oh that's right
Verizon's second
bright windows phone right um or third
even but it was really to win verizon
and early samsung windows phone as well
so that's something that we're going to
see here we've got to go soon but let's
talk really quickly about what we didn't
see well phones from the big players but
you know Mobile World Congress which is
a huge trade show coming up in February
in Barcelona these three will be there
and we expect a lot lot lot from that
show sore a big phone mobile fan check
back for our coverage then of course and
so we are going to wrap it up right now
