tour dates why don't you just carry me
around
hey there I'm Meghan Willerton Perseid
appliances here in my house with the
unified computer intelligence
corporations ubi now EB is short for the
ubiquitous computer when I think of that
I think of something that could automate
your house answer questions for you
basically be a Siri for your home plus
some automation goodies thrown in there
too for example you can pair it with
your smart things hub and other
connected accessories it works with nest
and Belkin Wemo products and as far as
helping with home automation and that
sort of thing it does a pretty good job
for example I used a Belkin Wemo switch
and hooked it up to a space heater I
have in my living room and I can say
okay Ruby turn heater on that didn't
work for example I could say okay Ruby
turn on heater and my heater just turned
on actually you probably can't hear that
but it's in the background there you
might have to try a couple times for
word to hear everything but generally it
does a pretty good job with that kind of
stuff as far as a search engine though
it did not do a great job
what time is interstellar playing in
Louisville Kentucky
it was 4:40 p.m. so as you can see there
it pulled keywords but it didn't really
answer the question I had for it that's
kind of how it generally works as far as
a search engine
I wouldn't expect it to return accurate
results I wouldn't really rely on ubi
your soul search engine this is $299
that is really really expensive for
something that isn't a ubiquitous
computer not really so overall if you're
interested in voice control and you have
three hundred dollars to spare this is a
fun semi novel product it can help you
automate your home but sometimes it even
gets that wrong thanks for watching be
