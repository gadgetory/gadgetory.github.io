it's another battle of the cameras not
much has changed from the s8 plus to the
s9 plus but the camera is a different
story
Samsung has raised the bar on smartphone
photography with a variable aperture and
super slow-mo feature on its s9 but is
it enough to outshine the iPhone 10 and
claim the crown as our camera King I
took these giants up to Lake Tahoe in
California to see how well they can
capture the snowy mountains an ideal
light there's no question these guys
take incredible photos and videos you'll
know slight differences in color
temperature and texture depending on the
screen you're watching this on but at
least to my eyes there is no clear
winner video on the s9 plus has more
contrast and saturation with greater
depth and sharpness the iPhone has a
softer brighter look and may come across
as a bit flatter they both have optical
image stabilization on both lenses and
video looks smooth even when I'm panting
up a snowy mountain chasing my pup
they're both good at keeping focus on
the subject but the iPhones may look a
bit steadier while the galaxy did a
slightly better job at smoothly adapting
to changes in light they can both record
up to 4k at 60 frames per second but
you'll have to take our word for it
because we can't actually play it in 4k
what's unique about the s9 is that it
has a variable aperture in low-light it
gets wider to let in more light and in
bright light it becomes more narrow in a
professional camera you can adjust this
manually and it's what our pupils do
automatically vs9 can only choose
between F 1.5 and F 2.4 but the fact
that it even has the option is a pretty
big deal in a phone it's constantly
guessing which one to use for what shot
and can produce a wider range of results
the iPhones aperture is fixed so it's
relying on image processing and shutter
speed to adjust to different lighting
conditions and shots look more
consistent across the board in this lake
shot the s9 plus looks a bit softer
while the iPhones has more contrast in
texture
but in this shot of the snow the s9 has
the higher contrast even though both
were shot at the more narrow f2 point
for the s9 plus also lets you pick the
aperture in Pro Mode switch between the
two and adjust a bunch of other settings
to get more out of your shot so you'd
probably use Pro Mode when shooting a
subject that's actually standing still
this was shot using Pro Mode on the
galaxy s 9 and this one was shot on the
automatic mode on the iPhone 10 as you
can see the galaxy s 9 blurred out the
background behind me it also lets you
adjust the white balance and the
exposure but when you're out and about
you probably don't want to bother
messing around with settings and that's
one of the problems with the
super-slow-mo feature on the s9 it's not
exactly straight forward and 960 frames
per second it is much slower than the
240 frames per second on the iPhone 10
but it doesn't shoot in Full HD and it
doesn't shoot the entire clip at this
frame rate once you hit the record
button on the phone it decides when to
switch on the super slow-mo feature
based on the movement in the shot
and it doesn't always get it right it
would start it too early or too late and
there's no adjusting it later but when
it does get it right yes nines is way
more dramatic than anything you'll get
on the iPhone the iPhone 10 is just
point and shoot
that's it the entire clip can be in slow
motion if you want it to be because you
can even edit it later the s9 also has
this option but it's buried in the
settings
and what about the other lens both
phones have a second telephoto lens with
similar specs for optical zoom and
blurred background portraits at 2x both
produce great results but if you zoom in
you'll notice the s9 plus is sharper the
iPhone 10 has portrait mode and the s9
plus has live focus similar to what we
saw in the note 8 and neither is perfect
at figuring out what to blur but in
general they both do a good job at
portraits colors on the iPhone seem
cooler and the shot is more true to life
because it retains a lot more detail in
the face while the s9s appears to be
more flattering because it makes faces
brighter and evens out shadows and skin
tones but sometimes all the retouching
can backfire and in this photo the s9
applied the same filter on my face as it
did to my son and while he looks fine I
look yellow the s9 plus lets you adjust
the blur while you're taking the shot or
after and I ended up using it a lot more
than the lighting effects on the iPhone
and if you're a fan of selfies both
phones have portrait mode on the
front-facing cameras as well the iPhone
10 has a depth sensing camera which is
slightly better at figuring out what to
blur in the shot but they're using
software so they're not as great as
using the main camera the s9 also lets
you do a wide-angle selfie but for video
it's the opposite and the s9 gets a
little too close for comfort
testing out the front camera of both
these phones Lake Tahoe
but when the Sun goes down is when the
s9 plus really shines the wider aperture
allows it to let in more light without
sacrificing detail and picture quality
both did well considering how dark it
was but in this shot of the lake there's
a no competition the shot on the s9
looks smoother and brighter while the
iPhones looks darker and a bit grainy
err and once you zoom in it's even more
obvious the s9 is still able to capture
some detail in the trees and the smoke
out in the distance while the iPhones
looks like an impressionist painting
with blobs the galaxy also did a better
job at evening out the lighting in this
cabin shot the cabin on the iphone looks
blown out and the supplies to videos as
well but the differences are not as
great
yes nines look slightly sharper and more
saturated but the iPhone definitely
keeps up photographing subjects in bad
lighting is tough on both especially if
there's movement the s9 plus still looks
brighter but it's blurry and the color
temperature seems off same goes for
video colors on the iPhone seem more
true to life but the shot in general
looks darker but when the subject is
still like this shot of Charlie the s9
pulls ahead the colors may be more
realistic on the iPhone but there's a
lot of noise in that shot and you can
barely see the pup and for food shots
it's impressive
even in this dimly lit restaurant it
managed to capture a lot of texture in
the onion both phones have their
strengths and weaknesses colors on the
iPhone seems slightly more accurate and
portraits more true to life but the s9
plus is a lot more versatile and is the
clear winner in low-light at least
low-light photos at the end of the day
you've got to ask yourself what you're
looking for in a camera the galaxy s 9
plus is not quite a DSLR level yet but
it definitely gives you more control
over your shot and if you know what
you're doing you can make it look even
better but you can't go wrong with the
iPhone 10 it gives you great-looking
results and it does all the work for you
so let us know what you think in the
comment section below
and what else you'd like to see the s9
compared to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
