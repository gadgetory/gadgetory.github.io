and is HBO now growing too slowly I'm
just akahlar filling in for Bridget
Carey this is your cnet update after
what was mostly a stagnant earnings
report released yesterday twitter is
having major issues convincing Wall
Street it's the real deal most
discouraging Twitter can't grow its user
base that number has not moved since
last quarter for hot Manju of the New
York Times writes that Twitter needs to
reconsider what kind of company it is
maybe it's not the blockbuster Silicon
Valley powerhouse that Wall Street wants
it to be but perhaps it's not meant to
emulate the googles and Facebook's of
the world instead Twitter is more like a
public utility a news wire a
transcription of the world manju doesn't
say Twitter can't make money but maybe
normalizing expectations is the first
step in bringing the still great service
back down to earth HBO now the ala carte
fifteen dollar a month streaming service
has seen a slower-than-expected adoption
rate it's been a little less than a year
since the platform debuted and analysts
had projected subscriptions to be close
to the two million dollar mark but in
reality about 800,000 people have signed
up for the service but on the flipside
800,000 signups is nothing to scoff at
HBO CEO Richard plepler says the numbers
remind us that HBO now was only
available on Apple TV for its first
three months remember that also HBO now
isn't really available on as many
devices as you may think especially game
consoles it's yet to hit the ps4 or Xbox
one which actually make up twenty
percent of HBO goes audience an HBO
still has tons of new content coming
through this year including shows from
Jon Stewart Bill Simmons and a daily
news program from vice and finally
comcast is trying to preemptively warn
potential Google Fiber customers in
Atlanta to quote not fall for the hype
and a flyer posted by a Reddit user
contest is trying to compare their
internet service with Google's but as
some reddit users pointed out a lot of
these bullet points come with
significant caveats for example
Comcast's festus home Wi-Fi claim leaves
out the fact that anyone can simply buy
a faster router and pair it with their
Google Fiber service now Google Fiber
offers gigabit internet at seventy
dollars a month where Comcast's to
gigabits per second service goes for
three hundred dollars a month with a
thousand dollars in startup fees so yeah
I'd be passing out flyers to that's
going to do it for this tech news update
