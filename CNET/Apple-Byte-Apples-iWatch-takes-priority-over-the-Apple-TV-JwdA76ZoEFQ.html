the Apple Viper everything good and bad
inside the world of Apple and our
contest winners at the end of this show
now we all got a little surprised when
the iPad Mini with Retina display popped
up on Apple's online store a few days
ago at 1201 a.m. on tuesday which
honestly is way past my bedtime now
current wait times are around one two
three days for the smaller capacity
Wi-Fi models and five to ten days for
the 64 and 128 gig models and also
cellular models right now now we've
heard all the stories about low
production issues and delays due to a
possible burning issue with sharps
displays according to Korean website
eTnews and that's not a website about
aliens now let's tear down from I fixin
reveals the internal upgrades we know
about with the a7 processor that appears
to match the one point three gigahertz
processor in the iphone 5s instead of
the 1.4 gigahertz processor that's in
the ipad air the 2048 x 1536 resolution
display used from this initial launch
batch are from LG with a significantly
larger battery that supports the retina
display and offers the same roughly 10
hour battery life also according to
Geekbench 3 benchmarks the ipad mini
retina brings five times the performance
compared to the original Mini which is
just a huge jump so get them while
they're hot if it's worth you know 399
bucks to also an Apple TV news according
to report from NPD DisplaySearch apple's
long-rumored TV plans which are far from
being concrete do to hang up with
content deals have been pushed off to
the side with the rollout of wearables
being a higher priority right now now
I've been saying we'd see an iWatch
before an Apple TV because of these
dynamics the report also says Apple
appears to be lining up resources for a
television product introduction in the
second half of 2014 with two to three
large screen sizes and 4k resolution but
again the hangup has always been the
content also KGI Securities analyst
ming-chi Kuo who you know always likes
to get his name and a story agrees that
due to difficulties in establishing an
apple TV supply chain and locking down
content deals with the cable operators
he believes the TV project will be
delayed to the end of 2015 or early 2016
at its earliest and you know I'm still
waiting to get smell-o-vision by then
I'll write in i watch rumors the Korea
Herald reports that NPD DisplaySearch
also believes that Apple's wearable i
watch product would come in a 1 point 7
inch screen size for men's watches and a
smaller one point 3 inch screen size for
women but what about the woman who wants
a big watch or the man with skinny risk
that wants a tiny watch and what's an
apple bite without an iphone rumor
according to a Bloomberg report Apple is
developing new iPhone designs including
get this bigger screens with curved
glass and enhanced sensors that can
detect different levels of pressure now
their source says screen sizes of 4.7
inches and 5.5 inches on the works
something we've seen over two years ago
but I so don't get the real need for a
curved screen and unless you want a
bigger bulge in your pants so one zippy
order date alright let's get to the
quick bites Apple has launched a new
page on its itunes store for American
Red Cross donations that will go
directly to relief efforts for victims
of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines now
one hundred percent of the donation goes
directly to the Red Cross and you can
donate as little as five bucks so I
really encourage you to give anything
you can to this tragedy overseas now
let's shift gears a little bit and if I
told you two companies are back at it in
court who could they possibly be well if
you guessed Apple and Samsung you win
after a judge in March invalidated
almost half of apples 1 billion dollar
verdict in their patent infringement
case a retrial is taking place now to
see how much Samsung actually still owes
now they're still on the hook to pay the
big a roughly six hundred million
dollars bocina reports Apple told the
course recently it still wants an
additional 380 million dollars in
damages just slightly less than the
original 410 million how nice of them so
let you know the final decision whenever
this case gets resolved alright here's
some eye candy for you Apple has shared
some additional renderings of their
proposed Apple
campus to spaceship that the city of
Cupertino gave its final approvals for
last month we've seen a lot of the
exterior but new renderings of what it
might be like working inside especially
with this modern cafeteria or check this
out the lobby of the auditorium building
that looks like it could really be the
command center when the campus needs to
take off now my favorite here is this
blurry girl who really gets around the
campus like a lot and who wouldn't want
to drive into an underground parking lot
that looks like a spaceport that's
awesome all right finally let's get to
our winners for the two copies of NBA
