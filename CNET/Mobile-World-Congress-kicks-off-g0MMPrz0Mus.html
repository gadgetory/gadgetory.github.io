Carey on cnet com and it's time to get
loaded this week will be jam-packed with
smartphone and tablet news as mobile
world congress one of the biggest
smartphone trade shows takes place in
Barcelona Spain before you buy a new
smartphone this is the week you pay
attention to what's coming down the line
throughout the year the takeaway so far
the carriers are lumping phones into
similar families all with hard to
remember one letter names HTC introduced
three smartphones under the same
umbrella name the HTC One there's the
One X the 1s and the 1v all at the
latest Android operating system and all
focus to shine around the camera music
and HTC Sense interface the new HTC
Sense four-point-oh is a more toned down
version than the previous HTC Sense the
one family also has a music hub that
pulls in all music apps into Beats Audio
the camera app has new filters and scene
modes along with better panorama shots
there's no pricing or availability yet
but it's expected the one family will
see release within the next two months
ad and C will sell the HTC One X and the
one s is coming to t-mobile sony has its
own family smartphones is calling Xperia
NXT smartphones the Xperia P and the
Xperia U which joins the already
announced Xperia S the S is the high end
of the product suite with the P and you
are more the lower end not sure what
their brand new teen was thinking when
they named them p you but now that NXT
line has products for every price point
the experience p big feature is called
white magic technology which makes the 4
inch screen easy to view in direct
sunlight no word on cost or when they
will hit the US market but the one phone
that is really standing out is the
samsung galaxy beam which has a built-in
projector at the top Cena editors say
the projections look good at first
glance in a dark room it could mirror
anything on a phone screen but Samsung
seems to be targeting this to younger
consumers who want to share photos and
videos no word on pricing and
availability but expect to land sometime
in the second quarter in mobile payment
