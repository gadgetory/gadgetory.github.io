and documents just to print them out
from your desktop you need air print
it's an iOS feature that lets you print
directly from your device to your
printer without any cables see I can hit
print on my iPad and once it connects to
the printer what was previously on my
screen will be sent to my printer just
like that it really is this easy but it
does require some setup depending on
your printer the setup will vary so the
first step is to find out if your
printer is natively AirPrint compatible
Apple has the complete list of
compatible printers on its support site
so browse through that list to find out
okay if your printer is AirPrint
compatible like this epson here the
setup is really simple start by
connecting your printer to your Wi-Fi
network that's almost always done on the
printer itself so I'll choose my Wi-Fi
network and then I'll enter my password
hit done and the printer will do the
rest
I know it's connected because of this
indicator light here and this symbol on
the screen here ok that's done now grab
your iOS device in this case it's my
iPad and connect it to the same Wi-Fi
network as your printer so I'll go to
settings Wi-Fi and select the same Wi-Fi
network you might already be connected
to the network but double check just in
case as far as the setup that's all done
to show you how this works though I'll
open up one of my notes pick a note here
tap the action button which is where
you'll almost always find the print
button hit print and as you can see my
iPad already found the printer but if it
doesn't show up just tap that printer
field and select your device from the
list all that's left to do is to hit
print the tablet and the printer will
connect and my no prints almost
immediately
now that was super easy because this
printer is air print ready but what if
yours isn't the good news is that you
don't have to buy a new one all you need
is a program called fingerprint and it
works with mac and Windows it is $20 but
that is still a lot cheaper than buying
a new air print ready printer and
there's a free version so you can see
how you like it
finger print basically makes it so that
your iOS device can see your printer as
an air print device ok launch the
program and in this sidebar you'll see a
list of installed printers check the one
you want to use with your iOS devices
that's it now make sure your computer is
connected to the same Wi-Fi network as
your phone and that your printer is on
from here it works just the same as any
other air print friendly printer so
here's the note I want to print I'll hit
the action button hit print my printer
shows up in the print dialog so I'll tap
print and here comes my note so now that
you can print wirelessly from your iOS
device you no longer have to go to your
desktop to print things out and it makes
printing event tickets photos and notes
that much easier if you have any
questions hit me up on Twitter and check
out how to see Netcom for the full
written tutorial for CNET I'm Sharon
