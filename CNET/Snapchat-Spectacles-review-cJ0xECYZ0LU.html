with a camera they are super easy to use
you push the button to record a
10-second video and there's a live so
you know you're recording and they
actually look pretty good on most people
what's even cooler is what the video
looks like when you put it on snapchat
but when you explode it it's circular I
don't know very nice
so there's a lot of hype about them but
what does it actually like to snap hands
and phone free jasmine or green tea
parent process is really simple and
transferring footage is quick and works
pretty seamlessly most of the time so as
I'm sitting here importing all the snaps
you probably notice that I've got an
external battery pack because it is
absolutely draining in the battery when
I import them all snapchat is all about
the filters and you can still put
emerging these geo filters and text on
there spectacled snaps and check out
this little trick
what I don't like is that even though
you can use all the filters and geo
filters that you like you can't do the
face filters we put funny effects on or
you can't do the creepies everything
that I love about snapchat taking
selfies does take some getting used to
or you have to hand off your spectacles
to a friend so in sunglasses they do a
pretty good job of blocking alive
there's a weird kind of tint on them so
it's really orangey but these guys paint
block your peripheral vision so much
even though you feel like an idiot
wearing them at night and indoors the
low-light video isn't too shabby and the
audio is good not great
sunset end of the day we've done a full
24 hours of sheeting with the spectacles
and I've only had to put them in the
charge in case probably two or three
times plus I left it overnight but at
the end of a full day of action shooting
I still have four full charges left in
the included battery case so it
definitely will last you the whole day
we just watched a beautiful sunset
and I'm talking to you very kind of
feels really weird because I'm like I
know I'm talking to you but I'm also
talking to myself it's very strange</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
