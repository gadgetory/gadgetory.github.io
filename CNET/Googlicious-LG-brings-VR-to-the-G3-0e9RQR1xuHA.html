well to the Google Isha's for everything
Google that we can pack inside of a show
let's get to it and the LG g3 is going
3d now LG announced a new virtual
reality headset for the g3 that will
work using Google's cardboard VR
platform and compatible apps
LG's own headset will be made out of
plastic VR for g3 will roll out this
month for anyone who purchases a g3 in
select markets but it did not specify
how existing owners can get one of their
own if they want in on the virtual
reality experience now the VR headset
will also include a free download of
Robo literation it's a bit of a surprise
announcement and after seeing the
popular response to what Samsung is
doing LG is making sure they are keeping
up with the game alright you will no
longer need an invitation to purchase
the oneplus one phone because they're
making it a little bit easier to
purchase it for the public every Tuesday
of every week moving forward you'll be
able to purchase the one phone for a
24-hour period without an invite so now
we have Jordans on Saturdays movie
premieres on Fridays comics on
Wednesdays and the oneplus one on
Tuesdays
now oneplus also recently released their
latest over-the-air CyanogenMod 11 s o5
q update with its most notable
improvements bringing the SwiftKey
keyboard as part of the experience and
max audio by waves which brings enhanced
sound performance for deeper bass and
clear highs for their platform we also
showed you a picture of the rumored
three colors of the new samsung galaxy
s6 and now our friends from scenic korea
have posted this image that showcases
the s6 and several different variants
now this isn't new for Samsung but you
can see an end style version laying flat
in the front and if you look closely to
the phone standing up next to it it also
has an edge revealed that's on the
opposite side which could indicate a
dual edge design for one of the models
there's also a standard s6 which is on
the far left a varus branded version
next to that and the remaining phone has
a thick of metallic bezel that could be
a more rugged
active lifestyle version now the
unofficial invite still looks like it's
for a fork but it also matches the
design on the side of the edge so we
will wait to get an official word and
another google event is happening this
week with Mattel and the googs sending
out an invite for the event titled view
what's possible that's a reference to
what looks like an old view master toy
and for the kiddies who don't know what
a view master was please see this for
reference see now you know now we're not
exactly sure what Google and Mattel have
in store or if it's piggybacking off
their cardboard platform by creating
apps for kids but we'll find out on
Friday the 13th and the heads up for
everyone that owns a chromecast Google
is giving owners of their streaming
stick a $6 credit that can be used
towards any movie on Google Play this
week it appears that not everyone is
getting the promo so you'll need to fire
up your chromecast use your browser and
check out the offer section to see if
you get it and if you do it's the
cheapest Valentine's Day date you'll
have all year and you could thank me
later all right that's gonna do it for
this week you can always email us at
Google issues at cnet.com or tweet me at
brian tong thanks so much for watching
it we'll see you next time for some more
of that Google issues
you delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
