widely available today but i got an
early review copy of microsoft's
productivity suite so you can check it
out right now i'm jason parker fresita
and this is a first look at microsoft
office 365 home premium it's important
to note that I'm only scraping the
surface of new features in the interest
of time with the tiled interface of
Windows phones and the Metro UI design
and Windows 8 it's clear Microsoft is
trying to reinvent the way you interact
with your software now with office 365
home premium Microsoft is also
reinventing the way you interact with
your office suite in fact i'll be
demonstrating the new features in this
video on a samsung tablet running
Windows 8 it's important to note that
you can use office on desktop computers
with all the same features but for the
full windows 8 experience we're going to
see it on the Samsung tablet now let's
check out some of the new features I'll
start with the well-known word
processing software microsoft word
immediately upon lunch you'll notice a
new start page here you'll be able to
open recent documents you have worked on
or you can choose from several templates
word remembers what templates you use
most and will display relevant templates
at the top the recent documents in
templates start page will also show up
in excel and powerpoint now open a demo
document i made you'll notice the
somewhat controversial tool the ribbon
is still here but the buttons have been
flattened for a more simplified and
minimalist look not a fan of the ribbon
not to worry to get a cleaner view
simply touch the small arrow on the
right to get rid of the ribbon if you
need it back for heavy editing or other
more complex word processing tools just
touch any of the tab headings at the top
to bring it back you can then pin it
open using a button on the right or let
it collapse again when you're finished
now let's have a look at PowerPoint
right away you'll notice a similar start
page with recent presentations on the
left and several pre-made themes to
choose from on the right once in a
presentation powerpoint offers all of
the features you've grown accustomed to
in previous versions but adds several
more all of which you can use with a
touchscreen or desktop interface another
new welcome enhancement in PowerPoint is
the presenter view now when you're
presenting with a second screen like a
projector for example you'll now have a
view on
your computer that offers
behind-the-scenes tools so you always
know what's coming next you have full
control over your slides here and you
have other useful tools like a laser
pointer to point out specific items to
your audience you can also have notes
over on the right to remind you of
topics to cover during your presentation
all these tools are hidden from your
audience as your presentation plays on
the projector in Excel Microsoft has
added a number of new tools to help you
visualize and interact with your data
one new feature that illustrates this
concept is the addition of recommended
charts rather than having to build a
nice-looking chart from scratch you can
highlight your data click a small tab
below your selection and Excel
automatically lists out recommended
charts also extremely helpful are the
quick previews of each chart type so you
know what you're going to get with your
selection that's all we have time for
today but the new office 365 home
premium also includes updates for access
publisher outlook and OneNote it's clear
from the features I've used that
Microsoft is going all in on the touch
screen interface and it looks like they
did a good job making it work on the
desktop as well in the end we'll have to
wait and see how users respond to the
new style of using Microsoft Office i'm
jason parker frisina and this has been a
first look at office 365 home premium
