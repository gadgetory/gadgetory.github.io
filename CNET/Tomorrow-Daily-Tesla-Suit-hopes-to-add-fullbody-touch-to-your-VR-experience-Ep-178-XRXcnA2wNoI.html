to show that drones can be beautiful and
the Star Trek replicator has become a
reality and it's like a consumer the
consumers can get it - so that's weird
and also a virtual reality accessory
that is kind of like a suit that gives
you haptic feedback we're gonna tell you
how it works just don't get shot Samar
Daly
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in their universe I'm Ashley
Skylar Jeremy's always kill anonymous
one of the best how's it going one of us
it's great yeah it's like we're gonna
actually talk this time instead of
yesterday we were like sup yeah I like
how our small talk today is talking
about yesterday how we didn't talk on
small talk yep that's right good and
that's it let's hit the headlines okay I
gotta tell you about this crazy virtual
reality accessory this is pretty cool so
there's a UK company called Tesla
studios no relation to Elon Musk's car
and battery company they are making what
they call the Tesla suit and I thought
at first this is sort of like a Faraday
cage like suit where you have the chain
males know this is a virtual-reality
suit this is a suit designed to give you
a full-body haptic feedback experience
in a virtual world meaning you put these
things on you put these little sensors
on these modules and as you're walking
around in virtual reality you can not
only touch things in virtual world
virtual things can touch you so that's a
little bit scary that's a little bit
awesome a little bit awesome as well
it's a scare sighting um and so okay it
starts off with the T built so you got
this built and there's all these
different modules that go on different
parts your body the t belt is the main
control unit it is wireless it connects
to pretty much everything like PC
console smartphones VR headsets all that
stuff Wow this is these are all the
different modules they have so you can
see there's two are two modules on each
arm two on each leg and then the belt
and then the gloves the t glove so the t
glove provides haptic feedback for
touching things so reaching out touching
stuff and you can see how it works is if
they also do things like heat they can
heat up or cool down so if there's cool
air touching you like they'll cool down
these like these bands will cool down
and it will also do things like track
muscle movement temperature posture also
machine washable for those of you out
there looking for something something
convenient you clean it very easily and
then the the bands for the arms and legs
you can also use for motion capture
motion capture systems various points
that deliver range of blows and heat so
let's say you even grass brush up
against your legs and Fable you're in
this virtual fable world ok well then
you'll feel light kind of haptic
feedback well let's say then maybe you
go over to Call of Duty and you get shot
in the arm you're gonna get a much
stronger feedback on that arm so it's
gonna like hit you you're gonna feel
like you got hit by something just kind
of crazy unfortunately each piece will
be its own module and each module be
sold separately
so they're not going to sell it as like
one big piece and the first modules will
hit the market this year they're saying
they want to do it this year crazy no
word yet on pricing or specific
availability dates or which modules will
launch first maybe they will only do the
belt and then the other bands will come
later or maybe they'll do them all once
we don't really know so their websites
up and like I said it's like
all-or-nothing with this but here's the
you know here's somebody using one of
the bands and and it does seem to be
kind of working and that's the Oh
balloons popping okay so like you're
gonna kind of feel that as you like pop
the balloons and stuff so I thought this
was a really fast that is a huge bound
by by far I mean you remember that we
covered a story where this people made
this mask that you can smell in virtual
reality we're like this is a future but
no this these people are like you're
gonna put you inside of it and you're
actually gonna feel everything yeah and
that's really cool I'll wireless so
pretty neat um
which brings us to our hashtag of the
day which is TD Tesla VR I want to know
like are you in on this are you gonna
use it I feel like this is something I'm
looking at that I feel is really cool
but I'm like I don't know if I'd buy
that why not well I guess I'd have to
see what the games are like in virtual
reality first so you're basing it on
nothing well I mean I feel like I'm
hedging my bets a little bit and that's
fair that's a fair assessment
I'm ahead you better okay
this is an awful lot like ready player
one and I keep bringing that up that
it's and it was about full and complete
immersion and if we're gonna do virtual
reality might as well right I mean this
isn't gonna make you bleed if you get
shot it's not gonna like you're just
gonna feel it and it's gonna be I mean
if you're going to be doing virtual
reality might as well go full immersion
that's all I'm saying and this is
awesome I hate that it's all separated
and then you have to buy a piece by
piece when you said it I felt like it
was just gonna be one suit when I put it
on it was that Lara Croft yes okay then
I would know I want this oh come on
don't know I thought they're gonna yeah
I thought they were you know what I'm
gonna do I am going to buy you this for
your birthday next year and I'm gonna
everything was like two days ago I know
that but I'm gonna have it sewn into
like a morph suit so you can just put it
all on that's what I'm saying it and
that's what is it sewn into a suit like
yeah just listen guys Tesla studios if
you're watching this here's our
suggestion do an add-on for a bite like
a bodysuit so just so uh in all the
things and then like or have like little
like pouches on each of the armbands
stuff where you can like slide it in and
then slide them out and wash them that's
my that's my idea you can have that I
want it so that's that's the Telus would
we wear this thing yeah what are you is
this how about what would you want to
experience in the Sun and these Tesla vr
so hashtag TD Tesla VR yeah would you
want experience what's the experience
Barcroft done it's already done you're
gonna be able to do that you're in go on
a date with her we go see a bad movie
and we both hate it and the date goes
poorly and we break up it's a whole
cycle that's a cycle of life don't be
sad my even my virtual life sucks no all
right the Star Trek replicator so you
thought that was so you like future
stuff well I got another story for you
because this I want to tell you about a
little device called the genie okay so
the Star Wars replicator can you
describe the Star Wars replicator yes
Star Trek Star Trek Star you started and
it's a little device and it has these
like it kind of it's a little bit like
the Jetsons and with like you know where
you put in this little like pot or you
get food anyway Oh meal so this device
called the genie is basically that if
you think of like the cure eggs that you
may have in your house you put a little
coffee filtered thing at you and then it
shoots the hot water through it well
this kind of runs the same exact way you
put a pot a pot in as freeze-dried food
and then it creates a full meal in like
30 seconds oh yeah so what's great about
this app of a great about this device is
it works with an app okay so that you
can control it from an app and there's a
lot of ways that you can kind of tailor
it to how you live your life so if you
don't like glue if you're like allergic
to gluten or dairy or egg free like
they'll build it around that and it kind
of learns to the point that it will
eventually the genie will know your
microbiome and will prepare food for you
directly that's creepy
so that's that's what I like this what's
okay there's ramen chocolate souffles
there's a lot of stuff that they're
developing right now they're preparing
for mass production already there's no
price or release date yeah but they said
it's gonna cost like a couple hundred
bucks okay that's not terrible yeah 200
bucks for a Keurig that's not bad at all
and yeah they're saying that the the
pods that are coming with it will
actually be like comparable to an actual
meal so the price baguette II will like
be comparable in price to you think you
know the pot of spaghetti so I guess the
only thing we're missing here is how do
they taste
because it sounds like an amazing idea
and I'm totally in on this like I
totally want to do this I love this I
think this is very Jetsons like the food
replicator in Star Trek is like food
synthesis it like synthesizes items
anyway my question is this like they
show in this video from Reuters and
that's where we found the story Reuters
so Thank You Roy ders they show this
video and they show these like plated
dishes yeah the thing is is in this in
this little pod that's not the case
you're not gonna be able to pick out all
the things and put it on a plate so it's
just gonna be like a pile of mush kind
not unlike Willie Wonka and the
Chocolate Factory where's like you eat
the gob stock or do you eat the gum and
it like gives you all the meals but it's
just one piece it's like mush but it
tastes like that plated thing this is
just this is just a fancy way of doing
microwave dinners this is really all day
it's just tapas just eating up your food
in a little bit just putting it in a pod
and making it and another thing is this
is but I don't know if you've ever heard
of MREs the military use these things
is ready to eat and basically they have
a pouch of food then they put it in a
hot water packet for I'd say about five
minutes and pull it out and they had
their little mushy food that's all this
is so this would be a really good thing
for like emerging markets I mean if they
could keep it cheap like this could be
something really cool and also I mean
college students let's talk about that
like this is something I see in a dorm
room yeah I put your little curiosity
that's why I think it would be work best
as is like people that don't know how to
cook and people that don't have a whole
lot of time to cook and that's
especially why I think it's important
that they have the dietary and gluten
stuff because if you're busy and on the
go a lot of the time you don't you can
only eat like fast food and like junk
food and don't really have time to eat
healthy so ya know I like it for as far
as the health benefits so there you go
all right but we'll see there's still
there mass-producing them we'll see how
much it cost if it tastes good so
senator I like it try it out I like the
genie okay I want to tell you about
Dancing with Dancing with drones which
is a little short
that kind of short film I guess so Cole
Mott robotics wanted to show people that
drones do not have to necessarily always
be associated with surveillance and
military use they wanted to show that
drones could potentially make something
really beautiful and they did that with
dancing with drones which this is really
cool that's great so this comes from
choreographer nina cove and some
biological physicists there are seven to
ten automated drones they are autonomous
drones I'm sorry completely non
automated they do not have any
pre-programmed routes and what they do
is they respond to a human dancer on the
ground outdoors so they take these
drones outside this guy's dancing and as
he's dancing he has a wearable that did
that he's wearing that communicates with
the drones as they dance which sort of
makes him like the leader of the drones
and so he's the spinning and stuff and
so then all the drones are going around
in circles a mate so they made this
system that basically tells the drones
this guy the data the main person with
the wearable on is is one is a drone
like they're they consider through the
computer that he is a drone like that's
what they the drones are set up to
believe and so beyond
that beyond it just being like sort of
the beauty of drones and being able to
kind of show off this technology one of
the other things they're doing that the
physicists are studying multiple drones
in the sky and how they interact with
each other because they think that at
some point there's a very high
likelihood that we would have multiple
drones in the sky all at once from
different parties and they want to make
sure that like you know they can study
sort of how they move in the sky and
relate to each other and kind of send
each other data and things like that so
I thought that was really cool it's it's
a super short story it's not anything
like super deep or you know but anything
that's like oh this goal is like in the
future we're gonna have like drones that
are your friends that dancing it no
there's no that it's just they wanted to
show that drones could also make
something very beautiful and artistic
and also it doesn't hurt that they get
some data about multiple drones up in
the sky what do you know it was just
some guy that had too many drones well
there was really dancing I mean no but
it what it was it was cool except for he
was a little D got a little too much
into it let's say it was your dancer you
got a commit and that guy committed he
was they kept please yes please send us
your a drone interpretive dance so but
that's cool that's a cool way to test it
that is a largest acquitted festival
artistic way to test it also I mean it
looks beautiful it's R it's really cool
to watch I just really enjoyed it so
that's it for our headlines we're gonna
be right back with Mod Squad which is
kind of like an artistic mod school I
don't know I cut it's a stretch this
week I'm sorry like I really liked this
I don't want to show it off so and then
we have of course your user feedback
finally about Nintendo and there are
theme parks okay um and and then we have
of course our photogra for the day so
don't click away it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we have
returned it is a Wednesday which means
we like to talk about modifications that
people make and and the cool things that
come out of them so this is mod squad
such a good graphic if you spot the
mistake you win a high-five from us uh I
gotta tell you about mark Hagan Geary
he's better known online as the paper
dandy I don't know if you've heard of
this no I haven't I love that name
delightful the paper dandy he works in
an art form called kigurumi I don't know
if you ever heard of this which is I'm
sure you've seen it online if you are of
any if you love looking up really cool
stuff
Kurumi is cutting out piece one sheet of
paper into a beautiful 3d sort of
portrait and this guy made his favorite
scenes from Star Wars these are made out
of single sheets of paper and he cuts
out the shapes and then folds them up so
that they make this sort of 3d landscape
he did all of these scenes on each scene
is on one single piece of a4 so it's a
little over eight and a half by eleven
inches and yeah look at that he cut that
out and his only tools are an exacto
knife a metal ruler and a cutting mat
that's it and so he wants I said I
figured this was kind of a mod squad
because he's modifying paper I'm like
he's mining right yeah yeah so he he
back likes them he has these really cool
art exhibitions he's been doing this for
a very long time like this is sort of
his thing and and so what he wants to do
right now is cut scene which is the name
of his new exhibit this is the start
looking Jabba's bar like unbelievable
just so freakin cool how great this is
and he wants to make this an exhibit
that travels around he's looking for
funding so of course he's on Kickstarter
and as of right now he was pretty close
like I want to say he was within a few
thousand dollars I'm getting fully
funded but I mean God what what an
amount of work that went into this I
can't believe I mean this guys are so
talented it's amazing and yeah he's like
I'm not not officially affiliated at all
with Lucasfilm I'm not making a profit
on this like this is basically the
funding is just to take the project out
and show it to people and go on a little
tour my god that is amazing unreal I
can't even think it's time to make a
paper airplane that's cuz making Star
battles I know he's making Jabez 35 I
mean I would love to see those actually
I hope he take gets to take it around
yeah he's um he's in the UK and I like
I'm hoping that maybe he brings them
he's able to bring in the states with
the yeah the Kickstarter funding so but
like I said he's got I think he's got I
wanna say last I checked is like three
three or four thousand dollars left
she's asking for around 25 grand can you
see him like board the plane would just
like a stack of papers no I never my my
art this is my art whoops the mouth yeah
amazing so yeah it's just super cool
great work paper dandy you are fantastic
and we love what you do I just I thought
it was amazing I love the video too
okay guys we finally are gonna talk
about the Nintendo theme park and your
thoughts on it it is time now for user
feedback so many good ideas like blowing
my mind making me crazy I love all of
them let's just call up Universal and
implement them all immediately
Joe wrote in and said hidden coins
around the park that can be collected
and used the blade classic Nintendo
games on an arcade near the food court
oh nice
boom love that okay you could even do
that with like an AR game looks like
coins are on the park you'll collect
them that would be pretty fun to have an
arrogant thing Neal wrote in and said an
extreme f0 Racing roller coaster two
cars jump sloop SuperSpeed and vomit
bags I think you would definitely need
that yeah I don't know but I didn't
survive on f-zero very often so there's
a lot of deaths to the death toll they
just put the instead of you must be this
tall to ride it's like instead of a
million burger served they're just like
this is the tips for x0
today's death tolls they keeps going up
this encounter Martin wrote and said
this is my first tweet but a mix of
practical first-time tweet but it makes
a practical effects a are to take to
Hyrule from The Legend of Zelda see
that's cool I like that everybody's
using the AR yeah like AR and I love
this idea of roller coaster that sort of
changes like once a year like the a are
changes and like you can so like Legend
of Zelda you could do a great Legend of
Zelda pass
and then a couple years you'd switch it
to the new Legend of Zelda game yeah
that would be pretty awesome Joseph
Thomas wrote in and says Star Fox our
winged assault think of the Rip Ride
Rockit roller coaster with a VR display
and way more barrel and he's gonna say
barrel rolls in there so what's that and
also I mean instead where you just are
good to be a barrel ride and they're
like hi starfox and you just like her no
barrel roll but I was that got me
thinking like you wouldn't even have to
build a full roller coaster if it was VR
you could just put in like Star Tours
you have the simulation you're right
just have your VR headset and you look
around during the ride and stuff and it
would just be you just be in a little
simulator yeah or they could go the
route of like the Buzz Lightyear ride
and you actually have to shoot down
enemies and stuff like that and it's fun
to pretend and then hear do a barrel
roll and it feels like you did a whole
barrel roll and you're like shooting oh
they'll be so amazing okay and then
Justin a lastly wrote in and said a
starfox single-seat roller coaster in
the cockpit of an arwing that has
screens to make you feel like you're in
the game yeah I'll have that screen
little screens the stuff you they touch
everything so yeah really good oh and he
said also make it with four different
roller coasters weaving between each
other so you can have four player co-op
great fries good point good point
excellent excellent choices guys so you
guys really kind of crushed it on this
one so great of course we knew that yeah
we knew you guys would do it and of
course because we're all done with user
feedback it's time for our very last
piece which is our phone time for the
day
I can't wait for next week because I've
already picked out a couple of the font
ography pictures and one of them in
particular I'm just so excited for you
to see okay this is actually from Ashley
so great name Ashley says hi Ashley nice
name well thank you
after I came home crying from the first
day of school and said Ashley was a
girl's name mom said boys were spell le
why I'm beginning to believe I've been
duped
you weren't it Ashley I swear it used to
be a boy's name it's just we got I'm
sorry girls took it over I took this at
semaphore Beach Adelaide Australia it's
the last commercialized beach before
industrial ports and it's set around the
northeast corner of the city it has an
old-timey low-budget cinema waterslide
mini-golf and restaurants I live 20
kilometres away but there's a 90
kilometer per hour expressway going to
it from my house took this on an lg g3 I
feel as bad about a bridge shot as some
people should feel about Instagram
filters Cheers
ash I like this guy I like yeah I like
this is a great picture gorgeous
beautiful thanks Mona go I've never been
have you been Australia no I'm scared of
giant spiders giant spider yeah there's
a lot of deadly things in Australia that
that aren't pictured in this but they're
right behind the camera yes I'm
underwater about to come after Ashley
yeah no but it's a great photo I like
the color filter a little often look I
like that you didn't Center that bridge

redeem it for you Ashley by the way I
think when you like once you get older
like having Ashley his name is awesome
like it's cool it's pretty great like as
a kid I'm sure it's like hard because
you get made fun out yeah but it's a boy
named Sue type of thing but it's like as
you get older pretty great like your
name a dude like a grown up dude named
Sue it really is all I've heard that
song but he was angry even until he got

pretty cool name it was a guy's name in
Gone with the Wind
they made him tough right yeah do you
think Ashley's tough yeah well she lives
in Australia is still alive guys gotta
be tough probably riding a spider right
now lassoed on ceman spider he rides it
around he takes that that expressway is
actually for spiders it's not for cars
it's a 90 kilometer an hour spider
