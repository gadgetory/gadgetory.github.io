Origin we're getting ready for new
Shepards ninth mission to space the
clock is at t minus 16 minutes and 40
seconds to go until liftoff this is not
actually the first time that we've done
an escape test on new Shepard October of
2012 we did a pad escape test or we
simulated a failure on the pad then
fired the escape motor that's 70,000
pounds of thrust it's a solid rocket
motor it fires and then as soon as it
has completely burned out there then we
release the drugs and then the mains
completely successful test back in
October of 2012 we followed this up in
October of 2016 where we tested the
solid rocket motor the escape motor
in-flight at max Q when it was the which
is basically the most stressful
aerodynamic point in the flight for the
rocket again perfect test the capsule
came back down softly under the
parachutes
additionally we actually recovered the
booster we weren't expecting it because
that's not exactly what it's designed
for but we brought back the booster and
now she is sitting pretty in retirement
in Florida at Cape Canaveral in our
rocket Factory now a big difference
between those tests and today we're
gonna have manikin Skywalker on board
today there he is he's going up for his
third flight to space he will be
collecting some very important astronaut
data for us that we're gonna be
crunching there we go it's all chilled
out relaxed in his reclined seat there
little does he know we've got a pretty
intense day in store for him all right
thanks everybody for joining us live for
new Shepards ninth mission to space this
is actually gonna be the third time that
this rocket and capsule have flown to
space but it's the ninth mission in the
whole entire test program
see - one minute and 40 seconds to go
the gantry is retracting there go the
fin checks
there goes the engine gimble check you
can feel the excitement down here in
Texas at this point let's turn it over
to Mission Control okay I'm ready for an
exciting ride manikin Skywalker - ten
nine eight seven six five four command
engine start -
go baby go a beautiful liftoff of our
new Shepherd rocket here from West Texas
listen to that beat III engine whore you
can follow along as she gains speed up
to space in your top right corner of
your screen bottom left follow along it
with the altimeter you may have seen we
started about 3,600 3,700 feet
that's our altitude down here at our
West Texas launch site 90,000 feet and
climbing thank you again for joining us
for this live test of our new Shepherd
rocket we are within seconds of this
exciting escape test we'll be firing the
escape motor in the crew capsule about
20 seconds after separation of the
capsule from the booster there goes the
escape motor the crew capsule has
blasted away from the booster as planned
let's see how the reaction control
system on the base of the capsule reacts
we want to stabilize the capsule prior
to it reentering the atmosphere for a
nice smooth landing back here home
alright the next step here the drag
brakes are going to deploy you'll see
the speed of the booster reduced
dramatically and that is before the
engine restarts for nice soft landing
and relight
and touchdown welcome back that is the
third trip to space and back for that
rocket just another day at the office
all right and there is the crew capsule
the drogues have come out excellent sign
there go the mains slightly reefed and
they will go to full inflation gorgeous
and look how stable the capsule is after
such an extreme event up there in space
mannequin is ready to come home
he probably peaked at about 10 G's or so
but you know what that is well within
what humans can can take especially for
such a short spirit of time and in those
reclined seats it's just important that
we bring the astronauts home safely
500 feet
and touchdown absolutely beautiful
welcome home new Shepard what a test
today Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
