receiver you would have quickly noticed
one thing most of them are both huge and
kind of ugly it seems you have to pay a
lot more to get something both sleek and
that performs well but not so with the
Moran sonar 1506 this is a slimline
receiver which is half the height of
competitive models and still has a lot
of the bells and whistles you'd expect
from a modern unit power handling is a
little down on what you'd expect a very
conservatively rated 50 watts into each
of its five channels but it should be
plenty for most home cinema speakers as
it's only a 5.1 receiver there is no
Dolby Atmos or DTS X as it lacks height
channels but I don't think these will be
missed unlike the last 1504 which didn't
even have wireless this model goes all
out with both Wi-Fi and bluetooth with
this comes Spotify connect airplay
Pandora and streaming from DLNA as far
as connectivity goes it has six HDMI
inputs which are compatible with 4k
video sound quality is exactly what we'd
expect from Marans with an excellent
music focused sound but with enough guts
to power a home cinema convincingly well
you can get better home cinema
performance for the same money you
choose morality if you listen to both
music and movies equally and 499 dollars
there is very little else out there that
can worry the feisty little NR 1506 and
only the most power hungry users may
want something a bit better this is ty
