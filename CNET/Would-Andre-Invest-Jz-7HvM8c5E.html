with you to wrap things up we're going
to call it would Andre invest because we
know your investment I see guys so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to throw
out some of these some of these maybe
rejects some of these might be products
that exist first one is called the bark
bath portable dog system to bathe your
dog anywhere anytime with virtually no
mess it's kind of like this steam
cleaner system is 109 it's for dog
owners and dog lovers do you want you
wants to want to see what it looks like
or not a pit fan see how I've made that
brought in setting like dogs didn't say
I didn't like cats I just and I'm not a
fan of pets the thing is the dogs / he
really get wet it doesn't make it at me
but why would you take it anywhere I
don't know why you like you just take
your dog out my car I take a bath right
now or like how about this you want to
brush your dog in like maybe in the
kitchen and living but if they don't
have to jump in the tub it doesn't get
all bubbly you want to see what this
looks like it will still stay at home
what's quite a bit being portable there
you go that's what I'm asking you you
know would Andre invest now our pan the
only because I'm not really in the pits
next up this is a social media app it
catches moments as they happen that
disappear after 24 hours as filters like
silly add-ons that you can turn your
face into a dog or a clown would you
invest you know I'll be honest if I
heard that I probably wouldn't matter
you know yeah we're like a lot of
athletes have conversations yes sir and
no we just gonna text through this app
and then it's gonna be gone after you
read it so I will understand that I
would invest in that right away okay
here we go icon this is the product name
icon the world's first smart condom it's
a ring that fits over a condom to track
exercise thrust calories burned average
skin temperature it can detect some stds
seventy four dollars retail price would
Andre invest I've already read about
this with Andre that's a really good we
had a really good conversation about
this so could it be reused I think it
can cuz it's a ring that goes over oh
god it's not like it's not good
disposable thing I mean I would invest
you were never run out of min next one
we got to golf ones because you know you
know you like your golf game not dirty
but the name of the product is called
the tittle it's a golf swing analyzer it
mounts on your golf clubs senses your
swing without the ball calculate scary
distance various attributes of your shot
without actually making contact with the
ball you just put this like adapter on
your club would Andre invest we're not
invest you gotta continue to grow to
game of golf first I'm not optimistic in
the golf equipment plus I have all those
gadgets in I'm an avid golfer like you
have to be a big offer to buy these
products and there aren't too many of
you is Andre a basketball player or golf
or less we realize not at all watch and
play yeah straight off the course all
right last last thing this is a fun game
it's called RP golf like RPG like
role-playing game think of it as a mix
between zelda and a golf game so
basically like I'm gonna just I gotta
pull this up to show you basically like
you're playing a video game like it's a
golf course but while you're navigating
this golf course you'll come across
dragons and monsters oh wow when you
fight monsters
a lot going on I wouldn't invest because
I feel like you know most mobile games
the ones that are very attractive or
addictive it's like week when you can
compete for play with other users and I
don't see how you could you can interact
with anybody else with that game it just
be you and fight dragons get lost have
like a you get lost like the nintendo
feel old nintendo fill tool or atari
yeah I play the target that's a long ago
too so no I went out of this okay Andre
