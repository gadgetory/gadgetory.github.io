the apple byte for everything good at
bad inside the world of Apple let's get
to it and follow-up reports by The Wall
Street Journal and others confirm Apple
is indeed working on an electric vehicle
of their own with hundreds of Apple
employees working to design an
apple-branded minivan like electric
vehicle under the code name project
Titan yes the apple mini van the van for
everyone now this is a serious project
for Apple that was approved by cook in
2014 an apple vp of product design and
former ford engineer steve's adess key
is reported to be heading the apple cart
development now when the world hears
news like this everyone has a reaction
including former General Motors CEO dan
akerson who said about the apple car
project they have no idea what they are
getting into and you know he has a point
he adds they better think carefully if
they want to get into the hardcore
manufacturing we take steel raw steel
and turn it into a car now this smells
like history repeating itself when a
market that Apple wants to get into
feels threatens immediately criticizes
them and warns them of the difficulties
Apple's not fazed by this at all and
clearly it didn't stop Tesla and yes for
everyone in the YouTube comments that
love saying this the Apple car will come
loaded with Windows all right Apple pay
support continues to roll out after
adding 19 new banks this month bringing
the total to over 80 financial
institutions even Samsung just acquired
mobile payments company loop pay to get
into the game so what's apples next step
well taiwanese rumor site apple club
which has a solid track record claims
that touch ID is coming to max this year
and will enable Apple pay functionality
they report the upcoming 12 inch retina
macbook pro air and future macbook pros
will integrate the component above the
standard trackpad because of the lack of
space on Apple laptops for a dedicated
touch ID sensor they also report for
desktops like the imac mac pro and mac
mini touch ID will be enabled by the way
of an upgraded magic mouse and magic
trackpad now yeah this sounds like a bit
of a stretch without a doubt Apple
at least thinking about it touch ID on
the desktop primarily would be best for
unlocking your computer and great for
password management even more than Apple
pay transactions so we'll wait and see
an apple watch news a report from The
Wall Street Journal claimed several of
the original health features apple hope
to incorporate were dropped due to
consistency problems the report said the
bake a originally featured sensors that
measure the connectivity of skin to
detect stress levels and heart rate
monitoring similar to an EKG and also
experimented with blood pressure
readings but ended up having to scrap
them because of inconsistent results
depending on how tight the watch was
worn or how dry someone's skin was or
even how harry they were a real talk you
know fanboys would be getting bikini
waxes on their wrists just to wear an
Apple watch now the features were
dropped and that's why it pretty much
gathers all the same info any other
wearable Fitness band does right now we
know the watch is coming in April and
the Wall Street Journal report also says
Apple will make 526 million in the first
quarter half of the units will be for
the Apple Sport Edition one-third will
be the middle tier stainless steel ones
and the rest will be the 18 carat gold
ones which some are projecting to be
apple's most expensive product ever
alrighty news from patently Apple Apple
has been granted a video headset patent
in really who isn't doing one these days
in the patent Apple would provide a
video headset frame that allows a user
to slide an iphone or ipod into it to
watch video there would also be a
picture in picture mode feature so you
can check on your actual surroundings in
case you get caught up watching a movie
in public with the headset on and you
would also get alerts or notifications
for things like messages and emails the
system appears to have some physical
controls or a remote but also could be
controlled via Siri so get ready guys
and gals the future is now and Apple has
also been awarded a patent from their
primeSense acquisition for a 3d virtual
keyboard that would enable users to type
in air now a 3d capturing device with
multiple cameras would be able to detect
the user's hand movements and then the
user would be able to type and control a
virtual keyboard by using their fingers
no apples application would have to
feature cameras accurate enough to
detect subtle fingertip movements for
this to work so we've had the
guitar for years and guys have been
getting girls with this go to move well
at least I have there's even a world
championship competition for this
yeah you didn't think I'd prove it huh
and coming soon to a home near you the
air keyboard all right in some fun use
if you aren't a fan of modern family by
now you've got to check out their
februari 25th episode titled connection
lost where the entire episode happens
from a mac OS 10 yosemite desktop and
yes they fake some effects to make it
work properly but even cooler the entire
episode was shot with apple's iphone 6
and ipad air 2 tablets now the format of
the show was inspired by a 17 minute
short film called Noah that took place
entirely on a computer screen Apple and
ABC's parent company Disney are tight
friends disney acquired pixar in 2006
and SJ sat on the studio's board a
director so clearly there is some
cross-promotion back scratching going on
here but it's a cool idea either way
alright you can email us at the apple by
the cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong
and i'll respond when i can thanks for
watching in I promise my voice will
return next week for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
