welcome to tomorrow daily Club ASCII
talk-show in the known universe I'm
Ashley skele and this is our temporary
set while our new set gets built but for
now Komatsu is one of the largest
construction companies in the world and
they're facing an issue that may affect
the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games they don't
have enough workers to operate heavy
machinery so they're turning to drones
to guide their robotic bulldozers and
stuff the service is called smart
construction and because of Japan's
aging population meaning less
able-bodied people to operate heavy
machinery
Komatsu devised a way to operate those
heavy machines by remote-controlled
drones who map out work areas and update
them in real time as the bulldozers and
other vehicles move dirt and other
debris around a site Komatsu still needs
a couple of people on the ground to
ensure that they can handle problems if
they arise or if anything needs to be
fixed but those people don't actually
require the same kind of training a full
blown machine operator would need in
addition surveying sites with drones
dramatically decreases the amount of
time it takes to complete the mapping
and also drops the margin of error
considerably so while Japan still has an
aging population and that's going to be
an issue going forward it's pretty
awesome that Komatsu's answer to that
problem was hey let's just throw a bunch
of drones or robots at it and see what
happens okay so going from one olympic
city to another there's a pair of VJs in
Rio de Janeiro Brazil who are coming up
with new and interesting ways to show
off both their audio and visual
techniques yoga Merida and ceci sula
Waga designed and assembled these
amazing trikes that they call suave sea
clothes they're packed to the brim with
features like high-powered projectors
laptops batteries and speakers and
they're all rolled up into a boxy mount
set on top of each one of the tricycle
frames and what they do is they go
around and they play music for everyone
in the vicinity and while they do that
they project beautiful high-quality
animations on to nearby surfaces and can
even manipulate them to conform to
building edges and other environmental
features in the area apparently they
have been doing this for the last year
or so and I've taken the suave sea
clothes through play
like Russia Germany and Switzerland but
honestly this is the first time I've
heard of them and so now I want them to
come to Los Angeles and show off their
super skills with their suave si clothes
so awesome all right very last headline
and then we'll get into new releases we
have to talk about the electrical
engineering professor who created a
bikini that absorbs pollution when you
swim in the ocean this swimsuit is
called the sponge suit bikini so here's
the science behind it the material the
suit is made of is called sponge and it
consists of carbon material that's light
flexible and can absorb just about
anything up to 25 times its weight
except water which makes it a great
material for things like cleaning up
spills and also desalination add sponge
to a 3d printed frame designed by Eric R
bajo and architecture and design firm in
Istanbul and voila a beautiful
cool-looking pollution absorbing bikini
the material is relatively cheap to
mass-produce and poses no harm to the
wearer since sponge traps contaminants
inside the materials pores and doesn't
get let out unless it's heated to a very
high temperature so space-age and
honestly that suit is super fashionable
I mean I would wear it so great work
science all right guys let's check out
our new releases
this week's new releases include Yoshi's
wooly world for Wii U on October 16th
