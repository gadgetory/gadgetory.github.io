coop but your spouse reminds you we're
not going to be lifting babies and seats
across the back of a two-door let's
drive the 2012 Infiniti g37 sedan
touring and check the tech let's face it
a G coupes a gorgeous car the G sedan
not so much it's not infinities fault I
mean there's only so much you can do and
you've got to create full-size access
doors back here but the whole thing
basically goes to Helen gets tubby in
the rear when they add the extra doors
it's just life in the design studio and
it's not the most spacious car in the
back either it's not bad it's not
terribly good and I haven't been a big
fan of the latest redesign anyway which
made it less edgy and more kind of
bulbous and round but what really
matters is what goes on inside let's
check it out now there's 2012 G is
basically a carryover from 2011 but let
me refresh you about the cabin text
because it's one of the better cars in
the industry for that especially
considering it's you know pretty much
down low on the Infinity lund here is
our standard interface but it has
optional navigation so you always get
this color display you always get this
infinity controller and that'll let you
access a lot of settings audio a climate
vehicle set up but the navigation part
is optional and that includes a hard
drive when you option that in I'm not a
huge fan of the navigation map quality
it's a little childish looking a little
bit grainy that they have done quite a
bit to improve it in the last couple
model years but it's still a bit of a
torture to read I mean do you really
want to read Folsom Street with the
characters laid out like that
it's just bad cartography I think other
things about it they were very nice and
easy to deal with for example unlike
some German cars I can mention scanning
around the map to figure out where you
are as easy just touch to recenter I
love that or you can use these buttons
here on the Infinity controller to move
around I don't know maybe that's just me
but I like be able to move the map
around and see where I am and then when
you want to get back to your current
spot just hit the map button
obviously you have Bluetooth calling
here's one coming in now in addition to
the Bluetooth calling hands-free have
also got stereo bluetooth streaming in
this guy because we've optioned up the
premium sound system that means I've got
10 speakers around the cabin instead of
the base 6 I get the ability to play DVD
I believe that's actually part of the
navigation option kind of a weird split
there
I've got bose amplification I've also
got drivers audio stage that means you
can tell the system to set up the
virtual staging of the audio what's left
right forward and back all right around
this seat no matter how you get a g37
specta comes base with am/fm no HD radio
XM is your satellite radio you'll get a
USB / iPod iPhone Jack here in the
glovebox I've got my ipod touch in there
now the DVD playback ability comes as
part of the navigation system and the
hard drive to rip music - also a part of
the nav rig also standard on all g37 s
regardless of how you take it up is
going to be a rear view camera what's
not standard is rhere sonar that's part
of another option package so again
throughout this car I found they did
some strange splitting and bundling of
kind of dissimilar and similar
technologies things that should go
together aren't always things that
shouldn't sometimes do one choice
gearbox on this guy because we don't
have what they call the sports 6mt model
that's called 6mt because there's a
six-speed manual we obviously don't
instead you get the 7-speed automatic
gearbox it goes in four simple gate
positions left for your shift ability
position and then you've got two paddles
that are done the right way they're
fixed on the column the way they should
be with big long ears so just about
wherever you are on the wheel if you
know how to drive
you're just a finger away from grabbing
downshift on one side up shift on the
other
now what's under the hood here made of
like a kind of garden-variety v6 and an
arrow in v6 --is that are really good
are fairly common but I will remind you
there was a time when that was not the
case until these guys came along and
they built the best v6 anybody had ever
seen and this is the descendant of that
motor this one is now a 3.7 liter v6
hence the name of the car 328 horsepower
269 foot-pounds of torque 0 to 60 on
this guy which means about 3,600 pounds
takes about five point eight seconds by
most tests while delivering 1927 mpg and
again through that 7-speed automatic in
this trim level but a six-speed manual
is available let's see how all this
works together okay so what's this guy
like on the road now like I say one of
the great v6 is in human history is
under the hood of this car and the power
comes on real nice real linear nice big
high fat torque curve is what you pick
up on right away what you also pick up
on right away is a lot of harshness I
blame that on the Sport Package this car
has a very rough ride which is to say
you feel everything in the road and not
in a cool way it's not sporty to me it's
just riding like a truck it's especially
bad over certain undulation 's where you
end up doing this a lot in the car
that's not sporty when I'm driving to
work that's just annoying and splashing
my coffee all around the Sport Package
also gives us a tighter steering ratio
which is real nice this car has really
nice steering and it turns in very
linearly there's no weirdness about it
and the on the road weight is just about
right the car doesn't feel too heavy nor
does it feel too light in some this is a
rather capable sports sedan great
powertrain gearbox is real nice by the
way it didn't do anything I didn't like
it's just a really good automatic but a
little too much of the byproducts of
sport are coming through for this to be
a real comfortable everyday car for me
as well
okay let's price out our 2012 g37
journey again this is not the sport
model the Camino transmission nor the
all-wheel drive this one is 37 1
delivered then there are 4 chunky tech
packages on there for you to consider
and here's how I'd score them Premium
Package 2150 mostly about Bose audio and
the power moonroof yes
now package 1850 I'm on the fence
haughtily yes Sport Package 2150 hell no
I like my car to not make my back hurts
and finally the tech package 1200
basically adaptive cruise and
pre-collision braking and seat belts I'd
probably blow that one off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
