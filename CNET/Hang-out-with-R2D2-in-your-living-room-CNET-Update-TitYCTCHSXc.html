leap announced is working together with
Lucasfilm to produce Star Wars related
content what exactly that content is
neither magically nor Lucasfilm is
saying magically founder Ronnie above it
says the two are working together in a
semi secret lab if you haven't heard of
magic leap it's a tech company that
specializes in mixed reality mix reality
is now the term for interacting with 3d
computer generated objects that are
integrated with real-world objects you
got that in the demo video c-3po talks
to the viewer about Han Solo's debt with
Jabba the Hutt r2d2 then projects a map
onto a real table in the room on the
bottom of the video it says shot
directly through magically technology no
special effects or compositing were used
in the creation of this video this isn't
the first video showing off magic leaves
technology back in April a demo of a 3d
virtual desktop made the rounds okay so
this is all very cool but when will we
be able to interact with magically it's
mixed reality great question so far that
information is not public apart from
those people working directly with
magically no one has seen the hardware
that lets you see these amazing mixed
reality scenes what we do know is that
magically uses light fields technology
similar to that of the electro camera
that camera lets you take a picture then
choose what area to focus on after the
image was taken magic leaves product may
allow you to see depth and let you
choose to focus on different computer
generated images anyone else feel like
Philip J fry right now shut up and take
my money anyway I maya's akhtar and you
can keep up with the hottest tech news
