here's what's happening this week see
that's crazy
you need the dentist these days when you
have a smartphone and a tooth scanner
okay okay you probably still need a
dentist but this tooth scanner device
can sure make you feel like a sci-fi
dentist tooth scanner uses spectroscopic
to scan your teeth for cavities the
device looks like a futuristic
toothbrush but instead of bristles it
contains a pulse of light that bounces
off the enamel of your teeth relaying
information back to the scanner that
data is then relayed through an app on
your smartphone that can evaluate the
health of your teeth spectroscopies is
the process of evaluating the different
colors in a beam of light to determine
certain information in this case
according to the product video when a
light beam reflects from a healthy tooth
it has a distinct spectrum when the beam
reflects from a problematic area there
will be a spectrum deviation indicating
poor health in your tooth the overall
idea is that if you monitor your teeth
regularly you will know where to
concentrate brushing and places you may
not be brushing properly which may help
improve the overall health of your teeth
you can pre-order your own tooth scanner
on IndieGoGo for $149 since the Star
Wars trailer came out recently the
Internet has done bonkers with trailered
Hannity's artwork and 3d printed toys
made for a movie that is not even yet
been released what some talented folks
at the maker organization like fab shop
have put together detailed instructions
and uploaded a downloadable file to
Instructables for 3d printing your own
customizable cross guard lightsaber that
has been the topic of some controversy
among Star Wars superfans the Handy
makers over at left fab shop watched the
trailer studied the controversy over the
new lightsaber configuration and decided
the best way to test the design was to
make one the specs for 3d printing your
own lightsaber are currently available
for download at thingiverse.com so if
you have a 3d printer go and get it
your 3d printers are so cool while
you're printing out your new lightsaber
why don't you head over to 3d print comm
and learn how to hack MIDI files that
you can upload to your 3d printer to
play music
I'm not kidding it's a thing and it
works check it out
2014 will be known as the year of the
hoverboard well to me at least we saw a
few working hoverboard prototypes but
the problem is is that if you want to
purchase one of these hoverboards you're
looking at a pretty hefty price tag
well do-it-yourselfer and inventor Ryan
Craven is trying to reverse that trend
and has produced an affordable and
relatively easy to build DIY hoverboard
using four leaf blowers and purchased on
Amazon for $200 he built essentially a
hovercraft on top of an old water ski he
found on the side of the road used other
household items like a shower curtain
tape and staples to build his first
working prototype
he is calling mr. hoverboard Craven has
been testing the board's agility at
local skate parks in Austin Texas and is
currently refining the next prototype to
be quieter and with improved air flow he
wants it to be as quiet and as sneaky as
a Prius hybrid if you'd like to build
your own mr. hoverboard Ryan Craven has
thoughtfully posted instructions on how
to make your own hovercraft hoverboard
at mr. Hubbard board calm where he is
also accepting donations from people who
want to support the project go and check
it out
