Sumi das and joining me is Seth
Rosenblatt thanks for being with us
thanks for having me again he's senior
writer for cnet and today we're talking
about Twitter and these high-profile
hacks that have happened recently AP
news got hacked CBS got hacked our
gainful employment exactly that hits
close to home and now twitter has
released this memo it happened on Monday
tell us what this memo said basically it
said two companies you're responsible
for your own passwords good luck but but
some good advice in this memo right
basically it was sent to journalists and
people that might be targeted in the
future twitter has had a problem with
spearfishing so explain what
spearfishing is first of all so
spearfishing are phishing attacks that
are directed at specific people using
information that they are likely to
recognize as familiar so that they are
basically more susceptible to the
phishing attempt which is where they
enter in their password or other
authentication information into a
website that looks real but in fact is
there just to steal their information
okay so what should people be doing with
their passwords what what constitutes a
strong one what constitutes a week when
we we get this advice all the time but
it we did like it will it's a big deal
traditionally people think of having one
word passwords with a lot of funny
characters in them pound signs and
dollar signs and percent signs and
that's no good capitals and numbers and
things like that they're actually very
hard to remember yes and not only that
and which is actually much worse they're
very easy for machine logic to guess the
way to do it actually is to go in the
other direction choose a password that's
easy for you to remember a bit harder
for a machine to guess and one of the
best ways to do that is to choose a
multi-word password that uses spaces
it's less important although it's
helpful to have funny characters in
there but if you have four random words
as your password that's really the best
way to go and you're saying you can use
spaces in your passwords this is
actually information and news to me you
know so that's acceptable for Twitter
you can put spaces in your Twitter
supports at Facebook supports a Google
supports it I don't believe that
Microsoft does but Microsoft does
support two-factor authentic
which a lot of other services also
support and what is twitter doing I mean
besides saying create stronger passwords
and change your passwords what they're
actually doing some taking some security
measures on there and to they are they
are apparently working on two-factor
authentication so noisy big step yeah
let's let's explain what that is sure so
two of two factor authentication or two
FA as it's called involves using two of
three different kinds of information to
authenticate that you are who you say
you are when you're logging in ok
there's a knowledge component so that
can be a password or a pattern or a PIN
number there's a a physical component an
ATM card or a smart card of some kind or
there can be a biometric components such
as a fingerprint ok and Twitter doesn't
have this yet do we know when it's
coming we don't ok there are a lot of
services they do offer it google has it
Facebook has it Amazon Web Services has
a Dropbox has it Microsoft has it with
hotmail yahoo uses it there's a lot of
high-profile services that do use to fa
which is great however the two fa is
still susceptible to spear fishing which
is the kind of fishing that's been used
in the past to get people's Twitter
account passwords and at the end of the
day there is no such thing as a one
hundred percent secure authentication
method if you're not a member of the
media you're not a journalist and should
you be worried about these sort of spear
phishing attacks I think you should be
concerned I think it's always important
for people to remain vigilant about
opening emails it's less of a concern
now with attachments when everyone's
using webmail it's much more important
that when you look at an email they you
know you you're taking a look at who
it's coming from the domain of where
it's coming from the link if you click
on a link before you do take a look at
it see where it's going if it says
something like big net or something
weird and you're looking for your bank
of america document then you've got a
problem and you probably should just
delete the email right okay all right so
in the meantime we'll just keep watching
for Twitter to release that two-factor
authentication absolutely Seth thank you
so much thanks alot for inside scoop I'm
Sumi das thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
