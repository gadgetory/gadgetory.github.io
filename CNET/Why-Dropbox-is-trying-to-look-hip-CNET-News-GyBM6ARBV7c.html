a more creative customer the file
sharing service revealed the new splashy
marketing campaign to put an emphasis on
how Dropbox is cool and weird and
different so maybe it'll catch your
attention against the growing
competition from file syncing services
offered by giants like Apple Amazon and
Google and maybe Wall Street will also
notice Dropbox which is said to be worth
10 billion dollars talked about going
public years ago but it never happened
so what's different now the Dropbox logo
has changed a bit instead of a box it's
a bunch of diamonds that look sort of
like a box and now it is using a new
squished font big whoop right well these
visual changes are not particularly that
interesting to most folks in the scheme
of things
this shows Dropbox is trying to stand
apart from the usual safe and boring
blue and white personality of the
competition the product itself really
isn't changing with the new creative
energy themed ads the company just wants
to inspire you to pay for it to store
your work so far it has convinced more
than 500 million people and 200,000
businesses to do just that I'm Bridget
