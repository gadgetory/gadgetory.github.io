welcome to tomorrow daily the best week
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley sceva yesterday you watched jeff
kannada we're gonna be in the studio
together at the same time it's gonna be
the greatest thing ever I not like
Schrodinger's Tomorrow daily uh we're
gonna be in a set our actual new set and
we're gonna do a 45-minute show just for
you we're going to talk about all the
stuff we talked about this week we're
gonna deep dive so let's hit the
headlines oh my god you guys a real live
jet pack that looks like it doesn't suck
to pilot look jet pack aviation is
responsible for the jb9 jet pack an
actual jet pack in the sense that it
uses turbine jets and a backpack to
propel its pilot and it looks super
duper agile inventor David Mayman took
the jb9 for a spin around the Statue of
Liberty you know as one does and man
that thing looks super beautiful in
flight which is a big time difference
compared to a lot of other jetpacks out
there it kind of looks and feels like a
big deal the jetpacks turbine engines
run on simple kerosene and can carry
about ten gallons of fuel which is good
for about a ten-minute flight depending
on how much the pilot weighs it's well
enough to stick in the backseat of a car
and light enough to jog a bit with the
tank full unfortunately it's not for
sale he says for now he wants to be
sensible about who gets their hands on
the jb9 as they develop the jb 10 I
gotta be honest with you guys I am
terrified of heights but I would totally
take a spin on this thing okay so next
story on a scale of 1 to 10 how excited
would you be if I told you there were
flying modular holograms because there
are a team at Queen's University created
bit drones a series of tiny drones with
some interesting capabilities this is a
super early concept that you're seeing
but let's imagine a lot more of these
things creating shapes as you hear how
the technology works so there are three
different kinds of drones working here
pixel drones which have an LED display
for showing information shape drones
which can join up with the others like
it to make Kubek displays in three
dimensions and then display drones which
are literally a flexible touchscreen
mounted on nano drone in a demo they use
the pixel drones to browse files by
moving the drones left and right and
then tapping the desired file then they
the shape drones which are flying cubes
that indicate the basic markers for a 3d
building model and the operator can drag
the drones around to change the
orientation and adjust parameters pinch
the zoom using two drones and use the
display drone to control the model
remotely the system only supports a
dozen drones currently but the goal is
to scale the idea up to thousands of
much much smaller drones in essence that
would kind of make them like a flying
pixel display that could be manipulated
and changed in real time which sounds
pretty fun honestly okay so our very
last story Disney research is back the
news they have an interactive design
system for 3d printed robots that even
you and I can use ETH Zurich
collaborated once again with Disney
research in Carnegie Mellon University
to create an interesting software that
enables anyone to design their very own
3d printed robot you start out with a
basic foundation with virtual motors in
every joint but then you can click and
drag and add or remove motors adjust how
the robot looks when it walks and
generate 3d geometry for your robot body
you can even watch how your little robot
will look when it's walking via physics
simulation the software lets you input
what 3d printer you have and what type
of filament you're using and then it
will optimize the final design based on
that data to make you the strongest 3d
printed robot possible the team made
five different types of robots each with
their own gait and numbers of legs
including a five legged robot which is
really creepy you won't be making your
robot run though since the software
can't handle that yet but the team
doesn't seem to be really concerned with
that they actually seem to be more
concerned with the creative side of the
design and letting you unleash your
imagination in making weird 3d printed
robots with five legs honestly my
favorite part of that video is when the
little tiny four-legged robot waves at
me high-low robot you're so cute alright
guys let's talk about Mod Squad
today we're gonna get a little bit of
fashion Lina a song designs clothes with
wearable technology inside and she
recently debuted a skirt with some fun
surprises the skirt is controlled by
Arduino and features a microphone and
LED lights when the skirt hears music it
lights up but this is not a standard
equaliser skirt or anything like you've
seen before it actually lights up based
on the musical notes it hears and
creates a sort of LED visualization of
the music it's hearing of course she had
this idea while she was at Burning Man
and she'll probably wear it there next
year but the best part is she put the
entire process up on Instructables
including hooking up the electronics and
installing LEDs in leather fabric so
honestly if you need an LED kind of
equaliser visualization skirt you are
now covered the internet says you're
welcome
all right guys it's time for our
photogra of the day our phone talker for
the day today is yuan who sent in this
gorgeous photo with his xperia z3 he
wrote to us and he says hey everyone at
tomorrow daily I watch your show all the
time really enjoy the content I recently
flew down to Cape Town from Johan s Berg
in South Africa and took a few pictures
with my Sony Xperia z3 in and around
Cape Town Cape Town is a very cool and
trendy city just thought I'd share my
beautiful country with you you have my
permission to use them of course keep on
making geeks happy
thank you greetings from sunny South
Africa you on Vanderpol you on it was
such an amazing picture you actually
sent in a bunch of pictures from Cape
Town now I want to visit I'm going to
add it to my list of places I want to go
if you guys want to send in your phone
tog Rafi to make me jealous of where you
live you can email us tomorrow at
cnet.com make sure you give us
permission to use your picture send your
actual photo don't forget to attach it
and tell us a little story about it just
like you wanted because it was great and
if you want to find us online you can
find us at tomorrow daily on Facebook
and Twitter we are also at tomorrow's
daily comm if you want to share the show
with a friend which is always great
I am at Ashley sceva Jeff is at Jeff
kanata with two N's and one tea and
producer Logan is at Logan boy on
Twitter if you would like to befriend us
that is it for the show today we will be
back with a brand new docket a weird
wonderful science fact meeting science
fiction with some discussion tomorrow
it's gonna be a long show so get ready
but until then be good human so I'll see
you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
