dive into movies TV shows and games
friends this week I'm a little concerned
about the Harry Potter universe earlier
this week the second round of box office
numbers rolled in for fantastic beasts
the crimes of Grindelwald and let me
tell you they were interesting let's
take a look at the numbers so over the
Thanksgiving weekend from Friday to
Sunday crimes of Grindelwald made about
thirty million dollars which doesn't
seem terrible okay but it was a 52% drop
off from its debut weekend that's a
pretty disappointing couple of weeks
domestically for the second fantastic
beast movie which has also kind of been
raked over the coals by critics
internationally though it is doing fine
full disclosure I am a massive Harry
Potter fan I love the Harry Potter
universe witches and muggles and no
Maja's and the fight of good versus evil
it's all great stuff but I do think that
fantastic beasts as a series is
suffering from some issues that may be
the original Harry Potter series didn't
have on top of that crimes of
Grindelwald isn't as strong a movie as
the first fantastic beasts which wasn't
exactly perfect either which got me
thinking what happens if fantastic
beasts as a series is a flop it's really
scary for me to even think about but
here are the facts okay fantastic beasts
the crimes of Grindelwald had a budget
of 200 million dollars and that is just
the production budget that is not
counting any additional money Warner
Brothers spent on things like marketing
or other related costs for the movie we
also know that they have already
committed to three more fantastic beast
films they said it would be five from
the get-go of each one of these movies
has a two hundred million dollar
production budget well do the math that
is a billion dollars in expectations for
Warner Brothers and not only are they
going to want to make their production
budget back they're gonna want to make
more than a billion dollars so let's
talk about what's next so Warner
Brothers will likely profit from crimes
of Grindelwald but I'm guessing it's not
doing the kind of business they were
hoping it would do that 52 percent
second
we drop off I mentioned has something in
common with another Warner Brothers
movie in a different cinematic universe
Justice League and if there's anything
we know about Warner Brothers it's that
they're not particularly patient or you
know brave about having a movie get bad
reviews and not take as much at the box
office so we're not really sure what
Warner Brothers could do next movies
like these are expected to bring in a
billion plus dollars because studios
know how popular the universes are and
how expensive they are to make now that
we know some facts and figures let's
speculate just a little bit so depending
on the final box office take of crimes
of Grindelwald Warner Brothers could
choose to take these three upcoming
films and shrink them down into just one
single movie forcing fantastic beasts to
wrap things up in a trilogy instead of a
five movie opus and ask JK Rowling to
maybe start a new series about a
different time in the Harry Potter
universe I'd maybe go with the cursed
child story which is already on Broadway
but I'm not sure that could be expanded
into a trilogy if it doesn't decide to
condense everything down to just three
movies and stick with that five film
plan they originally announced Warner
Brothers could in fact get fresh blood
via its director David Yates
this guy has directed a ton of Harry
Potter movies order of the Phoenix
half-blood Prince both Deathly Hollows
movies and the two fantastic beast films
he's basically the harry potter director
maybe the studio decides it wants to
bring in a fresh perspective bring in
some new life to these three additional
films I mean to be fair though David
Yates is actually listed as the director
of all five fantastic beast films on
IMDB so maybe that isn't quite an option
maybe contractually legally something
like that there's also the possibility
that JK Rowling the creator of the
entire Harry Potter universe is
realizing that there is a problem which
is that she's suffering from a similar
issue that George Lucas ran into while
making Star Wars episodes one through
three and by that I mean that everything
and everyone in a mad
civ universe somehow always came back to
the main core characters that's kind of
what's happening in fantastic beasts
don't worry I'm not gonna give you any
spoilers I know some of you haven't seen
the movie yet that is totally fine and I
would never do that to you but it is
kind of happening so it's possible that
rolling and Warner Brothers could bring
in another screenwriter to sort of
freshen up the series and get it back on
track
regardless the Harry Potter cinematic
universe is going to be fine and there
will of course be at least a third
fantastic beasts movie to try to close
out a trilogy or continue this five
movie series so I think really the only
question here is will Warner Brothers
respond well to a dwindling box office
and you know honestly kind of really
conflicted fan base we seen it before I
like I said earlier so who knows what's
gonna happen
Axios Errol's blah blah blah blah blah
blah blah can you believe that in 2018
the only movie and to the cinemas called
fantastic peace to their claims of
usually I'll get really angry s point
and start screaming simple skies brick
images think of it that that we were a
load and this year there's at least a
movie like that and core it becames that
Grindelwald whose grand award with
claims fantastic piece will be score
today weekend the world how is that even
a movie house David I need for a movie
well there's too many words
I just can't handle these things that
are so anguish any of all these men or
we words in a mentor we world magic
world's magic the studio it story all
these more tomato I've written me that
these guys doesn't mean that is all made
up the just et Tyler Park was going to
be three Mia movies are s premiere
movies I'm a dot what they need of
characters amid apparent just know
