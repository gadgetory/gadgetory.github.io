soul of the note series it's what allows
you to be creative and productive it
combines the simplicity of a pen with
the power of the nurse and you never
have to worry about charging or syncing
the s-pen and now we've made it even
better it has a finer tip and greater
pressure sensitivity to faithfully
capture each stroke and it's paired with
the largest screen we've ever put on a
nerve so now you have a larger canvas
all these amazing drawings you're seeing
coming up in the screens around me were
created using the S Pen and post it in
pen up the vibrant community DJ talked
about earlier we created pen up so users
could share their work or browse through
a curated gallery of s-pen art and today
there are over 2.7 million pen up users
globally and here's my favorite new
feature pen up now has a collection of
coloring book templates designed
specifically for the S Pen the pen up
coloring books are a great way for me to
relax after a long day working on the
note 8 launch today most of us
communicate by texting but a text
message lacks emotion that's why we find
ourselves relying off pictures emojis
and clever punctuation to express our
feelings but now the S Pen adds a whole
new dimension to your communication by
letting you anime what you write or draw
so instead of just texting a friend to
say thank you you can add a little
flavor to your message a personal touch
makes a huge difference even if you're
just scheduling coffee with a friend
so for the no day we created live
message a new feature that lets you put
some soft back in self-expression with
live message you can animate anything
you write or draw or add personal
messages to photos let's try it out
right now
first I need a picture your side of this
audience is going to give me the most
love can I hear it all right you guys
ready bring your smiles up all right see
perfect looks good so now I'm gonna take
my S Pen out let's get back to that
picture
I'm gonna take my S Pen out click on
live message select that picture that we
just took from my gallery not gonna lie
the sparkle pen is my favorite now this
is saving to an animated standard
animated message format so I can share
this with everyone isn't that cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
