just don't like that feeling but they
still want an in-ear headphone if you
are one of those people the Samsung
level you might just be the wireless
bluetooth headphone for you hi I'm David
Carr know from cnet.com and it's the
design of this $70 headphone that makes
it recommendable modeled after LG's
popular around the neck tone headphones
the level u has a lightweight flexible
neck collar with easy to access control
buttons built into the right side of it
the buds hang from the collar and adhere
magnetically when not in use to help
with cord clutter you get a couple of
sets of ear gels but the one that worked
for me and kept the buds securely in my
ears was the one with the stabilizing
wings it's a lot like boses earphones
that have their own little wings and are
designed to sit loosely in your ears
it's a very comfortable design and this
headphone actually works well at the gym
for light workouts but I wish it was
sweat proof like other Bluetooth
headphones this one doubles as a headset
and has dual microphones and vibrates
when a call comes in the only downside
to the ear tips open design is that they
do let in a lot of sound from the
outside world so the performance suffers
a bit in noisier environments yes this
is a Samsung headphone but it does work
with all Bluetooth enabled phones
including iPhones though a free Android
app does add a bit of extra
functionality battery life is rated at
10 hours of music playback which is
decent for this type of headphone I
wasn't blown away by the sound but it's
pretty good for a bluetooth headphone
just not great there's some distortion
at higher volumes and some competing in
your models offer more basses a little
cleaner sound but with those headphones
you do have to jam the tips into your
ears and some people really don't like
that
David car noise thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
