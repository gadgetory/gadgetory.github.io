taking a look at a olace last year at
CES we saw a lot of robots that had the
pieces to make Rosie the robot if you
combined them this thing might be the
whole package look it can grab things
and reach and hand it to me that thank
you and Z it can use that and learn
different objects and put them away
it can hold a vacuum cleaner and vacuum
your floor if you want to
it has Alexa built-in so it responds to
voice controls it's going to respond to
touch controls you can remotely control
it with your phone it's gonna be able to
travel on wheels and raise up and down
this is Rosie the robot Aeolus can also
roam your house looking for security
incidents can act as basically a
security bot looking for out of place
things because it remembers objects it
also remembers your face so it can look
and let you know if it spots something
unusual so my friend Aeolus here is
still in development it's expected to be
out by the end of 2018 as you might
expect from looking at this thing it's
not gonna be cheap they're currently not
giving me an exact price but what they
said is it's gonna cost as much as
sending a family on an overseas trip so
that's a little ominous but that here is
really
cool and I'm really excited to play
around with a robot that can actually do
all of those smart home functions I'd
look for in Rosie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
