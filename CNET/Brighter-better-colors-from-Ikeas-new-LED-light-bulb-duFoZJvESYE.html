lad are a line of LEDs is growing in one
of the newest additions is this 1000
lumen bulb you can get n ideas right now
for 11 bucks now a thousand Newman's is
kind of an odd number that's a lot
brighter than most 60 watt replacements
like these over here those are about 800
lumens but not quite as bright as the 75
watt replacement level where it's
usually about 1,100 lumens that you're
getting so this bulb is kind of in the
middle it's brighter than these 60 watt
replacements but not as affordable and
not as efficient and it's cheaper than
these 75 watt replacements but not quite
as bright so it all comes down to
whether or not you're comfortable in
that middle ground if you are I think
you'll enjoy the outstanding color
quality that this bulb offers the CRI
score the color rendering index measures
how good a given light source is at
making colors like vivid and true so a
good CRI score when that's up in the 90s
or close to 100 will make your reds look
red your whites look white all of your
colors just kind of pop a little better
and see what I mean take a look at this
bowl of M&amp;amp;Ms now this is a multicolored
bowl of M&amp;amp;Ms a white bowl we kind of get
a little bit of everything in this
picture here we have the cree 75 watt
replacement a very typical LED with a
CRI score of 80 you can see the bowl
looks a little yellow e some of the red
and orange M&amp;amp;Ms are a little dull
overall it's fine but not ideal
now let's upgrade to the IKEA light you
see the bowl instantly looks a lot more
white the Reds pop a little better the
oranges look good everything looks just
a little more vivid and that's what
you're getting with this light a subtle
uptick and color quality now where might
you want that well a kitchen makes a lot
of sense if you're cooking food bright
colored vegetables you want it to look
good maybe a walk-in closet where you
want your clothing to look accurate or
maybe if you just painted your living
room read all those scenarios make sense
for a bulb like this now the bulb shines
at 2700 K so it's a nice yellowy
familiar incandescent light tone uses 13
watts to put out those 1,000 lumens for
an efficiency rating of 74 lumens per
watt now that's not great all of these
bulbs are better than that most bulbs
today are at least 75 lumens a lot if
not closer to a hundred so if you are an
efficiency hound it's probably not the
bulb for you that said it's an
omnidirectional bulb it works well on
dimmer switches and it offers pretty
good value at eleven dollars a lot
better than most
five watt replacements which cost
fifteen or twenty still at eleven bucks
it's maybe not quite as competitive as
last year's 600 lumen Ladera LED that
cost five bucks but I still think that
it's an interesting bulb that merits a
close look if you like bright colors in
your home for more check out my full
