like we're living in a sci-fi movie set
in the future but you know what here are
the top five signs we are not living in
that future at number five we don't wear
uniforms I've watched a lot of TV and
movies in the future we're supposed to
be wearing uniforms maybe silver and
shiny uniforms right now we don't have
that shares some eccentric people like
Mark Zuckerberg have adopted the uniform
approach but that's just one guy at
number four we don't have bachelors
child preparing and eating food is a lot
of work in the Jetsons get awesome deals
in pill form in Futurama there was back
there chow
but you know what we don't have solid
meal replacements yet yeah there's
powdered food like sewing like an ample
but it's not the same number three
flying cars are not mainstream now that
I think of it flying or floating things
are still not real flying cars yeah they
sort of exist but they're essentially
small aircrafts and what about those
hoverboards two wheels on a platform

are living in the future our homes are
starting to talk to us dance devices
like the Amazon echo we do carry around
personal communicators and wearable
computers like fitness bands and
smartwatches all of the world's data is
accessible easily and we even have
electric cars on to number one their
number one sign we aren't living in the
future is robots are not trying to kill
us
I've owned several robot vacuum cleaner
sure the room but used to smack into my
foot while trying to figure out where to
go not exactly killing me
robots are still out there building cars
not attacking humans in any significant
way we're building robots right now just

because I don't want robots to Phyllis
