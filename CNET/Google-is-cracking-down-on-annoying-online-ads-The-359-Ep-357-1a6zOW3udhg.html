sorry we're running so late today it's
episode 357 of the 359 podcast I'm BVG
and the house is full today Ben Joan and
Alfred hey we're getting so close to the
350 ninth episode I whoa bursting with
excitement and the name of the show is
three one three fifty-nine yes so look
out for a marathon episode where we're
just basically doing a podcast all day
on Wednesday so look out for that for
today though we've got a packed episode
we're talking about Google's new ad
blocking effort on Chrome also spending
with Bitcoin that is if you actually do
spend your Bitcoin on anything like
goods or services and then Jones here to
talk about the code media conference
that should just came back from just got
back so oh and if we have time we'll
talk about the home pod ruining
furniture which i think is very funny as
unusual what i'm just here a look cute
yeah and rune furniture
that's just like just like a new puppy
as usual sending your questions and
comments BVG we'll get to as many as you
can at the end of the show let's get to
the podcast and we'll see you soon see
in the chat in 3 minutes and 59 seconds
from 3 to welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox
Riven I'm Joanie Saltzman I'm Alfred
hang starting today Google is cracking
down on some of the most bothersome
online ads and videos using its Chrome
browser to block pop-up ads ads that
cover more than 30% of your phone screen
and autoplay videos with sound this is
just the first step and a controversial
one too
since some folks see this as a moot see
this move as Google getting too much
power over what ads websites can
actually show what do you guys think so
yeah this is also it kind of in tandem
with another play that Google is doing
where it's blocking access now or just
marking as heavily insecure on any
website that you go that's not HTTP
which is a lot of websites like CNN's
website is an HTTP
as currently but I think that falls in
the criticism that you were talking
about you know Google kind of taking a
lot of control over like what websites
you're able to visit and all that and
it's important to note that it's Google
has a unique role in that place because
Google is Facebook and Google command
like almost all of the new money that's
coming in to digital advertising and
they're the majority that your
advertising money right now already yeah
and so the people that they're that
Google is now blocking ads for is like
the 2% of a digital ad money that's of
new digital ad - coming in is going to
like 2% of people that are Google
Facebook and now Google is starting to
block some of that money you know why
that isn't annoyed about this though the
rest of the people that come on don't
have to deal terrible in the media and
we have to serve ads to you know keep
the lights on and pay the bills but
you're absolutely right Alfred a lot of
users find many many of these ads super
annoying and they probably wish that
Google went even further there are a ton
of downsides to ads they're distracting
they slow websites they eat up your
phone battery some of them might have
malware on it they track users so they
build profiles about you I mean like
there's there are a lot of reasons why
people don't like ads and it really does
show the point as to you know not
everything you know you can get free
content on the internet but sometimes it
does come with us it's in saying that so
much of our internet still looks like
it's from like 1998 or something because
of all these like ridiculous ads on how
much space they take up yeah next up I
wrote a story about how Bitcoin and
other cryptocurrencies aren't still
aren't living up to their promise as
digital cash that you can use to pay for
goods and services
most people just hold on to it as an
investment vehicle do you guys have
Bitcoin have you ever actually spent it
no no no I bought some Bitcoin I'm very
excited because I don't want to be that
the case of the person that was like hey
I had like one Bitcoin in 2009 and I
bought you know like toilet paper with
it
and now it's worth $20,000 right now
that's valid toilet paper worth $20,000
yeah like one of the most well known
stories about that is Florida software
developer who spent 10,000 Bitcoin on
two pizzas and I'm sure he wishes he
wasn't so hungry that day
last up John you just came back from the
code media conference maybe you can tell
us a little bit about what were some of
the biggest things that happened there
what were some of the headlines from the
event yeah so one of the things that
people are talking about on the ground
there you know the code gets some really
good speakers some really interesting
speakers they had Facebook and YouTube
show up on the first day and a lot of
people in the audience were frustrated
that you know you have these really
powerful giant companies and then they
get up on stage even though they're
facing a lot of really intractable
problems and they aren't really upfront
about how they're dealing with it you
know they it's like why are you even
inviting these people here they're not
gonna say anything what there's nothing
wrong with Facebook or YouTube it's been
they're perfect they're perfect in every
way well that's kind of like it sounds
like a joke but it's not they don't get
up there and say that but they it feels
like that sort of cognitive dissonance
where they won't they're so dedicated to
not having to go on the record about
addressing these problems either because
they can't or because they won't because
they don't want to speak about it in a
public forum that it feels like that a
little bit like why are you what do you
even wear well world are you living in
yeah yeah definitely if you want to read
more about these stories check us out on
CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Johnny
Salzmann I'm Alfred Inge all right
thanks for listening little rough on the
dismount I don't think that wasn't my
fault this that would have gone over
well at the Olympics usually I'm it's
MIT's my fault on the dismal ways been
more of a bronze guy anyway that's true
alright everybody thanks for joining us
we are going to go ahead and delve
through the comments and see if you guys
got any good feedback and questions for
us to keep the conversation going until
then I don't even have a suggestion this
time I'm completely burnt out today you
guys fill sometime in the meantime I
wanted to talk about this home fight
story we didn't get to it during the
podcast but it is pretty funny it's
apparently I don't think
it's the home pot the new Apple home
pies it's Apple's new smart speaker
apparently messes up your wood furniture
if left on top of it for too long it'll
just create kind of like a white ring
around it I think that's it's like from
from the heat from yeah it's an acid or
something like that it's it's not an
acid because it kind of goes away after
a while but I think that it's the same
thing that happens if you put like a
coffee mug or like hot tea on your wood
furniture well that's like condensation
I think bunch which like couldn't they
like solve that for like a three hundred
and fifty dollar well yeah right hope so
you would think that they would just put
it on toothpicks or something am I gonna
have to like a coaster when I buy that's
what I'm oh my gosh there you go but I
thought home but I have to get like an
apple ploy so they can start selling
like coasters or their own home pods
they're gonna be at least five hundred
dollars Oh stirs too so yeah um I
coaster i coaster but yeah 995 so do we
have any questions I'm still digging I'm
still digging okay keep going all right
well we have so many questions we do all
right fine let's go back to the like the
chrome stuff cuz to me that's pretty
interesting and talk about it from the
user side I think the other thing that I
also wanted to talk about was that in
Steven Shanklin story yesterday he
called out like the LA Times and Forbes
like their websites is having some like
particularly bothersome ads I've been on
those websites I wouldn't disagree with
that I'm not saying that they don't have
good content it's just sometimes it can
be pretty bothersome to see some of the
ads sometimes like they they like take
over the page or you have to like click
through them actually I mean countdown
during during the conference the
editor-in-chief of Huff Post was on
stage and one of the comments one of the
questions from the audience is like I
just went to your website on mobile and
I had to see 17 ads yeah four of which
we're all for the same company before I
could actually get to your content Wow
yeah so it's something yeah there's a
lot of reason there's a lot of points
what are you what did she say about that
she was like well I don't like to hear
that that's not
the experience you should be having but
I'm getting paid a lot of money so sorry
see curly she was like I'm sorry to hear
that you should actually be seeing 42s I
don't know this is this is another way
of looking at it - is that a lot of the
websites that have paywalls now like the
New York Times Washington Post Wall
Street Journal they also serve ads
they're not nearly as bothersome right
well then again the LA Times also has
subscriptions but if I were paying a
subscription and didn't have to have any
ads that would be useful that's an
interesting idea since they definitely
like text based online publishers more
of them are gravitating toward this sort
of paywall scheme because people are
more willing to open their wallets for
publishers today though it'll be
interesting to see if they start to
consumer start to say like hey I'm
paying you money I don't want to see the
ads did you hear about what salon.com
did tell us so on monday some news had
come out that if you went to their
website with an ad blocker you can opt
out of it it was basically yeah we won't
show you yet but you'll basically be
mining cryptocurrency for us while
you're on the web's yeah and we won't
show you ads but you're gonna be mining
for crypto currency for us and somebody
some people who tried it out and it
showed like their chrome processor like
it was taking up like a hundred percent
of their and like it just slowed down to
a halt to the point where they couldn't
even navigate the website because it's
like yeah I mean that's that gets people
talking about you but like ultimately
their business is not mining yet and
they're making their business their
business like it's either it's either
they're making it really on it's like
turn off your ad blocker turn off your
ad blocker and like view our ads so we
can make money off of that or mine some
currency for us and keep your ad blocker
but I think it's an experiment it
probably didn't work and people got
really mad about hey let's take some
questions I finally got a couple of good
ones in here you ready yes it only took
me a few minutes sorry always good
conversation in the chat
imagine soggy says does Google does the
Google adblock include those scammy ads
that when you click on the link it's a
pop-up that says you win a new iPhone
like what is really in their targets
yeah it's supposed to block those kinds
of ads though with that like rhetoric
around it they're trying to prevent like
a lot of these like scam ads okay I can
read through some of these in Chrome you
will no longer see ads that cover more
than 30% of your phone screen cover your
screen and show you a countdown timer
autoplay video with sound use quote
sticky panels that won't go away
and pop up to cover part of your screen
so those are all pretty annoying I've
had to deal with like plenty of those
and that's nice but I would probably say
that a lot of people in the chat would
like to see them go well that well that
includes stuff that's not ads though but
more so like part of the website design
like oh subscribe to our newsletter kind
of thing like when that pops up like
it's not an ad that's a good question I
don't know I don't know I think they
have different kinds of IDs that they're
identified by so it's supposed to not I
mean I would hope that a wouldn't target
things are actually just part of the
website experience and then you can
judge that separately if the website
experience also sucks right that's my
two cents sure a couple more questions
let's keep talking about ads Watson says
isn't removing these annoying ads going
to dramatically lose profit for Google
do they think their shareholders will be
happy about this well this is the thing
is that they're actually taking away ads
from other ones that like make money off
of these ads yeah I mean it's it's they
will block some ads if on google sites
if they do fall into this realm but I
haven't really noticed Google having
these types of ads and I think that's
probably why they identified them
specifically because they don't tend to
do this kind of thing I want to see
something that actually the bothers me
the most is when the ad or when the page
loads in chunks and then ad moves
everything so I've already got the mouse
click here in place and I go and then it
says I miss fire that's the one that
bugs me the most I don't know
I hate pre-roll I don't hate pre-roll as
much as I hate autoplay audio which more
than a few people like sir enjoy in the
chat also hate but yeah it's that thing
we're a sec alright I can beat it yeah
yeah I hate waste I hate it when
websites have autoplay yeah I think we
all do let's go and have some more
questions why don't we James Vincent if
I see multiple ads on a mobile web page
I'll just leave the site I agree with
Google blocking them finally yeah one of
the worst ones I experienced is this a
comic books I don't want to throw them
under the bus and name them but yeah I'm
a comic book geek go figure and I love
the content on the site but man the ad
experience is miserable especially when
you click through from social and it
just gets to the point where it stacks
and stacks and stacks and I can't even
read it it's completely unreal nights
that's partly the issue is that chrome
is a very successful product for Google
it gives them a lot of user data
it helps redirect people to Google which
is you know how they make all their
money where they serve you ads on
google.com so they have a vested
interest in preventing that type of
thing from happening now the way ads
tend to work is that these are the worst
offenders I remember when we were first
starting with the internet pop-ups used
to be the super annoying thing that ever
everybody had to deal with and as South
Park generally you know gets on top of
this stuff before anybody who really
starts talking about it it's they're
gonna they're gonna redirect to
something else yeah where they
eventually the ads eventually become
people I'm more astonished that
something like that has survived so long
after how negative it's like I don't
even have a good analogy for it like
what's something that everybody hates
like everybody hates pop but you really
like they aren't Google they don't have
the resources to have an advertising
base like Google but they have I'm sorry
but they have to make money somehow and
they don't have the wherewithal they're
focusing on giving you great content I'm
sure yep they don't have the wherewithal
to have an ad experience as good as
their content experience I presume not
knowing do they
but I feel like you know it's easy to
take a crap on these really small
publishers that are gonna get hurt by
this because they are doing annoying
things but they're trying they're just
trying to how to figure out how to make
a buck I'm not talking about like porn
sites or things that are sending you
malware but like the actual people that
are getting hurt are usually you know
publishers that you like you're not
you're 110% correct and I should come
down and I'm so hard but it's it's that
it's the the piling that bothers me it's
when I go to the site and they've got an
autoplay with audio video on plus
banners and then there's an overlay and
that's what I'm talking about that would
say it's the trifecta of all the worst
experience and they happen concurrently
yeah not even like switch page here's
another ad experience we're gonna keep I
get that and as somebody who works in my
bread and butter comes from us being
able to serve ads the experience still
sucks and the concept of the pop-up is
like the definitive worst experience out
of all of them that's like the reference
point it's the Kleenex of bad ads yeah
and I think that another another piece
of context to throw in is that the
inventory is almost limitless on on like
for online ads and that's partly why
like the value of them has dropped so
low and that's why a lot of as Joan said
you know these smaller publishers have
to serve a lot of ads because you have
to like bundle all of these to actually
turn it into something that's off value
so you know it's it's interesting to
think about like newspapers and
magazines where like you know they're
dead tree media but they their inventory
is far more limited and therefore they
can charge more money then somebody can
online so one thing that we can talk
about is ways that publishers like the
comic book site that do you like so much
ways they can deliver a good experience
but also get money so there's there are
things like like the brave browser where
like your comic book site could just
sign up to be part of their program
where brave has a blocking built into it
but you can as a user sign up for a
program where the time that you you have
it's it's a crypto currency sort of
thing which I know like hold on it's not
entirely stupid but as a crypto currency
where you as a user
sign up for the cryptocurrency and you
say that all right however much time I
spend on these websites I want you to
divvy up my amount of currency and pay
those publishers because I'm not looking
at their ads or you can you can
basically say like you really like this
comic processor give like 80% of divvy
it up by proportion to what I'm looking
at every day but the given for the last
20% just give it to that publisher
because I really value them so there are
ways where does this currency come from
it comes from brain yeah brave made it's
called the basic attention token and
they launched it so that's you know it's
still at they only just have done in the
last month or month and a half
interesting interesting ways that you as
a user without having to you can you
know people talk about like let me just
give you my money so I don't have to see
this stuff like I love your content but
let me just give you money instead of
having to deal with it that's one way
that people are trying to sort of figure
out ways to do that I mean it's not what
YouTube is doing with leg YouTube red I
mean I know there's premium content too
but like you don't get ads on YouTube
yeah yeah it's like actual just paying
YouTube money it's a little bit less
like there is a middleman though YouTube
is the middle yeah this is more of like
a direct like I want to give them
although you could consider the
cryptocurrency middleman dollars but
yeah yeah I'm doing oh sorry
online tip jars for instance is
something that a lot of media companies
had tried in the past and I don't think
they've really been that successful so
this sounds like it might be a way of
like improving that concept yeah does
this technically qualify as a
subscription then you think this is I
don't think that we're going to see a
increased uptick in the concept of
subscription-based Internet content oh
we already are we are yeah there are
people are subscribing more especially
for news content like text-based content
people are subscribing for that more
than they got it thank you for that
let's talk to Josh and storm king who
are both asking basically the same
question will the chrome ad blocker work
like a normal a blocker or is it just
going to filter through and allow Google
ads to surface well I think that well so
yeah so Google like normal ad blockers
like if you're looking like adblock plus
or like any kind of extensions that
blocks every ad like not just like these
offending ones this is like Morka so
Google like
Chrome standard of like this ad takes up
this much space or this ad has audio in
it and it plays automatically so we're
blocking that from chrome but I think
this is how it works it's Google
analyzes sites and warns them warns the
site specifically that they're being
intrusive with their ads and gives them
an opportunity to get rid of those
intrusive ads if they don't do that then
they become blacklisted and every single
one of their ads on the page ceases to
exist through Chrome so it is a bit of
an like somewhat judicious I suppose
effort to try to say like hey these
these aren't up to snuff on Chrome get
rid of them if you don't get rid of them
sorry you can't serve any ads now but I
think that underlying that question is
whether Google would allow their own ads
Google I think won't be creating ads
that fall into the categories as
intrusive and so it's not like Google
will be blocking if Google had an ad
that was exactly the same as seeing it
had an ad if they were both intrusive
it's not like crew and would block the
scene at one but not would allow the
Google because Google wouldn't you're
gonna be meeting their own standard we
would create like a pretty awesome like
time paradox if Google ended up blocking
its own ads somehow and I feel like that
would be pretty self-defeating on
Google's side but I don't know I guess
anything could happen but I don't think
it's like a Mahna Mahna monopolistic
power that they're gonna be abusing I
think it's more setting standards and
then they're gonna abide I was I was
gonna kind of bring up the point though
that I feel like most people that use
Google Chrome already have an ad blocker
on it some well plenty of people do as
Steven Shanklin mentions and his stories
I think it's hundreds of millions of
people I'm gonna double-check I'd like
AB hundreds of millions of people do use
it yeah at blocking extensions on Khan
chrome are so prevalent that like the
fake version of adblock plus got like
millions of download it was like a
malware like extension and like millions
of people still downloaded the fake
version of it before it got taken down
yeah well maybe that's why people don't
have downloaded the wrong one dude I got
an ad blogger he gave me a virus that's
like the ultimate Rick roll if I've ever
seen one
we got a lot of great conversation going
on from is this going to kill off
torrenting sites Alex is asking
open-eyed would pop up had to be less
annoying if the ads are something you're
interested in I've always said try to
sell me something I want I don't mind
being short hitched but if it's just
trashed and it's just trash also if it's
obtrusive them going to you could offer
me like the best pizza in the world if
you throw it in my face I hate you for
it you know
Schiffer asks it will not ask but
theorizes and i love this idea it will
be interesting when we go with ads once
VR or AR becomes mainstream like I'm
walking down the street and then a
BestBuy wall pops up in front of you
stops you it's like it's like in
Futurama when when they have ads
inserted into their dreams yes
that's coming like a freight train yeah
III think that the concept of likes and
give me ads that I won the other side of
the coin there is that you would have to
get pretty thoroughly profiled by the
advertisers to know what it is that you
won and I think a lot of people are
uncomfortable with that they'd rather be
you know more anonymous online and not
have you know constantly tracking the
problem is is that I know a lot of that
already happens like there are probably
like dozens of trackers you know that
are checking like what I'm doing on
chrome at any given moment truth
very true we're almost out of time but
let's talk a little bit about home pod
before we let everybody go because there
is still some conversation going on
about that for sure so do we know
exactly what it is it's causing these
rings is it paint residue is it moisture
because when you get a coffee table you
put a drink down on there it's that what
the ring the ring is usually caused by
condensation I think it's just dry heat
the ring is usually caused by a VHS tape
that you watch and then the girl shows
up no no not the ring is the movie
though yeah so it's not caused by the
VHS it's it's the ring anyway whatever I
mean like Apple confirm that it happens
to wirecutter was the one that found out
about this and they said the marks can
infuse improve after several days and
you could you could like use like a
polish on the surface
like Old English or something to try to
remove it so it seems to only happen on
wood surfaces mostly untreated so it
does seem to be like what is a heater
condensation related okay that's
interesting because Kangol ox is
thinking that it might have been
something to do with the paint residue
being caused by overheating or excessive
vibration essentially just leaving an
imprint on the table and I got to wonder
like how hot does that home pod run does
it run warm it's not going to cause
damage I don't because war wood will
warp yeah cuz it goes away though it
were at least according to Apple like if
you remove it for a bit and like what is
it like wipe it down you said yeah with
like yeah I don't think if it were heat
that wouldn't happen I love the burn
dinner it's like like have you ever like
I don't know I live in New York and so I
put wood on top of my radiator because
you don't have a choice because I don't
have a choice and so I turn and I think
it's just I think it's just just dry
heat that causes if it's an untreated
piece of wood like a shelf that you get
from Ikea not speaking from experience
but I think it's just yeah it's just dry
heat and the longer that you have it on
there the more permanent it'll be I
would just be really interested to see
if anybody I'm sure somebody amongst us
is gonna wind up with a home pod and if
they leave it planted in the exact same
location for an extended period well we
all if it does actually cause long-term
damage like a year down the road I'd
like to talk and see I'm guessing shot
in the dark here but Dan Ackerman
probably gets one right I would be
interested to see if that actually cause
long-term damage not something you can
polish away we have one in the office we
should probably set something up with
that yeah but when it's in the office
with us we are gonna be using it for
testing and different content so it's
probably a move I'm saying like funny
just man they just plant this thing put
it somewhere on a piece of wood like a
home pod leaves like the coffee rings
that I leave all over this table like a
time-lapse video of like how long it
takes for the ring to pop up like a year
I think we are just about out of time
and that's gonna be it for the week and
we are off Monday for Presidents Day
yeah but coming up next week who wants
to who wants to fill everybody in and
our big plans have we been talking about
it alright brief a little bit yeah 3:58
baby yeah what are we talking about on
