had you worried about your privacy well
it turns out we were just getting warmed
up in its global government request
report Facebook revealed it received
almost 50,000 government requests for
user data in the last six months of 2015
topping the list of these inquisitive
countries India in the United States in
these cases user data can mean
everything from their IP address to
their actual wall posts and while we as
users are relinquishing our privacy it
seems like the US government is worried
about keeping its own anonymity as sixty
percent of these requests came with
non-disclosure agreements meaning your
account could have been accessed without
you even knowing it and even if your
account wasn't access the government can
still ask Facebook to block certain
posts if they violate local laws during
the recent terrorist attack in France
Facebook got hit with 32000 block
requests from the French government to
remove a photo in this specific case it
was to preserve the dignity of the
victims but there can be a fine line
between this and censorship this is the
first time Facebook has shared this data
publicly and stated it scrutinizes each
request for user data they receive for
legal sufficiency if a request appears
to be deficient or overly broad they
push back hard and will fight in court
if necessary for a network of over 1.6
billion users 50,000 requests may not
seem like a lot but judging by the
numbers it's a practice that appears to
be on the rise and that should be more
than enough to make you rethink your
next post</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
