Olympians are using technology to help
keep their head in the game including
sprinter Mike Rogers because my body's
already warmed up it turned on my brain
so my motor skills can always be already
be receptive what I'm doing halos sport
is a headset that uses neuro stimulation
to help improve the brains response to
training so the device works by applying
a small electrical impulse to the part
of the brain that's specific for
controlling movement so it's called the
motor cortex halo is designed to be worn
during warmups for 20 minutes
athletes can adjust the intensity of the
impulse with the app I'm feeling a
tingling sensation it's like slightly
like pins and needles running across I
tried out the halo sport testing my grip
strength before during and after wearing
the headset the results are in
what have we seen from ya know yeah so
Lexi it looks like you got better by
about 9%
we can't take credit for all 9% because
you were training and you were
practicing and you're probably just
getting better on your own but maybe we
can take credit for some portion of that
in the lead-up to the NFL Combine hailer
says players using the headsets or leg
strength improved by 12% Mike Rogers was
skeptical when he first tried halo but
soon felt a difference in performance
usually it takes me at least 2 or 3 reps
to get going I want to get efficient now
that I have been using the headset
everyone is right on the money but it's
just helped me feel calm against me gets
me ready faster other athletes like
beach volleyball a Kerri walsh-jennings
have used the vs. headband by sense labs
in training it senses brain waves and is
designed to help them focus for these
athletes using neuroscience to improve
performance is a no-brainer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
