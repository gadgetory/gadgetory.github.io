mobile is more convenient and popular
than ever
but it's also become more dangerous with
thieves finding new ways to steal your
information so try to limit the number
of places you type in your credit card
details payment services like PayPal
Apple pay Master Card master pass and
visa checkout let you pay across
multiple sites essentially what that
does is keeps your credit-card
information in one place instead of
giving it to dozens of different
merchants before you even get to a
payment page look for clues that it's a
legitimate and secure site or app you
want to make sure that there's that
little green closed lock up in the
left-hand corner you're gonna use one of
those shopping apps you have to be
really careful that it's what it claims
to be and beware of emails promising
deals click through to it from your web
browser rather than clicking from an
email because there are a lot of scam
emails mobile purchases are expected to
account for 34% of online revenue this
holiday shopping season according to
Adobe Analytics so take advantage of the
security features on your phone like
biometrics to add an extra layer of
protection so if you have the ability to
use touch ID or another fingerprint or
anything like that to keep your
information secure so before you have to
pay use that if you're shopping on the
go don't be tempted to use public Wi-Fi
you should imagine when you're using a
public Wi-Fi network that anyone can see
anything you're sending it's better to
use your data taking precautions when
shopping online can help stop getting
more than you bargained for in San
