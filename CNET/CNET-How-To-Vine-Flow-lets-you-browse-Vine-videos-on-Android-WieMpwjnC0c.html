only at the six-second video sharing
service launched by Twitter neglected to
release an android app at the same time
the service launched and while there
still might not be a way for Android
users to upload videos to vine service
there is a third party app called vine
flow that allows you to at least browse
buying videos but it is a bit limited in
features so let's take a look at it now
as you can see it's a pretty basic app
you have one video that shows up it'll
begin to play automatically once it
loads and then if you want to view
another video you hit next this is just
a feed of the latest videos that are
being uploaded through vines iOS app you
can't actually search for specific users
but you can search for hashtags if you
tap on home and then explore and you
could type in any hashtag you want to
view videos for if you do find one you
want to share you have the share options
up here as well through your normal
Android sharing you can't upload any
videos you can't sign into an account or
like I said you can't search user names
but it's a general start for an
unofficial client for vine until Twitter
releases their android version once
again this was Jason Cipriani was seen
at how to and that was vine flow on
Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
