cnet.com and I'm here with Plantronics
next generation wireless stereo
Bluetooth headset the backbeat go to
this model looks very similar to the
original backbeat go
but Plantronics has made a few small
changes to design for starters the
inline remote / microphone has been
tweaked so the buttons are easier to
operate by feel also the earphones are
now covered in a coating of p2i moisture
protection technology that makes them
water-resistant so you can wear them
while you're working out or when it's
raining outside the other changes are on
the inside the headphones now play
louder and sound better they offer good
clarity and a decent amount of bass
though it's crucial to get a tight seal
where they can end up sounding thin as
with all in ear headphones some people
will be able to get a better fit than
others I was able to get a tight seal
with the large ear tips and easily
paired the headphone with both an iPhone
4s and a samsung galaxy s4 and stream
music wirelessly from both devices with
only minor hiccups to be clear while
there's a cord that goes between the
earpieces these earphones don't plug
into anything they are indeed Wireless
and you can make calls with them like
the original backbeat go the new model
comes with little stabilizers to get a
more secure fit while they work pretty
well I think Plantronics could come up
with better stabilizers that really keep
the earphones in your ears even more
securely especially when you're running
as far as accessories go these guys come
with three different size of your tips
plus a USB charger they come in two
colors white or black and there's also a
version that comes with a charging case
for $99.99 or $20 more the idea behind
the case is that it not only protects
the earphones but it has a built-in
rechargeable battery for charging on the
go it's probably a good idea to get the
version with the case because the
Plantronics didn't improve the battery
life you still only get about 4.5 hours
of listening time when fully charged the
case can charge the headphones twice
which gets you up to over 13 hours of
battery life though you won't be able to
use the headphones while you're charging
them
I personally thought the case could
stand to be slightly larger to more
easily accommodate the headphones but
that's a small gripe I do like the
improvements Plantronics is made and
it's $79.99 these are clearly a better
value than the jaybird blue buds X
Bluetooth earphones which cost 179 99
those Jaybirds sound disappeared to the
original backbeat goes but the new go
twos sound the same as the Jaybirds I'm
David Connolly and that's the backbeat
go to a nice improvement on the original
and definitely worth checking out if
you're looking for an earbud style
