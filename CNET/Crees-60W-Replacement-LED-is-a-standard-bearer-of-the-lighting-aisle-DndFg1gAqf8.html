got a full review of the Cree 60 watt
replacement LED now this is a light that
puts out 85 lumens per watt at a nice
yellowy color temperature of 2,700 k so
it's got that warm glow that you might
be looking for then it gets there in
super efficient fashion using just nine
point five watts to get those 800 lumens
that's better than any of these bulbs
can say the closest that you'll get from
these is the Philips slim style which is
going to use 10.5 wats to get 800 lumens
so Cree is the most efficient another of
crees strong selling points is its price
at just ten dollars per bulb that's one
of the best values you'll find in the
lighting I'll it's not quite as cheap as
the slim style though this is a nine
dollar bulb but with the Cree you're
getting a 10 year warranty that's a lot
longer than Philips plus a slight uptick
and efficiency the two of those put it
over the top in my book Cree also does a
nice job with its color temperature
these bulbs are all aiming for 2700 k
that kind of warm white glow of an
incandescent and if you look at this
page that we've spread out on the table
and divided into three lighting sections
the Cree is a lot closer to that
incandescent warm white light the
Philips is a little too warm it's a
little too yellowy it's kind of low on
that temperature scale closer to twenty
six hundred and twenty seven hundred now
the Cree isn't a perfect LED we found
that it does buzz a little bit when
you're using it with an in-wall dimmer
switch so if that's the type of setup
that you're replacing a bulb for you're
going to want to splurge on the philips
LED that's the best bulb for in-wall
dimmer in our tests also in terms of CRI
the Cree bulb is right around 80 same as
the Philips bulb that's a pretty average
score for LEDs if you want something
that's going to be better at bringing
colors out and making Reds look red and
blues look blue you might want to go
with something like the Cree TW series
or the GE reveal or even the standard GE
LED which does a better overall job
getting those colors looking right and
for those of you who prefer hotter color
temperatures the Cree bulb also comes
available in a 5000 k daylight variety
giving you this nice hot whitish light
overall though this crease 60 watt
replacement LED is an exceptional value
at ten dollars I think the best value of
any le
you'll find on the Shelf right now if
I'm heading out to the store to get a
new light this is the one that I'm
probably going to pick foreseen that I'm
right Chris
