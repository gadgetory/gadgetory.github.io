mountain view inside here there's a
discussions going on entrepreneurs are
listening to talks about how to start
their business how to get funding how to
get customers outside here there's a
little street fair of startup companies
showing their wares looking for
investors looking to hire people let's
go check out see what they're up to what
brings you to this event and what are
you up to so what my company does is we
automate all of the legal documents for
startups so this is my target market
startups angel investors incubators and
the law firms that service those kinds
of clients and what I will say is it's
uncanny that really this doesn't exist
out there in them in the market well no
there's a legal zoom yeah there is legal
zoom I would say what we are as we are
like legal zoom but we use software to
produce all the documents and we're also
focused initially on technology
companies so we address issues that they
don't so Israel what brings you to the
startup conference I'm here to presents
a product that we built called restock
it consists of nfc-enabled bracelet so
it's a smart bracelet that can you
upload your wallet information to the
cloud and you also download an app with
it and that way you can just go around
and use the bracelet as your wallet the
way it works is basically the app you
put it let's say the phone on top of the
bracelet it vibrates it get the data
from the cloud for instance here in this
case we retrieve my identity information
here this is my image for fun but you
could do more with that basically this
would be a point-of-sale system as well
we're at a club or beach club where you
having fun and those venues you don't
want to want to pull out your phone you
just can wave your your wristband and
make those transactions
so touch Barry is a keyboard on Android
devices so it helps you type thirty
percent faster than the stock keyboard
we also provide a better like typing
experience so that it can correct your
mistakes when your types we developed a
technology called predictive sliding so
you don't have to finish the homework
look at this we got cupcakes z billing
cupcakes you have to pay for them online
we'll be back let's see what else we got
here oh this is awesome this is what
every conference needs is a giveaway
check it out hand sanitizer it's a dirty
business this one's going home to the
five-year-old why did you come to the
street fair what are you looking to get
out of it a lot of inspiration I'm a new
business and I'm a start-up as with
everybody else and I just want to see
what's going on out there what what are
the hot companies what are the
innovators what who's disrupting the
market and how can I be a part of that
are we in a bubble I don't think we're
in a bubble I were in a different
universe but I don't think we're in a
bubble I think this is part of the new
technology we learned lessons from the
last bubble these people have to be
doing things they have to make a
difference and they have to be usable so
there you have it from the startup
conference in Mountain View i'm rafe
