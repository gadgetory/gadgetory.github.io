2014 will be all about wearable
technology wearables is a brand new
wide-open thing and there's a lot of
room for it to develop and grow expect
to see the market of smartwatches
explode several manufacturers are
already keeping time including Samsung
pebble and Qualcomm 2014 could finally
be the year Apple clocks in with a
long-rumoured iwatch I have high hopes
that if Apple were to release something
which is not outside the realm of
possibility that it would be a very
complete experience and it would also be
something very accessible and it went to
tie into a lot of the Apple ecosystem ok
glass another well hyped wearable Google
glass is expected to become available to
the general public one of the
interesting things about glass whether
you love them or hate them is that
there's nothing like it out there on the
market right now and certainly not from
anybody with the cloud or name
recognition as Google it's not the only
tech that hopes to land on your head
virtual reality glasses from meta that
project holographic images and the
Scully motorcycle helmet with built-in
heads up display could have a seeing the
world in a whole new way curves are in
in the new year expect to see curved
screens on both televisions and
smartphones similar to the current
offerings from LG and Samsung there is a
little bit of an ergonomic benefit to it
all things being equal if you've got a
straight screen phone and a curved
screen phone may be more comfortable to
hold the one with the curved screen in
your pocket at your ear in your hand
even because it sort of reduces the
footprint so it doesn't seem quite as
large but you may not even need to touch
your device's to control them gesture
technology could become more mainstream
and instead of using your fingerprint to
unlock devices how about your heartbeat
it's on the horizon so maybe tech will
be the new black for the new year in San
Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com for
