and today we're gonna take a look at the
Sony STR DN 1040 this is the top of
Sony's main line of AV receivers
featuring built-in bluetooth airplay and
Wi-Fi and is currently selling for $600
this is a big bulky full-size AV
receiver but Sony's actually done a nice
job of giving it a clean and modern look
it's relatively uncluttered with buttons
with just the volume and the input knob
grabbing most of your attention
unfortunately that minimalist look
doesn't quite carry over to the remote
which is covered top to bottom and
buttons that makes it tough to use and
it pushes crucial buttons like the
volume rocker all the way down to the
bottom
now most AV receiver interfaces look
hopelessly out of date
but Sony really did an excellent job of
updating this model with crisp high-def
graphics you get really nice
plain-english options like watch and
listen and the most impressive part may
be how responsive it feels it feels like
you're navigating a PlayStation 3 rather
than the typical sluggish AV receiver
feel there's nothing else like this for
$600 and it gives the whole receiver a
more overall polished feel the big
features inside the receiver are
built-in bluetooth airplay and Wi-Fi
Bluetooth makes it easy to wirelessly
stream audio from nearly any smartphone
or tablet while airplay offers slightly
better sound quality from iOS devices
Wi-Fi is also nice because it lets you
take advantage of the integrated
networking features without needing a
separate Ethernet connection those
features include smart phone control and
streaming services like Pandora Slacker
Sony Music Unlimited and internet radio
that's not quite as many services as on
other receivers but it doesn't matter
that much since you're usually better
off streaming from a mobile device
anyway the sony is also packed with
ports including 8 HDMI inputs which is
more than any other receiver at this
price I doubt anybody really needs eight
ports but since nearly every device
supports HDMI these days it's nice to
have some spare inputs for future
devices sound quality on the strd on
1040 is excellent we had resident audio
while Steve Guttenberg give it a listen
and he was really impressed with its
clarity and depth it could deliver big
powerful sound on movies but then it
also did an excellent job when we
switched to more subtle acoustic
recordings we've auditioned a handful of
2013 receivers so far and so far that
STR DN 1040 stood out as our favorite of
the bunch so overall you're really
getting a lot with the STR DN 1040 and
the main question is whether it's worth
the extra money over Sony's other
excellent AV receiver the STR D and 840
the 840 also includes bluetooth airplay
and Wi-Fi and it costs one hundred and
fifty dollars less and while it doesn't
have the neat interface or the eight
HDMI inputs it's plenty well featured
for the average buyer still the step ups
on the STR DN 1040 are pretty nice so
it's a tempting option if you have a
bigger budget even though most buyers
will get an overall better value from
the STR dn8 40 I'm Matthew moscovia and
this is the Sony STR dn 1040</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
