what is called the rose and it's
actually for 65-inch 4k displays that
are curved and then put together in a
configuration so the petals curl onto
themselves like a rose it's pretty
beautiful I've just been sitting here
watching it for about the past five
minutes and it's an LG display so it's
showing you the latest and greatest of
everything in TV OLED and more displays
here come on inside there's a lot more
to see I'll show you around so there's
lots of screens obviously all of the fun
stuff happening inside and over here
something interesting but hey look who I
found
it is seen its resident TV expert David
Katz Maya oh hi funny to find you yes
fancy meeting you yeah I do I'm having a
fantastic show I notice you are looking
at some transparent olin this is crazy
look at this thing so hang on
so it's the panel in the front and then
I can there's a there's a gap here so I
can stick my hand in there and as a
display saying they made the
transparency even more so let's even
more like a window it does and say you
so it's like they saying 40%
transparency yes very high in store or
if you want to buy some clothing and
have it see it looks like it's solid
it's solid and then you turn it off
and it becomes transparent I visit
there's some buttons over there that you
press to make it transparent I don't
know which ones that are it is but we
did say it before this is pretty hmm
let's see
no oh we did something we did something
let's move on we have a lot of the I
guess more commercial signage stuff here
so this is like I think one of the
whiteboard walls the 86 inch yeah right
so there would we were doing some
demonstrations of riding on this screen
should I should I be bold enough and
write
we can learn something yeah it's like hi
I just made something hi
from CNN
how original of me I think that was very
original I know of course handwriting oh
thank you I've been working well I'm
working on that thank you all right
let's talk about variance okay obviously
we have a bunch of LCD displays sorry
LCD verses earlier like why would you be
thinking of buying an LCD when you could
buy an eyelid in a 75 s they're cheaper
yeah this is gonna cost a lot of money
then whole debt especially with these 8k
resolutions so that's really the
difference image quality oh that's gonna
be better
but these LCD displays you know they
look really good and they say they make
some improvement so one of the big
things here they up the pixel count yeah
but is there any 8k content no no good
watch on this thing yet now but it's
kind of a future-proof thing this the
first time you've seen the 65 so that's
something doing it's like an engineering
feat they get the pixels down really
time I notice there are a couple of 65
inches here in the LG display and that's
a new size Falchi isn't it yeah to get
them pixels down to 65 inches with all
this 8k resolution it's it's it's pretty
impressive something else that really
wowed me is over here it's actually
speakers in the screen it's the 88 inch
crystal sound OLED yeah come over here
let's take a look so you don't see any
speakers there's nothing here it's all
integrated into the screen and the
actual proof is in the pudding when you
turn it on can we hear some of the sound
from this
I don't know if it's gonna be kicked up
on my microphone
just be quiet for a second and let you
hear it where I stand right in front of
it
so I don't know if you could hear that
on the microphone but I'm a huge audio
geek and I love I could he's so
directional I could hear the sound
coming from above there's actually a UFO
demo that runs now and you can hear the
UFO is like going straight up and down
the screen on the sides as well so
that's pretty impressive has LG had a
product like this before so we've seen
this crystal sound which is basically
the the TV screen is the speaker
actually Sony produced you know a TV
that has this the last couple TVs
they've done for OLED have this
technology in it we haven't seen it with
this kind of directionality I said
they've improved the location awareness
of the sound and it really kind of lines
up with what's on the screen it also
helps to have an 88 inch screen yeah
it's pretty massive bigger the bigger
speaker the better it is the bigger you
know screen that's a speaker the better
I love it okay speaking of 88 inches
it's the magic number 88 8k this is it
so we saw this from LG Display last year
they had an 88 8k so what's new with the
one this year they say they've done a
little bit to improve the technology
that's essentially the same but you know
again you have this year so that's
pretty cool we're gonna see one of these
to be able to buy who knows how much you
know basically remortgage your house and
then you can also previous was a tiny 77
so now you're up to 88 so much happening
here at the LG booth and of course
another 65 inch 8k - and then finally we
have the video wall or LED video wall
here Paris Paris I love Paris in the
springtime we could burst in Ferb we
could burst into song but I think I'll
spare your eardrums so deep play cats
thanks for taking the tool with me we're
gonna go back and try on some clothes on
that virtual OLED transparent wall I
think that's all from LG display at CES
2019 stay tuned to seen it we'll have
plenty more coverage coming your way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
