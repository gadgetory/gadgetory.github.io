Toshiba Q 300 solid state drive now this
one is quite interesting because
supposed to be a low-end everyday
computing dry but it's quite expensive
costing on average more than 50 cent per
gigabyte this top capacity of 960
gigabyte right here has the suggested
price of 4 and $50 that's kind of crazy
because this one here the top not one
tear by Samsung 850 pro right here can
be found for just four hundred and
thirty dollars now in return for the
cost the performance of the Toshiba is
quite underwhelming it's not super slow
but it's about the slowest I've seen so
clearly this drive here has the art
combo of high pricing and low
performance now other than that this one
here is a standard internal drive and
will work in any home application where
a regular hard drive like this one right
here or this bigger one right here is
used and even though it is slow among
other SSD it is still so much faster
than any regular hard drive and will
still boost informative computer a great
deal it's just that there's so many
option on market right now that are
cheaper and likely better I'm not sure
why you soon wait until Black Friday for
this one
for more on this one you check out my
full review asean calm basically this is
a quite good dry it's just too expensive
so unless you get a free hour-long
massage bundle with it
you should not go and get it now the
question is why am i having it right now
and that's because I'm dumb going this
has been the first look at the Toshiba
q3 hundreds on state drive
okay now charlie oh yeah that's what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
