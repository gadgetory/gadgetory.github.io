2015 but I've got a solution that the
cubes
and the big kids like me are going to
love it's an eye tracking system that
helps you piece together Lego using your
eyes you still have to use your hands to
put it together now if you remember
making Lego when you were younger you
probably remember the actual paper
instruction booklet with the come in the
box now this can get torn or damaged and
it can be quite difficult to follow this
system is incredibly intuitive so it's
using the eye tribe tracker this is a US
$99 tracker and it fits onto a system
and then Lego has provided the
instructions for use to make 2 different
types of Lego kits we have a duct and we
also have a car from here once you
calibrate the app using it your eyes you
just need to find the Lego head in the
center of the box here you'll see that
there are certain pieces that you'll
need to put together so the first piece
is the bates and once we've found that
we want to hover over to the right arrow
but all you need to do is just look it
will then complete the circle and
provide you the next piece that you'll
need to
on your lego duck keep going with the
process until it you're pretty much
finished but if you want to see your
progress along the way or you're not
quite sure where a particular piece fits
in on the model you can actually look
into the model using i gestured look
around that zoom in and zoom out and
spin it around as well it's really cool
unfortunately it's not available for
purchase yet but it will be available at
Lego world's in Copenhagen pretty soon
I'm Lexi fubini's with C net here at CES
2015 and that's been a look at the eye
tracker to make Lego using your eyes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
