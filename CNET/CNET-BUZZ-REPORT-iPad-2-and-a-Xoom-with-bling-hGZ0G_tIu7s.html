report the show about the tech news that
everyone is talking about this week it's
the eminent new iPad your brain on cell
phones and a really sad facebook breakup
story but first it's the gadget of the
week the gadget of the week is the
motorola xoom not the regular one that
jumps like you and me get i mean i know
that one launched this week and
everything and it's all exciting and is
it too expensive for the Wi-Fi version
and what not but that's actually not the
zoom I mean I mean the limited edition
gold Motorola Xoom all for the beautiful
people it's a special gold plated tablet
made only for Oscar nominees and hosts
it'll be in their high-priced goodie
bags on Sunday at the Academy Awards
sadly half the people who get these will
probably drunkenly leave them on chairs
at the Vanity Fair afterparty and now
for the news Apple will hold an event
March second to almost certainly
announced the ipad to the real questions
now or whether Apple will also announce
the iphone 5 and how soon the new iPad
will come out so that it can counter the
threat from the coming crush of Android
tablets there were some rumors this week
that there might be ipad 2 production
delays but then other analysts and apple
blogs rushed to say there were
absolutely no delays and don't even be
thinking androids going to get a little
window of opportunity here folks no no
iPad will rule forever in other news a
new medical study this week shows that
cell phone radiation has a measurable
effect on nearby cells in your brain in
fact the study said that areas of the
brain near the phone's antenna showed
unusual and surprising increases in
activity during your call but they also
says they don't know whether that
increased activity in your brain is
actually bad for you dude it's bad I
guarantee you it's bad i'm not saying
cell phones cause cancer I'm just saying
they probably do also this week
developer danlo and hurts created a
facebook app that would email you any
changes in the relationship status of
specified
friends so you could keep track of when
your crush finally dumps that loser
she's dating or you know when those
people get together and you know it's
just totally not going to work out then
when they break up you can send out your
little i-told-you-so cards unfortunately
even though the app racked up three
point six million users in like two days
Facebook came along and shut it down and
disabled low and hurts his account and
Facebook won't even say why and they
won't give loan hurts his records and
his t-shirts back worst breakup ever but
hey myspace I hear he's available and
now for a few other tech headlines of
the week thursday the 24th with Steve
Jobs his birthday so happy birthday
Steve hope you're doing okay buddy
possibly as a little birthday present
Apple shareholders this week rejected a
proposal to force Apple to reveal a
succession plan in case jobs doesn't
come back to work Steve did not make an
appearance at the shareholders meeting
though so you know figured Tim Cook
microsoft released its first Windows
Phone 7 patch this week and it is not
going well the update has caused some
people major problems including bricking
a few phones so that's just the kind of
press you need when you're up against
iphone and android not good a couple in
Egypt just named their newborn daughter
Facebook in honor of the social
networking site that sparked a regime
toppling revolution they couldn't have
just put it on their license plate and
finally WikiLeaks open up a gift shop
selling shirts and bags and stuff to
raise more money because if there's
anybody I'm going to give my credit card
info to its WikiLeaks although I do kind
of want a Julian Assange beach towel
he'll be cool alright that's the buzz
report for this week everyone I'm
Hollywood and thank you for watching
unfortunately even though the app
wrapped up balls you could make a card I
told you and then like a little broken
heart picture yeah that'd be funny</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
