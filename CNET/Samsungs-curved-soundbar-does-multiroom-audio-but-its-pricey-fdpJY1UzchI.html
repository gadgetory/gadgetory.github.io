will have quickly noticed that
conventional AV equipment looks kind of
weird sitting underneath it
but never fear Samsung has come to your
rescue with its hwj 7500 sound bar which
features a curved look designed to
complement your new TV at $800 though
this is a premium unit and it offers
some nice design touches including a
brushed aluminum top in addition to a
bunch of features such as Wireless multi
room music at 48 and 1/2 inches across
the Samba is designed to accompany
Samsung TVs between 48 inches and 65
inches the main unit houses eight
drivers including side firing surround
speakers plus it's accompanied by a
large wireless subwoofer the system
comes with a kit remote control which
offers a lot of options but it's still
relatively easy to use if you don't need
to change settings that is unfortunately
there's no on-screen display despite the
system offering both HDMI in and out and
just be aware that if you're setting up
Wi-Fi get a paper clip we're not kidding
it's worth doing though because
Samsung's multi-room system offers
plenty of streaming options including
Spotify connect and sounds a lot better
than Bluetooth which it also offers
sound quality overall is pretty good
especially if you tweak it with the
onboard EQ but some rivals like the Sony
HD st5 and even cheaper systems such as
the amaha Y a s 203 do offer better
performance but the problem is they do
look funny sitting in front of your
television so if you want something that
does that and performs decently the
Samsung is a good choice this is ty
