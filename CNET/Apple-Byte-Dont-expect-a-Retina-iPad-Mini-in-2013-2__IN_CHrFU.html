welcome to the apple byte it's
everything inside the world of Apple
like the creamy filling of a Twinkie in
the back in case you didn't know alright
let's get to the show and a new report
from frost &amp;amp; sullivan that says apple
has claimed the majority of the
streaming device market share with the
Apple TV at fifty-six percent these are
dedicated streaming boxes so you won't
find the ps3 or xbox but Roku came in
second at 21.5 percent and Tebow came in
third at six point five percent the
others were made up of familiar names
like the boxee TV and logitech revue so
not too bad for a hobby device that has
added more channels like HBO go and
watch ESPN but everyone has continued to
ask what will make the apple TV TV
special and why should we even care well
according to tech journalist Jessica
lessin she reports that apple has been
negotiating with cable companies and TV
networks to offer a premium version of
the Apple TV service that would allow
you to skip ads and would compensate the
networks for the lost revenue there are
no specifics for how the service would
work or how much it would cost but Apple
has been talking about how they want to
make the current TV experience better
and this is a pretty compelling option
now I think the big question comes down
to how much would you be willing to pay
a month on top of your current bills for
a service like this is it thirty forty
fifty dollars a month or more let us
know your price and your thoughts send
them to the apple bite at cnet com and
we'll talk about it next week now an
iPhone use according to all things D and
jefferies analyst Peter Misek production
ramp-up of the iphone 5s should begin
around the end of this month music says
that Apple started a small batch
production of the iphone 5s last month
and is ready to ramp up now didja x is
also reporting that the next-gen iphone
may see constrained supplies at launch
due to poor yield rates of the
fingerprint recognition chip designed by
authentic that will be included in the
phone they claim it actually delayed the
iPhones ramp up for production to late
July because of issues with producing
the fingerprint sensor now we're still
expecting to see the next iPhone
one in the fall around early September
now and some potentially sobering news
for all you ipad mini fans multiple
reports are now saying that Apple will
be releasing a thinner and lighter iPad
Mini this year but brace yourself the
retina iPad Mini will see an almost
bezel free design but it's expected to
launch in early 2014 I know how you feel
first world problems now digit times
also reports that Apple's 5th gen ipad
is on its way with a thinner and lighter
design and the supply chain is starting
small-scale production on the new
full-size iPad this month all right onto
the quick bites Apple and Samsung have
had their beef but the korea economic
daily reports Apple and Samsung have
signed a deal for the two companies to
work together on future a-series chips
for iOS devices specifically covering a
9 chips based on the 14 nanometer
process starting in 2015 and more
frenemies working together Microsoft has
released a native Outlook Web App mail
application for iOS devices now owa for
iphone and ipad are free but in order to
use the app you'll need to subscribe to
their office 365 service and have the
latest update of exchange online so
there's a lot of pieces that need to be
in place and music creators apple has
released a brand new version of logic
dubbed get it Logic Pro X for 199 now
one of the new features is the
instrument track called drummer that
automatically plays along with your song
with a wide variety of drumming styles
and techniques now the logic remote
companion app it's on the iPad and it
allows to control and play with logic
from your iPad well that's also free and
finally in a new segment that you know
will do once in a while and I really
decided to make it up it's our Apple
biter of the month I know so check it
