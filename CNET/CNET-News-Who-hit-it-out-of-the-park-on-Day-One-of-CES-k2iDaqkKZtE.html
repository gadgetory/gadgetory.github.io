you live from the cnet stage at CES 2016
I'm Brian Cooley Abele joined by mr.
Scott Stein and we're going to recap the
major news and announcements from today
the official first day of CES 2016 might
fool some folks cuz we were really
jamming yesterday yeah this feels like
it's been the 19th day yes I see yes I
was gonna go there is yeah it's amazing
we'll see we've talked about so much
already and we went some of us even been
briefing about some of these things so
yeah it does feel like we've known about
some of these for a while but everyone's
getting to see it experience yes this is
interesting yesterday was the press
events day that we brought to you
exhaustively lots of blog posts and
videos and slideshows and are anchored
coverage of the press conferences and
then CES opens up kind of like for the
industry to come in here it's not like
it's it's really opening today it's
opening the floor today but CES
officially started jamming first thing
yesterday morning so it's so kind of a
split open anyway let's jump right into
it a virtual reality something that
we're both really interested in VR is
big here at the show no surprise there
but surprising news came out here today
from oculus that just announced finally
some specifics right the rift headset
the most celebrated of all the VR
high-performance headsets will go for
six hundred dollars and will ship in
April we've got something official we
can hang our hat on so yeah it's uh oh
yeah I know good feeling about that I
mean yeah it was like 600 bucks what do
you think oh you're watching you're
watching your videos I it's a high price
because first of all the development kit
cost less and you know but but I else is
saying they want to get this people's
hands they're saying they're not you
know they're trying to cut it as
affordable as possible but we solve your
headsets last year that were mobile gear
VR hundred dollars you snap it into your
samjhe phone yeah google cardboard is
free it's nothing like this but six
hundred dollars sounds high plus the
coolest part of oculus are those touch
controllers those are not included in
this package but they are coming out
they're coming out they delay it until
later this year so who knows how much
those cost then you have to buy the
gaming PC oculus that you can get a
whole package minus the controllers for
fifteen hundred dollars are going to
bundle it so they're still standing by
that but it's a lot we're in the serious
gamer price realm
we offer the whole kit once you get a
machine that's powerful enough if you
don't already have one controllers
headset accessory something I'm sure
yeah and then who knows how much the
htc's will be because I feel like that
will be even higher Oh interesting I
think so because it's including more HTC
vive the other PC platform they want to
include everything in that bundle which
they have not priced yet you get to
lighthouse sensors which shul A's errs
around your room sensors that monitor
your movements right then you get the
two wireless controllers and the headset
so you got a thing well that seems
certainly closer to a grand yeah I think
it could be a grand and that really gets
into a high territory yeah very
specialized who's going to go in for
that but I did look at vibe here the
coolest thing about I've is that camera
the camera does something that VR should
do more often it lets you see the real
world yeah when you got that crazy
goggle on your head it goes into some
sort of almost feels like that vision
and which means that you can you can see
everything almost like a heat map the
the room furniture people so if you get
too close to a wall you won't hit the
wall and also you'll be able to find the
sofa not without having to take that
thing off all the time more VR needs
that huh and they tweak the hardware it
feels better I look ridiculous wearing
this everyone does everyone does
everyone does you send it being these
weird postures looking at strange places
yeah it's absurd the controller's it
very similar in some ways to oculus
touch it's it's amazing to experience
but again oh wow I should no one should
ever watch themselves on VR VR fertile
teta it'll retail bring you right on
down all right send the same category
vaguely we saw something that's a very
different take on AR yes which is the
Intel daiquiri helmet this is meant for
enterprise use here's an example of it
this is an example of let's say a person
working in a power plant or a nuclear
factory or something and they have the
helmet that has a forward-looking
realsense 3d camera an Intel product and
it's got an AR of display ability on the
visor so it can see what you're looking
at make sense of it and then animate it
in front of you it's definitely you know
in the AR camp but so rich
and it reaches to the cloud to figure
out what it's looking at and then to
pull in augmentation in real time that
is about the current state of what it's
looking at as opposed to stale
pre-existing information that may be a
lesser headset would do this is it looks
amazing I know demo looks great it's
similar in a lot of ways to have
microsoft hololens has been explored
except this is shipping now so they're
getting a leg up on that but it's also
showing that hollow lens they've already
said it's for enterprise for now and
that's where it's going to be targeted
and other smart glass manufacturers seem
to be leaning on that google glass the
next version has been settled the
enterprise so it sounds like for now
smart glasses are going on a price
interesting yes has moved away from
consumer they don't know what to do with
the yet but companies like Carl Zeiss
optics actually developing trying to
make a class nice reference design idea
today yeah I saw it looks like my
glasses and they're carving out a space
where you can put electronics so it's
like they want to if build it they will
come maybe they're getting ready for
that idea yeah it's still a while off I
think before we're putting smart things
to see a company that's going into the
electronics business without doing
anything electronic I means ice is
giving you a plastic and glass and
sculpted reference frame but they're not
doing any the guts yeah it's a start
that was funded by Carl Carl Zeiss fully
independent company and they're doing
this exactly is it's all classic optics
they're just carving out the pot I
thought that was kind of cool Tesla this
apiece me because tech companies don't
know how to do that no don't style you
need that help they need that help big
time so they're doing that ok let's go
to well let's switch to the automotive
front which would be a whole different
haul that be the north hall which is
here at the Las Vegas Convention Center
the faraday future is probably the most
talked about car here this is a
long-expected chinese backed electric
hyper car that has a single seat that
has obviously extreme performance very
exotic provocative lines as you can see
high connectivity of course what's
interesting about this car though a
canopy over it but what's interesting
bout this car in terms of the auto
industry strategy is not that it's
electric or anything of that other stuff
but the fact that they've made it on
what's called a modular platform a truly
modular platform they can literally in
the manufacturing they can reduce or
extend the size and length of
this thing in modular slices which is
more so than what other car makers do
that sounds a little bit in the weeds
and it is kind of inside baseball but
that's that's a really big topic in the
car industry I'm a little disappointed
because this is a super pie in the sky
hypercar for nobody I like to see you
know I get more excited about a Hyundai
Sonata than a Lamborghini all day long
I'm weird that way I like cars that real
people can appreciate and buy and really
get use out of you know I dig the
supercars but this isn't that category
and it's like okay talk to me when you
guys have brought this down two or three
models to what real people are gonna buy
yeah when I was a kid and I was one of
the dad to car shows like it was really
like things like that I would be excited
it's like it about beautiful view is
thing it's like a glimpse of the future
but yeah this is the total weird taste
of somebody out there totally bizarre
but it is a huge buzz topic and they've
got a big big plant their opening here
in Nevada kind of like you know who over
the Tesla side another car that came out
was the Volkswagen buddy electric
concept that flashes back to the old VW
classic microbus now to me it looks like
a toyota sienna but supposedly I'm
supposed to see microbus in that I
really don't aside from the badge that's
not agree better than the classic beetle
our beetle bus no no one took that the
Woodstock no I don't think so right it's
like a giant Hot Wheels car kind of does
San design yeah but an electric effort
by Volkswagen it's always interesting to
see a German car company do pure
electric because they were banging away
at diesel for so long as a national
industry a lot of them are coming to the
electric table the other pure electric
of course being detailed here not
completely unveiled is available for is
a Chevy Volt this is the craziest naming
story in the auto industry bolt and volt
sound almost exactly the same over a
phone connection unless you're in person
and then someone says you mean bolt or
volt and you say bolt or volt again they
still didn't hear it right so then you
tell them the first letter you say it
with a V well the V sounds like a bee so
you still can't tell what they're
talking about V&amp;amp;B sound the same volt
and bolt soundless and did anybody check
this out before they went to market with
this I think I'd been secretly confusing
them for years 20 a lot of people were
not your
yeah anyway so let's talk about
appliances what do we got there well the
one we were talking about yesterday that
ridiculously crazy samsung fridge it's
okay get it out of my mind I don't you
like it yeah it has it as ideas I'm
going to like it really what two things
I like the most the cameras that are
built in that's cool answers a real neat
how many times do you go to the grocery
store you're gonna buy something extra
if you already have it and you don't
know what's in the fridge but the
cameras will let you log in remotely and
see what's in the fridge snapshots not
video ah the other thing that I thought
was interesting is the the relay or the
mirroring of what's on your TV so the
TV's on in both places kitchen and
dining room whatever because how many
times we sitting there cooking and doing
this looking through the doorway at the
TV because we hear we hear the scene
just got interesting and we do this and
I still really like the idea I'd oh you
could do this some other way but but
some sort of central hub where people
could have a little white board well
family community and I'm on the fence on
that still I know it's you guys do
another way but I feel like there's
still something in that maybe not on a
fridge yeah but I still need to put
something like that in in the kitchen
it's quite a few the family hug our
families in it yeah yeah but it's gonna
be quite Mele Hubbard I forgot about
that it's all right well speaking of
cool we've got a very cool announcement
that came from LG in the area of
refrigerators for this one our own BTW
is standing by at the LG booth to tell
us about it BTW what's up
alright Brian and Scott I'm a one-up you
right now you're talking about
refrigerators frigerator frigerators I
got a refrigerator right here I got my
man Matt Matt what's up man what's up
how's it going say hi to your mom your
dad to love one mom dad what's up he
famous he famous you know so this is
LG's signature section of their booth
and it's really a lot of products at our
proof of concepts things we might see in
the future but really collect name in
the future yep he said definitely know
how many times we've seen things here
that are not definitely oh man take my
word for it so um I want to see that
this is supposed to be like one of the
coolest frigerators here on the show can
you kind of show us some of the things
this thing done yeah let's do it man so
check it out this is going to be
tempered glass here on the front if you
double tap it's gonna light up and show
you a display just so you can kind of
see what's here for easy grabbing this
is called a door within a door okay so
you're gonna have obviously your beard
here and your hard ciders all your stuff
that you drink a lot is gonna be here
for easy access mine are like orange
sodas me too man me too hahaha no and
then they moved the display over here so
you can control your refrigerator in
your freezer temperature right here okay
question can I do the little knock knock
no one's watching do it knock knock
who's there boom you can't do that with
your refrigerator alright think so
alright check it out you see this little
door open light I'm gonna step right
here I'm just gonna automatically open
for you did you see that Brian and Scott
you saw that right that's what I thought
they saw let's do it again oh la la it's
like magic Matt told me one time but
wait there's more but wait there's more
check it out open the freezer drawers
and they're gonna automatically slide
out for you but say you have this one
open you're unloading like some things
that need to be frozen you give it a few
seconds the other ones are gonna slide
back flush no can your frigerator do
that that just happened it just happened
all right hey thanks for your time all
right appreciate good guy later bro all
right Matt that's one of the things you
can find at the LG Signature Series all
right we're gonna keep on walking around
showing off another concept their dual
view curved OLED right it's kind of
smooth curves smooth it out we don't I
don't think you gonna be using this at
home or anything but you can see it
probably used in like corporate displays
or cool buildings and then we also have
over here another LG signature their
washer and dryer double loads we're
gonna maybe visit this back in a little
bit but let's just keep on going this
way cuz I got I got one thing I got to
show you okay let's come over here so
smart appliances big thing here but what
about the smartest smartest styla sila
Bonet come here just really quickly tell
us what this is this is the LG styler
and what does it do why is it shaking
like a salt shaker well you're watching
it shake shake shake shake shake away
and I'm gonna do that again shake shake
shake all right so it's teams and shakes
the clothes all just like this right
yeah you're watching it basically it
will shake 220 times in a minute in
conjunction with using a very powerful
true steam generator so with that steam
is coming up and it's literally shaking
though usually shake together with a
curry we're silent are a fine day so
much my name you guys stick it here cnet
com for everything more CES 2016 we'll
see you guys okay welcome back to CES
in-depth live at the scene that stage at
CES 2016 with the Jolly Neapolitans
Brian Cooley and Scott's done recapping
the news of the show so far next up a
topic near and dear to your wrist yes
wearables wearables and it's it's it's
hard for one person to cover we got a
lot of people out there looking at stuff
at this show the big one that everybody
was following was Fitbit Fitbit made
their announcement there's a market
leader in wearables yep and and they
announced a watch and I think the
reaction was a little mixed it's called
the Fitbit blaze okay two hundred
dollars this does a lot of what the
Fitbit surge did last year the the Obama
SmartWatch the one that he uses it to
get fit does not have GPS but it pops
out it has a variety of accessories is
almost Apple watch like in the sense
that
it's competing for style steal the other
and that's a trend throughout the show
materials are big at the watch category
this year gets notifications it gets
just some of them by design it also has
some coaching a little bit fitstar which
was acquired by them they put a couple
of coaching routines and maybe we'll see
a little more of that that's the thing
that's missing in wearables but you know
some people wonder what am I going to do
with this why is it trying to keep you
with watches other people think well I
don't really want a fancy SmartWatch I
want to watch it does fitness in just a
bit more just a little more notification
yeah so might actually do quite well
it's interesting yeah maybe we're trying
too hard with SmartWatch too rich too
complex too many different use cases is
trying to map to as opposed to just give
me a little bit that we can all relate
to yes and the fitness piece and a
fashion piece and I think we're a little
a little bit away from the super
connected watch it's a remote maybe
wireless networking that's all of the
discussion yeah it's like early
smartphones right now that stuff could
be great later when homes get more
connected yeah now you're out in front
of its out in front of its skis
potentially at this point the other
trend is more brands getting into
wearables it's all about fitness at this
show under armour huge brand yeah
announced a ton of fitness tech health
box and connected running shoes you had
the shoes on yes I wear shoes yesterday
these are these have a chip inside you
do not charge them you do not replace
the battery you can't replace the
battery they last the life of the shoe
which for a running shoe it's also about
450 miles these checks tried under
armour has a new app that launched this
week that is meant to be more of a
complete hub interestingly it allows a
lot of other hardware to connect with
ings and Fitbit in apple health that's a
scale the health box is a scale heart
rate strap fitness band and they also
have heart rate headphones coming out so
they're just throwing the ball you've
got a pretty complete array right now of
a fitness platform not just products and
they're going a little bit after apple
health kit they're trying to unify the
fitness pieces in one platform yeah and
after Fitbit and they're trying i think
it's reminiscent of what nike had done
before the question is you know is it
all going to work people do people want
all that stuff is it too specialized or
two it's all you know they're really
just covering all the bases bye
I think some of the ideas are
interesting some of them you wonder like
the fitness band while it has a lot of
stuff they're just so many fitness bands
so many that aren't terribly
differentiated know and at some point
you just want to say I'm going with a
popular platform which is why I think
Fitbit is doing right very well there's
a well-known highly regarded brand it's
not an upstart so they don't need to do
that on the other hand when you've got a
well we got regarded Brandt you have to
reposition it now under armour is known
for soft goods for fabric products yes
all of a sudden its electronics brand
surprisingly no smart clothing that
would be the thing i would think on
doing a viper bait leave no smart fiber
excess skin and others do that yeah they
are out of that mean that's interesting
yeah maybe in the future it's time to
get back to that okay um let's talk
about a little bit of drone activity now
the most interesting drone was the
parrot disco because the parrot disco is
not a helicopter style model it is a
fixed-wing airplane style model so this
is a it's about three feet wingspan kind
of big boy yeah it's big big old foam
wings just slide on rear pusher
propeller and does up to 50 miles an
hour which is absolutely terrifying for
something that is consumer grade that's
not all right I'm sure it'll be fine you
control it as usual with you know with a
mobile device and they have an optional
dedicated joystick thing you can latch
on to that it'll go two kilometers in
range and then it will hunt its way back
so it can't fall out of range and if it
does somehow get out of range it knows
to come back to your GPS position which
had always timestamps when it starts to
go on a flight you launched by just
throwing it in the air it's it's pretty
cool because the main differentiator
from this and the various roto copters
is that you get angles which roto
copters don't do they're always flat
right this guy can get swooping angles
and and you can easily track I love this
you can easily track a car and shoot
video of it so this could be the best
thing for shooting scene that auto
videos is actually a plane as opposed to
a drone we can easily out drive I'll be
cool it's got 45 minutes I think a
battery minutes is a lot so it could it
could hang in there yeah so look at that
one tell you right now okay let's talk
about one a couple wacky things sensor
wake is the smell alarm clock that's
what I want that's what I've been that's
what I was looking for the question is
what smell do you want to wake up to
right people need
I want to reveal that or other might
very personal I hope they don't hey this
is so what looks bad enough yeah good
old CS for these types of things like we
look forward to this these are the sink
cartridges you put in there smell
crystals one of them's coffee um one of
those money I love that one is the smell
of money so you're like you know you're
like you're like a big baller like BTW
that's what you want to wake up to in
the morning is money here goes which
ones that one this is gonna be that's
the coffee and it puts out the the scent
no sense gonna wake me up i don't get
that all right there's no powerful smell
respond maybe both and if it may be a
smoke would nice yeah yeah give me a
give me the house burning cartridge
that's the one I want yeah I want that
one terraforming wake up you're a
flatulent dog can I put that one in
there you know I love ozone I don't feel
does it also buzz does it also do other
no one I bet it doesn't wouldn't it be
great yeah all it does is admit Smith
does a condition to you I feel like
there be a strange conditioning effect
if admit if it fails it does yes ah
clever pet either the coolest or the
cruelest technology we've seen yet a
game console to make your dog infuriated
has to push a button to get fed I'm
getting the HSUS on this so fast yeah
this is not going to market so let's see
look at this hamster I mean this is like
a strong enough experimented to get fed
he's gotta play some idiotic game where
you kiddies a game console feed the dog
I don't know who what is the valley like
who wins with them know exactly it's
actually kind of cool because if you
know dogs and cats old to play games
with things that light up and move
around open up the feeding and it can
mod it can modulate their feeding a lot
of animals eat super fast when they're
left alone because they have anxiety and
they've been they they puke it all up
because they eat too fast this is a nice
way to modulate their intake we just saw
any kid people could do it too if Raja
your human feedings are you kidding
there's no way they're not having these
at the staff dinner on Friday oh yeah
we're all gonna have one each check the
only way to get also drunk by then we
cave and operate the thing it's only
three buttons and we're still starving
right it's been test here's cooling wait
there's a third button oh that's the
problem
dimensionally alright so that about
covers the highlights and the lowlights
yeah of the best of tech on take what we
call that the best wow it's the
selection it's alexa defenses luncheon
that's right it was a it was a little
sense of tang i come back at nine a.m.
pacific tomorrow we crank things back up
again well I'll see also I seem a live
demo of that smell alarm clock ashley
askin is going to be up here as I
believe she's got the demo of that will
also have the CTO of an adult video
company talking about that and how that
industry is trying to penetrate a tight
market and sees the low-hanging fruit
why is that written in there plus we'll
see it from me printer that prints
circuit boards and if you're just
jumping into our CES coverage there's a
lot more to see at CES cnet com
goodnight Scott we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
