resolution in professional cameras
Sony's 3200 dollar a7 are two ways in 42
megapixels that's right between the five
ds's 50 mega pixels and the d810 36
megapixels but the camera really doesn't
need to claim highest resolution to
stand out in the crowd of full frame
cameras it's excellent photo quality
great video including support for 4k and
it's compact comfortable design speak
for themselves I'm Loria grinning for
cnet and this is the sony a7r to the
sturdy dust and weather sealed body has
a big grip to help balance even heavier
lenses as well as an intelligently
designed and easy to navigate control
layout I'm not fond of the somewhat
mushy shutter and I hate the flat hard
to manipulate record button but none of
these are really deal killers you can
remap almost all of the controls which
helps its feature set Lex nothing
obvious except perhaps a touch screen or
a second card slot it includes
essentials like pro shooting profiles
for video a huge bright electronic
viewfinder and a tilting LCD there are a
couple of photo issues like unexpected
artifacts at high iso sensitivities and
some clipping and highlights though
you'll have to read my review for
details on those nuances but the issues
with the stills have don't seem to
affect video the cameras real weaknesses
performance though calling it a weakness
might overstate a bit at five frames per
second for continuous shooting and with
solid auto focus and processing
performance it's really in the middle of
the pack for its class just don't try
shooting sports if every shot counts the
biggest problem is battery life you'll
need at least two and probably more
batteries to get through a day of
shooting without recharging whether or
not that matters to you is your call</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
