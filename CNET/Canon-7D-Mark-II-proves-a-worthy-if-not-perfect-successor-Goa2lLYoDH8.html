7d and eagerly awaited the 70 mark 2 so
while the mark 2 is a great camera with
significantly improved performance and a
few new features important holes remain
like an articulated LCD and Wi-Fi I'm
Laurie renew for cnet and this is the
canon eos 7d Mark to its designs
extremely similar to that of the 70 with
some subtle tweaks including dual card
slots new features include reasonably
flexible in-camera HDR which allows you
to save the original images multiple
exposure mode and interval shooting but
the interval shooting isn't as powerful
as competitors who've been offering the
feature for years now Canon also added
GPS for geo tagging geo logging though
some people may have preferred an
articulated display and Wi-Fi plus it
gains USB 3 and a headphone jack like
its predecessor it's a pretty fast
camera the new 65 point focus system
performs well and if you shoot action
it's definitely worth an upgrade from
the 70 for the focus if not the bump
from eight frames per second to 10
frames per second for continuous
shooting like other modern EOS models
the mark 2 also has selectable
sensitivity settings for the continuous
autofocus video autofocus generally
performs well too even with the non STM
lenses the mark tues photos look great
JPEGs look good up through iso 1600 and
depending upon scene content and how
large a plan to view them you can even
get decent results as high as ISO 25600
that's in part because Kenyans jpg
processing is excellent the video
quality is extremely good with
practically no rolling shutter artifacts
more a or edge artifacts the mark tues
great camera it's fast familiar and
delivers excellent albeit not
best-in-class photo and video quality I
really enjoy shooting with it but if you
like to shoot video and don't want to
rig out the camera the lack of an
articulated or even a tilting
touchscreen display makes it frustrating
I'm Lori grunion and this is the canon
eos 7d Mark
