to the alpha byte for everything good
and bad inside the world of Apple let's
get to it and right now the phone
getting the biggest buzz has been the
Samsung Note seven and the tech inside
it is amazing but do not fear Apple
fanboys your iPhone 6s is better than
the note 7 now check this out in a real
world app speed test YouTube channel
phone buff open the same apps on each
phone perform the same tasks and then
relaunch them for a second time in a
display of how important it is to
integrate hardware and software together
the iPhone 6s with its dual-core a nine
processor and two gigs of RAM
outperformed the note 7 Snapdragon 820
quad-core processor with four gigs of
RAM finishing in one minute and 51
seconds compared to the note sevens two
minutes and 49 seconds now this comes
right before Apple drops the next iPhone
7 on us in September so if there's one
thing we're confident about its the fact
that the iPhone 7 will be significantly
faster than a note 7 in real-world speed
but it's not all peaches for the iPhone
after a growing number of iPhone 6 and 6
pluses are being affected by what is
being called the touch disease the bug
appears has a grey flickering bar at the
top of the screen and a display that is
unresponsive for less responsive to
touch the heart of the problem appears
to be the touch integrated circuit chips
that over time start to lose contact to
the board and result in the display
becoming unresponsive now a hard reset
can temporarily fix it but users notice
the issue becomes more prevalent over
time and the only way to fix the problem
is to either replace the phone the logic
board or the IC chips on the logic board
now the other issue a lot of people now
have iPhone 6s that are outside their
warranty period and can't go to Apple to
get them fixed until this issue is
officially acknowledged so why is it
affecting the 6s and 6s plus
well that's because Apple strengthen the
body and change the position of the
touch IC chips in that generation hmm
now what a coincidence it's almost as if
they knew so we'll keep following this
this clearly smells like a rotten apple
to me but we'll wait if they decide to
address it and what perfect timing is
about
two years just around the time for a new
iPhone seven to wash all your problems
away all right in Apple watch news over
the weekend a Bloomberg report says
battery life concerns have delayed
apple's plans to release an Apple watch
with cellular connectivity the current
cellular chips consume too much battery
life for Apple's liking and even on
their most aggressive schedule the
earliest possible time frame for
cellular Apple watch models would have
been in December now we can still expect
to see new models this fall that have
improved health tracking and integrated
GPS base location tracking but complete
independence from the iPhone will have
to wait so that's a bummer all right the
latest report from me cases Apple is
planning to release at least three new
iPhones next year for the 2017 edition
on its 10th anniversary the idea
floating around from them and kji
securities claims we'll have a five
point eight inch iPhone with a curved
AMOLED display and glass casing and then
the standard 5.5 inch in 4.7 inch
iPhones with their standard LCD displays
reports also say the curved AMOLED one
could be for the 5.5 inch version and
not a larger 5.8 inch model but this is
all speculation for a phone that is
still two generations away now Apple
music has been locking down the
exclusive deals with artists like the
release of Frank ocean's hugely
anticipated album blonde on Apple music
for its first two weeks and now the
music services muscle is starting to
show music business worldwide reports
some of Spotify contracts are up for
renewal and the higher rates that apple
pays record labels is now affecting
Spotify sneh goshi a shion's
spotify pays record labels fifty-five
percent of its revenue while apple pays
58 percent and apple also pays more to
music publishers now we've heard about
talks for Apple to acquire title music
mostly for its relationships with its
artists but title has suffered from
mediocre growth and many exclusives have
ended up on Apple music after a short
period of time
Apple strategy hears that they don't
need a buy title they can just wait it
out and eventually force the artists to
come over because of the power of the
brand oh and before I forget Apple
released the seventh beta for
macht la sierra see we do that with love
just for you now I think we've all
noticed Siri has improved over the years
and it's going to get even better in iOS
10 thanks to machine learning technology
that Apple is implementing in a story by
back channel Apple is swapping out some
of its licensed technology in favor of a
deep neural network now Siri moved to a
neural net based system in July of 2014
but Apple didn't publicize it responses
will still be stitched together from a
central database of recordings but the
head of development for Siri Tom Gruber
says machine learning is going to help
smooth out sentences and make Siri sound
more human this should also make a big
difference for music legend Barbra
Streisand in one of the largest pressing
issues
Apple has ever faced Streisand recently
called Apple CEO Tim Cook to complain
that Siri pronounces her last name with
a Z in the middle of Streisand and it
has annoyed Babs since its launch in
2011 so Tim Cook then promised her to
fix this first world problem and before
we go we wanted to reward all of you
