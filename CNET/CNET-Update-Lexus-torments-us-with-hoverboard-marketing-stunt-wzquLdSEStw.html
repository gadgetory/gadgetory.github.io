Bridget Carey this is you're seen that
update Lexus the luxury car brand of
Toyota is making every back to the
future fans dreams come true by creating
a writeable hoverboard yes this is heavy
or maybe it's light we don't really know
how much it weighs because Lexus is only
teasing us with a few facts about the
project promising to reveal more details
about it every week but we don't even
have video of it in action in the movie
Back to the Future Part 2 Marty McFly
travels to the Year 2015 and comes
across a hoverboard so of course now
that we've reached 2015 engineers find
themselves compelled to make this
fantasy technology a reality now this
isn't the first time a company has made
a hoverboard you may recall video last
year of Tony Hawk zipping on the Hendo
board which used magnetic levitation on
a copper surface with the Hendo board it
just needs to be on a conductive surface
to work it's really a proof of concept
to show what's possible we could use
this same tech on a larger scale
imagine a hover train the Lexus
hoverboard likely also needs to be on a
special surface to work it's said to use
magnetic levitation and superconductors
inside are cooled with liquid nitrogen
Alexis told CNBC that you cannot buy
this it was just created to show it off
for promotions too bad because it looks
seriously slick with its bamboo board
and a front design like the grille of a
car I think us future fans will only
really get excited when someone figures
out how to make one work on water in the
meantime there's another company that's
figured out a way to print on water
ripples is a machine that can print any
design onto the foam on top of any
coffee drink now this printer uses
coffee extracts as the ink to print
anything you want it can be words
graphics a company logo even a photo of
someone it can even be sent to give you
a different quote or horoscope on your
coffee everyday
now a few coffee shops got to test it
early the shop can pick from a catalogue
of designs all uploaded on the cloud but
customers can also make their own
message or photo and
to the machine printing it in under 10
seconds each ripples machine costs one
thousand dollars and they will start
shipping in September and here's some
good tech news you can use today Google
has given Gmail the power of undo send
that means you have 30 seconds after
hitting send to cancel the message now
it's not able to fetch back an email
because once an email is gone there's no
getting it back rather this is a setting
you can turn on in Gmail that gives you
a few seconds of delay to take back any
embarrassing mistakes like realizing you
sent it to the wrong person
that's it for this tech news roundup
there's always more in cnet.com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
