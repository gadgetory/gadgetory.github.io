former Senator Donald Bell I was to pick
up the iPhone at 6:00 p.m. from the
Apple store in downtown San Francisco
and then write the review that night at
the store it was an absolute madhouse a
huge crowd outside there was a queue of
people that you know I've been waiting
four days to buy the phone it was
wrapped all the way around the corner
and I was waiting there patiently and at
one point the crowd surged forward an
idea actually got flattened against the
glass wall at the store I really just
thought for a moment like I've never
seen a crowd like this the doors open
they started cheering I was ushered in
the store really quickly along with
Donald we went into a back hallway they
gave us the phone they gave us you know
like press release and a little of
information and we were actually assured
out the back door because they didn't
want they didn't want us to see us
walking outside the door or walking
outside the front door we hadn't waited
in the queue
walked back quickly got in the office
had it immediately photographed because
you know we hadn't seen it yet we had
the only thing we've seen it was behind
glass at Macworld which was six months
before you know this was one of the most
anticipated two gadgets ever and we were
holding in our hands we certainly one of
the first but I was the first at Cena to
actually do it so that was a cool moment
Donnell denied at our first look video
and then we went back to our desks we
started looking at the foam twine with
it and just started writing and ordered
pizza so what we did is a live review
that we are publishing it in sections
live on scene it as we were writing so I
would write you know a few paragraphs I
sent it to my editor she was at home
she'd send it back to me you know here
are you with what tweaks or minor
Corrections or whatever I stand then
would publish keep publishing and it was
kind of exciting because actually people
really were following along and they
were asking questions in the comments
they were saying this is so cool like I
feel like I'm remember always remember
one person was like I feel like I'm at
the Super Bowl right now but it was a
supportive of really enthusiastic
readership which you don't often get
because usually you write something you
publish and then it's done and then you
see the comments but as you're writing
to see the interaction from seeing
readers was very cool and it's always
something
it took about Kosh I think we started
probably started writing about eight and
I think I left maybe at 2:00 or 2:30 in
the morning when I look back at the
review now I see that I had said doesn't
live up to the stratospheric hype well
not so much and you know at the time I
mean I certainly was a great device it
was amazing and it has changed the world
has become all the best ones ever but at
the time there were a lot of things that
we were very used to using on a phone
like photo messaging like stereo
Bluetooth and other things that just
didn't have and it was great promise and
so I don't regret that line at all not
so much but I knew what they were onto
something big
and you know that certainly has been the
case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
