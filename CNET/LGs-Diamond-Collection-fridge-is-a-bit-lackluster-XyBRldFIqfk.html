here with another tea type model this is
the LG diamond collection French
four-door refrigerator model LP XS 308 6
6 d now this is a pretty eye catching
high-end model it sells for $4,300 that
kind of makes it a direct comparison to
the samsung rfg237 23 pelling
fingerprints and we found that to be the
case when we tested it out it's also got
the door and door feature that you see
in a lot of high-end LG fridges and to
open it you'll have press this button on
the front here the panel opens up and
you can access the indoor shelves
without opening the entire fridge inside
that door indoor compartment you get
this easy lift bin that's kind of like
an elevator shelf you can easily move up
and down to make room for tall items
that's really it some notable features
though in the samsung model you can
adjust the right half of the freezer and
dial it up into fridge mode for extra
fridge storage space you can't do that
with this fridge and there's no
temperature controlled drawer either
like in other LG models this is a 30
cubic foot fridge very big but the
fridge compartment actually is on the
small side at sixteen point eight cubic
feet so really you're paying for a
bigger freezer and not a bigger fridge
now you do get LG slim face plus ice
system which helps with the storage
somewhat I like that a lot it's this
flat icemaker that's totally in the door
there's nothing taking up space in the
body of the fridge and it's easy to put
things in that shelf there about the
overhang of a normalised apartment makes
less ice but it does save space
as for performance the Diamond
Collection fridge did pretty well kept a
very nice consistent and accurate
temperature in the body of the fridge
but that right door the door indoor
section ran a little bit warm in all of
our tests we had a lot of orange in our
heat maps there it's not terrible though
the Samsung model had five orange hot
spots this one has three and that top
one there's a butter bin which is
designed to be warm so really only two
problem areas all in all though I think
that this model and the Samsung model
are both really clear design place aimed
at consumers that want something really
high-end in their kitchen that looks
fancy and harass conservative
performance or high-end features for my
money I think I'd rather have the LGL
mxs 307 8 6s that's a more traditional
looking French tour but it gives you
more space more features and is
all-in-all a more complete package than
this model it also retails for 600 less
than this model so if I'm buying a
fridge that's 3,500 or up I'm probably
gonna go with that one
