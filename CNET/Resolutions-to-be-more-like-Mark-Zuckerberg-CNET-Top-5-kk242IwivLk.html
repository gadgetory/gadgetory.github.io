resolutions you should make to be like
Mark Zuckerberg Mark Zuckerberg is a
billionaire genius who runs Facebook
maybe following his footsteps to be
useful for anyone if you didn't know the
Facebook founder sets a yearly
challenges to improve himself here's how
you can follow the way of the suck in
the new year at number five dress for
the job you want in 2009 Mark Zuckerberg
wore a tie to work every day why he
explained that he wanted to signal to
everyone at Facebook that this was a
serious year for us my tie was the
symbol of how serious and important a
year this was and I work every day to
show this so if you want to make moves
at work maybe Dress for Success yes I
realize I'm wearing a dorky t-shirt
hearted job and number four say thank
you in 2014
Zuckerberg explained that he will write
a thank-you note every day via email or
hand written letter that's right instead
of just clicking a like button or
responding with a thumbs up emoji how
about actually expressing gratitude to
people it's really easy to complain
trust me but to commit yourself to tell
someone thank you and a note will help
you be a better human being coming in at
number three expand your worldview
Mark Zuckerberg has to be a busy guy but
in some of his personal challenges he
has forced himself to grow in 2010 he
learned Mandarin in 2013 he challenged
himself to meet one new person every day
outside of Facebook then in 2015 he read
a new book every other week are you
busier than Mark Zuckerberg
sure just do any one of these challenges
will help you expand your world to me
the 2013 resolution of many people seems
the most difficult but maybe that's the
most worthwhile then that brings us to
number two kill your own food in 2011
Mark Zuckerberg became a vegetarian sort
of he would only eat the meat of animals
he had killed and butchered himself
publicly Zuckerberg said I don't have an
issue with anything people choose to eat
but I do think they should take
responsibility and be thankful for what
they eat rather than trying to ignore
where it came from so maybe you don't
have to take this resolution literally
but you can try not to turn a blind eye
to things in general and the number one
way to meet your hashtags up goals is
to improve your home in 2016 Mark
Zuckerberg personal challenge was to
build a simple AI to run his home and
help with his work he said he wanted
something like Jarvis in Iron Man now
any normal person can get an Amazon echo
or a Google home with smart home
accessories to have a conversation with
their house duck wanted to build his own
in a cave with a box of scraps wait that
was Tony Stark anyway by December 2016
Zuckerberg outlined how he successfully
built his AI he could talk to it on his
phone and computer the AI also could
learn his tastes as well as learning new
words and concepts maybe you don't need
to go as far as Zuckerberg but why not
try it on the small-scale special thanks
to Bridget Carey for helping out on this
episode are you going to try any of
Zuckerberg challenges let us know on
Mayas actor and I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
