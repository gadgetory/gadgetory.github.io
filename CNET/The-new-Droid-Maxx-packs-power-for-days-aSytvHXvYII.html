and we are at verizon's launch event in
New York take a look at two brand new
phones these are the two new droid
devices to join Verizon's lineup we've
got the droid Maxx which is made by
motorola and it actually has a very
large battery in it a 3500 milliamp
battery which apparently will let you
have a runtime of 48 hours that's two
days of runtime which is pretty awesome
as you can tell it's got a 5 inch AMOLED
display 720p and the device itself is
actually not very thick you know
considering it has a large battery this
is the droid ultra which as you can tell
and has actually the same screen as the
max but it has a slightly smaller
battery essentially it's very thin has
less better life but it has extremely
thin profile and both of these products
have a 10 megapixel camera on the back
with a sensor technology that supposedly
will allow for better performance in low
light you also have a Kevlar coating on
both of these this may not on the ultra
may not look like its Kevlar but it just
has a polished finish as opposed to soft
touch on the back of the droid maxx
actually what's really interesting about
these products is that it has a 8 x or x
8 processor is what Motorola is calling
it it essentially has 8 cores which when
you boil it all down it has some for
processing some for graphics and also
one that will enable you to do
contextual searches what Motorola is
calling a touchless interface you don't
have to actually touch the screen to
begin Google searches and plug into the
Google now feature which is something
that's pretty cool so in case you're
wondering when the droid ultra and Droid
RAZR MAXX are coming to stores
essentially both are available for
pre-order now though you you have to
wait until August twentieth for them to
hit the stores and the ultra over here
is going to be 199 whereas the droid
maxx will be 299 there you have it folks
we just took a first look at the
corolla droid Maxx and the motorola
droid ultra I'm Brian Bennett for cnet
