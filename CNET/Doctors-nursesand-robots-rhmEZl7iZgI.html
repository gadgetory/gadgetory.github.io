crossing corridor and names will be
roaming the halls of the University of
California San Francisco's new hospital
relieving staff from tedious deliveries
that allows our staff to focus on the
things that people do so well caring
decision making
supporting the robots can carry up to
1,000 pounds and deliver six types of
supplies lab specimens surgical
instruments bed linens meals waste and
medications there can be scheduled
deliveries as well as on-demand the
robots can maneuver independently
communicating over Wi-Fi they could open
doors and even call the elevators and
travel to different floors some of the
hallways here are nearly three football
fields in length that is a lot of
walking for hospital staff in just one
of the reasons why they wanted to use
robots to cover all that ground to do
some of the heavy lifting when we made
the decision to use the robotic courier
it was based on three different tenets
safety for our employees reliability
because we have a schedule and then last
but not least is the efficiency for
example they can deliver 1,000 meals a
day to patients all of the robots have
the building's floor plans embedded into
their systems they're also outfitted
with more than 30 sensors a camera
sonar lasers and infrared those four
components actually allow the robot to
sense the size of a corridor to make
sure the right patient gets the right
meds the pharmacy BOTS have built-in
fingerprint sensors so only authorized
staff can access them they require a
specific ID for each medication that
goes into the robot and then a specific
ID for each medication that comes out
only proper use reliable use of the
technology by people is what makes it
safer the staff are voting on names and
how they should be decorated while the
robots won't be rolling up to a
patient's bedside that should help with
their bedside manner in San Francisco
