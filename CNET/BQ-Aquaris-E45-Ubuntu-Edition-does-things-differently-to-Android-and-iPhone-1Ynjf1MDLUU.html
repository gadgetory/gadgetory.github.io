trinoma cnet that lists the BQ aquaris
efore point 5 of 12 edition ubuntu is a
new operating system that does things a
little bit differently so one of the
interesting things about 12 is that it
doesn't do much with the hardware
buttons it's all done on the screen so
this is a version of the phone that's an
existing Android model but with a bunty
software in it so it won't actually have
these android familiar icons in the
finished version it doesn't have a
camera button for example it just has
volume buttons and a power button on the
side so the main difference between a
blonde two and android and other types
of smartphone operating system is that
it will necessarily have apps it has
scopes and they're like home screens
where you can have different sources and
services and publications or pull into
one place so for example here's your
today scope which shows you the weather
your calendar appointments and recent
messages and recent news or what's 20
trending on Twitter that kind of thing
so here's your new scope which has the
headlines from different sources and
different publications so you can see
what's going on in the world and the
nother scope is nearby which has little
location services so for example you
pull in restaurant reviews if you were
hungry if you are on the move you could
see traffic updates nut and the weather
and that kind of thing one of the clever
things about scopes as they combine
sources that you might have had to keep
in different apps on other phones so for
example in the Photos app you've got the
photos that you've taken on your camera
itself then you've also got your
Instagram photos on the same page so as
well as being kind of home screens you
can have individual branded scopes made
by publishers and services so here on
the music service we can see music scope
we can see 7digital soundcloud songkick
youtube and so on and if you want you
can add lots of different sources
grooveshark youtube and all the rest and
then when you click on individual one
you will go through to the actual
branded scope so for example is the song
kick one allows you to see events in
songkick made by the publisher themself
soul into is controlled by swiping in
from different sides of the screen for
example if you swipe in from the top you
can control all your settings like
network brightness battery settings all
that kind of thing if you swipe in from
the right you can move through all the
apps and scopes that you have open at
the moment swipe away the ones
you don't want and quickly open up the
ones that you are open so I pin from the
left for the launcher which has all your
favorite apps in there for quick access
or you can go straight back to the home
scope and if you swipe up from the
bottom you can manage your scopes and
change the order they appear and show
which ones you want to show so another
clever feature is that when you get a
new text message it will appear in the
notifications at the top so you can
simply tap on it and reply straight away
so this first of 12 phone is going on
sale in a series of flash sales
throughout 2015 I'm rich at Rome and
this is the BQ aquaris be four point
five of them to addition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
