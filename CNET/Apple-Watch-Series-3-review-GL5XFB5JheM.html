watch has promised an escape from the
iPhone for years but I still stare at my
phone and my watch not as cellular is it
possible that I could take these phones
and leave them behind the new Apple
watch Series 3s cellular it's basically
a self-contained wrist communicator it
means you can leave your phone at home
which I did to wander free unencumbered
by notifications and people bothering me
just me in a wash in the trees in the
park why not escape hey John
yeah I'm sitting right by my desk right
now other Watchers have tried to be
things to Apple watch Series 3 does it
the best easily making phone calls and
receiving emails using Siri searching
for directions
listening to music paying for things
with Apple pay it's a fascinatingly
self-contained info bubble the on-board
microphone is good but you really need
wireless headphones to make it work air
pods are ideal but this tidy escape
package costs at least $400 for the
watch $160 for the air pods and $10 a
month to tie the watch into your
existing phone plan phone calls don't
last long on a full charge the cellular
Apple watch can only make about an
hour-long call I talked to my mom for
half an hour and recorded two workouts
and listened to music and I was already
at 50% battery new watch OS 4 features
available on other Apple watches add
better workouts some attempts at daily
fitness coaching and more active heart
rate monitoring including heart rate
recovery it will ping you if your heart
rate spikes as a flag to maybe get
medical attention a new barometer adds
elevation and stair climbing like Fitbit
has with more casual use the watch lasts
a day and maybe a bit more on a charge
but the limited battery life and up to
five hours of workout battery life with
continuous heartrate means I wouldn't
wander too far
it's also swim proof so this is a wrist
worn swimming phone outdoor explorers
might love it does feel oddly liberating
just me and the Apple watch Series three
and a pair of air pods no phone in the
park and the trees but Who am I kidding
you still need an iPhone to connect in
the first place and with the battery
life this short for making phone calls
you're gonna have to eventually go back
and recharge without onboard app
downloading and with its required iPhone
syncing this is an accessory not really
the world's tiniest iPhone not yet now
with this battery but it could be a
helpful light boat maybe even a
lifesaver a backup phone an emergency
tool it's $70 more to add cellular to
the series three but it'll cost you
monthly you'll always feel connected at
least until it's time to go home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
