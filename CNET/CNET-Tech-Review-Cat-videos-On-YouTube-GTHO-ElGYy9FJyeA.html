Samsung's latest 4g phone is truly epic
a new digital pen that can read your
handwriting we've got an external hard
drive that's fire and waterproof and we
count down the top-5 cat videos on
youtube it's all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus we offer some unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's start with the good Sprint's
4G service is still being rolled out
around the country but you don't have to
wait to enjoy the many fancy features of
a 4g phone or spend a ton of cash to do
so take a look at the epic 4g from Samsa
I'm Nicole Lee senior associate editor
for cnet.com in this is a cluster 50
samsung epic 4g for sprint nextel the
epic 4g has the most features and is the
most advanced phone out of the samsung
galaxy s family as you can see here it
is the only galaxy s phone to have a
physical keyboard 4G and a front-facing
camera it is also the only one with a
flash LED on the back the overall design
is very solid it feels very install it
in the hand and is a quite a large
footprint that because on the front is a
very generous and very colorful 4 inch
Super AMOLED touchscreen display it is
absolutely stunning vibrant and
brilliant he has a very wide viewing
angle and as higher contrast ratios when
compared to ordinary LCD displays aside
from YouTube and your own videos the
samsung epic 4g will also have access to
samsung's upcoming media hub that lets
you rent and purchase movies TV shows
and other content we don't know yet who
the content partners are however the
epic 4g is also the only one where you
can download media hub content via Wi-Fi
as well as 4g like the other galaxy s
phones the epic 4g comes with the new
touchwiz 3.0 interface this includes new
widgets like feeds and updates for all
your social networking content and
buddies now which acts like a favorites
list for all your contacts instead of a
scrolling menu left with other android
phones you get a great view with lateral
panels the phone slides open to reveal a
full curly keyboard which we like a lot
it's spread out evenly across the phone
thanks to the phones
sighs we really appreciate the physical
keys for the usual Android controls on
the side here as an alternative to the
touch-sensitive controls underneath the
display the overall keyboard is really
nice and tactile and it's easily one of
the best keywords you've ever tried
that's it the virtual keyboard is great
to you especially with swype there's a
five-point Omega pixel camera on the
back which takes great photos especially
with the LED flash the epic 4g comes
with android 2.1 which of course brings
the usual google features like gmail and
google maps the epic 4g is also
upgradeable to android 2.2 in the future
other features of the phone include
Wi-Fi video read a 4 3g and 4g webex
were available as we said there's a
front-facing camera on the front here so
you can use it with quick and fring
video calling services other services on
the phone include sprint services like
spritz zone nascar sprint mobile and
more the epic 4g also has a 1 gigabits
hummingbird processor which keeps it
running along very smoothly you will
also be able to use the smartphone as a
mobile hotspot 3g or 4g for up to five
devices the epic for it is available for
two hundred and fifty dollars with a new
two-year service agreement and after a
hundred dollar mail-in rebate like the
evo 4g however there is a ten dollar
extra fee for the data plan that ten
dollars extra gives you 4g access as
well as access to premium data services
i'm the coldest it's been the first look
at the samsung epic 4g yeah it is kind
of bulky but that giant slide out
keyboard is huge and therefore awesome I
think I love that phone actually to an
epic degree next up we've got a pen yes
a pen the kind you write with also the
kind that talks to you and puts all your
notes on the internet here's Donald bell
with a Livescribe echo
hey I'm Donald Bell and today we're
taking a first look at the Echo smartpen
from Livescribe pen comes in a 4
gigabyte version for 169 dollars in an 8
gigabyte model for 199 you get the pen
and ink refill to pen caps a USB cable
and a pad a special paper that's
required to make it work so why spend up
to two hundred dollars on a glorified
ballpoint pen well the echo has three
ingredients that make it special there's
a microphone for recording audio a
speaker for playing back recordings and
the camera hidden in the tip that
captures your pen movements you pair it
up with the special paper and you have
the ability to take notes and record
sound at the same time it could be a
college lecture or an interview or maybe
you just like to brainstorm and doodle
at the same time so here's the magic
trick when it's time to review your
notes the timeline of the audio
recording is synced to what you wrote
down so just tap a section and the audio
from that moment plays back through the
speaker or the standard headphone jack
on the top a USB port is also on the top
of the pen that you can use to sync your
notes and recordings back to any Mac or
PC you'll need to download the free
Livescribe desktop software to make it
work but then you can export notes as
AAC audio and image file PDF or as a pen
cast file you also have the option of
uploading the pen cast to an online
locker where it can be share it online
or embed it into a web page the same
software also allows you to download and
install applications that run on the pen
such as dictionaries games and travel
phrases for different languages overall
the echo smartpen is very impressive if
perfectly tracked all our notes and is
smart enough to know when you start a
new page or when you write down a new
note while listening back to a recording
is there catch well you do have to use a
special paper which you can print out
yourself on a color printer or buy for
around five dollars a notebook the cool
thing about the notebook though is that
you get all these little shortcut
controls for the pen and recording
settings a calculator and quick buttons
for record pause stop skip audio
bookmarks
a timeline bar for jumping around the
audio playback speed and volume control
the pen refills are unique to it's just
regular ink but the cartridges are
shorter than average so they run out a
little faster a five pack of refills is
like five dollars so no biggie but they
can be inconvenient to track down when
you're in a pinch also you have to keep
an eye on battery life mileage will vary
depending on how high you have the
display brightness and recording quality
settings but if you use this on a daily
basis expect to charge it daily as well
finally remember it's a pen people tend
to lose pens the echo can be
personalized with the name and the
content can be password protected but
ultimately if you tend to lose pens this
isn't the way to go that said on its
merits as a pen alone the echo should
satisfy those who are picky about those
kinds of things compared with the first
generation model called the pulse the
echo has a lighter more tapered design
better balance and a flat edge that
keeps it from rolling off tables so
that's the echo smartpen a genuinely
novel and useful approach for capturing
and reviewing audio and handwritten
notes the cnet com I'm Donald Bell now
if it only came with a disposable pen
cap for you to chew on in class I don't
want to get slobber in my USB port you
storage prices have been plummeting
recently with terabyte hard drives going
for less than a hundred bucks in fact
the data on your drive is probably more
valuable than the drive itself so it
might be worth spending a few extra
bucks to protect your files
backing up is important however in case
of fire flood most of your bike up dries
won't survive unless you have what I'm
going to show you today hello my name is
Domino and this is the solo pro
fireproof waterproof external hard drive
from iosafe the i would say solo bro is
not external hard drive for everyone is
huge and it's very heavy about 15 times
the weight of a normal external hard
drive is also comparatively expensive
costing around two hundred fifty dollars
for one tear by a foreign trade dollar
for to tailor by to make up for this is
come with layers of protection desire to
guarantee the survival of your data even
under extreme heat and water submersion
according to ioc of the solo pro can
protect the data against extreme heat up
to 1500 degrees Fahrenheit and we're a
submersion down to 10 feet for three
days why we don't have the resources to
test the drive in the extreme condition
i will save haven't shown as many live
demonstration to prove the effectiveness
of their disaster-proof drives other
than that this is a simple search
solution on the front the solo has a
large blue LED light that showed the
power status this light flashes to show
the hard drives activities on the back
it has one you speed through pengal port
a small ventilation fan and an on-off
switch you can also buy a solo pro with
an e SATA port but then you have to lose
the USB 3.0 port unfortunately there's
no option to have a more than one type
connection the solo pro comes with just
one USB through panco cable and nothing
else however it shipped with one year
warranty that includes iosafe data
recovery service which take care of
getting there back for you in case of
disaster in case the hard drive is so
badly damaged by fire or water and an
expensive forensic light recovery
service is required the warranty will
cover up to 2500 dollars of the cost
customer can also upgrade to a three or
five year warranty for 50-100 dollars
respectively for more information check
out the in-depth review etsy.com once
again my name is demo and this has been
the first look at the iowa save solo pro
fireproof waterproof external hard drive
from Iowa
Oh dome I'm disappointed I really want
to see you break out your flamethrower
or at least pop that baby in a fish tank
all right now it's time to check in with
jason parker to find out which apps the
team is tapping this week hello and
welcome to tap that app i'm jason parker
and this is the show where we cover the
hottest apps in the mobile space this
week we're showing off a trifecta of
iphone games that are fun challenging
and easy to pick up and play and no
we're not talking about Angry Birds now
this week we're talking about skee-ball
flick kick football in Star duck to get
started skee ball has been in the itunes
app store for more than a year now but
remains an excellent way to waste a
little time wherever you are just like
arcades of old the object of skee-ball
is to flick 10 balls down an alley and
try to land them in cups with different
score values hitting lit cups add to
your bonus and when you're done you can
even spend your winnings on cheap
trinkets and other items in the loot
shop skee-ball is a lot of fun it is 99
cents at the iTunes App Store the
skee-ball is not your thing check out
flick kick football this game challenges
you to flick a soccer ball into a goal
around stationary defenders and
sometimes a moving goalkeeper as it
progress through the game you'll need to
hit skill shots near the edges of the
goal to earn extra lives so miss shots
won't end your game you can even do
curve shots to kick the ball around
defenders with a curved swipe your
finger flick kick football is
surprisingly fun and challenging the
more you play and you can get it at the
app store for just 99 cents our third
grade pick up and play game is star dunk
a basketball shooting game with an
arcade twist shoot a basket by touching
and moving your finger on the
touchscreen to adjust your shot
trajectory then let go to shoot hitting
all four bars on the backboard gives you
a random bonus that can make the hoop
wider or let you shoot multiple balls at
once as you progress you'll be able to
unlock an experiment with different
balls with unique properties to see what
works best for you best of all you can
play online against other players in a
minute and a half long shoot out to see
who gets the high score star dunk has no
actual slam dunks but
is definitely fun in a steal at 99 cents
to sum it up let's face it some iphone
games are made for those times you need
a quick time waster in each of these
three games fit the bill nicely if
you're an iPhone user i recommend
tapping all three of these apps that's
it for this week's show if you have any
suggestions send them to tap that app at
cnet com i'm jason parker and we'll see
you next week I don't care what you say
Jason I love Angry Birds but maybe these
games will help tide me over until the
next levels are released come on already
alright it's time to take a break I
don't know about you but I am going to
use this time to hunt down some more
little green pigs we'll be right back
with more Cena tech review right after
this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on with the good just because
Apple is in a big fight with adobe /
flash that doesn't mean all of Adobe's
products are forbidden you can still use
Photoshop on your Mac you could edit
video with premier if you really want to
and now Scott's time is here to show you
how to read your PDF files on your iPad
hi I'm Scott Stein senior associate
editor at cnet com and we're going to
show you how to get PDF books onto your
iPad now the reason we're bringing this
up is because the iPads a fantastic
ereader there are a number of ear
reading software options on there ibooks
the kindle barnes and nobles app and and
more in fact and they're all compelling
and they're all great except for there's
a question of unless you're purchasing
them how do you get stuff onto it from
outside well you may already know that
if you have an ePub file but what if
it's something else in fact what if it's
something that you've written I'm a
writer and other people may be two or
you may have documents you want to bring
on there and glance that as well well
for that PDFs are much easier way to use
the e-reader functions on your iPad then
epub while there are some other great
PDF readers as well including good
reader for 99 cents a very diverse
program that allows you to also import
directly from the web or even from
google docs it can go on to the file
server and pull the documents down I
books is a lot easier in the sense that
it's built in already and it actually
looks really nice and pretty will admit
it step 1 and maybe the most challenging
step is actually saving your document as
a PDF now if you haven't done it before
you may be confused as to how exactly to
do it on a Mac instead simple you
actually go from the print menu and you
can actually save as a PDF from there
from any document or any program that
you're working on and it's actually very
simple a lot of modern word processors
can save as PDFs screenwriting programs
and Google Docs can save automatically
as a PDF as well from there we find that
the easiest way to do it is just
the document to yourself we just
downloaded a free epub there are a lot
out there this is David Copperfield by
Charles Dickens a 3.9 megabyte file once
it's downloaded you can click on it and
it opens up a preview within email now
at the top there's an open end button
you just tap that and it actually shows
you all of the apps that can read that
will pick I books and it imports it
really quickly and then it adds it to a
library that's a parallel library to
what's on your book collection on your
iBooks app now the difference here is
that you can't really change the font
sizes and as you notice there's no
pretty page turning you're going to have
to deal with just side by side scrolling
if you can bear it as far as chapters
there really aren't that either if you
press the chapter button at the top it
actually brings up all the pages of the
PDF which can get a little annoying if
we're dealing with a tremendously large
file it's not the greatest for large
files if you're reading a novel in that
regard although you can search the text
within the PDF another nice thing about
PDF files they'll retain all of their
color and graphics as well so if you
have big brochures or digital magazines
those work great too now if you don't
want to email it to yourself you can
always simply do it from itunes the same
way you would with epub or other files
when you connect it within iTunes you
can choose to add it within iTunes under
the documents area you can add the files
that you want so that's it we would love
if you be able to take notes within the
PDFs or be able to do some editing as
well obviously that's not available with
current technology but hopefully in the
future that type of cloud document
support will become easier and easier to
use on devices like the iPad but for now
it's a more diversity reader than you
think and it's really easy to get files
from your email if you're using PDFs I'm
scotts diving this how to read PDF
ebooks on your iPad
hey I didn't say it was gonna be pretty
like Scott says you probably won't want
to read long PDF novels and I books but
a little pamphlet might be okay okay
folks get ready for the bad earlier
Nicole Lee showed us a phone that
exemplifies all that is good in the
world of Android phones but while
Samsung's 4G phone may be epic sony
ericsson xperia x10 is decidedly less so
take it away Kent hi I'm Kent Sherman
senior editor here at cnet com today we
take a first look at the sony ericsson
xperia x10 now this is the x10 for AT&amp;amp;T
service it does improve a couple of our
biggest problems we had on the other
original x10 one is that the virtual
keyboard now works in landscape mode
across all applications you also have a
cheaper price you can try 149 with to
your service rather than seven hundred
dollars and the data services that will
improve but that still doesn't mean we
love it there are a couple things we had
a problem with one is only once android
1.6 so with so many devices coming out
now with 20 21 22 also there's that time
scam application now that's similar to
moto blur in the sense that it takes all
of your email text messages multimedia
facebook status updates tweets rolls
them into one steady stream of
information it sort of resembles a deck
of cards I like the idea most of the
time behind these applications but i
think the timescape can be a little
overwhelming it's just a lot of
information for the bean thrown at you
when originally came out it was one of
the larger smartphones around it's great
to have that amount of room on a
touchscreen phone you can really get
around and maneuver things that you want
get through the menus you can type
easily so really like that you do get
three home screens you can populate in
the normal Android fashion with folders
with widgets with shortcuts anything
you'd like it only supports 65536 colors
so things look ok but they just could
look a little better on the top of the
phone there's a 3.5 millimeter headset
jack the power control and a micro USB
port on the side you'll see there's the
volume rocker and we all set a camera
shutter on the back there's a lens for
the 8.1 megapixel camera and behind the
battery cover is the micro SD slot we
don't think that's the best location but
as long as it's micro SD at not Sony's
memory stick micro proprietary format
we're going to let it slide in this
point now the x10 does
sony ericsson's user interface
experience that's their customized
interface for Android devices feel a
little bit divided on these customized
interfaces but overall certainly
attractive certainly nice and just Sony
Ericsson's effort to put a stamp on the
phone features on the phone are pretty
plentiful you have the 8.1 mega camera
video you can get messaging you can get
email if you want most work email so if
we're outlook you'll have to go through
a separate email applications I don't
really love that idea but at least it's
on the phone I think it is a good entry
for sony ericsson's first android phone
but with that 1.6 OS on there it's gonna
look dated I'm Ken Sherman this is sony
ericsson xperia x10 only android OS 1.6
and no ability to upgrade why bother and
what a letdown this phone had tons of
buzz when it was announced all right now
it is time for this week's bottom line
like most of you out there we like to
spend at least a couple of hours a day
watching cat videos on YouTube unlike
the rest of you we're able to turn that
into work presenting the top 5 cat
videos of all time
you know they tell me that YouTube gets
fifteen hundred new cat videos posted
every day so I'm glad to hear that
because that means I'm not the only one
who's crazy I'm Brian Cooley with the
cnet top five so shameless I almost feel
guilty about it almost it's top five cat
videos we hunted down the top videos of
cats on YouTube took out all the lazy
compilations and any that looks remotely
like cat torment because we don't roll
that way and came up with these five
that have monster traffic coming in at
number five it's the ninja cat with 12.6
million views short simple and hilarious
this is that video where the cat keeps
getting closer to the camera without
ever seeming to move brian Tong has the
same disturbing habit number for Nora
the piano playing cat 18 million views
the London Times describes her music as
somewhere between Philip Glass and free
jazz yeah very free video of her playing
has been studied in scholarly circles
shown on just about every TV talk show
and news website and her music is
featured on a CD and like all great
prodigy stories hers begins with humble
roots a shelter rescue from new jersey
number three kitten fight eighteen and a
half million views this transcendent
video is actually a set of important
life lessons first it's about
establishing limits on one's behavior
through healthy conflict second it shows
that no matter how engaged you are in
said conflict that stops when someone
pukes number two two talking cats 30 and
a half million views okay these cats are
talking to each other right just like i
might do with you I mean look and then
they groom each other which I don't want
to do with you
by the way before we get to number one
it's not a mystery why there are so many
cat videos out there cats are the most
popular companion animal Scientific
American says there are 600 million
living among humans the Egyptians
probably got all this started a
relatively short 3600 years ago and if
you're going to follow their lead I
trust you'll adopt from a shelter okay I
know you're sitting there in that cat
sweater you knitted covered in fur
itching to know the world's number one
most popular cat video and this is it
the mean kitty song with 36 million
views you know this one was sparta the
cat came out back in two thousand seven
months now the music is disturbingly
like men at work and I get a broad sense
of unease watching that guy run around
in his faux hawk and his camo pants but
it can't mess with 36 million and that's
one cute kitty I'm Brian Cooley I have
seven caps and we'll see you next time
for another top five the bottom line
this week cooley loves his cats and that
is not news actually so does the rest of
the world apparently although as cute as
they are I've always been partial to
this little guy oh and by the way nice
shirt coolly think that thing is gonna
get its own YouTube channel and that's
our show for this week join us next time
when we'll be back with a brand new tech
review until then there are tons of
great videos available every day at Cena
at tv.com I'll see you next time and
