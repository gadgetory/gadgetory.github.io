augmented reality platform alright sir
going to swipe to the camera and you're
going to start discovering effects that
your friends are using and that are
relevant to the place you're at nearby
so now for real augmented reality you
don't just want the ability to do those
tools you also want the ability to have
realistic 3d objects and in order to do
that you need to have a platform that
has that gives them precise location a
realistic relationship with objects
around them in their environment here's
how this works so you're going to easily
create anything you want you can write a
fun message next to your breakfast and
and it's going to slide onto the table
and since we understand the depth of the
table you saw it was occluded and the
right place as it came up so we can make
this more fun let's add some some
breakfast sharks swirling around my ball
some clouds and you know there you go
then it's got the depth right so when
they go behind the bowl that they're
occluded it gets the depth of the table
and all that from this still photo we
constructed a 3d scene and now because
it's a 3d scene we can pan around how
crazy is that you can add all kinds of
effects you know we can fill the room up
with water if we want again it's got the
depth right you can add a lot of bouncy
balls or a found of bouncy balls and we
could fill the room up with skittles we
also have some of the best computer
vision and object recognition work in
the world you can tap on the wine bottle
and you can add an information card or
that that shares that that shows on and
what the vintage of the wine is and you
know what the rating is and maybe where
to get it or maybe even the future even
a link to buy it this is an AR tool that
Nike created for helping you visualize
and share your runs and some fun new
ways so here's an example of a father
playing an augmented reality game with
his kids in the waiting room at the
doctor's office wears using the table in
the waiting room as the the game board
for a tower defense game and the kids
can kind of slap the bad guys before
they get to you
now there's gonna be a lot of awesome
stuff
like this that comes and I'm pretty
excited about this this part of the
platform is going to come a bit later
this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
