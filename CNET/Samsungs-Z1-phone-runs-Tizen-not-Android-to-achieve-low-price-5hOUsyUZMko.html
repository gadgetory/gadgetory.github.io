advertising stand at Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona taking a look at
Samsung's said one smartphone running
the Tizen operating system now first of
all what is Tizen well it's a mobile
operating system that's designed to be
an alternative to the more dominant
Android in iOS but there can be offered
at a lower price now something is
pushing Tizen on his low-end phones for
developing markets like India but you
can also find Tizen on a range of other
products including smartwatches
connected cameras and various home
appliances as well now as eggwin itself
is unquestionably a low-end phone you
can see it's got a plastic and chrome
effect body which is very reminiscent of
some of the early Galaxy phones its
4-inch screen has an 800 by 480 pixel
resolution as a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
processor a 3.8 megapixel rear camera
and VGA front camera all very low in
specs but then this thing did sell for
only around $90 when it went on sale in
India the Tizen software isn't too bad
to look at and in fact it's quite
similar to Android you can see there are
these various home screens showing some
apps and some Clarke's and down below
there are always these eight apps for
quick access and swiping up brings you
to another app tray there is of course a
pull down pull down menu for
notifications and again quick access to
settings which is very Samsung we've
seen this a lot on the Galaxy phones
before the the settings menu is also
pretty much the same what we've expected
on a lot of Samsung phones so currently
the said one is available in India and
it's recently gone on sale in Bangladesh
as well it's only for emerging markets
and Samson currently has no plans to
roll it out any further but of course
things could change any time so do you
make sure to keep your eye on CNET for
all the news about the z1 and other
types of products I'm Andrew Hoyle for
CNET and this is the Samsung z1
running Tizen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
