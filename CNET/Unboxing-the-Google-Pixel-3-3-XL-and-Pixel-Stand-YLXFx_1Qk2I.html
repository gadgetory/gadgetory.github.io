pixel 3 XL and we have a stand the thing
is the pieces of hardware here you guys
are probably seen it online already so
we're gonna unbox the stand first and
then set it up with one of these phones
maybe both okay
it's got a nice shrink wrapping on it
and I'm gonna stab it somewhere rap okay
now oh it comes off this way pop this
off maybe I'm supposed to open it that
way okay so let's see we're supposed to
be showing to us this way gonna be
presented when you pop it off like this
oh when it comes to the stand itself
there's not a heck of a lot to look at
it's just an oblong disc there's another
disc
there's no USB on the front here so this
actually be wireless charging obviously
there's USB here so I'm going to take
off this protector
let's see what else we got here we've
got a nice little piece of paper
let's see plug it in charge your phone
and then it says it in French all right
sounds pretty easy I don't know what
this is even more instructions basic
safety it says do not ingest you just
kidding we've got a USBC plug and we've
got a USBC to USBC cable so let's set
this thing up it's stuck with a little
bit of cardboard moving the cardboard
it's a nice design but if you're
impatient tired might be difficult
okay it is now free and we're gonna pop
this guy into the USBC receptacle it's
got a nice little bit of cable
management there they even protect the
base let's clean that off get rid of
that and we're gonna put a note on it to
see how it does as a wireless charger my
note has a case on it we'll see if it
actually picks up and there it is
actually as charging it's a standard Qi
charger it's not just for the pixel so
if you want to have one of these around
your house probably charge your iPhone
10 your note 9 whatever else you got
sitting around with while it's charging
and pop that off alright which one of
the pixels to open up I'm gonna go with
the XL this is the monster with the
notch let's go ahead and open this up
it's got a little tab remove that pretty
simple another tab pop that off let's
unbox this alright move the stand over
we've got a pixel XL 3 XL in black it's
got a nice little protector let's see if
it's charged and ready to go
and with this shot you can definitely
see how ridiculous that notch is I'm
still very curious to see what's this
going to be used for in the future
because otherwise it's just a
notification tray and that's not a lot
of information there
you got your to school you got two two
speakers there you've got your single
camera on the rear the fingerprint
sensor and touching the screen until you
hear a beep to enable accessibility mode
oh it turns out that it talks to you
when you start okay let's do that
I'm gonna start this alright there you
can get to that in a minute let's see
what else is in the box the cardboard
here we've got our booklets and we've
got a little sim tool from Google it's
very nice and handy if I want to switch
let's get started a sticker and a really
long book what else we got here it looks
like we got our pixel earbuds so I'm
gonna open this up and we've got wired
USB C headphones believe the other
pickles did not ship with headphones
have to double check
we've also got a dongle if we want to
attach really easy for you to get out I
can I get stuff
you got a USB C to 3.5 millimeter dongle
for other headphones we've got a USB a 2
USB C dongle here if you want to use
other devices with your phone and a USB
C 2 C cable and we have another USB plug
to charge this guy let's see if that
works it's a nice little hum sound when
you put it on there and clean up my
workspace you see really not much to the
pixel 3xl you've seen it before
it shouldn't be any big difference
between the three XL and the three other
than the design of the phone so let's
see if anything is different and you
open up it free and move this out of the
way and we're gonna open up the 3 to see
if it's got anything different or
additional compared to the three XL side
pieces
this one is in clearly white and open
this guy up is in clearly white look at
that that is white that bad this guy on
styling so much like the pixel to excel
I really do enjoy that it's got this
nice look to it it's really really
sturdy in the hand - it's really nice
very surprised it's expecting this to
feel cheaper but it doesn't we got the
foam put that aside so let's see what
else we get with our three we get sin
tulle Blue Book sticker a bunch of
documentation another plug here are our
pixel buds put that right there
our cable and our section four dongles
there you go it's like a game of memory
excel in one hand I've got the three in
the other I'll tell you they're actually
pretty comfortable to hold on to I
really like this smooth back it's not
slippery at all even though it's made
out of glass and yes you do have single
cameras on the back but Google says
their software is so good you won't even
need it these have been the Google three
and the three XL by Google and they're
available soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
