i'm brian tong and we're here to find
out who's the top dog in the battle for
social networking supremacy do I know
you
you know who say what all coming
questions in the real world that are now
taking place online in this week's prize
fight it's a face-off between two of the
internet's heaviest hitters it's a
battle royale between myspace versus
Facebook we've got five rumble tumble
rounds so let's see who's got the goods
first up it's all about the user
interface let's just take a look at the
login homepage for myspace Wow
there is sure a lot going on there now
let's check out Facebook's and it's
pretty clean it straight forward those
two pages alone basically tell you what
you'll be getting into myspace is just
real busy with a lot of links a lot of
ads and a little too much action going
on and when you navigate pages you're
also at the mercy of the users personal
layout which can be painful now Facebook
is a whole lot cleaner and easier to use
we aren't being bombarded by
advertisements well yet anyways and it's
a really bright and sterile look that is
consistent with every profile Facebook
beat some of the punch with the four in
this round and myspace gets a three next
round customization now myspace gives
you the ultimate control to personalize
your profile page using HTML there are
different layout styles embedded
multimedia and anything you want you
could basically have it also launched a
new applications platform that lets you
add widgets and web apps to your profile
now Facebook allows you to add all these
fun and quirky kind of apps by
rearranging and resizing your page and
dragging and dropping them in there's no
HTML code editing and you can't even
change the color scheme of your profiles
at the moment that's a huge bummer
myspace counters this round comes with a
five because you could do anything you
want to it for better for worse and
Facebook gets a four thanks to its
matured apps platform now you may like
your own homepage to have personality
but which side brings it when it comes
to attitude and times
sure a new score bought it but MySpace's
roots started with bands and artists
using it as a promotional tool and music
is still a major part of the experience
it's also packed with celebrity profiles
and multimedia and it still has an
independent feel to it now Facebook well
it was created by a guy from Harvard
people praised it for its clean looks
and controlled feel but at the same time
it's a little stuffy dare I say geeky
now we're handing out fours thumbs -
both MySpace and Facebook for their
different approaches that work for both
of them now we're tied at 12 apiece and
next round it's all about privacy
myspace profiles are public by default
and there isn't any sort of age
verification yet but it's been added
very soon
you can also constantly get spammed and
it can be pretty annoying myspace gets a
whole lot of flack but you can really
lay low if you want to now Facebook has
privacy customizations that you can
tweak for everything on the site and
there's a lot less spam on Facebook
I haven't received a single piece yet
cross my fingers Facebook pump gets the
four and myspace gets a three in this
round these prize fights are always
neck-and-neck with one more round left
to go how do you spend your time on
these sites well the final deciding
round is all about time blown
my space is loaded with exclusive music
previews from your favorite artists and
there are more streaming videos as well
now Facebook takes on another approach
with its extensive group of applications
that keep people coming back for more
can you say scribe ulis now giving gifts
and super poking people becomes super
addicting in the final round
Facebook pump gets the four and myspace
gets a three the final score is 20 to 18
Facebook reigns victorious in another
slobberknocker
I'm Brian Tom and we'll catch you guys
next time on another prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
