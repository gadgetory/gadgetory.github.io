about the tech I'm Bridget Carey we'd
seen a TV and it's time to play we all
know Barbie is the queen of fashion and
they're sure to take this to a whole new
tech level this is the Barbie photo
fashion doll and here on her shirt is an
LCD screen on the back is a camera and
using her belt you can take photos and
turn them into whatever she's wearing on
her shirt she's gonna be about $50 and
available in the fall fisher-price has
the Kids Huff portable DVD this is just
for kids it's covered in rubber so it
could take a beating it records 2 hours
of video content and expandable to two
more hours if you have an SD card slot
it connects to the TV and kids can set
it up to 24 hours in advance to record
their favorite shows and take it on the
go this is the Yip it the new pet for
fidget this is by Mattel it's gonna be
available in the fall for about thirty
to forty dollars and these are dynamic
interactive pets you can train them you
can sing along with them and you can
play games with them but what's really
cool is they also interact with sounds
and they interact with other fidgets so
if I clap this little guy will interact
toys that work with iPad apps are the
big trend this year and Mattel is
getting involved with a new line called
activity whether it's Barbie Hot Wheels
these toys for about $10 each will
interact with their own apps on the iPad
and it's more than just Barbie and Hot
Wheels they're even going into existing
apps like Angry Birds cut the rope and
fruit ninja' and you're going to start
to see these around July the app craze
has even gotten to babies this is the
last and learn activity monkey by Mattel
he's $30 available in July and what you
do is you put an iPhone or iPod touch in
here and whenever you press his foot or
his hands
he'll interact now it's this is glove
force technology and this is the force
Flyer it's an RC helicopter completely
controlled by this tool oh it's going to
be available in May it's $50 and also
comes in bugle for now the Activision
booth
Skylanders are the focus there's a new
game coming out called Skylanders Giants
these characters are much bigger than
the original Skylanders were they have
glow light-up technology so when they
get close to the base station they start
to glow now the whole point of the base
station is that once you put them on
he's in the game so if you go to a
friend's house whether they have a
Playstation a Wii or Xbox 360 that same
data goes with you if you're not quite
ready to get your child their own iPad
how about a tablet of their own it's
just a curio it's $200 and it's made for
kids because it's fully customizable for
parents so they can control what apps
are on here how many profiles for
different kids to trade back and forth
it's going to be available in September
so although tech and apps are playing a
big role in this toy fair you can tell
we're only at the
I'm Krystina TV I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
