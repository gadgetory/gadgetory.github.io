securities it's a small but feisty group
of add-ons and one of the best is Do Not
Track me hi I'm Seth Rosenblatt for Cena
and today we're taking a first look at
Do Not Track me which blocks trackers
from following you around the web
originally known as Do Not Track plus Do
Not Track me has more to it than just a
name change Do Not Track me has dropped
advertiser opt-out cookies a small
change that eliminates confusion about
different types of cookies while
increasing your protection there's a new
add-on icon a simple crosshairs now in
addition to indicating how many trackers
are blocked on the site you're currently
visiting it also warns you about social
networking news tracking habits and when
those sites make privacy policy changes
DNT me has a new look to that makes it
easier to check up on a chart front
center gives a helpful visual to the
esoteric concept of tracker blocking a
bite has also highlighted links to its
blog posts that focus on privacy and
explaining how sites track you of course
they're also pimping their paid privacy
services but it's remarkably unobtrusive
and the add-on still does its unique
rebuilding of social networking buttons
so even though you're blocking trackers
you're not killing off the benefits of
the modern web the add-on works with
chrome firefox safari and internet
explorer but not opera online privacy is
a hard place to make a buck when
companies and governments are doing
their best to violate yours fortunately
do not track me remains free and it also
remains one of the best add-ons in this
space the first look at do not track me
I'm Seth Rosalyn
