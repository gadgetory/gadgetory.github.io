doesn't use tech very often can be hard
one solution is memo Bird launched two
months ago it's a simple and compact
printer that connects to Wi-Fi with a
separate phone app you can send photos
and handwritten notes to the printer and
will print out like a receipt the phone
and the printers don't have to be close
to work with one another and the app is
compatible with iOS and Android if
you're wondering why you need this it's
actual texts or messaging apps exist you
can still use memo Bird when you want to
send something a little bit more special
like when you're in a long-distance
relationship or friendship think about
it like telegrams for the modern age you
can set this up at their home or
retirement community and as they go
about their day they can still receive
messages from you and your family you
can send them daily reminders or just
send a message to say hi because the
printer uses thermal paper you don't
have to keep buying ink it costs $79 and
it's available now in the US the company
is also launching a more office friendly
device called Cuba note which has the
same idea but a prints on sticky notes
and it's aimed for more professional
environments it costs one hundred and
forty nine dollars and will be available
in March</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
