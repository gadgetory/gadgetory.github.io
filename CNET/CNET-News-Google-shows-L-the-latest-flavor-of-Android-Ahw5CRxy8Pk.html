simple and that people would intuitively
understand so we imagined what if pixels
didn't just have color but also depth
what if there was an intelligent
material that was as simple as paper but
could transform and change shape in
response to touch and this led us to a
way of thinking that we call material
design in the real world every small
change in position and depth creates
subtle but important changes in lighting
and shadows so as part of the L preview
will now allow app developers to specify
an elevation value for any UI surface
and the framework will render it in
correct perspective with virtual light
sources and real-time shadows material
design is beautiful and bold because
clean typographic layouts are simple and
easy to understand your content is the
focus so the L preview will allow app
developers to easily colorize all
framework elements in your app to match
the theme to your brand so you're
probably wondering how this looks like
in practice we're going to give you a
sneak peek at one of our familiar Google
applications in the new material design
here you can see step by step how we
update to design the typography the grid
changes and finally the surfaces and
bold colors and a few small changes make
a really big difference let's have a
look at now we're all familiar which is
the phone dialer thanks Marcelo ok so
the first thing you'll notice when you
find up far up the phone dialer are
those bold material colors and shadows
and you'll see the the ripple touch
effect as I touch each of these tabs and
you get a more subtle material touch
effect on the recent calls you'll see
that the dialer button has its elevation
set so it's floating above the UI and as
I tap it you get these really nice too
rifle animations in L we give you
instant interactive access to
notifications right from the lock screen
so now you can read open and dismiss in
seconds I can swipe down and I get my
full list of notifications and we've
done a clever thing here where we've
merged the notification shade so
something that's been in Android since
10 with the lock screen and so from here
I can DoubleTap on a notification to
launch the corresponding app or if
there's something I don't need I can
just dismiss with a single swipe and to
unlock the phone well this is just a
notification shade so you just swipe it
away and you're straight into the device
fast and simple in El we're introducing
a new concept we call personal unlock it
and personal locking enables a device to
determine if it's in a trusted
environment say in the owner's hand or
on beside the owner on a table personal
and locking users signals such as
locations you tags it made Bluetooth
devices that are visible even your
unique voice branch so I currently have
a pattern of lock on this device but
because I'm wearing a Bluetooth watch my
phone knows it's me who's present and so
it doesn't challenge me with an unlock
so for example if I just swipe up the
phone will unlock just like that if I
take my watch off let me just add it to
Marcelo ok so now my phone can no longer
see the watch and because of that my
phone cannot ascertain if it's me who's
present as a result my phone will lock
down its security so now when I go to
unlock the device it presents me with a
pin lock it's a really great feature the
last performance enhancement I want to
take you through is on battery and we've
worked hard to make sure that the
battery keeps up with the performance
and of course there's a variety of
systems and components that tax the
battery on a modern phone or tablet so
Wi-Fi radios cell radios GPA GP you etc
you can't improve unless you can measure
so we created the tool that we call
battery historian and it helps you
visualize on a time axis the battery
usage information now you can correlate
battery discharge with what was
happening to the device at the time and
then finally we've added a new battery
saver mode in el sol battery saver
allows you to clock down CPU the refresh
rate even turned off
background data to conserve battery and
you can trigger it manually or configure
it to come on automatically when the
battery level is low so battery saver is
really great if you're about to embark
on a long hike or maybe a long protest
and you say you want the battery to last
even longer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
