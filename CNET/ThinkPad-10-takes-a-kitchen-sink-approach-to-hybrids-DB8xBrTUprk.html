wear a lot of hats i'm dan ackerman this
is the Lenovo ThinkPad 10 now we
certainly look at plenty of 10 inch
Windows 8 tablets this thinkpad 10 from
Lenovo is a little bit different in that
it has a higher resolution screen the
most of those even though it's an intel
atom processor this is a 1920 x 1200
screen which is actually super useful if
you're doing a lot of you know careful
work on here and you want that higher
resolution it also wants to be more than
just a tablet it wants to be your laptop
your desktop any kind of mobile system
that you might want to have this guy
wants to fit into it by making available
a whole ecosystem of accessories so the
basic tablet itself is right here looks
like you know standard thin 10 inch
Windows 8 tablet then you can get this
keyboard dock over here and it's got a
fairly nice lenovo style keyboard the
slots in connects the physically not not
via bluetooth is a little physical
connection it makes and then you can
just fold this down and take it with you
it form sort of a clamshell laptop the
only thing I didn't like about that
keyboard accessory is that you can't
really adjust the angle of the of the
screen when it's in here just kind of
stuck at this one angle but you can also
get a whole bunch of other accessories
let you do other things with the
thinkpad town I have a couple right here
there's a more traditional dock and you
can take this traditional dock here and
stick the system on it and that gives
you access to a whole bunch of other
ports and connections including an
Ethernet jack and some video output so
you can set this up and connect the
mouse and a keyboard and a monitor and
it's almost like your desktop computer
if you can handle the you know
reasonably pokey intel atom processor
there's also a snap-on cover kind of
like you would find with an ipad or
another tablet and thing i like about
this is you snap the cover on like this
and then when you flip it around to the
back the cover has a little a fold-down
flap right here so you can use the so
you can use the camera while keeping the
cover on you just fold this down your
camera lens is right there and then you
can use the rear facing camera on on the
thinkpad of course because this is a
very multifunctional tablet it's a
little bit more expensive than a lot of
the other similar systems that we've
seen you do get the higher
but still an intel atom processor this
thing started about five hundred fifty
dollars can go up from there and of
course if you had all these accessories
it can cost just about as much as a
regular full power core i series laptop
i'm dan ackerman and that is the Lenovo
ThinkPad temp</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
