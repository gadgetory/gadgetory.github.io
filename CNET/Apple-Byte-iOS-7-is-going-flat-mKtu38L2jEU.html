and welcome to the Apple bifur
everything good and bad inside the world
of Apple that's got new pair of glasses
you know but hey guys if you're waiting
to see the latest and greatest from the
Bay gay you might have to keep on
waiting now a recent Bloomberg report
says that a sweeping overhaul of iOS 7
by jony ive and team could leave the
company at risk of falling behind on the
new version of the OS for iPhones and
iPads a story earlier in the week from
nine to five Mac talked about how the
redesigned user interface is set to be
very very flat getting rid of textures
and the gloss and shine of previous
versions of iOS in favor of the flat
modern approach that's more similar to
what we've seen with Microsoft's Windows
Phone Metro UI and really something I've
been a fan of since day one now it looks
to bring a more streamlined interface
across the board where notes won't look
like a notepad and calendar won't have a
leather-bound feel and we've already
seen subtle changes where the podcast
app does not look like a tape deck
anymore the report also says Apple is
looking to add more glanceable
information and system option panels in
the OS so with all these changes the
Cupertino kids still are hoping to have
iOS 7 out in time for September but
internal deadlines for testing new
features are being set later compared to
past releases now if you even look at
this year's WWDC logo it hints at a
flatter design with modern lightweight
text and because it's such an extensive
overhaul some apps like male may be
revamped later after the OS is released
now in other news Apple is also pushing
for better car integration with maps in
Syria for 2013 9 25 Mac reports they're
working with car makers on updated
versions of center consoles that would
allow you to plug in an iphone and a
redesigned version of Apple maps would
pop onto the display instead of the
factory GPS system that's installed now
last year Apple announced the eyes-free
Siri service that allows users to
connect their cars to their iPhones and
use Siri with the iphone display turn
off
Apple is also partnering with Volkswagen
after the recent unveiling of yes the
IVL in Shanghai now it supports a
docking station on the dashboard and
when an i phone is plugged in it can tap
into the navigation and audio systems
there's also an app that's a companion
that will display vehicle information
like your fluid levels your car fluid
levels compared driving distance times
and can bring in music from Spotify or
iTunes and take calls that can be
patched into the car stereo now the car
integration does sound pretty cool but I
don't want a beetle with a flower holder
in my car like my boy Steven does that's
right I'm calling you out dude whatever
brian at least i'm not wearing a plaid
shirt with a lavender undershirt and a
beaded necklace are we in hawai bro yeah
let's um just take a look at the app of
the week
this week's app for the week is the
addition of Google now wait isn't this
an apple show yeah charlie it is but the
latest update to the google app brings
even better integration with the best
voice search for information and
directions that's available on your
phone while also showing you google
nails relevant information for weather
sports scores nearby traffic and more
and you know what there's a whole lot of
people that use google services on their
phones so check it out is definitely
we're taking a look at but there's one
thing to note and it's the widespread
reports that this app is a battery hog
because it constantly uses your location
services to pull new info for you so if
you're seeing a significant drain the
best thing to do is jump into your
settings then privacy go to location
services and turn it off specifically
for the google app you'll turn off
things like live traffic updating but
you'll still be able to use many of the
other pieces of google now so yeah you
just have to decide if the app is for
you or not alright let's check out some
rumors related to WWDC we already know
that Tim Cook hinted we would not see
any new hardware until this fall but
that doesn't mean we won't see any speed
bumps KGI securities reports that we
should see new models of the macbook pro
and macbook air lines based on Intel's
latest Haswell processors which is no
major surprise they also say Apple will
still keep the standard size macbook pro
13 alongside the air due to its
popularity with consumers and it's lower
price point but this really feels like
Apple is setting the expectations very
very low for WWDC alright let's check
out the quick bites if you're an iPhone
user you've probably heard of the app
called vine or you can make some fun
six-second videos and you can also get
really creative with stop motion videos
as well well the app just received an
update to use the front-facing camera so
some of you will like that but it's
really basically just going to bring a
lot more video selfies and have you
heard of this auction on the website
charitybuzz for coffee with Apple CEO
Tim Cook how much would that be worth
you well it has over a week left for
bidding and the highest bid is at six
hundred thousand dollars that's the
price of five Audi are
or 600,000 sausage mcmuffins totally
worth it but if you had coffee with cook
what question would you guys ask him in
it could be any question well let us
know by emailing the apple byte at cnet
com or tweet me at brian Tong I'll pick
my three favorite questions and if you
get picked I'm looking you extra special
people up with one of these logitech
ultrathin keyboard covers in black white
or pink for the ipad 2 3 and 4 they're
one of the best accessories out there
the keyboard feels great and there are a
100 dollar value alright that's going to
do it for this week's show it's a
quickie but we'll be back with more
thanks for watching we'll catch you guys
next time for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
