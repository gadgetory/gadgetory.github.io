tune I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
CNN update Microsoft is launching its
new streaming music service called Xbox
music and it's designed to compete with
services like iTunes and Spotify Xbox
music has a library of 30 million songs
for users to stream any song they want
create playlists or stations even
download songs but there are several
drawbacks
starting Tuesday Xbox music will be
available on the Xbox 360 but it
requires a $10 monthly subscription yeah
and that's on top of already paying for
an Xbox Live account you can try it free
though for 30 days Windows Phone 8 users
will also need a subscription to use it
on a phone however you can listen to a
free version with commercials on Windows
8 PCs and tablets when Windows 8 arrives
on October 26th Xbox music will be the
default music player but after six
months the free ad-supported version
will be limited to 10 hours of playback
per month by comparison Spotify doesn't
limit how long you can listen to the
ad-supported version and Spotify is on
more devices so why would you want Xbox
music the idea is that all your
playlists will be in sync across Windows
devices and someday apps for Apple and
Android will be released Microsoft's
goal right now is to hook you into the
Windows 8 ecosystem Windows 7 users are
also out of luck Sprint will be getting
a big financial boost next year a
Japanese mobile carrier called Softbank
just bought majority controls sprint for
twenty point one billion dollars
Softbank will also prompt another eight
billion dollar investment into improved
Sprint's Network nothing will change
right now the deal isn't expected to
close until the middle of next year the
cache though can help sprint expand its
4G LTE coverage area Sprint only offers
these faster speeds to 24 areas to
compare Verizon has LTE in 400 areas we
have another iPad Mini clue mobile geek
published a screenshot of an electronics
retailer inventory list which lists the
iPad Mini coming in both Wi-Fi and
cellular versions for several different
memory options if you believe this list
it shows the iPad Mini coming with eight
gigs as well as 1632
and 64 gigabyte options if you're
looking for a cheaper game system for
the holidays a Nintendo has dropped the
price of the week to 130 dollars this
isn't the new Wii U this is the current
system but for that price you'll get it
in black with Wii Sports and we sport
resort as well as a black Wii Remote
Plus and nunchuck controller so
basically starting on October 28th an
entire Nintendo Wii game system cost
less than the new Apple iPod Nano go
figure
