life no pressure there let's find out
about it as we drive the 2011 Chevy Volt
and check the tech the 1970 Z car 76
accord the 86 Taurus all watershed
introductions and all pale in the glare
of the hype around this guy
the 2011 Chevy Volt it's being asked to
save the environment your fuel budget
and GM's reputation in one stroke I
don't envy it the Volt is distinctive in
its look but whether folks are going to
aspire to be seen in it for its styling
is doubtful that Malibu meets Cruze
thing is neither hot nor hideous it's a
4 passenger sedan not 5 due to a console
between the rear seats to accommodate
part of the battery now inside the Volt
the first thing you notice is look what
made it into production this white stuff
this was in all the concepts and I
thought oh that's interesting they're
trying to do like an what an iPod
Classic meets a you know Imperial
stormtrooper but no here it is more
notable than that though are these touch
sensitive buttons almost every button
here is a touch contact kind of like on
current my Ford in my link in touch
which I have not been a big fan of that
part of touch if you're looking around
you may have already noticed something
else really cutting-edge on this car no
dials no gauges all screens you've got
one in the center that we've seen before
this is all new a complete LCD square
instrument panel it's basically like a
7-inch tablet just sitting in front of
you all the time you've got a huge array
of media options on this car they aren't
the main story but let me just run you
through them you've got your usual radio
categories as well as XM radio on this
guy you've got the hard drive disk aux
button right here again Touch cycle
through at 30 gigabytes of hard drive
space - rip - of course aux USB you do
have bluetooth streaming and of course
Bluetooth hands-free another indication
that a volt is being moved is a mid to
high end car is the fact that it has
navigate
patience standard on it as you might
imagine there's a drive mode button down
here that lets you go from normal to
sport to mountain normal is what it says
a normal balance of how it uses electric
versus charges versus gives you
responsiveness to the throttle your
sport mode is going to give you greater
sensitivity and accelerate a response in
particular but of course that's going to
tap more juice and then the mountain
mode is one that will start to charge
the battery sooner when you're doing
lots of mountain grades because that
will deplete the battery rapidly so the
generator will kick in before the
battery is as low as it would be
normally aside from in the driver's seat
you can also run your volt from your
phone
OnStar mobile lets you lock and unlock
the doors start the Volt prep the cabin
climate check your charge state tell the
car when and how to charge even blow the
horn to find the thing ok here's where
GM has been spending all their time and
their bajillions of dollars developing
the voltec powertrain here's what makes
this car interesting it's an electric
car but it has a gas engine there's a
1.4 liter inline-4 super lean-burn gas
engine here that does nothing but turn a
generator that generator puts juice into
a big old t-shaped Power Cell that's in
the middle of the car and that power is
an electric motor that drives the front
wheels through a one speed gear
reduction transmission bottom line 150
horsepower 273 foot-pounds of torque
huge Delta there because it's all
electric power zero to sixty about eight
and a half seconds not bad you're gonna
get about 35 40 mpg but there's also a
number called mpge or equivalent that's
ninety three and your evu range before
the car starts to burn any gas to
replenish its batteries is around twenty
five to forty miles there's a lot going
on here now mpge is an odd bird it's a
measurement you'll see on some new
window stickers that converts
electricity and roughly equivocates it
to the same energy in a gallon of gas
rule of thumb one gallon of gas is 34
kilowatt hours because
I know you wanted to know now weird
about charging you can plug this guy
into 120 or a to 40 outlet charging
apparatus right here this guy lives on
this kind of wind-up thing in the back
you see you got a regular plug on there
that can plug into whatever outlets
you've got and then this will go into
the little door here keep that guy on
the side of the car that's this new
universal thing that all the electric
cars are using that plugs in there so
yes there's nothing wrong with charging
this car it works really well you do get
a bunch of electric-only range a nice
amount that might even handle your
entire commute I just think there's an
awful lot of hassle that goes around
with it if you're not really committed
and for most folks just putting gas in
it and getting like around 60 mpg it's
pretty good and all the hassle of
charging may not be worth that 93 MPGe
okay so here we are underway the Chevy
Volt on the left here in the
configuration I mean you can read rigor
this - a little bit but on the left
there is my fuel tank my gasoline with
an estimate of range on this range
extending generating on the fly drive
motif on the right is something very
interesting that green ball is the
momentum meter if you will you don't
want it to be up or down when you hit
the gas to hard the little ball goes up
see that and it gets smaller and it kind
of withers and it gets this nasty Flemmi
color of yellow if I brake really hard
watch this same thing it drops down and
it's not happy it tells you want to
accelerate hard I'm wasting energy
either electrons or dinosaur cells but
when I brake hard I'm also wasting
energy I'm wasting kinetic energy now on
this shifter which controls the one
speed automatic which is really a gear
reduction box than an actual gear box
you've got your Drive and low Drive you
know what that is low is a little
different low is like be on a Prius or a
hybrid synergy drive vehicle it brings
in an aggressive regeneration so I'm
gonna put this guy in low and do nothing
else Oh
down we go heavy deceleration as it's
really putting the electromagnetic
brakes on to put juice back in the pack
interesting trivia about this guy
you can go potentially a year without
burning gas if you've got a short
commute and you plug in every night and
only commute in this car so what happens
to that gasoline sitting in your tank
gas does go bad you know it jellify is
it gets real nasty well they have a
pressurized gas tank on this car also
sensors that will run the engine and
burn off some gas about every couple
weeks I understand it if you never use
gas otherwise okay you got a bunch of
modes here on the power flow thing
there's battery power I'm running off
stored electricity and the engines not
running right now I hit the brakes
alright Coast and there's regen that's
regenerating with the electromagnetic
clutching of the motor to drive back to
the batteries now when I get on and I
have engine power where I'm generating
through the generator through the
battery pack into the electric motors
okay so all of this gets down to the
bottom line what's the efficiency on
this car let's take a look that's under
energy info here on the main screen
you've got lots of things it will tell
you what the
MGP is the confusion does not end on
this charge since the car was last
plugged in and got a charge in the
driving history since then I got a bunch
of things to look at I got 55 miles per
gallon overall on this charge the cars
done 60 miles per gallon average and
it's twenty two hundred and seventy two
mile life here's my driving style and
climate setting efficiency on this trip
I've not been driving terribly
efficiently only thirty four percent
efficient but I've had my climate
control 100% efficient that basically
had it turned off here's your climate
system where you can save as much power
as possible if you go to Eco mode it'll
use the climate in a way that doesn't
SAP energy so it'll run the AC very
limited li down here that little green
ball that's where you see the total
efficiency you want that number to be
low on the climate scale Chevy has
turned out a nicely engineered car here
it's a technical tour de force enjoyable
to drive and seriously efficient its
hurdles are the somewhat complicated
story around its electric miss suburban
looks the fact that it comes from a
recently bankrupt car brand and then
there's the price okay so you decided
the volts for you here are the numbers
forty-one thousand dollars with
destination now there's a little bit of
I don't know I think it's a little
misleading on the Chevy Volt website
that shows the price of this in great
big bold numbers with a $7,500 tax
credit already - doubt of it but that's
a tax credit that's not a rebate as of
today's taping though the Obama
administration's trying to convert it to
a rebate that'll be different right now
it's a credit
it's a $7,500 deduction if you will off
any federal tax that you owe in the tax
year you buy this car if you don't own a
federal tax you don't get any benefit
and even if you do get a benefit it can
never turn into a refund all I can do is
reduce your tax to zero so in other
words you've got to at least $7,500
federal tax to get the full $7,500 tax
credit from buying one of these cars
it's not as simple as getting a check
from the government if the Obama
administration just changed the law as
they're trying to you will actually get
a $7,500 rebate at deal time at the
showroom that will be different</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
