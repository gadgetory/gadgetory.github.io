out the rugged cat beef 15q now the
phone comes to us from Caterpillar a
company that's probably better known for
those big yellow construction vehicles I
doubt this is gonna be able to stand up
to a quite as much punishment in those
behemoths but it's definitely built to
last and start to $350 unlocked the
specs here aren't really impressive the
4-inch screen has a measly 800 by 480
pixel resolution and doesn't hold up too
well in direct sunlight viewing angles
aren't great either colors look fine but
hold the phone at the wrong angle and
the contrast degradation becomes really
noticeable there's also only four gigs
of total storage space it does have a
micro SD card slot though with support
for up to 32 gig cards so you're gonna
want to pick one up if you plan on
installing mini apps performance on the
other hand isn't bad a 1.3 gigahertz
quad-core CPU isn't all that stellar on
paper but the phone never get on the
ways I flip through apps and websites
during my testing more importantly
simpler casual games like Angry Birds
transformers handle really well so any
downtime can be spent productively
there's a five megapixel camera on the
back and while I was able to tease out
the occasional usable shot and ideal
condition bright lighting that sort of
thing it mostly cranks out grainy noisy
shots the autofocus elves are pretty
sluggish so you're gonna want to stick
to slow-moving or static objects but you
probably aren't buying the rugged
smartphone for gaming and photography
this thing is solid with the scratch
resistant Gorilla Glass 2 display it's
also pretty light just under six ounces
that's thanks to the silver anodized
aluminum body rubber bumpers keep the
corners safe and also make sure the
phone is really comfortable to hold the
b15 cue is ip67 certified that means
it's dust proof and water resistance in
this case up to three feet for 30
minutes the phone's USB port and
headphone jacks are covered and you'll
get a little warning when unplugging the
phone and removing the headphones
reminding you to seal it back up pretty
nice touch now on the back you'll find
the locking switch
slide that over to the right and you'll
see the yellow that means it's unlocked
and then you're gonna pry the backplate
off it's a little tough to get off which
is a good thing actually because that's
how the phone keeps its water resistance
underneath you'll find the two thousand
milliamp hour battery the micro SD card
slot and the Simcoe
this particular model has dual SIM slot
so that's the cat b15 queue now if
you're just a little clumsy this phone
is probably gonna be overkill especially
at $350 but if you work outdoors or
spend a lot of time camping and are
worried about you know dropping your
phone or inclement weather this is gonna
be a pretty strong contender the glossy
display does give me pause though so
you're gonna want to beware if you spend
a lot of time in bright sunny areas
I'm Nate Ralph thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
