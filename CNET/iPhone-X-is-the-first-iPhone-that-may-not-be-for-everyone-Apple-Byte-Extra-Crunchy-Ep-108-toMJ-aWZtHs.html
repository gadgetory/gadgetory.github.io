to the show good morning my name is
Steven beech a producer of the Apple
byte extra crunchy podcast when you're a
host here in studio in San Francisco I'm
the flash
mr. Brian Tom what's up everybody
welcome to the show a this episode 107
of the Apple byte extra crunchy it is
iPhone launch week it is iPhone launch
day when we're recording this but before
we get into all the things that were
happening we want to jump right to it
because we have our man scene that's own
Scott Stein the CNET review
extraordinaire he has it in his hand I
do want to preface this Scott sign has
literally been working non-stop since
what is it like Monday a.m. overnight
basically is that when it went it's when
they got you the phone monday monday
about noon is one I started setting it
up so we've been about four days we've
been working really constantly and and I
have gotten up I've got about one and a
half hours of sleep one night Ari
another and somewhat normal the other
nights I was at the CBS broadcast Center
for about five hours one day and five
hours another day too
yeah I mean he's been in high demand and
so we appreciate you coming the show and
we can hear it in your voice and Scott
said I'm gonna give you ten minutes of
my time and if I pass out I pass out so
we're gonna respect that true story I
was asleep on the sofa like 10 minutes
ago
and I slapped him I wrote in our throat
corporate messaging app I'm like are you
gonna still be on the show like dude are
you bailing
like I just woke up I didn't think I
could do it I was delirious
I'm delirious right now so you're gonna
get some some thoughts this is actually
the best thoughts okay so Scott the
first point I want to hit obviously
let's talk about the iPhone 10 you
reviewed it you've talked about a lot of
this ad nauseam but I think you can get
in more detail and also the Delirium
does actually make it more interesting
to me yeah let's let's jump right into
it I I've used it obviously the home
button is probably feels its face ID on
the home button but the home button
feels like the biggest change you've had
it now for almost a week what what are
your thoughts on it we're forced we're
going to be forced to get used to it
that's why I find it interesting how do
you feel about it now after all these
days yeah well it's now my delirious
thought I'm thinking of like the first
iPhone when we had to think learn how to
type on on the screen and people said oh
I'll never get used to keyboards and and
we did so maybe it's kind of like that
you know I feel that everyday stuff I
did with it felt a little different and
it was frustrating right because the
home button is really convenient now
Game rid of the virtual home button now
means you're gonna be swiping up which
is not as easy for one hand use but I
started to get used to that and I
started to kind of getting used to the
feel of the interface in general and I
think it's about trade-offs for getting
that nice huge screen and so that's what
this phone is about do you want to learn
the new language in exchange for the
screen I think that screen and that size
are really worth it do you know could
there have been better ways to do the
interface I don't know like I feel like
sometimes yes but I feel like in general
maybe Apple will either figure that or
I'll figure it out so that's that's kind
of the story of the 10 is that it's like
I really needed to shaving my beard it
was like I don't know how I feel I don't
know I feel about that but I do feel
like I love the design of this 10 I
don't know if I'd want to pay a thousand
for it but just because I don't spend
like crazy amounts of money on things
all the time I don't like to but I think
that it's worth it if you've been
waiting and you want to show off a phone
that is the best iPhone right now you
know I think that also using the phone
itself what what stands out to me is
look
there's gonna be a variety of different
people right Apple has such as mass
appeal you'll have the young techies the
the Millennials the people that are
super tech savvy that are going to
embrace this and use it but one thing
that I did find oisin like this phone is
not gonna be for my mom like my mom
already has a problem with the home
button okay yeah so like to be first for
those type of users you're not gonna all
sudden say hey go get a 10 it's a
literally there's times where you start
you swipe or you feel like you want to
touch somewhere nothing happens like I
even don't I how did you get used the
idea of control center being in that top
corner where you couldn't just access it
with one finger you gotta like really
almost use two hands and reach into that
top right corner I do not like Control
Center in the top right corner I do not
like it at all because I think control
center is great and bringing it from the
bottom is the way to go actually someone
i retweeted had the solution which was
they should just include control center
as a tool alongside multitasking when
you swipe up and hold kind of like the
ipad does do that just make it
accessible from the bottom because even
with accessibility reach ability reach
ability is on the phone which which
drops the screen down but you have to
swipe up off the bottom edge and it is
impossible to pull off like forget that
that's a sweet spot you have to hit it's
so weird and it doesn't most of the time
I can't get it to work and that's the
only way you could potentially reach up
to the corner for a control center it's
almost like deliberately and accessible
like it's um not not what I would like
to have and I think control center is so
key for so many different things so
that's one thing I think the flicking
the swipe up instead of home button is a
good way to go I kind of feel as I swipe
I am like yeah that's like I'm drunk um
so basically a swipe up is like drunk
history yeah and then and then I'm
pretty you know then-president like it
and so you swipe up and you get used to
it I think it's like flicking apps away
and so that gesture actually and the one
I thought was the weirdest I actually
started to get the hang of and I really
liked doing with both hands
but with one hand I still feel like the
home button is so convenient you know
the other disconnect that I found
immediately is the way you use the iPad
with iOS 11 is now totally different
than the way you use it on the iPhone
and that is that is really odd to me
from a standpoint of look right Apple is
always and I know this is like their
future concept phone right we know this
is what they have is envisioned as a
future but when you have multiple
devices that are doing different things
even though the iPad has a home button
accessing control center on the iPad is
different than accessing control center
on the iPhone and I think you know yeah
you swipe from the bottom up and it's
all there here because the bottom swipe
I do you feel they should have or maybe
I know they've explored it but the idea
of a virtual home button would have been
okay yeah I think it would have been
okay and it's something that's a point
that I was saying before too that you
know other phones like the node 8 and
others have a you know area where you
press that's the home button on the
screen that's an Android thing that's
very common and I'd still like to see
the iPhone explore that at some point
because I agree there's something
comforting about that and you can't I
want the screen to evolve into the
button itself and I want 3d touch to be
used more I feel like 3d touch is so
underutilized in navigating the
interface like I want to be able to
press into things and kind of you know
wipe away apps by pressing into them
route or maybe I'm crazy but I feel like
there's just ways that you could do this
with the screen that doesn't have to
involve like a swiping gesture but I
think that I think well we're told what
were you talking about before then I was
talking about the disconnect between the
iPad yes and the iPhones interface
totally yeah yeah thank you
I really am like doing so I love you
thank you you know you know you know but
that well thank you um but I think that
the AI is ridiculous but the iPad and
iPhone are different now and I think
that is super funky although I think it
also points to something else I want the
iPad to continue growing into a MacBook
alternative and that's a growth path
that I think is still in process and the
eye
heads growing into an even more
full-fledged computer but right now it's
still very much of a familiar connection
to iPhones and so the language is
starting to split but it's like a gentle
split and it's kind of weird so I will
actually want them to go even further I
want the evolution to continue and
really diverge and and and then maybe it
won't be so bad but right now that is
the weird thing too is that so you have
touch ID on a lot of other devices you
have a lot of different interfaces on a
lot of other iPhones and other things
and right now the ten stands alone and
that's a strange place to be because you
you may have devices now like you said
iPads or even other iPhones or the Apple
watch they all kind of share oh don't
share they all have different ways of
doing their own thing I think it's the
most fragmented we've actually seen the
Apple ecosystem and iOS ever and just
kind of rewinding back to one of your
points about 3d touch you know
everyone's going to have to learn how to
use the new iPhone 10 with this new
interface language and it was one of
those things where when I first saw 3d
touch I was excited because I'm like
this is awesome this could be a
game-changer but they never built in any
functionality that forced people to use
it right some people write to this day
don't even really use or even really
quite honestly don't even really know
that 3d touch exists on their phone and
so that is to me it was like you said an
opportunity to okay if you 3d touch
somewhere on anywhere on the screen and
that could be your home button that's
almost better to me than using a swipe
because you just do a little hard press
and that's instantly the home button and
then people would be like oh I get what
3d touch is about maybe it'll evolve you
know they've they've made mistakes and
interfaces before like the Apple watch
how we've seen how watch OS is
completely evolved and I love it now but
uh it's just interesting that 3d touches
is this underutilized interface that
could tie things together more from
whether it's iPad iPhone but it still
hasn't really been used in that way yeah
it's a it's a story in progress for me
that I'm trying to like think about but
that's exactly because I've said for a
while I think 3d touch in concept is
really great in execution
in terms of what it is in iOS it's not
even used to any degree of what it's
capable of I mean there's a whole
gradient that that 3d touch can do and
is super sensitive and you almost never
see that you see that in like a couple
of games but or like drawing apps but a
lot of times it's just a push in and
that's it and it's just to do something
that's essentially like like a hold tap
you know that you could duplicate on
something without 3d touch maybe it's
for consistency but heck if you're doing
a whole new phone that already has its
own language why not push that envelope
further absolutely I'm just glad I know
I'm gonna ask you one more question that
we can dig into and then I'm gonna
literally let you go faced ideas
obviously the other big thing here with
the iPhone 10 you did a great thing
where you lit and you said earlier you
literally shaved your beard did you do
it for the iPhone 10 you actually wanted
to shave your beard I need a knife I did
it for the iPhone 10 real confession I
talked about face I know and how how you
felt using it over time up to this point
what do you think of it yeah hey are you
a are you a sold on it or you're like
it's alright right now I'm we know it's
gonna get better
so I think face ID surprise me in that
it worked with more of my facial hair
configurations I love this montage this
is the best it gets I'm so much more
Haggard now that that is um that's the
thing that surprised me and I thought
that was great
oh this this this really does work but
the difference between it working as
again conceptually and sort of like
always being instantly logging you on in
a way that feels seamless and buttery
smooth that doesn't always happen and
that doesn't happen for a variety of
reasons sometimes it might be the way my
hand is positioned angled sometimes it
might be that it just didn't get it cuz
every once in a while unlike when you
put your finger on touch ID even that
fails sometimes you know just sometimes
it just didn't get it and I don't know
why and rarely and then other times it's
that I didn't get the combination of
like Oh II sure need to swipe up or if
somebody sees your iPhone
and that triggers the you know hit your
passcode to use it again thing which is
what happens if somebody looks at your
iPhone and it's not you
so which happens a lot so you know those
are all those things and it makes it
just something that doesn't quite feels
automatic right now and then you know
will that feel comfortable because it's
so it's chapel's credit that it's so
easy to use touch ID on the home button
it was a brilliant innovation yep man
you click it and and just by clicking it
you've already done the scan that was
brilliant and I think that I just think
that face ID as much as it's going to be
a factor going down the road and be
something you're gonna see in a lot of
stuff and is the beginning of something
new for Apple it doesn't currently have
that brilliant
utilization the moment you use it like
the bat plus swipe up is like it's a bit
of a disconnect it's two steps no matter
what it's two steps yeah and that's like
weird it's weird and that's why I was
saying the review it's weird like that
just a weird not normal thing
Minoo I think if you lifted it everyone
just wants it to unlock or maybe that's
something you could have as an option or
maybe you just tap the screen now it has
to tap the screen to wake up which is
nice you could tap the screen face scan
and it wakes up something that just
feels like you know voila
the swipe is yeah it just feels extra
like it does it it feels exactly it
feels like extra and it doesn't show up
so the cool thing and interesting thing
is if you use any touch ID apps that now
use face ID as you use the phone you'll
notice that it's kind of crazy automatic
like if you use an app like Amazon or
something else all of a sudden you'll
just scan your face the face thing will
transform and your user information will
be entered and you'll it'll just be like
it'll just be like this kind of magic
window where it's like yeah and then you
and then it's kind of scary because you
think like oh did you just like log me
in for something and usually I think you
still have to enter you know you still
have to hit the return or the dot you
know whatever it is to log in but it
just means that instead of usually you
do that do
touch ID iCloud keychain now it's like
we already got you he chained away
without you doing anything now just tap
to log in and that's pretty cool because
it's getting to the point where it feels
like it'll just know who you are for all
your apps yeah
the other question I had and scary yeah
it is very scary what can we give our
information to all these companies now
it's we're already done so when it comes
to that the other question I had is did
you get to use it that much at retail
like point-of-sale displays because I I
haven't yet obviously but I feel like
you know you angle your phone a lot
differently when you're trying to put it
in your point-of-sale purchase and you
don't have it aligned up with your face
I felt like touch ID was so easy because
you don't even have to be looking at
your phone you just double click the
home button the wallets there do you
have to align yourself a little better
when you use it for payments that like
at retail shops well what you have to do
I've only used it a couple of
point-of-sale spots I'm gonna use it
more for that is that it's it's it's
like you have to load the phone with the
capability to pay so bringing out your
pocket you're double clicking now you're
scanning now it says hold near reader so
now I could bring it over and pay that's
a way that's much longer interaction
yeah so it's gonna be this like hang on
a sec while I make my face work now I'm
gonna pay and whereas normally you would
just bring it over and pay and it would
just work at when you're already there
at the terminal now you have to like
have the second yeah that's what I
thought and then you're like a hundred
percent sure you know yes so it does
mean that you can reach across and pay
for stuff and you don't have to like
stick your face in something but it is
weird
it is weird just because it's a
different process and I I don't think
that's gonna take much longer and I do
maybe do like the side button because I
actually accidentally purchasing the
other day where I click the home button
out of like semi deliriously as I was
browsing iTunes and I like bought an
episode and then I was like oh wait a
second I just purchased something I
could I already have unscrew hold on
hold on well didn't you also
accidentally purchase like an Xbox on
Amazon one time
you accidentally like anima beta like an
Xbox or something on the Apple watch I
actually bought an Xbox on the Apple
watch that was might one of my first
viral moments when pre air pods when we
did that and it was really stupid and I
didn't mean to and that it became like a
story the people I've seen a pattern
Scott I'm seeing a pattern here yeah
there is a pattern there is a pattern
and it goes back like when are you still
working with other magazine things to do
like other gear tests and things like
that before there was like functioning
internet where I would like do crazy
gear test so yeah its pattern so I would
say that I would say that I don't mind
the double-click on the side I not wild
about bringing things up to my face and
I also need to give it more time because
I think that this is like four days and
it's definitely not enough time to
really know if the training wheels have
come off yet and whether you know the
point between you say oh I've gotten
used to it and oh yeah I'm still not
gonna get used to this like this is not
good not good for me so I'm in the
middle zone now where I can say parts of
it were weird and parts of it I'm
getting used to but I still like TBD hey
Scott the face ID has like these little
lights that flash is that annoying to
you when you use that like I could see
that being an annoying in a movie
theater or something but is this
something you could turn off or what do
you think about that which lights do you
mean the lights I keep seeing all the
reviews they're like flow you know it
only is caught on camera only cameras
catch those lights only camera yeah yeah
all that infrared stuff you do not see
um it is you know scanning across your
face with thousands of dots and and it
doesn't happen all the time because it's
you does use power I think I think it's
a pretty big power drain on the phone
because when I use face ID or any of
that an emoji stuff a lot in demos the
phone gets a little bit little toasty
more than a little toasty it gets quite
warm and so it makes me wonder if apps
that are going to be heavily using that
in the future will be limited because
every other time the phone was cool but
it just it does tax it but if you don't
see anything when you're using it
hey go ahead over also battery life has
been okay for you like have you had any
problems with the battery so far it's
been okay I mean I it's nothing it's
nothing great it's been kind of like
iPhone standard I would call it like I
made a power use phones I guess I've
never had an iPhone regular or Plus that
has gotten to the point where I go oh my
god the battery life is unbelievable
you know like that's I'm always wishing
it had more I usually tend to need a
recharge later in the day
I'd say that I'd say the 10 probably
feels a little it and as Apple said a
little better than the eight or seven
maybe about the same or a little worse
than the plus but similar in terms of
like when I got into work I was about
like 70% and you know six maybe 69
percent went on a bad commute with
crappy service which drains battery so
our battery benchmarks are just about
finished and and you know we've been
finishing those up and I'd say it's it's
between the eight and the eight plus
which is okay that's good hey Scott a
last thing before we let you go so what
is your kind of at least up to this
point because it is still TBD where do
you stand just the overall take on the
phone I feel like it's not for everyone
but you know I guess you could almost
divide it like who is this phone really
for right now yeah well so the fun I
mean the final review did go up and
we're just adding tiny bits to it but we
did put the rating on it I think it's
the best iPhone and I had to think about
that so that kind of shows I think
because I I'm not wild about some of the
gesture interface stuff but I think it
will be a growing pattern I think it's
the sweet spot and design and screen I
think that's fantastic I don't think
it's the phone for everyone and I think
I think back to when I reviewed the
iPhone 5 that period of time in Apple's
cycle they had one iPhone a year and it
was the iPhone for everyone that was I
remember feeling like the iPhone 5 is a
phone that everyone should be getting
and I think that's changed now
anything Apple is created a lineup
that's also changed they have a variety
of iPhones and a ton of iPhones for sale
and it's kind of an acknowledgment of
that I really wish that the 10
was a little bit easier to use and I
wish that it was more affordable so that
it could be the one that everyone could
be getting right now that may be that
may come obviously in the future
yeah but it's great I hope so but you
never know I mean maybe they just
continue creating three products that I
mean their product line that keeps
blossoming into more and more items so
I'm not entirely sure they may just keep
selling a touch ID one alongside it
maybe they'll have two different sizes
of ten I kind of wonder if they're gonna
go ten plus like that's what that it's
something Lucien is right everyone's
pointing to that I mean the rumblings
are there why not I mean they do that
with every other product they make I
mean there's multiple sizes of
everything actually even Apple watch so
I think that it proves that you could
have a larger size one and keep it more
manageable in size and so that that's
the question is do you want to wait it
out and see where this thing goes or
dive in now and I think the fact I think
just think of thousand dollars is a lot
of money I think no matter which way you
slice it I think you could say sure it's
worth it and I think it is as a bump up
in it cost but a lot of the the best
features for this are our design because
you're getting the same processor you're
getting the same a lot of the same
camera stuff so it's not like you're
getting even though they call it a ten
like it's next year's phone it is this
year's phone with maybe next year's
design yeah that's that's great Scott so
you know what thank you so much for
hanging and spending adult you're
delirious time with us like you stayed
of course 10 20 more minutes than you
said you would and so we loved your
insight we always love having you so
Scott um enjoy your weekend and if I
don't hear from you for a week it's
probably cuz you're in a coma yes
I'm about to pass out I'm more awake now
than I was and I will be more sleep
later than I am now awesome alright
Scott Stein thank so much buddy we'll
talk to you soon okay thanks brain
awesome
alright so Scott Stein given us the four
one one on the iPhone 10 he's had it the
longest out of any person here at C net
I'm still waiting to get mine because it
should be coming in the mail I'll be
flying home tonight and I'll pick it up
but conveniently I did want to tell you
this
my iPhone seven went into an infinite
loop boot where it just keeps on
rebooting rebooting I tried to do the
force manual restart it wouldn't stop it
and it just come in and also I noticed
there was like a chip on my touch ID all
of a sudden like I've never dropped it
but the actual laminate on it is chipped
a little bit and so of course
coincidentally the day the night before
the new iPhone 10 comes out is it broken
right now won't start at all oh no I
won't I mean I praise my power it just
loops out so I'm coming up to put it you
know I'm gonna probably have to put in
DFU mode and restore it but I have to
connect to my home phone it just I just
love how coincidentally it didn't work
today we were outside at the line all
day and we have so we have some fun
we're gonna put up a great video of what
we did the line but yeah my iPhone
didn't work so guess what I use the
whole day so far what was Apple watch
seriously LTE baby and I'm loving I love
this way you put it in DFU there's a
mode that basically puts in like a disk
restore mode oh yeah that's good alright
so let's just take a break we will read

let's talk about iPhone launch day I was
at the line at 6 a.m. in San Francisco
today how did that go man well you know
the Union Square store in San Francisco
is the flagship store and Apple even put
up like photos of all the different
different source oh this is not that
video this is yeah we know online
there's a there's a link with the stores
that Apple I kind of showcase what the
stores openings look like around the
world but at a in San Francisco the
energy was honestly really great you
know I guess what like I do buy a lot of
Apple products and we do like to be
critical of the brand because we're
putting down our cold hard cash for it
but when you go to these Apple events
you just you honestly feel and see the
power of the brand there were about 400
about 400 people wrapped around two
sides of a San Francisco block waiting
to get the iPhone 10 and sometimes
you're like why why didn't you just get
it online I talked a lot of them they
said look it says two to three weeks
I wanted I'd rather just wait in line
and get it today so I think a lot of
people were like that
we had a line for pre-orders lines for
people that were just walking in but
everyone was excited about it the first
person in line was there since Sunday oh
my gosh so they've been there for five
roughly five days Wow
waiting to be the first in line for the
iPhone 10 is I do something with your
life bro look at all the happiness on
all these people's faces though yeah I
look very happy it's you know when
you're away from me you don't feel the
energy but there's a lot of energy and
it's fun I'm the first admit like I like
you know it's a material good but I like
seeing people like happy about it I wish
they looked at their child children like
that for some people these are their
children yeah exactly
but it was it was a great time at the
San Francisco store I'm trying to think
of anything stuck out to me all I'm
saying is just watch the actual Apple
byte episode that we're putting up today
from the line we had a good time
what was that that you had an iPhone 10
yesterday morning whose was that was
that CNET's if CNET's iPhone - yeah it
was you know I play something tell me
what you tell me what you thought right
I played with it for like a good I don't
know maybe five minutes
the swiping was definitely had to get
used to it you know like figuring out
where where to swipe from and this and
that after five minutes I was like it's
just another iPhone that's exactly me
that's how I felt and I wanted to see
how you looked at it I want to see how
JK looked at it okay Len this is not
sacrilegious and I tweeted this I did
feel like the design is great but when
you actually use it
well you just swipe left and right look
up and down you don't really do much
because we know what they do yeah
sometimes it felt like wait it's a
little underwhelming right it's totally
all right feeling with like the last two
iPhones I bought like you get him in
first you're like oh my god this is the
latest phone the hottest phone the best
phone out right now after like five
minutes you're like okay it's it's an
iPhone you know I know I just swipe with
I know to use the apps I'm gonna slap
the case on put a case on it and
everything but I we're not trying to you
know be a buzzkill I think there's a lot
of people that work really hard for
their iPhones I put out a video after
the pre-order of the iPhone and we're
gonna have some calls about that but I
wanted to put out an honest video about
how I felt after dropping $1000 plus on
it and some people just instantly got
mad like oh you're killing my buzz screw
you you can't afford it if you're poor
blah blah blah it was honestly a video
just to offer perspective yeah like I
wasn't trying to make people feel bad
about it like I'm excited you're feeling
free heart yeah just my feelings about
everything that's been happening around
us and just like you got to stop for a
moment sometimes that's all and just be
like wow we're really lucky to have this
stuff so it was today has been crazy I
think there's gonna be plenty of news
stories covering the launch day events
but it was fine but at the end of the
day it feels like an iPhone which is a
good thing but it also feels like an
iPhone yeah totally I think the biggest
thing that sticks out of me is when you
hear some of our some of our reviewers I
got for the first time they I think
almost everyone that got it for first
time that didn't use a manual they're
gonna there's times where you just start
swiping RAM like how do I do this cuz
there's no whole button yeah and that is
I had that I had that feeling for a
minute I'm like how do you how do we get
home from from inside an app you had to
figure that out
swipe up which is not what I'm used to
at all you know so just feel it feel
weird like the home button is missing I
do miss it at home it's like home it's
like where we all want to be we want to
be home I won't be homey
I'm home right now we're home and people
watching this and listening they always
say dude I love it when you guys are in
the studio together why are you not in
the studio together Apple's trying to
take our home away from us why they took
it away I want to go home man I already
got a song my idea in my head already
we'll see if the lawyers let us do it we
don't legal hey I want to find yes all
right I'm let's just talk about a couple
quick more things just things that have
been happening around the iPhone in case
you didn't know Apple released the
latest iOS updates so iOS 11.1 that is
official has been rolled out it allows
you to get access to the 70 plus new
emojis that we all know that everyone is
hyped up about we also saw watch OS 4.1
probably the most exciting update out of
all of them because now series 3 LTE
watches can do streaming audio over LTE
this includes radio stations like our
parent company CBS News ESPN Bloomberg
and KQED and then you also have access
to streaming radio for free to radio
stations based on genres like the 80s
hip hop pop rock all that classical and
in addition if you have an Apple music
subscription you can stream Apple music
directly from your watch
rights don't you know I I told you my
phone broke down and I've been using my
watch exclusively today and it's looking
like we're told I don't even care about
the fact that I don't have my phone
honestly I just missed it for taking
photos at the event yeah yeah like I
just miss using my phone as a camera so
it feels like a full like replacement
pretty much for you well how about this
staying connected without being a face
connected yeah totally and I love that I
honestly I love that so we have that
going on also obviously Mac OS high
sierra was updated they get access to
the emojis and a few bug updates and
then TV OS for the Apple TV also get
some updates will
you people that are like kind of the
video files to tweak some of the
settings whether they want the dynamic
range on matching framerate on you can
kind of play with that with the Apple TV
so those are kind of all the iOS updates
across the board everything was updated
so you can check that out now but I did
want to say after that update Apple put
out this fun little kind of fun little
blurb and I don't want you to look did
you look at the article yet I don't want
you look I dunno okay what do you think
is the most popular emoji that is use I
didn't I'm sorry but if it makes sense
the guy crying with a kind this is a sad
crying like the laughing out the LOL sad
cry which I do like that one I use that
all the time
it works like my top three are the
crying face the eggplant and the peach
yeah yeah I like the dude with the
sunglasses my fav splat the splash mark
yeah the splash splash yeah there's like
this article I read I think it was like
a vice article or something about like
if you want to get get lay-by if you
want to meet some Millennials and get
laid use these emojis sunglasses one was
there and of course the you know the
peach bootie but yeah that one in the
eggplant eggplant yeah man I thought I
was you know I feel like I was one of
the originals to use the eggplant like
way back when emojis first I was like
this is amazing yeah in fact before I
use the eggplant I didn't even use
emojis you know what I use I use the
number eight and then the equal equal
equal equal equal sign and then a
greater than sign less than sign put it
together y'all this is like we still had
internet when I was doing that yeah just
we're like we're the first gen to create
this whole language with like pagers and
stuff you know Motorola pager
we were we were doing all that like back
in the 90s I think they came up with a
term for like the generation that's
really in our wheelhouse that's beat
it's like a what they call like I'm not
a mid generation or like a floating
generation oh yeah yeah 79 to 80 yeah
we're kind of that we were we
experienced you know tech and we
experienced tech all together but it was
a moment
time anyways if anyone uses my my nan
emoji trick and can benefit from that
I'm all about that I am all about that
also just to kind of before we wrap
things up Apple earnings came out
yesterday this is obviously doesn't
factor in the surge of iPhones because
they were pre-ordered so that would
require them to be put in the books
before that but Apple posted a revenue
of fifty two point six billion dollars a
net quarterly profit of ten point seven
billion dollars which was the revenue
and earnings per share numbers company
records for the fourth fiscal quarter
the total profit fell short of its
figure from 2015 after all is said and
done but what it shows you if it has a
record quarter is the strength of not
only the product line but the iPhone
line is because it's so diverse it's
actually working to Apple's advantage
yeah look at this pie chart man iPhone
is in red
iPhone net sales 55% sales or iPhone and
revenue so we have services that would
be like Apple music and iCloud is 16%
14% is Mac sales 9% is iPad sales and 6%
is other which would be like air pods
Apple TV and Apple watch the other thing
to break down how many units of you know
devices were sold apple sold forty six
point seven million iPhones up from
forty five point five in the year ago
iPad sales were up ten point three
million or sorry we're up to ten point
three million compared to nine point
three million in last year's fourth
quarter of 2016 and Mac sales road from
Rose from four five point four million
to four point nine million I'm sorry I
can't really talk
it's also worth to mention like I just
saw this this news story this morning
but Apple has passed 900 billion market
cap is that the high is that a record I
I don't know if it's a record but I
think it's the highest Apple's ever made
it to it's it's a Bloomberg report that
just came out about 40 passes 900
billion dollars that's incredible
they're almost to a trillion dollars man
they're getting close that is insane
you know 100 bill oh they'll be there
you know they're so they're so
successful that people are actually
making fake Apple stores now and in
China right no no in New York really
check this out that was the video that
you went to listen go in the rundown
I'll talk about it but we have if you
you guys and gals have to subscribe to
the channel Improv Everywhere everywhere
it's hilarious they're from New York
they do these great kind of I guess you
could call them stunts but because the
New York glass cube Apple store is under
renovation
they found a glass cube like subway stop
and turned it into a faux Apple store
where they had people waiting in line
for it people that can't see this they
basically apply an Apple logo to the
store they end up dressing people in
Apple shirts and people come by and say
like oh what what's going on here
they're like oh it's the new Apple Store
they're like what so they bring out fake
employees and then they created this
long line as if you were waiting for an
iPhone 10 a guys yelling we're only
limiting you to two phones per customer
and then people rise up from the subway
elevator out of this cube holding Apple
retail bags as if they bought something
and then the employees clap for them so
awesome how long did this go on for just
like a couple hours and I don't I have
no I'm sure they did it for for a while
they had news media that's faking these
money but people are looking at like huh
I just great just genius stuff you know
what you gotta love people it's pretty
cool all right should we get to our
calls was doing a new way we got a lot
of good call all right you all I mean
make sure there's nothing playing on
this computer and before we get to the
calls you know what I forgot to tease in
the beginning because we were so busy
you guys and gals can call us you're a
part of the show
times they're just too long and yeah not
broad enough for our audience to answer
so we appreciate it though everything
you guys do guys and gals look sometimes
there's bad connections too so that I
almost I burped there while I was
talking don't get your feelings hurt if
you're not on the show how about a syn
Rapids here we go hi this is Johnny D
out of Detroit Rock City yeah I was just
wondering if Apple will ever come out
with a rugged version of their phone
like Samsung and other companies do what
do you guys think about that let me know
that'd be great to hear about it on the
show take it easy guys keep up the great
work I love that man look anything is
possible I don't just because they're so
they're such sticklers on the aesthetic
value I don't get it but it just hit me
I thought about it if they did come out
with a you know like a super ruggedized
phone they would call it the iPhone
extra hard or stream by phone 10 hard
because they don't know how to be clever
with marking or this time around yeah
yeah like we were in line and these two
guys one guy called a 10 and the other
guy called the X and then I got them
like the battle like X 10 X 10 is this
funny it was funny
no that would be great I mean there's a
market for that definitely he's right
Samsung did it
rugged phones like buta mop throw them
around take track whatever there's
plenty of cases like OtterBox make some
crazy ruggedized cases spec make some
crazy recognized cases like there are
options and I think that you're just you
know they're military-grade spec not the
company spec but they're military grade
quality you know for desperate ection
and water protection as well on top of
the fact of what the phone already has
so I think you're just honestly better
just getting a case yeah cuz apples not
gonna change that aesthetic yeah they
probably won't
okay next call hey guys this is Pruitt
from Virginia I was just listening to
last week's episode about iMessage
lock-in it is real but I've been using
Google Hangouts / Google Voice
integration with all of my phones for
several years like Perrineau since
college like five years now and I love
it
I love being able to text on any phone I
can pick up any phone in the world and
make it my phone
just by hanging in my Google Voice
account it's phenomenal I'm locked into
the Google world like Google locking is
real for me it's amazing you know I
encourage everybody get out of the
iMessage work get out of that lock in
you never have any phone you want and
use it
even on the text on the computer you can
make your home phone ringing if people
call your phone your regular cell phone
it's amazing like it's so good but I
will say like I I know what you mean
people get upset on me all the time
because you have an iPhone but you're
not using on that's what are you doing
they get upset it means they hate me
they don't want to talk to me because I
don't have a blue mumble it's really
dumb and I should find out free printer
those people anymore but I will say
Google Voice is the way to go
all right guys love the show I love it
and also the fact that it tells us that
we have a lot of listeners that guess
what you love technology
it's not about Apple versus Google
unless it is yeah yeah hey you know we
love tech here that's funny though that
is this friend hate on him for having
you know because there are people that
there are people that that value that
feel the phone that they have is a
reflection of who they are as a person
and you say I've we've seen it all the
time I say one thing negative about a
phone or I don't even say negative let's
say critical about a phone and people
come out at me they're not happy that I
said their phones not as great as they
it's like they etat they associate their
confidence and their being to the phone
they have I find that one of the most
fascinating it shows how much a part of
our lives our phones are yeah that they
have that power for people to get
emotionally angry at you if you say
something about their phone I just find
that a fascinating thing of how we've
changed yeah it's very hopefully that
that is a trend that will die in the
next few years I based on based on
reading YouTube comments I have not seen
that change anytime soon yeah that's
funny
all right next call hi this is so
depressed Virginia big fan of the show
my question is I used to have the iPhone
5s and I did the pre-order the iPhone 10
do I need to get the Apple Care with it
and still like confused I usually
get it I don't have any usually any
accidents for my corns but the cost of
fixing the screen and the monitor on the
new iPhone is very expensive around 350
I guess I just need your suggestions
thank you so much
so here here's what it comes down to how
much will it cost to do repair with or
without Apple care okay so right we know
it's $1.99 an upfront cost if you damage
your phone's screen okay that's with
Apple care with yeah well you buy Apple
care for $1.99 okay so okay so
Apple care cost $1.99 yeah they will fix
your screen for free for breaks not for
free I think that's like a twenty nine
there's a $29 charge that you have to
pay if you want to get your screen
replaced that's basically your your kind
of upfront pain for the fact that if
anything happened your phone Apple care
was gonna cover it and you pay like a
nominal fee but if you don't have Apple
care on your iPhone 10 and they have to
do a screen replacement that is a $279
charge yeah that's the first so you're
basically saving 51 dollars if you think
your screen is going to ever get damaged
now here's where it comes in even more
specifically let's say you have any
other type of damage a water damage or
some physical abuse damage or it just
poops out and they can't even figure out
and it's outside of the warranty if
other damage is included that's gonna be
a 99 dollar fee on top of the 200 you've
paid okay but if you don't have Apple
care at all and some other kind of
damage happens your phone it's five
hundred and forty nine dollars so the
savings you would get by just getting
Apple care to cover any other damage at
as minimum is two hundred and fifty one
dollars that's crazy so this phone is
expensive it's the highest priced Apple
care we've ever seen but that's you're
saving fifty one dollars if you just get
the screen damaged once I think they
cover it they cover you two times
meaning it'll you pay that like $29 fee
for the screen twice before I think then
you have to pay like a higher fee but if
any other kind of damage happens your
phone
you're saving 251 dollars by getting the
Apple care
I've always purchased AppleCare on all
my phones personally yeah I have 10 it
sucks cuz it costs a lot of money on the
10 yeah I never I think I've had to use
a one time and I forget what it was
about it's like some some weird thing
that I did my phone wasn't in DFU mode
for further right yeah Matthew okay I
forget what it was about that was a long
time the other thing though is I use
Apple care I have used Apple care to my
advantage when something has happened to
one of my devices maybe it was just like
on the border of being out of warranty
I'm like can you look at my history I
buy Apple care on every single product
and then they kind of look at me and I
go I'm Brian Tom I actually never say
that I say I'm Brian Tom from seen that
so I don't say any of that crap but they
say I'm CNET's Brian Tom no I say I'm
Bryant on bitch so I don't do any of
that not that guy and never will be but
that does help you yeah historically me
know a loyal customer helps you that
totally makes sense don't say I just
bought a phone say I buy Apple care and
all my phones you didn't check it like
I've gotten a free pair of headphones
cuz I went in there I'm like dude I've
owned every iPhone I love the headphones
these broke and they'll give you a free
pair of sometimes yeah I got a free pair
of headphones one time it was alright
alright bicho they were being nice
sometimes they're nice go with your damn
self
yeah I like that okay here's another
call we got another one this guy has a
bad apple for us ding dong this is Tom
from Ocracoke Island North Carolina my
story of trying to buy an iPhone 10 is a
big ugly rotten fat bad apple I got up
at 3 in the morning
got my burger in to Apple at about 3:15
all was good
they said they'd email me back after the
contact of the carrier got that email
went to complete the order and they say
no you can't order because you get your
wireless bill at a post office box I'm
like what of course I get it post office
box I live in a place where we don't
have home mail delivery we have to get
it a post office box so they even the
post office even gives me a hokey way to
put a physical address in but AT&amp;amp;T won't
take that because it doesn't show up at
a post op
database so I ended up losing my
reservation had to call AT&amp;amp;T Jack around
Jack Ron and finally they put my
physical shipping address in of course
FedEx and UPS will ever hear no problem
it's just it's a bad apple i love i hate
we got nothing but love for you it's
like bad apple on all parties involved
I'm just gonna throw it out he was like
bad dirty run whatever you want to call
it that's a great call
yeah well and quite the dope voice too
he's got an awesome awesome voice you
might live way out in the way out in the
rural area a lot of texture to his voice
and we appreciate you listening man
thank you so much cool all right
got another call here we go Shamar
Sumati Beach and Aisha Boys Shamar from
Atlanta just wanted to log in a quick
Apple gripe at bat up or whatever you
want to call it about the pre-order
debacle and how I think that they get
preferential treatment two people were
on the iPhone upgrade program versus
anybody that buys it through the carrier
or write that out right because last
year when I did this ever plus I was
gonna go with carrier pricing but I had
some issues with my bills so I had
decided to try the iPhone upgrade
program now when I did the carrier it
was two weeks out from the street day
but then when I did the iPhone upgrade
program lo and behold I got it on the
actual release date that was supposed to
be out so I tried to go through do that
again this year and it kept give me like
an error and then I was trying to I had
the November 3rd date locked down but it
it changed to three weeks out so that
that dis sucked and I really think they
have more for people who are willing to
the iPhone upgrade program than they do
for people to buy it outright and not to
mention the 64 or gig to 128 gig dropped
it I just feel that this they need to
care more about the customer and stop
stop with the profit margins that's all
I got gentlemen have a have a good day
look feeling it feeling ill in it i my
mother I'm there with you bro I'm there
yeah okay we have one more one more call
one more one and he's feeling icky Oh
again icky with it
hey Brian tongue yeah bite nation I'm
just calling her I just saw your video
for the aftermath of the iPhone X
pre-order and I heard your feel about
feeling icky about spending so much
money on a phone and I saw exactly the
same way after I saw how much I was
actually spending on the phone I really
did question whether to keep my iphone
eggs or stay with my iPhone 7 but my
iPhone 7 plus if it was just too much
after seeing how much was tagged seeing
how much it was with Apple care with
Apple care I was like I can't believe
I'm spending this much money on the
phone and most definitely did have me
questioned whether I should even keep it
or just stay with my phone that I have
currently so I just wanted to say learn
alone
most definitely felt the exact same way
all right Thank You Man yeah I mean
whether whether people agree with me or
not I don't I'm not concerned about that
I think that everyone's opinions are
valid I just find it interesting when
people got really mad at me
expressed an opinion that they made
that's always I've started to see this
trend where sometimes people completely
hear one thing they zone out they get
mad they immediately go to their
keyboard and then their ups they're like
fixated on that single thing you know
instead of like there's more to this
there's more nuance it's these things
opinions and feelings are not just black
and white there's everything is gray to
me right
every well there's some things that are
just wrong you're talking about a phone
come on it's it's I felt that way after
about the 6s it was like 7 Hyundai Mikey
after that I'm like damn I'm gonna hang
on again I'm gonna enjoy the iPhone 10 I
know I am but I just don't I think I
mean I you you're forced to get used to
it like we talked to a Scott but the no
non-existence of the home button and the
fact that the interface is really
completely different than the iPads and
iOS 11 and that's okay because they're
different devices but man no home button
it's gonna I think it's gonna it's gonna
hit
people a little bit like to this kind of
bugs me yeah yeah I read I saw an
article that the headline was uh this
isn't your parents phone this is your
grandkids that's a great that's a great
point that's a great that's and like I
said to God I'm like I don't think this
is for everyone and he's like yeah it's
not for everybody
yeah definitely so there's how that's
how we do it everyone we'd love to hear
your iPhone 10 stories by the time we
come back together for the next show
there will be many listeners that will
have it in their hands all you gotta do
