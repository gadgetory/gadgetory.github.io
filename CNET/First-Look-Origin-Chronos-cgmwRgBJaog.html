today we're going to take a look at the
origin Kronos so this is an editor's
choice winning small form-factor gaming
PC our config here costs about 1199 so
it comes with an overclocked core i5 CPU
as well as a fast mid-range geforce gtx
560ti graphics card from nvidia so
overall I really like this PC for a few
reasons it's fast it's small it's
relatively affordable and it also has
some nice expandability which you don't
necessarily expect in such a small
system so if we go over the features in
the front of the case you can see
there's a blu-ray burner here so let's
USB 3 ports and a couple of analog audio
jacks on the front now in the back of
the case you've got a nice selection of
ports on the graphics card over here
you've got to DVI Ott's as well as a
mini HDMI output over here you have some
used to be two point O Jack's you've got
a couple ports for wireless antenna USB
3.0 7.1 analog audio as well as digital
optical output now you might see a few
video outputs here but those actually
don't work because they're connected to
the embedded graphics chip which is
overwritten by the graphics card so
going inside the case you'll see origin
is not a nice job of keeping the system
tidy so back here there's a core i5 CPU
it actually has a liquid cooler on it
which is pretty impressive given the
size of the case you can see the memory
slots here they're both occupied and
here's the hard drive bay it can
actually take a couple of solid state
drives if you go for that option this
config though has a 750 gig mechanical
hard drive and it takes up all the hard
drive expansion space so swim around on
the other side you can see here's the
graphics card it's a double slot model
and picks up all the card expansion
slots what's particularly cool about
this is that origin is throwing a 600
watt power supply in the system that
means that not only can this PC take
nice large dual slot cards but can also
go up to very high end cars if you want
to upgrade down the road it was a point
of comparison we wanted to show the
origin next to the alienware x51 so this
system has gotten some press lately
alienware just released it back in
January it's a nice design and it also
has a full-size graphics card inside it
which is pretty rare for a slim tower
case limitation for the alienware those
it doesn't have quite as many upgrade
options as the origin does alienware
won't overclock and because it was a
small power supply it actually has
relatively limited upgrade options the
fact that alienware got a full size card
in here at all is pretty impressive but
as limited power supply means that the
system is
only going to be so fast you look at the
performance comparison between the two
this origin outperforms alienware on
every performance test for gaming or
applications when you look at the
performance charts you'll see the origin
outperforms the alienware on every test
from gaming to applications by a healthy
margin if we're going to spend upwards
of a thousand bucks on a gaming PC the
origin is the clear choice here so it's
compact it's upgradeable it's also one
of the fastest pcs in its price range so
I'm rich brown this is the editors
choice winning origin Chronos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
