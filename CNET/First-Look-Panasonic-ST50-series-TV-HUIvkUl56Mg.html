I'm standing next to the panasonic tc-p
55 st50 this is a 55 inch plasma TV this
review will also apply to the 50 the 60
and the 65 inch member of the series it
doesn't come in any sizes smaller than
that this is Panasonic's mid-range
plasma TV daz3d it also has the
company's high-end neo PDP plasma
technology for all that picture quality
goodness we'll get to that and a little
bit but first like to talk a little bit
about one of the big improvements this
year over the st 30 which was our pick
last year for best bang for the buck
monk plasma TVs that's the styling this
TV has pretty slick styling for a
panasonic plasma actually looks almost
as good as some of the samsung plasmas
out there and that is a compliment
around the edge of the screen it's a
pretty thin bezel there's also this sort
of acrylic border the bottom edge is a
little bit thicker and there's a little
bit of indent there to give a little bit
of an accent the TV is also thinner than
it was last year the stand however does
not swivel the set includes of Viera
casts smart TV functionality which has
all the usual apps Netflix Amazon video
on demand voodoo there's also a couple
of audio apps including Pandora there's
a few additional apps pana Sara did
include the social TV app this year
which places Twitter or Facebook right
next to the TV screen so you can
simultaneously watch TV and tweet if
that's your thing this TV does not have
the higher-end touchpad remote however
panasonic reserves that for the more
expensive VT and WT Series this year the
st50 does get built in Wi-Fi however so
we figure that's a big convenience bonus
of course a lot of 20th 12 TVs do also
include that feature compared to the
competition the st50 has fewer picture
controls than seen on a lot of the other
higher-end TVs it doesn't have the
10-point grayscale it gets by with the 2
point there's also a fewer settings for
color management but on the flipside we
found that the presets were pretty darn
good this year for the custom mode and
that's a big improvement compared to
last year let's talk a little bit about
pitch quality now which is the real
reason why we like the st50 this set has
extremely deep black levels for a plasma
in fact it's even deeper than last
year's flagship TV the VT 30 by just a
little bit that deep black as usual adds
to a lot of punch a lot of perceived
contrast a great looking picture overall
under all different lighting conditions
speaking of lighting conditions
Panasonic did improve the
filter on this TV this year it actually
rejects ambient light even better than
before which means that those blasts can
say is deeper even in brighter lighting
situations which is again among the best
we've seen on any plasma TV set also has
pretty accurate color once you play
around with the settings in the custom
mode so all told we really like the
picture quality this TV did we mention
it's also 3d Panasonic does not include
3d glasses the cleric 3d glasses are new
for this year they're about 70 bucks
apiece they use Bluetooth functionality
the 3d picture quality wasn't quite as
good as we expected we did see more
crosstalk than a lot of competition but
that's not really a deal breaker in this
TV does still produce pretty good 3d
images around back the st50 is a little
bit sparse however instead of the normal
for HDMI there's only three there are
two USB and a rare SD card slot however
in addition to one analog input of
course the real kicker on the st50 is
its bang for the buck this TV does
produce a very good picture for the
price and I think would be hard-pressed
to see other TVs this year that can
match its value proposition and that's a
quick look at the panasonic tc-p st50
series i'm david katz meijer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
