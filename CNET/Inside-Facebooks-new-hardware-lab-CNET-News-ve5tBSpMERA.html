research and development for all of our
hardware we've been doing hardware for a
long time primarily on the proton the
testing and validation side and now
we're able to prototype parts as well so
instead of having them made by other
companies we can make our own parts
in-house first pieces of equipment I
want to talk about is actually our water
jet
it's high-pressure water and that water
will cut through pretty much anything
this is our surround 360 our 3d 360
camera I just wanted to show you this
because this actual outside shroud this
is something that we could prototype on
our water jet this machine is our one of
our three axis milling machines it's the
biggest one that we that we currently
have this is kind of like the workhorse
of the shop it's very versatile it's
very easy to use so an example of that
would be the propeller from the Aquila
so we won't be making the propeller but
we will be making the tools to support
the prototyping build so this machine
will take a piece of sheet metal and
actually fold it up to the specified
angle and it's capable of prototyping a
lot of very interesting sheetmetal
components some of those components
would be in our server rack
so this is our five axis milling machine
and this is my favorite machine it's a
very powerful machine that can do very
complex prototypes very quickly and
accurately
took about nine months to build the
space the new area it's 22,000 square
feet we'll have about 8 to 10 dedicated
staff here in the lab that there's room
here for about 80 other engineers will
be working on specific projects so I
guess the two things that we look for is
innovation with hardware if we don't
feel like the industry is moving in the
right direction making our own hardware
allows us to do our own innovation and
it also generally provides a lower-cost
product for us at the end of the day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
