solar efficiency and they use this
equation that they got the calculated
efficiency of solar panels and so the
most efficient solar panel in the world
has an efficiency rate of forty four
point seven percent so for Superman they
figured something out if he's gonna fly
around 48 hours he is going to spend six
but not two hundred and seven billion
joules this is crash course in science
atop of this yeah his energy output he'd
have to be six thousand times more
efficient than the most powerful panel
we have on earth that would be good I
could bomb I have no problem believing
that now my question for you is soo it
is super super it has to like recharge
okay so here's to do a Superman like
when they killed him yeah that was kind
of a joke that all you had to do is kind
of put him in the sunlight and he kind
of be okay Superman is just a plant he's
basically he's just a seedling based on
who just needs a little bit of he's got
photosynthesis well kinda actually think
about it he's actually using the Sun
much more efficiently than we are
although they're saying this would be
impossible the students had a great
thing that looked because this because
the solar efficiency is so ridiculous
yeah they're like there must be other
ways he's being powered but Superman's
oh oh I hate him alright what but he's
apparently green so well he's angry he's
barely super environmentally conscious
like no they made him blue once he's
never warriors electric Superman blue I
mean like you know environmentally green
girlfriend Leah he's he gets a green
badge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
