we're going to take a look at the Apple
TV this is the third generation of Apple
streaming video box which originally
came out in March but apple recently
added some new features so we're taking
another look at it this is still the
best-looking streaming video box you can
buy it's small it blends in with your
home theater and the power supply is
built into the box so there's no
annoying AC adapter or power brick
there's no display on the box other than
a tiny white light on the front that
lets you know it's on around the back
there's an HDMI port and optical audio
output and Ethernet port and a micro USB
port although the USB port is only used
for service and support it also has
built-in Wi-Fi for connecting to your
wireless home network the user
interfaces icon driven and it kind of
makes your TV look like a giant iPad if
you're looking at iTunes for movies or
TV shows there's a menu bar across the
top letting you quickly access useful
categories like purchase content and
search with purchase content your movies
and TV shows are saved in the cloud for
rewatching and you can also download
them later to an ipad or iphone for
third party apps are a handful of
services including netflix MLB TV
youtube and the recently added Hulu Plus
at however that's not quite as many
services as you'll find on Roku's boxes
which feature HBO GO amazon instant and
pandora now while the Apple TV doesn't
have as many content sources it does
have another killer feature if you own
other apple products that's airplay let
you take almost any photo music or video
you have on an iOS device and stream it
right to your TV so if you're listening
to pandora on your phone you can then
play it on your Apple TV even though the
Apple TV doesn't have a native pandora
app Apple also recently announced
airplay mirroring for its latest
mountain lion operating system which
means you can stream whatever is on the
screen of your computer directly to the
apple TV wirelessly now airplay
mirroring only works but relatively
recent max that support the feature but
it's the easiest way to get any web
video on your TV including flash video
and even free hulu videos so overall if
you're already
in the apple ecosystem the apple TV is a
must-have gadget for one hundred dollars
and with the recent feature updates the
Apple TV now gets our editors choice
award for streaming video boxes but if
you're not invested in apples ecosystem
it's still worth considering our other
editors choice in the category the roku
LT which is half the price and offers
more content sources I'm Matthew
miskovic and this is the Apple TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
