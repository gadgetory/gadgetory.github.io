you with and it's called them 89 and
here it is it's a junkie beast with a
5.9 inch full HD screen but it feels
fairly comfortable to hold which is
helped by its all-metal body like the
huawei p9 there are two cameras on the
back of the phone one which shoots
photos in color and one which is
designed only to shoot in black and
white I actually really like this
feature on the p 9 it takes great black
and white shot so if you're into your RT
photos it's definitely a phone to
consider inside the phone is an
octa-core kieran 960 processor which
should help the Android new girl
software run fairly smoothly now always
says that that has been helped along by
a host of software improvements we'll
see how that works when we get it in for
the full review at the specs are phone
includes 64 gigabytes of on-board
storage which you can expand with
microSD cards it's also 4 gigabytes of
ram and a 4000 milliamp an hour battery
which would easily keep the phone
ticking over for the best part of a day
there's no word yet on pricing but we
should get that information over the
coming weeks as the mate 9 is due to go
on sale before the end of the year I'm
Andrew Horrell cnet and this is the
huawei mate 9</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
