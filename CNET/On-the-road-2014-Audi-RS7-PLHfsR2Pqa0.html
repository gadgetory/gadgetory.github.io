the US and it's raining on the track
let's go into 2014 Audi rs7 check the
tech now the rf7 slots at the top of the
stack above the base a7 above the a7 TDI
even above the s7 which was the previous
hot rod king of the hill for this car
spot one of these pretty readily
different bumpers front and rear very
noticeable and they add two inches to
the cars overall length it's also got a
different very aggressive face and
grille big ol Quattro badge here in the
front outback look for a different
diffuser and very big body exhausting
inside some pretty hot looking quilted
sports seats and I don't believe any
other 7 gets that inside and rf7 doesn't
have really anything that another a7
couldn't have it just is a great place
to put all of it first of all you got
the pop-up screen here which is
controlled by their MMI control panel
that also has a fingerprint writing or a
touch panel for radio presets we've seen
this before like it a lot and then a lot
of things within this system are
connected for example your maps are
through Google Earth a 25 mile radius
that it scoops up for photorealism when
you're looking for an address you can
use Google online search to find that
and under the information menu you've
got what they call these Audi connect
services they still divvy up radio and
media in the two buckets which i think
is old-school at this point optical disk
remains in this vehicle you've got some
hard drive space to rip to they do a
nice job laying out meta tags and giving
you a very clear way to navigate
whatever you're listening to goes out
through a base 14 speaker 630 watt Bose
surround sound audio rig you can also
option up for nearly six grand bangin
Olufsen sound which we have noted by the
pop up tweeters now this car has
built-in Internet connectivity through a
SIM card right here to a 3G data network
not 4G and there analyze the rub things
do tend to move a little slowly if it's
rich data getting those Google Earth
maps loaded it's a little slow
retrieving requested information and
they claim you can use the built in
in-car Wi-Fi hotspot to power up to
eight devices good luck with that 3G
barely powers one device
luckily outtie has just announced
built-in 4G in their cars but starting
in the entry-level a3 after an initial
six months you'll pay about 17 bucks a
month for a gigabyte of data just for
the car now the optional tech on this
car includes a head-up display which is
pretty good it's getting in the category
of BMWs are not good as BMW M cars
you've also got a button over here that
turns on a night vision display between
the gauges it calls out things by heat
signature and lets you see especially on
dark roads if pedestrians or animals are
kind of moving around the periphery also
optional is the driver assistance
package which would include lane
departure with a really pronounced stick
shaker on the wheel if you drift about
the brightest most obnoxious blind spot
warning lights in the mirrors I really
appreciate them because you actually
notice them an adaptive cruise control
that goes all the way down to a full
stop and then go again when traffic
continues to move it's a very advanced
ACC we also have not only a back up
camera with many different points of
view depending on your parking situation
but then when you put the car and go you
also have a front camera with some
trajectory lines now up front this
engine just fascinates me 4 litre v8
twin turbo it's extremely compact check
out this architecture here what's novel
about it is in the valley and the inside
of the heads here you've got the turbos
on the exhaust apparatus the intakes are
on the outside of the heads 560
horsepower 516 foot-pounds of torque car
weighs about 4,500 pounds 0 to 60 and
3.7 seconds while delivering 16 27 mpg
which is quite respectable and way
outside of gas guzzler territory one
choice on the drive line its Quattro of
course all-wheel drive and an 8-speed
automatic I know you're cringing right
now and saying wait a minute what about
that dual clutch out of the s7 I think
this might actually play out better as
we're gonna find out in a moment now
another question people have is wait a
minute how do they get a hundred and 40
more horsepower out of this via
then it has in the s7 primarily boost
these turbos go up to 17 and a half psi
max in the s7 they're limited to twelve
point three psi that and all the
strengthening and tuning that goes
around that it does wonders I'm not
pulling up to disengage the stability
control but Quattro has such a good one
it's not that intrusive the power coming
out of this engine is glorious because
there's not just a lot up but it comes
on right away that's the beauty of doing
a big engine with turbos when you first
crack the throttle you've got plenty of
this place but to get things going back
while the turbos are getting spoiled up
and then they push it all the way
through like a freight train
torque vectoring on the rear and the
intelligence of this system makes a damn
fool like me get out of this looking
good and in one piece now my same love
letter goes to the transmission I know a
bunch of you probably we're thinking oh
great that's got an automatic why not
the DSG dual-clutch out of the f7
because this one's better it's better in
all-around everyday driving it's silky
smooth then when you get out here the
shifts are plenty quick maybe not quite
a trip
but they're plenty fast now the Quattro
system on this guy kind of face lines at
forty sixty forty percent of the front
sixty to the rear but it can go as high
as 70 front or 85% power to the rear and
it's got the torque vectoring applied to
the rear wheels as well so it'll kind of
claw its way out of a corner and turn
you the right way off the track you also
have a really tractable comfortable
commuter car that remains responsive it
doesn't turn into some slug or sloth
it's still taut but friendly note that
if you want the really serious sports
suspension in this not available in the
US RS 7 yet that I know of that's an
adaptive fully mechanical suspension the
base suspension that comes in this guy
which is still very adapted and smart is
air based now the rs7 is of course a
specialty model with a very special
price spent a hundred and six thousand
dollars base you're paying nearly twenty
five thousand dollars more than for an
s7 to pick up 140 horsepower to lose
about 0.8 seconds zero to sixty and to
add a gear the 8-speed automatic versus
the seven DSG what you're really getting
when you buy one of these is a bunch of
bragging rights as well now to get this
seen that style you got to add twenty
eight hundred bucks for the innovation
packet it's gonna bring us the night
vision and the head-up display I like
both another twenty eight hundred is
required then to get the driver
assistance package adaptive cruise the
lane and blind spot and pre collision
and stop and go there's a Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen
sound system for nearly six grand I have
never heard $6,000 in them that I've
listened to including this one so I'm
gonna pass and about 180 bucks a year to
get those outta connect services to work
all then we're looking at a bit over a
hundred and eleven thousand dollars but
for what may be the perfect car if you
have the money very spacious and
utilitarian not a lot of comfortable
room inside for folks space in the back
for stuff it's brutally fast extremely
capable and if you do get it on the
track it's gonna make you look good now
I wouldn't know anything this expensive
or complicated one day
a warranty but until then you've got
four years during which that grins gonna
actually start to hurt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
