have on people's lives but it's
disappointing that only less than ten
percent of the population have access to
smartphones we want to change that so
we've been working hard with our
ecosystem for on a very important
initiative which we call Android one so
let me talk to you about Android one
what we are doing for the first time if
you look at all the OEMs in these
countries each of them has to reinvent
the wheel and in a fast-paced mobile
industry they have to build a new
smartphone within nine months so we want
to pool resources and help everyone so
we are working on a set of hardware
reference platforms we identify the
components which go into a
next-generation smartphone these are
high-quality affordable smartphones we
qualify vendors so that we provide a
turnkey solution for OEMs to more easily
build a smartphone in addition to
hardware we are working on software as
well so the software on Android one is
the same software you see running on
stock android nexus phones and Google
Play edition phones in addition through
Play we allow om's and carriers to add
locally relevant applications on the
device which uses a full control over
and finally we provide full automatic
updates all the software and Android one
comes from google so we will keep them
updated just like we do with Nexus and
Google Play edition phones let's take a
look at one example device which we are
working on so this is a device with
micromax you can see there's a 4.5 inch
screen it has features which matters to
a country like India dual sim removable
SD cards and FM radio I'm used to
cutting edge phones and I've been using
this phone for a while and it is really
good and it costs less than hundred
dollars we are working with many
partners we're going to be launching
this around the world but we start this
year
in India and we are launching this with
three OEMs in India in the fall of this
year micromax karbonn and spice we are
also working with we are working with
carriers in these markets to provide
affordable connectivity packages with
these devices what we are excited is
this is a leverage turnkey solution so
that at scale we can bring high-quality
affordable smartphones so that we can
get the next billion people access to
these devices and we can't wait to see
the impact that you do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
