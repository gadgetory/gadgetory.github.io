I've had a chance to walk it yet but
it's always great last year I was on a
show of America's greatest makers we saw
that one yeah it was a lot of what you
think about just that whole experience
experience is great because it gave me
an opportunity to really you know dive
into how these things are made not just
they come out you know and I always call
gadgets it's a lazy man this is the lazy
man's convention this is where the
remote control was built you know what I
mean like who needs a remote you
couldn't walk over and just press the
button the lazy man convention it just
makes life easier for you well I do have
something here that makes life easier
for me or you okay you have you've seen
these before you know what these are
well these are the I will make you smell
these I'm so the marketer Fugees are
like the Nike self-lacing shoes I mean
back in your day right you're balling
what is your take when you see something
like this well I would say anyone over
eleven should have an explanation unless
the color matches your scheme of your
outfit like yours does that do it yeah

don't want to lace them just a lazy man
convention it is absolutely and then
just so placing this oh so you want to
see this I know you are right check this

senses my heel and then watch this right
