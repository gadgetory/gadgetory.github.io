yours have what's called a wet sump
something the old german dutch word for
a muddy wet bog or marsh which is
actually a pretty good analogy for what
happens down here at the bottom of your
engine is what's known as the oil pan or
the crankcase also known as the sump
the heart of the lubrication system is
the oil pumped the two revolving gears
create a subject as the teeth move apart
this suction draws oil from the storage
reservoir or oil bath when this is a wet
sump that means basically all your oil
lives down here except when it's being
pumped out circulate it around the
engine through little passages where it
gets all the things that need
lubrication lubricated and then it drips
back down here to do the cycle over
again the problems with that design are
actually many first of all look at this
pan down here or on this v8 to my right
they're both big and tall that means the
engine has to sit higher in the car to
not scrape the ground or bump in the
suspension that means a higher center of
gravity a higher hood knows what have
you the auto makers don't like that
secondly the oil keeps coming back to
this same hot place so it's hard to cool
the oil third because this can only be a
given size to fit in the engine bay you
can only have so much oil any terms
would like to have more oil pressure oil
and cooler void and fourth you get oil
starvation in a design like this the oil
is just kind of down there by luck and
by gravity in hard cornering sometimes
it moves to one side and the pickup
where the oil is sucked up goes dry once
in a while when that happens the
bearings goes wrong not
high-performance in a dry sump seeks to
cure all that if the first
high-performance sports car with dry
sump lubrication for a lower center of
gravity a dry sump engine still has a
pan at the bottom of the engine but it's
much smaller it catches oil and it's
immediately then pumped out to a
reservoir somewhere else on the car
where typically another pump then moves
it back to the engine it's all very
controlled and done under positive
pressure you end up getting a lower
engine and lower center of gravity
because you don't have a great big pan
to protect down at the bottom you have
no oil starvation and hard cornering
because everything is done under
positive pressure and you end up likely
with cooler oil because it gets a
vacation from being in the engine all
the time and you can have a lot more of
it because the oil reservoir can be as
big as you have room to fit the downside
of a dry sump design is basically cost
and complexity you've got a pump or two
that are external to the engine you've
got some very critical plumbing and
you've got that reservoir to hold all
that oil has to go somewhere else in the
car so they're only justified in high
performance situations today but if you
look at a high performance car look at
our reviews of them you're going to
increasingly see the dry sump design
making its way into vehicles that are
not just trapped cars that are high
performance Road cars more car tech
