coming I'm Richard Carey and this is
your cnet update facebook will change
the look of the mean newsfeed the social
network is having an event on thursday
March 7th to show up some sort of new
layout you might also hear about a
change to your profile because users in
New Zealand have seen their profiles
change and Facebook always seems to test
these things first in New Zealand I
don't have any new zealand friends but
the tech blog the next web has a writer
over there who shared this screenshot it
shows new timeline headers and some
column switch ups but there's something
more when a link to a story is posted
now Facebook is throwing in a button for
you to like the page the link came from
so if i post a link to a cnet story
it'll say hey you should like the cnet
page pushy pushy Facebook we'll find out
in a few days if these changes are
coming everywhere and Facebook isn't the
only one Donnie new spring designs
google is testing a new element on its
main search page a little grid icon that
will link to gmail google maps youtube
and other products instead of using the
black navigation bar on top which has
been around since 2011 in other news
Groupons founder and CEO Andrew Mason
has been fired because well the company
has not been performing well financially
the stock has dropped greatly since a
peak in 2011 and as the captain he takes
responsibility for the ship but be sure
to read his farewell memo to his staff
there's this geeky wit and charm about
it for example he makes a battletoads
reference and if you kids never played
battletoads take it from me it was a
crazy hard game you know maybe groupon
with some more deals if they made more
battletoads references well in the
meantime Groupon gets a two-for-one CEO
dl to replace Mason the executive
chairman and the vice chairman will be
in turn co-ceos until a replacement is
named the Amazon Prime video library
continues to grow with a new deal to
show Food Network and Travel Channel
shows so subscribers yeah now can get
your fill of Guy Fieri
and we got a few apps to end the show
adobe has finally released a photoshop
touch app for smartphones and it's got
all the features of the tablet version
so if you gotta do a little touch-up on
that photo before you Instagram now you
can it costs five dollars and is
available for iOS and Android but no
support for Windows Phone yeah Windows
Phone users still have to put up with
being behind on apps the Twitter app for
Windows Phone just got an upgrade and
it's going to give it the navigation
features everyone else had for a while
now but it still doesn't have tools for
editing photos or managing lists that's
your tech news update for more details
on these stories you can find them at
the blog cnet com / update from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
