and welcome to Rogue Warrior where we
take a look at the hottest gadgets for
life on the go should you go crazy for
the motorola krzr gaga for the giga bv
or mad for the mazda mx5 will tell you
right after we take a look at the archos
504 comes in forty sixty or a hundred
gigabytes of storage James Kim gives you
the tour on the right side here you have
the tactile controllers these are very
easy to use especially once you figure
out the sophisticated menu system I'm
going to take this battery pack off this
is a removable battery like the 604
takes the entire back and you can
actually see the 2.5 inch hard drive in
there the bottom here you have the
proprietary dock connector which you can
buy this optional dock that like we've
seen with the other devices and it fits
in there like this and you can actually
record line in video or audio with this
James says it's a little bit bulky I can
see that but it gives you 5.5 hours of
video playback on a single charge
however the toshiba gigabyte vee gives
you eight hours of video playback on a
single charge still James thinks it's
missing something notably this is
missing FM radio but it does play photos
music including WMA and then of course
video.wmv V being the only video formats
supported the controller buttons are
separated up top here I kind of like
that in some ways for music playback for
example but otherwise you have to sort
of get up there and get back down that
James never satisfied next up the
motorola krzr krzr k1m ken german says
it's really very similar to the motorola
razr overall though it is very slim as
you can see kind of continuing that slim
design it is actually a little thicker
than the razor it's also a little
heavier so it makes for a little more
solid feel actually glass is used on the
front of this phones kind of unusual
motorola says will stand up to cracking
or scratches I haven't had a chance to
try that theory does attract a lot of
fingerprints since it is reflective but
it does make for a very sleek look and
that's the rub on the krzr it does look
better than the razor but not that many
new features
let's finish up with a car from the 2006
paris auto show brian cooley shows off
the Mazda mx-5 miata with a retractable
hardtop it takes just twelve seconds for
this new power hardtop to retract behind
the seats not into the trunk which is
more than I can say for the saturn sky
and pontiac solstice so on the mazda
miata retractable you actually have a
trunk left when the top is down and it
looks just plain good with the top up
which we could never quite bring
ourselves to say about any previous
Miata you can find complete coverage of
the 2006 paris auto show at car cnet com
that's it for this edition of road
warrior I'm Tom Merritt check back next
time for more gadgets to keep you armed
