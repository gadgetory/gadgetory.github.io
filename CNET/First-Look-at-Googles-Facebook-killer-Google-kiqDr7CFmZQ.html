Google Plus Google's Facebook killer
well not really but Google+ is the
search giant's latest major social
networking play and it's the first
product that may eventually just give
other social networks including Facebook
and Twitter a run for the money google
has clearly learned a lot from the
problems that affected earlier
experiments like orchid google buzz and
Google Wave the key social concept of
Google+ is the circle you can create
circles for the different parts of your
life your work your family your friends
your hobbies and it's easy to drag
people into circles and then to create
updates that just go to particular
circles or to all of them at once and
then to keep you from getting
overwhelmed by all your contact social
updates you can watch just what's
happening in particular circles by using
streams so if you're in the mood to see
what's going on with your family you
just check out your family stream the
ease with which you can shift in and out
of circles send updates to one or some
or all of them is Google pluses big
differentiator from both Facebook and
Twitter now Facebook in particular also
lets you send updates to particular
groups but in plus the whole setup is
around carefully directing updates to
particular groups it doesn't feel like
an afterthought like it does in facebook
google+ also has a very strong video
conferencing feature called hangout you
can create a video room and then invite
your friends from some or all of your
circles plus displays everyone's webcam
image at the bottom of the window and
automatically shows a bigger video of
whomever is talking it's a seamless and
very powerful video experience we tried
it here and we were up and running and
having a natural conversation in moments
Plus also makes it really easy to share
photos it connects to picasa web albums
for instant sharing or you can easily
drag pictures from your computer into
your stream to share with your circles
and if your mobile there's a good mobile
web version of plus it has some features
that you don't get in the big web
version like location-based check-in and
the ability to see stream updates from
the friends that are closest to you but
it can't access the video hangout
features android
users also get a nap and iPhone users
will get the app later all is not
perfect in plus land though adding
people to your circles can be
time-consuming and a little confusing
especially if you're used to the more
monolithic social systems of Facebook or
Twitter it's not clear for example if
you add someone to a circle if you're
also added to one of theirs also
integration with other Google services
is so far incomplete for example if you
have a lot of contacts in say google
voice you might see all of those people
in google+ but not the categories or the
circles that you filed them under and if
you send a direct message to a user from
plus through the email feature and they
email you back it shows up in your gmail
viewer not in + + is big on privacy and
data ownership though which is a big
plus the whole idea of segregating your
updates into circles makes it much
easier in theory to control who sees
what of the things you post Google is
also pushing pluses take out feature
that lets you export all the information
on plus to your own computer for use
however you want facebook finally has
this too but I was a very long time
coming if you want to get into + hit up
your friends there's big demand from
people to try the service and people who
are in it have been sending out a lot of
invitations Google is only letting those
invitations go out in small batches for
the time being but they should start
flowing again soon it is unlikely the
Google+ will unseat Facebook as the
number one social network but it is a
worthy additional social service if
you're not already overwhelmed by having
to manage your connections in facebook
and twitter or linkedin and elsewhere
it's really worth a try when you can get
