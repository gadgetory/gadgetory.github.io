from 2048 I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update remember the so bad
it's addictive game of flappy bird well
the apps creator says someday he'll
release a new version of the game but I
think the world has already moved on to
the next game sensation it's 2048 a
simple but addictive puzzle game where
you slide squares to match a combined
similar numbers to earn points it's sort
of like the game threes once you get how
it works you can say goodbye to
productivity it was created by a 19 year
old Italian programmer and just a few
days after he launched the game on the
web he said thousands of people were
playing it at once and if you add up all
the time people spend playing this game
it's about five hundred and twenty years
there are several parody versions around
including one featuring the Doge meme
it's doge 2048 and I find it more
entertaining than the original much
matching such ego-boosting but if you're
looking for a game to play that has more
substance then check out a game called
papers please it won the top honor at
the independent games festival it's not
your typical game storyline you play an
immigration officer in a fictional
dystopian country asking for documents
and you have to allow or deny immigrants
by using your detective skills you can
find it on steam for ten dollars
available for mac or windows google took
its email security to the next step by
requiring all gmail accounts to be
encrypted chances are if you use gmail
you were already using a secured
connection with https most users are
it's the default but until today you did
have the option to turn off encryption
not anymore using HTTPS makes it harder
for outsiders to spy on messages and
that's a big deal in a time where the
world is wary of government surveillance
Samsung keeps making uber huge
televisions for the uber-rich Samsung
has named its price for its massive 110
inch 4k ultra high-def TV it'll cost 150
thousand dollars this model was first
shown off in January at the Consumer
Electronics Show but we now know how
much it costs and if that's been high
for you there's always the 85 inch TV
for 40 grand it's the exact same TV you
just get 25 fewer inches to brag about
and looking ahead HTC will officially
show off its next flagship phone on
Tuesday in New York there has been
plenty of buzz surrounding the sequel to
the HTC One because so many photos have
been leaked out of this new model and it
has to back cameras but you can follow
