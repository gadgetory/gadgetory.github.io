Samsung wireless this is basically a
purple hard drive but it has also a
built in battery and an embedded Wi-Fi
network the idea is that you plug the
computer put a ton of content on it and
then when you are traveling and it uses
as a wireless mobile streaming server
for your smartphone or tablet now this
is not new there are many other devices
of the same type like this pile I have
right here
but the Samsung meant is to be quite
unique for a three reason number one the
rest of this crowd here always tried to
have an mobile app for as many mobile
platform as possible
the Samsung here support only Android
now technically you can actually access
it using the web interface from anywhere
but when I do that on my iPhone here oh
I see it's a Samsung icon so basically
with this wireless Drive Sam someone to
send a clear message to Apple talk to
the hand
because the face it ain't listening it's
seen there's no love lost between these
two companies now the second reason is
this extra USB port right here that's
right this one can also work as a juice
pack so basically it can work at three
roles number one as the purple drive
when you plug it into a computer using
this included USB cable right here or
you can unplug it and turn it on like
right now and use it as a wireless
mobile drive or turn it off and now is a
juice pack now it can only do one roll
at a time but still this is a very neat
design and lastly the main reason why
this one's unique is because of all the
device here I'm review and I haven't
done a lot of them this has the best
support for five formats when it comes
to video and videos are the main reason
why you want to buy an accessory like
this because they take up a lot of space
in my testing I could use the mobile app
to stream video of all the formats I
have including the popular matress car
or MKV
now other than that the Samsung networks
very similar to the rest of the crown it
mobile apps is very organized and
responsive it organized all the content
into three categories
music photo and video you can also
browse the folder on the drive or should
for whatever you want you can also use
the app to make the drive here connect
to another Wi-Fi network and relay that
that works internet with the device
connected to its Wi-Fi network and apart
from trimming content store on the drive
you can also use the drive here as the
backup destination for your mobile
device and talking about mobile devices
this one here support up to five Wi-Fi
clients at a time now in my testing in
the Samsung work really well as a purple
drive it offer the sustain will will
copy speed of more than one hundred and
megabyte per second basically you can
fill up is 1.5 terabyte of storage space
in less than four hours as a wireless
drive it has some seven hours of battery
life and an effective Wi-Fi range of
more than seventy-five feet which is
really good for a device of this size
and as a juice pack this one here pack
enough juice to give any smartphone more
than one full charge now you know if you
are Android user this one here is
totally worth $180 price in the US or
180 euros in Europe now if I'm on the
drive here check out my full review at
cnn.com basically it's a great Drive so
great that you wish you could also
stream video from it using your iPad not
me though because when it come to
watching fun videos and to pick up the
iPad turn on the front facing camera and
start talking how you use such a funny
good-looking man there we go and that's
because I'm don't know and this has been
the first look at the Samsung wireless
oh yes very good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
