phones Sony has launched in a while
gone is the blocky design of phones like
the Xperia Z at five replaced instead
with this edge to edge display although
this is a mid-price phone the almost
total lack of bezel
gives it the look of a much more premium
handset it also means that although it's
packin a 5-inch display there's no
wasted space around it making it very
comfortable to use in one hand and it's
skinny enough to easily slide into your
jeans that's where my positivity for
this phone starts to dwindle though that
display might be packed in tight but the
quality of the screen itself isn't great
it's low resolution colors don't impress
and it's none too bright either while
most of Sony's phones used to come with
water-resistant components that's not
the case with the XA so do keep it away
from all of your spilled drinks it runs
on Android 6.0 marshmallow which is easy
to navigate but Sony has loaded it up
with so much additional bloat where it
makes it feel quite cluttered from the
moment you turn it on now that's
something of the problem when the phone
itself has a meager amount of built-in
storage to begin with you'll really need
to make use of that microSD card slot at
least the octa-core processor is
powerful enough for all your social
networking needs and will manage a spot
of gaming on your commute as well on the
back is a 13 megapixel camera which
takes pretty decent shots and the eight
megapixel camera on the front isn't bad
either
overall I'm frustrated by the xperia x a
as its slick design got me excited about
the phone but I was quickly let down by
what I found after turning its arm for
much less money you can pick up the
motorola moto G 4 Plus which has a
better screen a higher resolution camera
a fingerprint scanner and that
water-resistant design making it an
all-round better Buy
