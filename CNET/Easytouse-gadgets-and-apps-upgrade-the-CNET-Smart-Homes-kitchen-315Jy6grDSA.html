wouldn't it be great if your kitchen
woke up when you did Siri turn on the
kitchen lights the lights come on the
coffee starts brewing with just a single
voice command and what about
entertaining shouldn't that be just as
simple well today here at the cnet smart
home I'm going to show you some quick
cheap and easy ways to smarten up your
kitchen
for many people the kitchen is the
center of the home so bringing in
technology isn't just about cooking it's
about making the room a pleasant place
to be I used the mytouch home app to
create a breakfast scene which is
essentially a list of commands telling
the smart home which lights and devices
I went on in the morning for the
breakfast scene I plugged our aetna warm
mocha master into an iDevice to switch
to make coffee for the Philips hue
lights that hang over the counter area
and the huge strip lights over the
coffee maker I picked a calm blue color
and fifty percent brightness let's see
what else is going on today Alexa what's
on my schedule you have a dinner with
your book club tomorrow and 8pm sweet
now that I have some time to myself i
think i'll use the innova sous-vide
cooker to whip up a steak for lunch the
innova is a sous-vide gadget that lets
you cook your food in a hot water bath
the water circulates and heat to
whatever temperature you set it at and
the innova because it's connected to
bluetooth will alert you on your phone
when your food is ready one thing that's
great about sous-vide cooking is that it
doesn't require a lot of attention so I
can go off and finish this book in time
for book club tomorrow and the anova Act
will let me know where my steak is ready
I just got an alert from Innova that my
steak is ready and I'm super excited
because all I have to do now is take it
out of the water
Oh fine I wasn't planning on leaving the
smart home today but duty calls one
steak is not gonna feed three people so
I'm gonna roast a chicken but I'm going
to let this I devices kitchen
thermometer mini do the work for me
it'll let me know when the chicken is
reached temperature so maybe I'll still
have time to finish this book for book
club and done just in time too sounds
like my guests have a rob and it looks
like my chickens almost done to Siri
turn on the book club scene so guys what
y'all think about the book I didn't read
it I read it either what never do
typical of these guys and speaking of
not finishing things we haven't even
touched on large smart kitchen
appliances like ovens and refrigerators
that's a whole nother topic that we'll
need to get into in a different video so
be sure to check back in the coming
weeks and months for that video we'll
see you next time you know what make
this kitchen smarter wine typical</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
