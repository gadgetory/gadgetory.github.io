iPhone or how did the iPhone find its
way to you ah the iPhone had a very
circuitous route by itself I mean I at
that point was running like Mac os10
tyrany to the releases at that point and
uh and we've been working on a tablet
project which has a really odd beginning
uh it began because Steve hated this guy
at Microsoft that that is the actual
origin of it and it wasn't Bill cuz he
was starting to like Bill by this point
uh uh it was a Laureen had a friend his
so Steve's wife had a friend who's
married to a guy who worked at Microsoft
every time Steve had any social
interaction that guy who'd come back
just pissed off and I mean it wasn't it
was not in like Microsoft's like you
know it's not good for them that he ever
saw him uh and he came back one time
after seeing this guy and that guy was
talking about how Microsoft had Sol's
computing it solved like net uh like a
laptop computer or they were going to do
laptop or a tablet computing and they're
gonna do with pens and he just like
shoved in Steve's face the way they were
going to like rule the world with their
new tablets with their pens and Steve
came in on Monday and and there's a set
of expletives uh and and that was like
let's show them how it's really done
it's like the first thing is they're
idiots you don't use a stylus you know
it's cumbersome you lose it you're
always like picking it up and putting it
down you were born with ten styluses
style eyes so like lets me use the ones
that you don't to sell uh and and so
it's like and it's this time
touchscreens were resistive touch
resistive requires you to sort of deform
the screen you have to push it down so
if you look at it like text and
everything looks bad it's it's really
tiring and your thing
I said we need to do capacitive touch
and asking multi-touch so we went to the
hardware team and basically said like go
do this and they started and the design
team started building designs around
this idea of multi-touch and it was
pretty interesting I remember one of the
first demos of this you walked into a
room there's a giant giant table there's
a projector on the ceiling and you can
like you see a photo or something on on
the table and you can move your finger
around the table and it would move the
photo super cool wouldn't fit in you
know your your bathroom much less your
pocket or your your you know bag it I
guess we don't have it but the moment
you saw that you knew this was the way
to go like that was that was cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
