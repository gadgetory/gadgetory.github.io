websites the secretive country
accidentally opened access for the world
to see the websites hosted on its
servers it appears that a tech
administrator made a mistake because
access to the list of sites has been
blocked before a researcher in the u.s.
caught the data while running a project
and he dumped it on the site github
revealing that there are only 28
registered domains for dot KP some
screen grabs of the sites were shared on
reddit it's the first look into North
Korea's secretive online world among the
site's listed include one for the state
airline Air Koryo as well as sites for
education public organizations News
sports movies and cooking there's also a
film festival going on now these
websites are pretty basic and they're
slow to load but there are technically
more than 28 websites you see there are
more sites within the country's
closed-off intranet it's a local network
of sites on private networks similar to
a corporate network that's walled off we
know a little bit about it thanks to
reports from blogs like North Korea tech
org also keep in mind North Korea
servers are not the most stable the
country's entire internet went offline
at late 2014 and what appeared to be a
denial of service attack that's it for
this tech news update I'm Bridget Carey
