yes it is Thursday jun 7 jun 7 2012 you
were checking out the 40 Ford show
thanks for watching us I'm Justin you
I'm Joseph Kaminsky i'm richard peterson
know how are y'all new yet no just like
saying this is the show where we say
goodnight twitter bad guy yes I always
tell the truth you know when I die it's
true you're Tony much as much better
than mine my better I never see another
bad guy like this I tell you yeah like
that what's going on guys are you
watching the Stars video look I'm why
I'm reading one yet you realize this is
happening live in fighting the chest guy
has the chat room open on his iPad
that's pretty cool that's like I like
that I didn't realize and 14 though I
mean I told a couple people yesterday
for those that don't know i'm using the
I swifter browser it actually supports
flash yeah it allows me to chat it's a
little buggy but at least I can go and
do whatever it also supports like a lot
of the flash facebook games and stuff I
could also check out the shows on the
cnet TV ipad app Joey oh no no I'm
speaking in terms of who's going outside
another thing is even even though like
you know I could do the chat and
everything and I and it's not just
locked to see natal right all right this
is something I just use you can watch
other flash exactly all right please
stop why you trying to put me on blast
man that actually saved us cuz that's
why we didn't know there was audio
that's true exactly look at the day I
switch faq chat room we would still be
talking to herself probably finish the
show you guys missed the funniest joke
man I just can't do it again way we just
recorded an hour a half broadcasting oh
that's um alright so let's jump right
into the stories for the day uh what do
you want to talk about Richard I have no
idea what's in the run there ok let's
see let's talk about eharmony so
yesterday we talked about LinkedIn
getting a lot of their passwords League
what are you
yeah yeah let's talk about eharmony so
many harmony right now um so yeah
yesterday linkedin they had a big
password dumped on some russian security
website and it turns out that that same
security firm found a bunch of eharmony
passwords that I guess both companies
operate on the same on the same network
they use the same like password storage
system and so but what are you giggling
about could you imagine a happy harmony
account just the wrong two people
meeting at their I mean come on like
they can see the mixdown I you know with
the wrong oh my god she's hot yes I'll
meet her I'll meet her I'll meet her up
yeah and I'm leaving it there yeah I
stopped hahaha but it's weird because I
guess a lot of the passwords uh you can
go and see a giant list of them on this
forum and a lot of them were just
linkedin or password one or a harmony
that was it is like really a bad
password yeah my suggestion to people
who just have problems may be memorizing
numbers and stuff like that just make it
a full sentence just just make your
password like a full-on ah like an
already character pack you know that
like make it the quick brown fox with
with spaces capitalization stuff like
that that's that's a tight password and
it's just as effective and probably
easier to remember cuz my people may not
remember like FM TQ right you know TFT
7aq whatever you know some crazy thing
like that so yeah a lot of them were
kind of depressing to like I guess buds
feed did like a big list of them and a
lot of passwords for LinkedIn are like
hopeless I hate my job well horse java
was like really revealing about what
they would think about their occupations
imagine if you like employers got it
like a hold of the passwords for those
yeah you hate your job huh like like the
person would i think i read that
something like like put something on
facebook about any hated their job and
their boss actually caught a little
comment and do yeah I don't you quit
yeah that's why Arielle hasn't accepted
your friendship I know how many times
what they keep sending it damn you man I
was looking for you I couldn't find you
really yeah I'm there it's joseph
Kaminski I I searched that there you go
did I know you know I probably you know
what I'm more tongs list ok I'm on Tom's
Justin's richard.zito so everybody go ad
Joey on facebook
here I very I rarely go on anymore it's
very time-consuming you go in especially
now like the finals in a place i can
literally have like a 23 hour arguing
with people about sports or whatever
whatever I try not to really go on
facebook too much yeah speaking of
facebook though everyone go ad the
fourth shameless self oh yeah yeah yeah
we have a brand new facebook page so you
can go and add us fan our page look up
the 40 for a new old page yeah it's like
put a couple pictures up there revamp
read me yeah and we're also posting
YouTube videos on Facebook page every
day so you know when it goes live there
like a sweet sweet um all of us ah Joey
your question for you sure so we have a
story today that might be relevant to
you and I don't want to embarrass you
not you know yeah I saw that yeah you
saw this and you're the only parent on
this show so it's sort of relevant yeah
I got it I'm with it yeah we're talking
about it a pretty interesting survey
that says about one in ten parents over
55 obviously you're not in that
demographic have used their phone to
send some saucy messages I've i was
literally um maybe about a year year may
be here yeah okay in in car noise office
and I got her this random message and I
didn't spoke into this girl in a long
time it was just like her in like
lingerie mrs. I was like I was like I
know what that meant but yes that phone
really quit so yeah I i I'm Gildea oh my
god well that wasn't even that's like
accepting a sex message this what I I
had I had a bad I had a written response
to that yeah so yeah I'm guilty of it
yeah I'd really like to know that
responses but not on the show so yeah
it's kind of gross actually i don't know
i don't know about parents why are you
five sending sex messages why why is
that wrong I mean think about you figure
they have to behave in a certain way in
from their children all the time that's
probably the best way to actually outlet
invent how they really feel without
looking like freaks in front of the shop
because no child really wants a picture
like my mom did it twice for me and my
brother that's it she never did it again
nobody wants to picture
that right so I mean in out of respect
for their children it's one way just
like you know I argue with my son's
mother all the time when I tell you guys
before the show I replace the f-word
with freak and that still bothers her as
I credit you just can't you know each
other change your lifestyle and I think
the more you bottle it up when you have
that moment you just really explode and
go with it odds you could just stay up
all night with that back and forth and
and it's like a i guess like it so it's
a great foreplay for people that have
been together for a long time because
usually when you've been with someone
you get so accustomed in their ways that
kind of heats it up a little more right
and then dirt we were talking about the
other just like dirty talking in person
is like really well so maybe someone
would have an easier told me about
through at xmas and yeah and not only
that i think another reason is the the
want factor is greater because you're
not in that person's presence I mean to
talk dirty to someone at your right in
front of you can just act upon it right
so it's like you know you're away for a
couple days on wait till I get back yeah
dirty little girl yeah yeah I think the
only reason why it's gross because if
you think of your parents doing it you
darling okay I just don't know these
kids are looking through their parents
phone yeah I know and I I think
everybody in it is I think everyone
should just password their phone yeah I
don't know just like what you've seen
all the celebrity photo leaks uh but you
know they've taken in a mirror of
themselves topless or something right
like there's so many of those I would be
really nervous sending out a picture of
myself to anybody you know I mean to
know like Kylie get online well my my
tip to anybody that wants to send
pictures out arm two things one don't
make it a full shot with your face yeah
to go black and white black and white
was it's hard to identify you can't you
can't really ask you maybe don't have
your face and don't have any don't have
your face and body in the same picture
man do it in black and one here you go
Joey sexting tips video show any tattoos
yeah exactly no tattoos I'm have any
tattoos not but I I'm never touching
your phone latex you hold this for a sec
talk about my phone is clean yeah they
mostly come in they don't go out okay
good this is also talking about how
three percent of I'm sorry no they're
saying that one in ten men and women
have actually saved romantic partners
contact details under another name
either because they don't know what
there was when they picked it up or
because they you know they want like a
message to themselves when they see the
prison calling you know you do that no
you don't do that I just know I keep the
pictures though I gotta say it's like I
guess like achievements like PlayStation
achievements oh my god but after saying
some of the pictures of so much petty
like ah I think the imagination is so
much better like if you ever ever had a
friend to describe something you gotta
meet her she's hot she's hot no one can
ever be as great as your imagination to
make them so that's why you should never
hype someone up to two months so you
know what for you see for yourself but
yeah you know yeah dirty man yeah like
oh no one else has anyone who gets upset
at me for the today I did not pick the
show topics alright Justin does this to
me on purpose do you know knows he knows
I would like you know he sits a good
show you shouldn't have said that but
then you shouldn't put it in the show so
don't don't I'll take some
accountability I was living vicariously
through you guest on the show you can
say whatever you want yeah I really no
because you'll get flat I don't care you
read the emails not me yeah I'll take it
for you as a host I can't personally say
those things anymore yes I do not
condone or endorse anything that Joseph
committee exactly I'll defer to you he
has access to the podcast videos like
everyone else yeah alright well keeping
with the risky topics here let's jump
into we've been talking about this all
week but I thought that this story about
booth babes and going into more detail
about what the job is all about what
sort of clear the air about objectifying
women you know mean like what will
actually realize what these people do in
reading and reading that article that
actually reminded me arm when I was
younger actually i freelanced and i
worked woman's frail eight not work with
fragrances in macy's yeah and war suit
all dance shoes so i can understand
the trials are standing up and shit 04
'the yeah but um no I'm not going to go
any further okay they get a lot of good
stories though were so this this perfume
in like this irda toilet this perfume in
perfume like and I learn a difference
between like a perfume yeah I get hurt
the toilet is more alcohol base and it
evaporates quicker that's why I've seen
it you'll get into bigger bottles and
like a perfume is more oil base and it
stays it stays the sense things to
longer that's why you find the bottles
would be small does a lot more money ok
so the perfumes don't go in the spray
bottle then that's all this is more like
more than the ones you do da belong
right Boyan all right do you guys work
for club I haven't in a while but I
usually yeah I used to we need to this I
was terrible I'm wearing some right now
man dng light blue mmm um I used to work
cool water alive and popular ones go
orders my basketball Cologne what my
basketball you wear cologne you play
basketball sometimes cuz i play with
some people that really stink and i
really don't like my clothes to stink
like them after we like bobbing up on
each other so yeah I will I will dabble
who what is my basketball right getting
very turned out right now hey sexy shirt
yeah I mean I don't always wear it when
I play ball but sometimes like no really
there's some people like before they
even play a game they already stink is
like would you pull that chair out the
laundry bin yeah and I and I'm not gonna
not guard you I mean this one guy played
yesterday was so funny he out on a bob
marley shirt we played ball he's a good
friend of mine he's cool okay and it
smells like weed so he it I told him I
dude man I can't guard you smell it like
this so he changed the shirt his other
shirt smell like weed it turns out it
was his bag and everything put a bug in
the bag I was like I was like what you
have a garbage bag of the stuff in
everything you put on is like it smell
like em and that's what I mean I don't
like the certain sense when I pledge
just can't yeah like I just can't play
cuz I never mind you like being on the
couch and you know I'm like the enemy
well no I just don't I don't I don't
like the smell that because you know
you're you're running your breathing
heavy like you're sweating like a
certain sense you just don't want to
inhale yeah I had that we'd cologne
going um so God look at this picture is
very disturbing uh so this is detailing
that life of a booth babe here so
err disturbing is what I'm going to say
it talks about the you know the standard
stuff that booth babes have to go
through just the word booth babe is
already kind of offensive you're like
booth professionals or something
actually booths models booth models
there you go the models at computex for
example they profile 1 22 year old in
this article and she says that depending
on how you look apparently you get paid
between 80 and a hundred and seventy
dollars a day but that's obviously
dependent on the company as well paying
you but yeah you know you have to stand
all day you work in about a half hour
shifts then take a ten-minute break and
then work another half hour zero respect
a lot of leering guys with like creepy
comments which I imagine would be no
serious identify see now you let me say
something I didn't want to say it's
taking up said eight thousand times for
all right okay all right people are
gonna get offended when I say this no no
but it is a truth okay sexual harassment
is only for people who aren't attracted
to you I see people could you explain
that actually people talk just of the
Minsk you see people talk all the time
and you see things all even I'm not
pointing out anything but anyway sexual
harassment is what for people for people
that don't find the other person
attractive okay because some people get
away with it's kind of like a double
sink as well yes I disagree yeah you
could this because there's a lot of
reasons why you don't accept a come on
it's not because you're unattractive to
then maybe you're already with somebody
maybe you're not in the mood to be hit
on fine that's what I'm saying you okay
yeah that yeah you do it again no
because you you can see two you could
see two people flirt uh-huh and you it's
I don't know I knew you weren't flirting
but you could see two people flirting
school you can see another person do it
and you come back you're like yeah that
guy totally weird me out wit ya yeah but
he didn't do it any differently other
one it's because there was no attraction
there's no chemistry right now don't get
me wrong i'm not i'm not saying married
women or people that are in relationship
i'm just speaking on a broad single
scale fresh out of college to people get
a new job you see them joke and
especially on the sales side they go out
drinking together they party together
christmas party significant others
aren't invited yeah you tell me but
you think it's different for men versus
women though internet when they're open
to be getting hit on it's the same thing
it's just harder to prove you're a man
because I'd like come on man man up just
tell you're not interested you know so
it's a little so it's a little you know
if a man were to cry people look at you
like what are you nuts you know but for
a woman it's a little harder because
obviously it's never I get worried I
like it no because I'm just gonna ring
i'm gonna go to Cyrene it sums gonna
come out i was going to stop right here
it makes sense though yeah that does
make sense we got a pretty good
voicemail from Marlon from Trinidad
about this topic and it's a little bit
long so I'll summarize it he was
basically telling us a difference
between objectifying someone and just
being complementary which i think is
something that asus tweet failed to do
and uh you know it's like if it's
someone that you don't know and it's
just a photo that you see online it's
really easy to just kind of like look at
it and make a judgment really quick but
uh yeah I was actually talking to a
friend about this story yesterday and
she was like what would what would you
do if this was like your sister or you
know like a close friend of yours and
the someone sit down an unknown tweet
about it and then you had to show it to
her like I'm sure that we wouldn't
appreciate that right I know but it was
her back we don't know she is yes they
didn't have her name and didn't have her
face so like I said like with these sex
text just don't put your face in the
picture there you go yeah so we don't
know she isn't she can deny it til the
day whatever she can admit to it or deny
it so how do you guys feel about never
talking about girls ever again yeah that
destroys a this was the end of it yeah
with no more it was models what's a
booth model models yes professional yes
totally um all right so really quick I
know this is kind of irrelevant story
but that's not what I news going on
today ah Twitter new bird logo Joey have
you seen this it's the the application
formerly known as Twitter yeah exactly
anymore I didn't know this but
originally I guess the bird was named
Larry Larry I know there was a like
Larry like Larry Bird Lake looks like
very good for me indiana right yeah yeah
yeah I get that but I didn't realize
that it had a name in the first place
but uh so check it out this is the new
twitter logo really weird though so we
all got a press release here at Cena
describing it and uh this is a quote
they said it contains three sets of
overlapping circles to symbolize
networks interests and ideas connecting
and intersecting with peers and friends
like a lot of corporate you are yeah
it's just a bird but look check it out
is a similar to how your networks
interests and ideas connect whether
soaring high above the Earth's taking a
broad view or flocking with other birds
to achieve a common purpose a bird in
flight is the ultimate representation of
freedom hope and possibility and they
say I think things to me yeah yeah I
thought Twitter was already full screen
it looks like a would be some kind of
soap yeah yeah the nude of low yeah
exactly I pause it right here oh there's
the circle's going together yeah so long
circle circle dot dot that's a soap
right there yeah we're like yeah boom
there it is beautiful this is a lot more
circular than the other one yeah I'm
still not on Twitter huh still nothing
yeah what's up with that I like it dude
man I didn't I just say I did away or
four square man and I'm hardly on
Facebook I'm just yeah trying to limit
your social networks I understand
incognito that should be student onimous
Twitter we you know reveal yourself just
