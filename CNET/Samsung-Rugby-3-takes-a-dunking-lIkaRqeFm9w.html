CNET this is the Samsung rugby 3 for
AT&amp;amp;T this is a rough-and-tumble rugged
phone
it's got military specifications for
dust shock and water so that means you
can dunk it into some water and it will
work just fine now
what I really like about this phone is
the design I actually really enjoy these
sort of rugged phones they look pretty
cool they're durable and I am a person
who drops things so I like that if I
drop it I don't even have to worry about
it at all there's a large speaker on the
front small external screen that shows
things like volume on the side here
you've got a combined headset and
charging port there are these ribbed
sides four grips large volume button up
and down and push-to-talk it's got 18
T's enhanced push-to-talk the buttons
are large and responsive they're spaced
out so you could theoretically use a
gloved hand and still operate the phone
pretty well there are some shortcuts up
pull up GPS and a menu that goes through
certain shortcuts like your music player
games and your browser on the back
you've got a panel that is screwed in
you can unscrew it pretty easily with a
coin the edge of a badge anything flat
and sharp even your thumbnail there is a
3 megapixel camera on this phone it is
hidden in the corner there are a few
apps on this phone including mobile
email AT&amp;amp;T radio a bunch of other AT&amp;amp;T
navigation apps and GPS you can also get
a few games this phone is rated for nine
hours of talktime now the Samsung rugby
3 is available on AT&amp;amp;T for $99 with a
new two-year service agreement I'm
Jessica's all-court for CNN and this is
the Samsung rugby 3
