regular cable modem you know this diff I
connect to a cable TV lie in and then
Prinze the fast internet home after that
you can use a Wi-Fi router like this one
right here and connect the two via the
modems LAN port and then the router will
share the internet connection to the
rest of the devices in your home either
via Wi-Fi or more network cable now if
you put these devices together you will
have a combo device like the one I have
today the new support extreme combo
device from Motorola now so far I will
never recommended any combo devices at
all for a few reasons number one they
are kind of high risk high risk because
if either part fails the modem or the
rotor part you have to replace the
entire thing that is costly and time
consuming now the second reason is in
combo devices the router part tend to be
weak and slow and when you are tired of
it
you cannot just get rid of it you stuck
with it and speaking of being stuck with
it well I believe getting a combo device
is somewhat like dating a lady with a
very cute puppy you risk living to the
puppy itself so when you see this
remember these danger and it's a lot of
work now the new sub board here is
different however because it's come with
high-end hardware component both of the
modem and the router parts and that
means is very future-proof the modem
part actually support the latest toxic
3.0 standard to offer up to 343 megabyte
per second internet speed now that's
faster than basically all existing cable
services and that could be that way for
a long time the router part support the
latest 802 point it'll burn a C or a C
for short Wi-Fi standard to offer the
speed of up to 1.3 biga P per second
when used with an AC enabled client it's
also a true dual band Wi-Fi router
meaning is support or existing Wi-Fi
clients we got Lee's a bare standard on
the back the sub board
as for Gigabit LAN ports but no one port
instead it comes with one coax port
right here the connector similar to the
one foul in the modem now this means
this device here only works with
internet cable services and not any
other services such as DSL or a set like
disk to make up for that it has one more
thing built in these coax connector
right here also support a MOCA now MOCA
is very similar to powerline but instead
of using the power line
it used the cable TV lie in to extend
your home network to different rooms
that's very convenient because you have
to use the actual network cable to
extend your Y network on the inside the
device has a very robust and easy to you
web interface and it has a lot more to
offer us than any other combo devices
I've seen now in my testing the support
here offer very good performance both as
a router and a modem as a router offer
fast speed very stable signal and also
very good range now testing the modem
part was kind of tricky because the
internet speed depends on how much you
pay I bought a home I try at home and it
offers exactly the same speed as my
existing modem and guess what I have
very fast modem that's set at the
current price of some $200 the support
he actually very good dealing for cable
internet user especially when you want
to upgrade your network or you just move
to a new service because it's cheaper
than buying a a CRO separately and I
modem separately and the support for the
MOCA like this adapter right here is a
bonus for more on these check out my
phone with us at calm if you curious
about the lady and the dark well like
many combo deals sometime you manage to
love them both I know I do and I said
that without even knocking on wood and
that's because I'm don't know and this
has been the first look at the surfboard
extreme cable modem and Wi-Fi AC router
with mocha for Motorola and next time
please make name shorter
