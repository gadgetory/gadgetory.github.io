taking a first look at the Nokia Lumia
630 / 635 the reason I say it / is
because there are two models of the
phone actually there are three models of
the phone and they're all incredibly
similar
so the 635 is the 4G LTE version the 630
comes in two variants there's the
single-sim and dual-sim what I have
right now is the 635 this is an
incredibly colorful device it's a little
bit different in look and feel than some
of the previous Nokia Lumia phones this
one is orange it also comes in green
white black and yellow now one thing
that's different about the look and feel
is that it seems a lot lighter than some
of the other phones the material is also
a little bit different this is glossy
does not feel like the polycarbonate
backing that we've seen on other ones
however like at least one model that
we've seen before the 620 the back is
removable and you can interchange
different colored backplate now the 6:30
and 635 are - the first new phones to
run the Windows Phone 8.1 operating
system with that comes the Cortana voice
assistant a differently customizable
Start screen and lock screen and the new
Action Center for your notifications
onto the phone specs has a 4.5 inch
screen a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor and if
I make a pixel camera on the back there
is no front-facing camera and you'll
also notice that the physical camera
button that you usually see on windows
phones is gone for storage you're
looking at a gigabytes of internal
memory but when you pop off the back
cover there is an expandable memory slot
that will hold up to 128 gigabytes for
now the 630 in the 635 are gonna come
out globally again the 630 is 3G only
and the 635 has already been backed in
the US by 18 t t-mobile metro pcs you
might expect the 630 to come
you second tier carriers like a a
wireless which is owned by AT&amp;amp;T now the
different variants have different prices
the 630 single sim is going to be 160
add 10 bucks on top of that for the dual
sim and another $10 on top of that for
the 635 so you're looking at $180 for
that phone off contract with CNN I'm
toast gazelle card and you've been
looking at the Nokia Lumia 630 and 635

impressions and CNN's our comm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
