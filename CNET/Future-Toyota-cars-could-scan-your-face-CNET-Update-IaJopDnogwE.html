just open the door with your face I'm
Bridget Carey this is your scene that
update
what if your car open the doors not with
a key but by scanning your face that's
just one example of new technology
Toyota is working on now is part of a
new partnership with Microsoft a new
group called Toyota connected will focus
on technology for tomorrow's vehicles
say your hands are full with groceries
or you're carrying luggage the car's
rear camera will scan your face see that
your hands are full and pop open the
back hatch automatically let's just hope
you don't have an evil twin that wants
to borrow your car the team is also
looking at new ways to gather data on
drivers with vehicles that report on
hazards in the road ahead and then that
info can help warn other drivers on the
same road or offer immediate rerouting a
system like this also aims to solve our
parking woes and one example from Toyota
if you're driving to the airport the car
could automatically recommend where to
park so you don't waste time hunting for
a spot it also could remind you when
you're due for a service tune-up and
schedule it for you I think most of us
just rather have a nap tell us where the
car is when you forgot where you parked
as cars work to get smarter Syria has
been studying up on baseball stats
Apple's voice activated digital
assistant can now answer a wide range of
baseball game statistics and it's not
just Major League Baseball but also 27
other leagues including minor and
international leagues meanwhile
blackberry still is fighting to be a
part of your messaging life blackberry
is dropping the subscription plan for
the privacy features of the blackberry
messenger app which used to cost a
dollar a month the privacy features
included retract which lets you delete a
message already sent and timer which put
a limit on how long someone could view a
message or photo before it's self
destructed but remember the app cannot
stop someone from taking a screenshot
before it disappears and finally it
seems there's some trouble in virtual
reality land when it comes to the
delivery of the new oculus rift and the
HTC vive headsets the CEO of oculus
wrote in a tweet that the first rift
headsets are shipping out slower than
estimated so the company is giving free
shipping for all pre-orders meanwhile
over at the competition some HTC vive
customers had their credit card orders
cancelled as they were purchased
flagged is fraud HTC said in a blog post
that it is working to fix the cancelled
orders and to not have those customers
wait longer to get their gear that's all
for this tech news roundup and for more
details on these VR headsets you can
