smart outlet available online now for 40
bucks now for most smart plugs
communication is mediated between your
phone and the plugs by the local Wi-Fi
network this one is a little bit
different in that it uses bluetooth that
means that your phone communicates
directly with the plug and vice-versa
practically that means that setup
instead of taking four or five minutes
takes 30 seconds the problem is that
Bluetooth has a very small communication
range for us at the scene at smart home
that meant that when I was upstairs or
in the basement I would lose connection
with the plug even when I was on the
same floor and the plug was pretty
centrally located I could lose it if I
were kind of on the fringes of the house
as far as basic functionality is
concerned this plug is so-so using it
you can turn things on and off and you
can schedule certain commands but it
also has an additional feature called
proximity while using this feature when
you enter the Bluetooth range the switch
will activate and when you exit that
range it will deactivate this is a cool
solution to sometimes finicky geofencing
systems the problem is that it really
doesn't work very well like I mentioned
before Bluetooth range is limited which
means that when I was walking around the
house I would lose and regain connection
which meant that my lights would be
flipping on and off throughout the day
eventually I just turned off the
proximity feature altogether the nearest
outlet app is also problematic it's an
exclusive app which means that you can't
access other products using it even
Nereus products overall between app
exclusivity and major problems with the
Bluetooth functionality I really can't
recommend this plug to most users for
more smart plug coverage be sure to
