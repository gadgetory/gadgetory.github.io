buzz report and now for the gadget of
the week yes oh he'll save every one of
us this my friends is the t-mobile -
savior of the universe okay it's
actually a windows mobile based
smartphone and it's incredibly thin you
can see small boasts a cute little
keyboard super nice screen and really
fast performance but most of all it wins
the prize for best gadget name ever - ah
Steve you rode the universe and now for
the news Google about YouTube this week
maybe you heard the transaction cost
Google 1.65 billion dollars in stock set
off days of speculation furious analysis
and commentary from sometimes very
dubious sources I'm not trying to say
they're not gonna do anything with
YouTube I just think they aren't gonna
go in and Google if I it and totally
change it but you know they're gonna be
advertising all over that sucker they
definitely bought YouTube because it's a
huge advertising platform with about a
bajillion eyeballs oh my god I am so
famous anyway bloggers pundits and the
mainstream media immediately started
referring to the neucom juggernaut as
goo tube hey goo but that led me to
wonder what other merger possibilities
were out there perhaps if yahoo had
bought youtube it could have been called
yoo-hoo or maybe a time warner purchase
you time via tube pretty obvious but how
about an encyclopedia of video wicket -
via a news corp merger with myspace
makes my scoob or microsoft coulda
bought them and called it Microsoft
video now apparently the Google YouTube
deal actually went down in a Denny's
restaurant in Silicon Valley reports say
that once the deal was finalized between
Google and the previously unprofitable
YouTube its co-founders Chad Hurley and
Steven Chen decided not to share a
grand-slam breakfast as originally
planned instead Chad went crazy and
ordered his very own moons over my hammy
now in the wake of the big GU Tube deal
some analysts are starting to question
whether Yahoo which was reportedly in
the bidding for
YouTube has lost its way a flurry of
stories this week suggested that Yahoo
is faltering and doesn't have a good
plan for countering Google's increased
dominance but Yahoo is not to be outdone
oh no while Google is busy spending
almost 2 billion dollars on a gigantic
incredibly popular paradigm changing
video and advertising platform Yahoo is
hard at work creating and digitized time
capsule that will beam signals and
messages from an ancient pyramid in
Mexico into space for the aliens to read
see they have a plan in other news this
week federal antitrust regulators have
approved a 67 billion dollar merger
between BellSouth and ATT creating the
nation's largest telephone company and
reuniting two parts of the old Ma Bell
now some people might be wondering how
antitrust regulators could possibly
rubber-stamp
such a huge and potentially monopolistic
merger when there's already so little
competition in the telecommunications
industry well to help you understand we
took a look inside the complicated world
of antitrust regulation approval
uh-huh I'm Molly wood and this has been
the buzz report thanks for watching
dude or you know playboy could buy them
boob too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
