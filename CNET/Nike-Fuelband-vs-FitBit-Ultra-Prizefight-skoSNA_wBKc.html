and digital fitness devices over the new
emerging trends in tech so we're
bringing you the best of the best
it's a prized by Butch out between the
Nike+ FuelBand and the Fitbit ultra our
judges for this fight are senior editor
Brian V squared Bennett and myself
really big Tom now we'll take both
judges blind scores and average them out
to the nearest tenth each round the
final price price war will be an average
of all rounds using the same decimal
system it's four rounds to the finish
first one is design the Nike+ FuelBand
is a comfortable rubberized wristband
with a real slick LED display that's
colorful and animated it's
water-resistant so you can shower with
it and for better or worse it's a
fashion statement because you really
can't hide this thing now the Fitbit
ultra may not be as flashy but that's
why I personally like it's clean clip-on
design that's pretty much invisible to
others and effortless to wear it's a
monochrome display is simple and does
the job and it's semi water-resistant
but you can't shower with it and really
where are you going to wear it the Nike
Plus FuelBand takes round one with the
4.5 and the Fitbit ultra gets a 4 next
round is features
the fuel band is simple to use and
operate but it's a pretty basic feature
set it tracks your overall activity
level but its biggest feature is its
ability to sync its data to the Nike
FuelBand app wirelessly over Bluetooth
anytime
plus you can earn achievement badges and
match up your stats with friends with
social hooks for Facebook and Twitter
now the Fitbit ultra is a data freaks
playground it tracks your overall
activity level that's more detailed but
also includes a sleep mode to assess the
quality of your sleep plus through the
Fitbit app you'll be able to enter in
your food and water intake track your
weight and the web interface has an app
gallery that plugs into even more
services and Twitter integration it's
Vegas negative though is that there's no
Bluetooth syncing and you'll have to be
within 15 feet of a USB connected base
station to your computer to sync your
data
the Fitbit ultra speed percent still
beats out the Nike Plus FuelBand and it
takes the surround with the 4 and Nike
gets a three doctor averaging two rounds
the Fitbit leads by a little next round
is data with devices like these it's all
about the data
now the fuel band collects your steps
calories burn and Nike phone metric
called Nike Fuel that's their own
calculation based on your overall
activity level it's fun to obtain more
fuel reach your daily goal and I'll dual
your friends but the problems that we
don't know how its measured and it's not
anchored in reality now I found I could
boost my number of steps and Nike Fuel
score just by seeing my arm back and
forth rapidly that's not a good thing
and the data here just doesn't feel very
accurate
now the Fitbit ultra shines when it
comes to data that's much more reliable
collecting your steps calories flights
of stairs and your current level
activity with this cute little flower
graphic you can see how restless your
sleepless from the night before and
actually learn from it and compare that
with other Fitbit users calories burn
grossly differentiates from both
products but the Ultra appears to be
more reliable Fitbit takes this round
with a perfect 5 and the Nike Plus fuel
band gets a 2.5 out
now there's one more round left to go
and the final round that decides it all
is valued at one hundred and forty nine
dollars for the Nike+ FuelBand you're
going to be paying for that Nike brand
and it might be worth it you with the
Bluetooth syncing mm pins but a
mainstream company like Nike is finding
a way to consumer eyes Fitness with tech
and they'll be able to draw more users
while leveraging social networks for
competing with your friends now the
Fitbit ultra rings in at 99 bucks and
it's really a sweet price point for a
gadget that people won't even know
you're using there's also an optional
premium service for $49.99 a year that
gives you even more advanced data
analysis but the social hooks aren't as
strong now we're split on this one and
we're calling this round a tie at 3.5
points apiece
so let's average out all four rounds for
the Nike Plus fuel bed took an early
lead but the fitment ultra came on
strong that would not be denied taking
this battle for point one the three
point four and is your prize fight win
i'm brian song thanks for watching catch
you guys next time for another
prizefight
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
