we are at mobile world congress 2014 in
barcelona looking at the alcatel one
touch pop series the colorful pop series
has been apparently a big success for
alcatel so far and they're adding this
new s range this year these new devices
will all have LTE support and that's
Penta band LTE and that's also LTE cat 4
which means capable of up to 150
megabits per second in speed so that's a
really high speed new chipset all the
pop s-series devices is supporting the
miracast Wi-Fi direct as well and
they'll all ship with Android 4.3 now
they'll also be upgradeable to KitKat
4.4 around May or June and they'll start
to ship with kitkat pre-installed after
that time the s7 is a 5 inch quarter HD
that's 960 x 540 resolution phone with
an IPS display as well as a quad-core
one point three gigahertz processor it
also hosts a 3000 milliamp hour battery
which should deliver really good
performance the s9 is a 6-inch beast
with a 720p IPS display quad-core 1.2
gigahertz processor an 8 megapixel rear
camera and a full HD front camera plus a
3400 million power battery all of the
s-series supports miracast Wi-Fi direct
for a really good multimedia experience
the price is probably the killer factor
with this pop s range it's going to be
available around mid q2 the s3 which we
didn't have here will retail for 149
euros that's around 205 US dollars these
are all off contract prices the s7 will
be 189 euros or around 260 u.s. dollars
and the s9 will be just 219 euros or
around three hundred dollars us and that
is off contract so this is a great range
of products alcatel said the last range
did quite well I'm sure the pop s range
will do just as well this year it's such
a good colorful device it does feel good
in the hand
and at a great price so this is seamus
burn from Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona for CNN</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
