with CNET and this is a look at the
panasonic lumix DMC FX 90 so it looks
like instead of trying to beat
smartphones camera manufacturers are
looking to be friends with them by
adding Wi-Fi to some models the FX 90 is
one of those models and has a built-in
802 11 n radio used to connect to a
Wi-Fi network for uploading photos and
video to your PC sending them to a
smartphone or Panasonic AV devices or
upload to Facebook Flickr Picasa or
YouTube getting all the necessary
connections set up isn't the easiest
experience and can become fairly
frustrating but since for the most part
it's a one-time thing you'll have to
figure out for yourself if the headache
is worth it
once everything is set up though things
work pretty well but again it could be
easier outside of the Wi-Fi the FX 90
has some decent specs including the F 2
v 2 v 9 ultra wide-angle 24 millimeter
lens with a 5x zoom a 12 megapixel
high-speed CCD sensor and a 460 K dot
resolution touchscreen the touchscreen
is good but if you're using it alongside
a decent smartphone you'll probably be
disappointed with its size and
responsiveness for me a bigger issue is
the cameras photo quality a big reason
you'd want to have this Wi-Fi camera
would be to have better photos than
you'd get from a smartphone and while
they're better outdoors in good lighting
indoors or in low-light the difference
will be negligible for a lot of people
that makes its lens and image
stabilization the only real advantages
overall it's just a disappointing
execution of a solid idea
I'm Josh Goldman and that's the
Panasonic Lumix FX
90</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
