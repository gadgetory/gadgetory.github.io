today I'm taking the first look at the
HP Officejet 150 mobile printer so
believe it or not there's still a large
demand for mobile printing traveling
business professionals that need a
device to output last minute
presentations handouts and emails should
invest in a device that they can take on
a plane but the Officejet 150 isn't it
the $400 price tag is mostly due to the
added scanner and touchscreen but I
actually recommend saving some cash and
buying the previous model instead that's
the Officejet 100 also reviewed here on
CNET but before you make a judgement
let's take a quick tour of the physical
chassis the outside is nearly identical
to its predecessor except when you raise
the lid you'll see the 2.3 six inch
touchscreen that folds flush into the
machine there's a couple virtual
navigation buttons on the left and right
sides and there's also a few icons on
the side that let you know about
Bluetooth connections battery status and
more did I mention there's a removable
battery the included lithium ion battery
attached to the back and HP claims that
it can last 500 prints even with the
battery installed the printer still
remains a pretty manageable 6.4 pounds
that's roughly the weight of an older
laptop computer the printer itself has a
50 sheet input tray with a single sheet
scanner in the center and you can
connect it through a USB cable or
wireless Bluetooth so in terms of
performance you're really not going to
see super speeds or really great image
quality due to the two ink cartridge Bay
but I do suspect that users are willing
to sacrifice Portability and convenience
for resolution anyway so all that said
you can still get almost all the same
functions out of the previous model with
the exception of the touchscreen and the
scanner if all you're looking to do is
print on the go and would rather not
drop 500 bucks you can get the Officejet
100 for much less you can read more
details about this printer and the 100
in my review on cnet.com but that's
going to do it for me I'm Justin you you
just took a first look at the HP
Officejet mobile 150</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
