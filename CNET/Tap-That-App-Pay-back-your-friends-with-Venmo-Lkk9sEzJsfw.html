another edition of tap that app the show
we tap the hottest apps when touching
it's time to pay up my name is Eddie Cho
and today I'm going to show off a handy
mobile payment app called Ben Moe when
it comes to paying for dinner as a group
we all know how awkward it can be to
collect money from everyone with venmo
you can send money to your friends and
family right from your phone use it to
pay back your friends when they spot you
for meals pay rent and other casual
transactions let's take a quick look at
how it works when you first start off
you'll have to register and make an
account simply follow the on-screen
instructions to set up your billing info
tap Settings and then under manage
funding sources add either a debit or
credit card number to use for
transactions afterwards go back and tap
cash out to then add a bank account so
you can accept incoming payments from
others after registering and verifying
your account choose between four basic
options you can make a payment charge
someone view your account history and
cash out to pay a friend
tap the pay icon from the main menu
scroll down to select a friend and enter
the cash amount you owe you can also add
a short note as a friendly reminder when
you're done simply tap the send button
you can also choose to share your
activity on social sites like Facebook
or Twitter though personally I'd like to
keep things a little bit on the DL
remember that your friends must accept
your charges before any transaction can
actually take place so no shady business
you can also access all event most
features straight from their website
though most of venmo services are free
there's still some fine print to
consider basic payments from your bank
account and venmo balance are free of
charge but if you're using a credit card
to pay someone then Moe will cover up to
$500 worth of charges anything beyond
that and they'll start taking a small
percentage cut venmo also secures your
payments with 256-bit ssl encryption and
is bound by strict regulations set by
the federal bank so don't worry you can
rest assured knowing that your payments
are protected based on our experiences
we found Venlo to be pretty convenient
for just about
I owe you related whether it's for
splitting checks at a restaurant buying
seats with your friends for the Warriors
game or even collecting rent if you have
roommates the applications are limitless
that's it for today on tap that app if
you've got any hot apps that you'd like
us to check out hit us up and tap that
app at cnn.com tune in next week for yet
another tap worthy show and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
