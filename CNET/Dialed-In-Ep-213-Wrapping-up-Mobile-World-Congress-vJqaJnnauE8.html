in podcast today is Monday March fifth
and we have plenty of phone and mobile
technology news for you today for you
guys who don't know Mobile World
Congress was here and now is gone it was
last week in Barcelona and we're going
to give you a quick rundown of what
happened there just in case you missed
all of that crazy smartphone news
rolling out of the show and we also are
gonna talk all about all sorts of cool
things like specifically we're gonna
talk about the future of bluetooth which
some people may have forgotten about
that bluetooth is still out there and
exists and people use it and love it
yeah it's true it's true man um and then
we're actually going to chat as well
about the I bone 30 I've had three sorry
my god ipad 3 so yeah I got phones on
the brain I don't know I don't talk
travels that much but yeah so the I had
three this is a apple week you guys can
you believe this it's pretty much we
have two days until the press event
supposedly will kick off and after that
it'll pretty much be Apple news forever
or at least for opera seemingly forever
for about maybe about a month or
something so well you know just gear up
for that and we're going to talking
about all the other news as well that we
have been watching so we are joined by
linen la the awesome Lynn law in San
Francisco hey lint and we also have
Roger Chang here in New York and he's
going to chatting about his experiences
when he finally gets out of that phone
booth hail you still in that fun but uh
yeah actually that's my apartment oh no
they don't place a la cena so that's
really the only thing i can afford is
that is that phone booth but you know
what during rainy day definitely glad I
had that phone booth that's right you
know at least you can put something in
there and the man behind the dials we
have Steven Beecham good morning
everyone howdy morning's Lyon
and we are basically just gonna be
chatting real quick so let's just dive
in and see what actually happened at
Mobile World Congress so I wasn't there
but I was watching all the news as it
rolled out roger was there he has got
plenty of tales to tell but just really
quick we're going to just launch into
kent Germans a quick piece and wrap up
of the show and you know as it turns out
there are definitely folks that were
real innovators like Nokia they had
their Lumia 900 I believe elected I'm
sorry they say it sorry the cs they
launched the 900 but they 80 808
PureView which the 41-megapixel camera
yes but unfortunately it's on symbian so
no one's gonna buy it yeah okay I it's
true wow really that's not right that's
terrible so it's a little tease it's
like we've got this awesome camera but
it's on symbian so that is such a
letdown but in any case it's still
pretty high-tech camera gear to arrive
in a smartphone so yeah that's pretty
cool there have been some pictures out
already um some test shots of photos
taken with the 808 PureView I suggest
you guys check it out it's really good
it's it's more like you don't lose any
quality in the pictures when you zoom so
no it's kind of amazing how far into it
you could zoom these pictures that are
taken on this little small camera phone
he actually there's a picture out there
someone had taken of HTC CEO Peter Chou
and along with the nokia CEO stephen
elop and they actually zoomed into
Peters press badge or his uh his mobile
Congress badge and that's crystal clear
his crazy how it's a small part of
that picture but when you zoom it all in
get expected to be blurry but it was
crystal clear very impressive Wow so can
actually see a use for that in real life
maybe zooming in on someones you know
menu from rafita way just for us how
useful that is but spider-man journal
it's cool trying to cope with some sort
of use I guess it's you know it's good
for like
Rama shots in that type of fellow it's
important no it's not the sleekest phone
if you hold it it's got the sort of
oldest thing that sticks out of the back
of the phone where were they see jammed
in the 41-megapixel sensor so it's you
know it's not exactly a sleek film the
still cool yeah and actually didn't you
have an interesting experience where
Nokia decided to take you and a bunch of
other tech journalists out to test the
resolution of this device and involve
something with a mountain top yes well
basically nokia for a little while
stranded us me and a couple of other
reporters out in the mountain in
Barcelona which is not exactly a place
you want to be when you know you don't
speak the language you don't actually
have that much you know the currency
there but basically they they for one
the Mobile World Congress press events
they were taking us out to dinner at a
observatory at top of mountain in
Barcelona fortunately the bus driver got
lost ended up in this narrow road where
he couldn't cross so they just basically
told us all to get out and walk the rest
of the way that's like 20 meters you
know it'll be fine so there we are it's
about I think 2020 reporters from
various blogs and media outlets and
we're walking there in the dark and it's
higher elevation so it's a lot colder
and we walk about half an hour we
realize or the Nokia folks realize that
Observatory is a good 150 feet above us
and to actually get there from where we
were would require us to actually climb
the mountain so you didn't didn't bring
her hiking gear we did not bring our
hiking gear now and the the best part
was they couldn't get any service on
their nokia phones that's a great moment
where they're like i can't get touch the
bus driver my phone just will work up
here oh my gosh but ultimately all
worked out we we end up having to
actually turn around and walk back
another half hour to to the bus which it
was actually ultimately his faulty he
actually found the right road and it
only took us 10 minutes to get there
after that but but they they let you
take pictures with this phone right
or do they even bother no no they didn't
they didn't bother that point is dark I
mean I brought my own camera so I sort
of snapshots but it was a you know it
it's a lot of shots of the mountain but
that was that was the idea of the whole
thing is to get get people up on that
mountaintop well that the idea was the
observatory and we actually was really
cool we got a chance to look the
telescope check out sort of the close-up
view of the moon the idea being that
sort of adjust the zoom capabilities of
this telescope this sort of what
inspired the PureView it all sort of
ties in we didn't actually use a pier
view that much until dinner they you
know the exact sort of you know had the
phone out we got to test it a little bit
but so they actually let's take pictures
with a uh yeah yeah yeah okay that's and
you know overall I mean the Nokia folks
were very embarrassed about that yeah
and rightfully so but ultimately the
reporters you know we all seem to take
it all in good spirits we're all
actually it's kind of a funny bonding
experience me granted we were bonding
over bashing nokian how poorly this was
planned but it was a good event and you
know we don't obviously hold any grudges
against nokia for getting an autumn out
you know travel and in foreign lands is
always fraught with lotsa peril so yeah
so yeah so let's let's uh you know glad
you made it back to us from Barcelona
and we'll definitely can't wait to check
out the peer review if it'll actually
make it to the US yeah that you know
it's highly I probably won't but maybe
they'll integrate the technology into
their other phones that's what they're
saying it's going to show up it'll show
up in a Windows Phone eventually cool
all right and then quickly you know I
did a quick piece on the power of
bluetooth for dotto so you know folks
who don't know there's a new profile of
Bluetooth out there it's 40 and it
provides a whole lot of new features
like increased throughput also NFC
support and also they're really pushing
this low energy performance so basically
it will improve battery life by you know
a huge significant amount so that is
something that's folks will probably
want to check out just because
I mean I don't about you guys but I use
bluetooth pretty much every day and I
use a stereo bluetooth headset which is
just awesome so I mean they're always
snafus with bluetooth but i think the
standards getting better and a lot of
these new gadgets like these watches
like a Roger you're at the the night
FuelBand yep event where they talked
about this device which is using bordado
and then you know it's basically going
to be a fitness device and able to track
your activity and all that stuff and
talk to your phone too so there's a
whole lot of new products out there
there's a new watch you know from basis
that's also a fitness product so we're
going to see a whole lot of new
innovation around that technology so
hope you guys can you know check it out
and if you use bluetooth let us know
we'd love to hear how you have you
actually use that technology and then of
course we can't not mention the fact
that you know Apple is having an event
for the ipad 3 which everyone is
expecting on march seven so there's so
many rumors out there have you guys I
mean what would you guys what you guys
think is going to be this priority like
what's going to be well I mean I think
it's there's seems to be consensus out
there that this is more of a minor
upgrade to the ipad 2 we're talking
about a higher resolution screen
probably updated software so minor
tweaks to how the body looks doesn't
seem to be kind of a huge step up or a
huge revolution in terms of a new tablet
so even gonna be like thinner at all or
actually I from what I understand i mean
these are acquainted all just remember
speculation but it seems like it's gonna
be little bit thicker and that's to
accommodate the high resolution screen
ok what do you think about the home
button last week I heard there was going
to be no home button then I heard this
one me two buttons or 22 new buildings
between awesome yeah good one on the
back one on the fry think I also think
that invite was just so cleverly done I
think it was a shot of the ipad on its
side which I think yeah like it was
going off yeah tilted it too yeah they
had tilted it yo so there won't be any
home button freak anybody I think a
pretty sure the home but will still be
there yeah you have to have a yeah
I mean I mean I need it but then again
you know isn't it true that Android
Honeycomb not honeycomb Ice Cream
Sandwich doesn't have the yes yeah
they'd have taken out at least the
operating system doesn't require you to
have any kind of like hard buns yeah but
if you notice a lot of the Ice Cream
Sandwich phones that came out during
mobile Congress still included those
buttons right the home to search the
back button you know the vendors don't
want to let go those hard buttons so
can't trust the hardware understand i
guess the software yeah well i mean it's
just it from what they've told me you
know they've done tons of studies on how
people use their phones and you know
people still want sort of physical
dedicated buttons as opposed to these
soft keys yeah and also a lot of times
you know seems like soft keys will just
kind of flip around or disappear and
you're you're wondering like where it
how do i get to the settings menu i
don't even remember you know and you
don't get that multifunction ability to
because a lot of times you know you're
used to using honor about you guys mom
used to using the menu key is the you
know for everything for you know whether
whether I'm in like email or whatever
app on in that menu key serves so many
different functions it's easy to use and
kind of sad to lose that you know um so
I mean Lindy you have an iPad right
right yeah but I have the the first iPad
that came out and we like it but we
haven't filled the need yet to update it
but maybe with ipad 3 we will especially
with the higher resolution because
that's something that we're really
interested in and um the the whole
thickness debate i think i wouldn't mind
having it a little bit thicker if the
resolution widow would be better this
way yeah i feel like with the iphone 4s
and for just sort of set that standard
your kind of used to that kind of
resolution when i switch back to an ipad
2 or ipad it's a little jarring that the
you know it doesn't see much crisper
clear as the iphone anymore yeah i mean
maybe it'll be a higher resolution with
edge-to-edge glass no buttons the same
thickness as the
head to that same price and maybe even
quad-core mmm that would be nice that
would be nice and but that's what most
of the you know most of the competitors
out there now are in quad yeah yeah so
yeah that would be it'd be cool well you
know stay tuned we'll have folks live
blogging that event yeah actually on
Monday we're going to do a live
broadcast here in live stream the event
with Molly and brian Tong so come to us
you mean wednesday well yeah I'm
wednesday morning 10am so come check out
the live stream everybody yeah it'll be
fine that'll be a wild ride I'm sure
very cool and basically just going to
chat really quick about NFC i understand
that kent german also out in Barcelona
was able to check out some of the new
applications they had a booth there
demonstrating NFC which is a near-field
communication and just showing us what
you know all the different abilities and
things you can do besides just mobile
payments on on phones and you know i'm
all for NFC you know i think if it can
be used to two pair devices to set up
settings without having to enter all
these details you know you can just bump
two devices together and yeah nokia
actually has a great they have a great
bluetooth headset that connects via NFC
just sort of tap it and automatically
recognizes it no need to like fiddle
buns or enter codes it's actually dead
simple works really well I like this
harking meter right here I'd love to
just wave my phone at a parking parking
man trying to get change I see so many
ways to that can go wrong I know right
like walking by each parking meter
you're like filling every part I'm
waiting for someone to like you know
figure out how to make it fill up your
google wallet with all the money that
virtual money that's inside of it you
know the problem and I spoke to a vendor
about this at Mobile World Congress was
made they love to have NSC in in every
phone that they make but right now it
just it's a cost issue you know they
have to get their phones under certain
costs for the carriers and right now I
don't see it's just there just isn't
really a demand
for the services so I mean there's a lot
of sort of pie in the sky thinking about
what you can do that a/c but mobile
payments is sort of the most i guess
real goal that they could actually
accomplish with NFC so that's sort of
why you hear a lot of the discussion
around that but yeah as can match them
there's just there's so many more things
you can do with that technology yeah I
can't wait till it actually starts to
work in ways that people can use every
day cool all right well uh I think we're
gonna take a quick break if that's okay
with everybody is doing I'm going right
back talk news
oh yeah that's right I'm just working on
my delivery hey everybody we are back
you're listening to cnet dialed in we
are doing all the new smartphone news
that's coming out of a war Congress and
also the new ipad 3 which is supposed to
be coming out this week of course there
are other news going on besides all of
that we've got really quick we've got a
rumor that the samsung galaxy s3 could
hit as early as april so of course we
don't know where how what you know it
was sort of a something that was
announced or cited by our korean
affiliate ZDNet korea so we're going to
check those rumors and see if that's
actually going to happen turns out that
it may not may not actually happen
there's this update response from
samsung basically saying it's not really
that's not going to be April isn't going
to be when they launched it yeah so
we're looking at it closer I think to
the end of the first half okay so which
is basically which is not what they said
which is what I my sources have told me
but they also said that they're going to
be tweeting their announcement Oh
greater there uh mountain date or launch
date for the phone so so we stay tuned
on Twitter we have to keep our eyes on
tweetdeck 24 hours a day you're not
already doing that that's oh that's in
my life I can't do that no I do i do I
just I just hide it you know like to
look like I'm doing other things besides
that so and then of course another the
other rumor that we have uh well
actually it's more than that it's
basically a confirmation that Huawei is
going to be making the mytouch phones
for t-mobile that's a franchise that HTC
was the first to actually provide the
the phones an LG then LG you know
briefly um you know I think HTC is
probably most successful with that the
LG products we looked at were we're okay
you know but they're not not exciting
you know smartphones have changed so
much and it sort of feels like my
touches is like a
something that's used as a entry-level
smartphone to get people excited about
them but it seems like smartphones have
become pretty much are coming closer and
closer to the mainstream now that you
wonder why you really need a mytouch
kind of device like that but but you
know we'll check it out we'll see what
Huawei has and they're definitely a new
player in the smartphone market and we
also have another I think that both
huawei and ZTE are both Chinese
manufacturers correct yep there and
they're actually they're fairly large in
the the mobile devices business already
is just we're not aware of them because
they don't really operate in the u.s.
they haven't they haven't had a lot of
success in the US the the carriers just
for whatever reason haven't really um
warmed up to them yet they've done well
the prepaid business because they make
really cheap phones yeah but at Mobile
World Congress both of these companies
it went big let me see why away and gt's
brands everywhere while we brought out
this giant Pegasus that was created out
of the send smartphones which was pretty
pretty impressive and true a lot of
gawkers out there and the this wall way
agreement with tmobile sort of shows
that you know they're starting to break
in with the larger carriers so you're
starting to see sort of wall Wayne's ET
follow the same path that HTC had one
when they were try to break in and
create their own brand here yeah so I
mean I mean we looked at ZTE product I
did personally the ZTE Warp which was on
boost mobile you know it wasn't bad it
wasn't it wasn't extremely high-end
feeling at all yeah to put it kindly but
it worked and you know wasn't bad
actually oh sorry I actually sat down
with a representative from whoa Huawei
about three days ago and just to go over
what they had plans for the United
States and what their kind of strategy
was and I like their view on they have
like a very egalitarian view about how
everyone should be able to have these
kind of good quality affordable
smartphones and I liked that vision that
they had especially so it's almost like
a smart phones for all yes do the people
actually ties
team over really well right right that's
their whole thing they want to get
feature phone users to upgrade to
smartphones because they're not going to
win over the customers verizon AT&amp;amp;T but
they can still try to get some of their
own nature film customers to upgrade
yeah I mean hopefully they can shed some
of that you know lower end kind of
funkiness that people are a little leery
about you know they kind of don't see
them as an aspirational brand yet right
well I mean at the show you know while
we came out with the Manischewitz
greatly named ascend d quad oh yes
smartphone which they claim is the
fastest smartphone in the market yeah
they made a lot of claims there they did
make clear there's a quad-core 10 inch
tablet yes yes and that yeah I got a lot
of heat because they wrote a post on
that and and of course that I knew there
was a you know the ax sous which we call
it transformer transformer prime yeah
and that was technically the first
quad-core 10.1 inch tablet so I don't
know if with splitting hairs or what I'm
sure they're splitting hairs I mean
that's so ridiculous though they've got
a lot of fun I got a lot of spunk sort
of have to right huawei so anyway we're
get let's the quick lunch the next story
oh um soul in you said that the you're
interested in this square right there's
this a new app called square register
that kind of allows restaurants and
retailers to handle the stuff that they
usually would using their cash register
with this kind of ipad app and it's kind
of nifty because it could also help with
sales data which is really important and
and you could instead of printing
receipts and stuff they could just it
sends it within the app and things like
that so it's pretty cool we know it's
basically like a one-stop like set up
shop and as a you know entrepreneur you
just have a little stand and immediately
an ipad and you're ready to go to take
orders and run your whole little retail
outlet that way yeah and be interesting
to see how it could like integrate with
a google wallet and other
see enabled devices if everything if
every you know monetary purchase could
be through and iPad or some sort of app
you know I use square quite a bit
actually I have have like a little side
side business recording studio and I use
square on my phone when no band is
trying to pay me or something I'll have
cash and I'll be like oh I take a credit
card and swipe boom done it's really
easy simple it's real fast so and you're
also going to take a picture of them and
send them a receipt so it's kind of cool
oh yeah that is very cool power of one
do you have money but built building
this out for restaurants like this I
mean if you look at this picture it
looks looks like a you know like what
you would see in a cash register a reg
at a restaurant real simple to use
that's that's huge for people yeah like
a like those things it's funny because
those those what do they call them like
POS minor service quite a certain point
of sale yeah the software like Aloha
there's like defeats like Aloha some of
the other names I forget but this those
are expensive for restaurants to buy and
if they can I ASAP that's killer yeah
huge deal so awesome and then now we
also heard about at Mobile World
Congress the LG wcd 800 another
awesomely lovely name for product um
relative yeah yes but this is a tablet
and you know of course you know so okay
so we have so many tablets being
announced and shown but what's really
interesting about this is that it also
comes with a cradle there's planting
with the cradle that will also do
wireless charging so right on the box it
will do in what's the phrase inductive
charging so basically just like a
power-mad or competitors from giorsal
make these products basically you just
put tablet or phone or whatever on top
of the pad and it'll just charge up you
know without any wires or house or
anything like that so that's pretty cool
hopefully we're going to see more of
that in more devices soon yeah I'm
speaking of a wireless a new kind of ad
came out from sprint advertising google
wallet and we're interested about it
because sprint also made another
new saying that they're going to
incorporate google wallet and ten other
devices and the the video is kind of
cool it's a lot of theoretical uses of
their kind of beam application on the
Galaxy Nexus and my friend and I
actually used the we we both had Galaxy
Nexus at the time and we used it to kind
of send back and forth like apps and
contact info and web pages and it was
kind of cool it's like a neat party
trick if you had to see what it'd be
like and what kind of part is you go to
I wonder where you just wanted to show
others for no reason yeah check out my
web page and then you kind of like put
the phones in the back yeah you put the
phones back to back a little fun bumping
grindr than them and then yes and then
Wow no I'm just saying I bless you right
usually you literally do bump it anyways
and then you send over you know pages
and other cool things and it's nice it's
it's it's cool i guess so yeah so while
it will come to sprint and if you guys
want to check it out sprint has the
video out so you guys pool alright and
we had one quick review that actually
went through so Linda you were able to
take a look at the ZTE chorus on cricket
wireless yeah that's right it's not a
smartphone even though it kind of looks
like it and has some bread browsing
capabilities but the biggest thing that
I liked about the ZTE course was the
move music um it's a music service
program that kind of lets you download a
limitless number of songs and albums and
the the user interface of the music
service is kind of clunky it's a little
not a very enjoyable experience but I
did like the audio playback because um
the the phone comes with this great I
can't I can't remember it now but it's a
certain audio playback that's enhanced
and it has really good like speaker
system and also hearing it through the
headphones I really enjoyed it for a for
such a for kind of a phone that's not
high qualified feature pack phone it it
plays well with music if all you're
interested in is music and you don't
need all that fancy stuff so it's almost
like a like a
a boost sorry what is it beats audio on
the cheap in a way and you get a listen
to all the albums it's interesting
because like if you hear a song like
over starbucks thing or or wherever you
are and you kind of want it you could
have it within a couple of minutes and
on your phone that you can play and the
subscription fee is included in the plan
or do you have to pay actually it's part
of the plan it's part of the plan so
that's kind of like that sleeps big sort
of differentiator pretty cool with our
service and we'll get you free streaming
music yeah I've been really popular
that's good yeah you know what I you
know t-mobile should do something like
that to be honest they need they need to
yeah um cool awesome and the phone is
itself is what it's like fifty dollars
yeah so with like a 3888 38 even lower I
even lower yeah that's an odd number yes
very lucky chinese know yeah I guess it
is that's from amazon and then okay i
discounted dad yeah yeah cool alright
and then the other review that's in the
pipeline i'm working on right now is the
it's a bluetooth headsets and motorola
elite sliver it has you know we're still
work on the review just got it in friday
afternoon but basically it it's really
cool comes with this little case that um
you put the headset in and it also
operates as a battery and you can carry
with you and even crazier is it has a
NFC chip in the bottom of the the
charger / case and you can in theory
bump it up against a phone and you'll be
able to sync it and prepare it that way
without having to go through all this
menus and stuff so that's pretty cool
when I hope you know try that out
hopefully that'll work very well it's
also very small and stylish looking so
look out for that review this week and
that's about it for reviews I know that
we got a few reader emails this week we
got a note from and Isis is kind of
funny we got two emails both with people
with very similar names but I swear they
are from different
what we didn't make it up we have Eddie
who is hailing all the way from
Melbourne Australia which is pretty
awesome and then he asks us you know
what do we think of the lack of ice
cream sandwich phones at Mobile World
Congress you know and you know he wants
to get our opinion on that he also wants
to say that he loves us and he
definitely wants to keep listening so
yeah man we love you to definitely keep
listening and we'll be chatting so so
yeah what is this like there were only
what two three actually there were
requests were quite a few HTC had a
whole body she's he had a whole bunch
while we had a bunch no gee I mean
actually there were a good maybe dozen
or so right Ice Cream Sandwich phones
there's a lot better than CES a lot much
much better they're very sad at CES when
there is there were still a decent
amount of gingerbread phones though yeah
well i know that sony Sony had their
Xperia was it the peu peu exactly I
don't you you'd go there yeah no I was
laughing at that when I saw the stuff
really guys but those those I mean
they're very stylish phones but they are
running Android Gingerbread and also
dual core not quad core so that's been a
letdown and then so the next email we
got was from Edward and he actually
specifically has a question about the
huawei mercury on cricket wireless want
to know if it's a decent by so i know
that we're actually reviewed this phone
recently Jessica dull court the amazing
just go who's actually yeah she's uh
yeah she's so recovering for my
craziness Mobile World Congress so but
she reviewed this phone and gave it a
three and a half stars which is pretty
good for a device like this so basically
good about it is it you know for that
the price i believe it's it's pretty low
i got a double check the prices it seems
like it fluctuates all the time but it
does have Android Gingerbread and an 8
megapixel camera plus a 1 point 4
gigahertz
processor which is pretty good the
battery life not so hot and I think you
have to remove the battery to get to the
SD card slot which is not so great
either so you know there's a trade-off
there but I believe that we like the
phone it's not a bad Android device it's
not cutting edge but you know it's it'll
do you for a little while so that's our
tape anyway I think we've pretty much
run to the end of the show thanks to all
