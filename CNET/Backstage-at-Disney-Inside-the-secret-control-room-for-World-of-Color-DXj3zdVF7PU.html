happiest place on earth here at
Disneyland for their 60th anniversary
now we know they've improved the rides
the shows but what's behind all that
magic it's technology so we're going to
show you the technology and how they use
it to tell their stories
alright guys we are here inside the
world of color show control room Mike
this is amazing not a lot of people get
to see this every day so can you tell us
where exactly am I on what is all this
stuffing I mean we're in a secret
location behind Paradise Pier right now
this is like you said this is a show
control nerve center for world of color
in here we're able to control our
fountains our lights our video effects
and of course the master show itself in
our audio processing all originates from
this room Wow so this is just kind of
surround surrounding the lagoon exactly
so our crew in here has a full view of
the show itself see what's going on they
have the cameras we have status displays
we have cameras inside we're underwater
electrical rooms and of course we have
our media which pops up over here so we
can see what our video projectors are
outputting throughout the entire show
that's pretty crazy now also I mean
there's a lot of blinking lights we like
blinking things how complex really is
this if you if you kind of simplify what
is really going on every time someone
sees a show how many things are working
together at once where we're working
multiple thousands of pieces of
equipment we have over 1,100 fountains
alone and each fountain has 40 some-odd
pieces of control points on that alone
we also have our strobes me fog fire
effects what's a witch what's me fog fog
break let's move on me fog is our
atomized water affects what it does it
creates out low-lying fog along the
Paradise Bay Lagoon we'll move on from
here up unto our top tier well now we'll
look at our fountain controller this is
real this word gets really exciting so
over here we have our fountain control
you you're able to initiate queues and
you can push a button and then the whole
show will keep going and the fountains
will go up and down for us as we I
wanted to function its what would
happens if I here look what happens I
press this one Mike ah no
oops so here we're actually able to look
at each value individually and tell
check on its status and its updates
right here as you look at here if his
our array of our fountains these all of
our grid thumbs which are single shots
shoes up in the air and then of course
our robots that we developed and are
just beautiful the really the main
performance of the show you know they're
able to move and dance so you get that
dancing water feeling as the shows going
on and of course some of them are able
to switch nozzle types so one man you're
doing a straight slug of water let's
make you do this great flower effect out
of valve and of course the lights around
those to exceed mean we've we developed
as beautiful lighting ring that Lily
just takes out lane she's right at the
column of the water it's absolutely
beautiful and brilliant you know and
then of course back here one of the
other main components of this show is
video yeah we talk fountains we talk
lighting we talk to special effects but
now we have video as you can see right
here we're actually running our show as
we speak and it looks at our output of
our of our 21 projectors in the show but
if you look down here to our main wall
of video where I was able to see our big
miss screen set up which is the large
Smith screen that we've ever created 60
feet tall and the width of a football
field see that I mean that's probably
one of the most fascinating things about
world of color that mist screen I mean
it how much is being pumped through that
because it's pretty much create a shield
right that you put that image on right
it's really impressive it is and we're
actually creating that with the use of
three different mist screen nozzles one
on each table so each table has its own
nozzle powered off the same series of
pumps that we have backstage actually
takes the lagoon water shoots it down
through a main hype out to our tables
and keeps that water velocity going
pumping thousands of gallons of water
per minute just dropping it right back
in full of doing again and just
recirculating that on and on again
alright well thanks for your time we'll
be checking out World of Color celebrate
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
