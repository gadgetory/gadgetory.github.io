cnet.com and I'm taking an updated look
at the xbox one it's been over a year
since this new console has been released
to the public and my xbox one is a
little banged up it's a little scratched
up but what you'll notice is that it
doesn't have connect and that's because
not really recommending you buy an xbox
one with Kinect now while Microsoft has
made strides in improving that quality
it still doesn't work as well as you
wanted to alright so where has xbox one
improved over the last year finally Xbox
Live Gold is no longer needed to access
services like Netflix which is a major
deal it also has the best media apps
around and it beats PlayStation 4 in
terms of software and portals and
streaming functionality it also has DLNA
services so you can hook up a USB card
and you could stream stuff from your
home network which is pretty great now
going into the next couple of years it
does seem like Microsoft Xbox one might
have a slight edge in terms of console
exclusives games that can only be played
on that platform over the playstation 4
and that's one of the deciding factors
when you're buying a console so it seems
like xbox might have a slight edge
looking forward the next couple of years
so we have all those positives out of
the way let me get to what's still
bugging me about Xbox one first things
first installation times very strange
but for some reason Xbox one takes
longer to install games than PlayStation
4 so another thing that still bothers me
about Xbox one is the interface it's
still not as intuitive as I would like
it compared to playstation 4 it's way
more complicated than it seems it needs
to be because of that it's not the
easiest system to navigate now compared
to PlayStation 4 it does seem that xbox
one doesn't perform as well as
PlayStation 4 when it comes to
multi-platform games you'll see
sometimes games have a higher resolution
on playstation 4 and overall tend to
perform slightly better it's not that
big of a deal but if you're looking for
the machine that's going to perform the
best sometimes more often than not it's
Xbox one so compared to ps4 you can also
upgrade your hard drive space on the
Xbox one but it's got to be an external
drive of two hundred fifty gigabytes or
larger and work over USB 3.0 gamesavs
are automatically synced in the cloud
you don't need xbox live gold it'll just
follow your account wherever you log in
playstation 4 you need the PlayStation
Plus subscription and there's a limited
amount of space that you'll get for
uploading game saves xbox one it's way
easier to sync your game saves so
overall it's been a good year for the
Xbox one they still have to tweak a few
things but it's got a bright future
that's going to do it for me this has
been an updated look at the xbox one I'm
Jeff Bakalar and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
