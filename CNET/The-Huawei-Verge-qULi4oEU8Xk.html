here at Cena today we take a first look
at the Huawei verge yeah this is a
really basic phone there's not a lot
here but I'll tell you a little about it
anyway now this phone is really for
making calls that's really it I wouldn't
really give it much more than that
but even for that I would say this is
probably a phone I wouldn't buy there's
certainly a play time in a place for a
simple device that's easy to use that's
not expensive that doesn't is it
complicated and doesn't just have a lot
of stuff you don't need but yeah there's
a time and a place for that but this
phone even if a $49 for MetroPCS is no
contract service I think you're much
better served by spending an extra 20
dollars
so that's 69 and getting something like
the Samsung freeform three but let's go
through the phone anyway tell you a
little more about it phone looks like
it's about a decade old as far as the
design goes you know it's a classic
design you could certainly say that and
it is simple up top is a 2.4 inch
display it has full color and it's
relatively bright you can change a few
of the settings but you know it's not it
doesn't have a great resolution not for
graphics not for photos nothing like
that menus are pretty easy to use you
have to press this soft button over here
to get to the menus
I really prefer it when you have the the
ok button in the center to get to the
menus but what this OK button does it
does let you scroll through a kind of an
app tray down below for shortcuts again
these aren't really fast fancy apps I
think like take you directly maybe the
browser or metros browser portal or
something like that so that's a nice
touch though also you can get some a
couple widgets to show up that are like
you calendar and weather so nice a nice
touches for a basic phone certainly
inside the menus are pretty well designs
they're just icon based in the front in
the submenu so it's all list so very
easy to use very familiar if you've ever
used a cell phone before you'll know how
to use this one and that that's
something to be said for that you could
probably get this phone to anybody and
they would pick it up and they know
immediately how to use it below the
display is the navigation array it's got
a square toggle in the center with that
OK button that I mentioned too soft keys
there's a back key there's a dedicated
speakerphone key which is nice and then
the talking and power keys down below
are the keypad buttons I do like that
these are actually separated from each
other it's not just sort of one big
block of keys that you usually see so
there's a little bit of space it gives
you a lot of room for texting
quickly of course you got to use the
alphanumeric texting if you can remember
how to use t9 I certainly have a hard
time getting back to that after using a
keyboard for a few years and the keys
are backlit here in the side there's the
volume rocker and them down below is the
mark USB charger port around back is the
camera lens it's a pretty basic camera
doesn't have a high resolution not a lot
of features and pictures aren't that
great
and down below is a speaker just a
single speaker for the speakerphone if
you are using the speakerphone and you
have the phone on a table you might just
want to rest it upside down just so the
speaker's facing you the phone is a
pretty good size it's not too small
sometimes these basic phones get so
small that you lose them in a bag
certainly could find it easily if I had
it in a bag but it was I almost forgot I
have in my pocket it is so light and it
just fits squarely in the hand there's a
plastic shell though so it feels a
little flimsy this is in the phone I
wouldn't want to bang around so not only
be careful of it call quality was ok not
bad not great
speakerphone quality about the same but
like I said if you just want to phone
for making calls and maybe sending
messages you're better served by
something with a full keyboard just a
few more features that just cost a
little bit more I'm Kent Sherman from
