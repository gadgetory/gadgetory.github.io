with your chair I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update industry rumors
have been persistent that the next
iPhone will launch on September 21st but
it looks like a monkey wrench may have
been thrown into those plans reports
from The Wall Street Journal and reuters
SE electronics manufacturer sharp could
be having problems making the screens
for the iPhone there could be
manufacturing difficulties that are
delaying shipments now sharp is just one
of three suppliers for Apple screams
it's all very unclear how this could
change launch date expectations or more
likely if it will limit iPhone supply
we're expecting a new family of Kindles
to be announced on Thursday but images
for once seemed to have leaked early the
verge published French marketing photos
that say the kindle paperwhite has
higher contrast high-resolution
integrated lighting and eight weeks of
battery life if these images are the
real thing it looks like this would
compete with the barnes and noble nook
simple touch with glowlight the backlit
version of the Nook eReader that came
out in April the madden NFL video game
is hot every year but this year sales
Trump the past versions Electronic Arts
says it sold nine hundred thousand
copies of NFL 13 in the first 24 hours
after went on sale it's the most
successful Madden launch for the xbox
360 and ps3 if you have the xbox kinect
this version lets you use the microphone
to speak out voice commands like hike or
timeout zoom music is slowly being
erased from existence microsoft is
killing some features to prepare for the
replacement service called xbox music
which will launch later this year
facebook keeps looking for new ways to
make money off you this time Facebook
will let advertisers target you based on
your email and phone number now Facebook
isn't giving out your number and email
but rather it could share info about
your number like if it's based in a
certain area move over planking and say
Tata to Tebowing because the latest
internet photo meme craze is East
wooding as in taking a photo with an
empty chair during Clint Eastwood
speech at the Republican National
Convention the actor and director had a
conversation with an empty chair as if
it was President Obama sitting in it
some thought the joke was odd and while
Twitter acts fast my friends because
soon the empty chair had its own parody
Twitter account called invisible Obama
and people use the hashtag East wooding
to share photos of them talking two
chairs or having a poke at the moment
with Photoshop some update viewers
joined in on the viral trend and shared
their own East woody moments with us
that's your tech news roundup for today
you can read up on more details about
East wooding and other stories from
today on the blog sina com / update from
