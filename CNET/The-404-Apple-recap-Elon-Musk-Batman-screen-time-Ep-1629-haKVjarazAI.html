hey welcome to another episode of the
404 show thank you so much for taking
time out of your busy schedule to chill
out with us for about an hour or so my
name is Jeff Bakalar it is Friday
September 11 2015 mr. Ross rustic how
are you so Jeffrey I'm good I'm good um
you know always a sad day yeah it's a
drag especially in the city it's it's
tough to get it's a weird day it is it
is a weird day it is 14 years later and
stuff just still feels weird and I don't
know really much more to say then man
that's a that's a weird time in New York
you ever go down to none of the ground
zero and like see all the tourists
walking around and like feel like soup
that makes me feel super weird uh I i
have a few reservations about how much
of a touristy let's smile in front of it
not only so towards the it's also
there's like people selling photos of
like the plane crash no they're not yes
one hundred percent I've I was lucky
enough to have seen the museum before it
was opened I we Justin and I were lucky
enough to go to the top of tower one
before it opened it was amazing the
entire stuff politics aside about you
know what how long it took for all the
stuff to get into action whatnot it is
an amazing sight down there but yes
there is something really bizarre about
what it's evolved into and how it has
turned to such a commercial almost brand
here I say where it's like that's rubs
me away I'm not sure it does you know it
rubs anyone else yeah being from here I
think we you know we kind of like take
umbrage a little more than others but
that is human nature that is was is how
it all shakes out my friend yeah yeah
that's that alright uh today was an
interesting week so this week was an
interesting week in the world of tech if
you're paying attention to stuff like
that Apple
had their uh jig Nate shindig of the
year on Wednesday yep wasn't there big
it wasn't the Apple watch also this year
it was I feel like in terms of like if
like excitement the Apple watch might
have like that build-up might have been
bigger I think the reveal for that was a
bigger deal yeah then what happened on
Wednesday yes well what happened was
they everyone knew what was gonna happen
on Wednesday yeah and that was super
anti climactic I mean I'm at the point
where like I don't I don't need you
anymore I don't need your keynote
anymore yeah because I don't think I'm
getting you know all I'm getting is this
like you know spin from you I'm not
getting exactly what I want here and I
get it that's the problem with all press
conferences sure that's the problem with
any keynote delivered by a company
you're going to get a very one-sided
approach at the entire thing I don't
know I feel like we didn't need it I
feel like we got everything we needed
all it did was allow for let downs and
disappointments yeah and it's also kind
of funny because it usually hits their
stock pretty hard like it almost every
single press conference their stock goes
down afterwards which is normal for the
stock market but it is weird that they
build so much around it but it is I mean
for their brand I think it's very
valuable what happened this time when
you say it cuz it so you're saying when
when Apple has a press conference yeah
the stock takes a hit because it sort of
corrects itself it's exactly right so
you're supposed to uh the the old stock
market adages by on the rumor and sell
on the news right because nobody in
there like no one everyone knew what was
going to happen Wednesday so that public
knowledge already had its effect on the
stock market so what I mean I what are
you just spilling this out because you
uh here on Fox Business no I just think
it's interesting that like as if or like
there are obvious benefits for their
brand and like awareness and stuff like
that sure but as a like strictly
numerical like one-to-one connection it
is a little bit damaging to their bike
stock well and what it like like it that
goes down now so what's it at now do you
know I don't know I haven't looks I know
it's split like six times and now it's
so valuable of course no I'm not worried
about Apple's stock long-term
just I found that interesting I I don't
know but as a press conference in terms
of the reveals like as we as we said we
knew everything we did except for maybe
the pencil I don't think you knew about
the pens did not know about the pencil
so and there was this great comic I
don't know if you saw this comic did
something done in 2012 yep and it was
literally like the first panel is uh
Steve Ballmer on stage introducing the
surface yes and saying hey and it comes
with a with a keyboard and a stylist is
not OS and all that stuff and he was
like and then it's him getting angry at
the crowds that crowd hates it and he's
like well apples gonna rip us off in
three years and then the last panel is
tim cook at WWDC 2015 yeah revealing
literally everything that was revealed
in this press conference which is pretty
spot-on it's a very strange reverse
reversal of roles I I don't know how
anybody cannot take a second guess and
you know cut I mean look it's a tip of
the hat to Microsoft it is yeah you're
the first to do that it was a good idea
it's a good idea people I I the keyboard
thank you again I know a couple people
who have a surface and they like yeah
they do yeah the third one I don't know
if the first no way it took a little
while then I do know people that like it
right so people like so okay so here's
my own thing right the ipad pro yeah
with its keyboard and it's pencil I just
don't understand the evolution of this
product anymore at first when the ipad
came out was at 2010 yea rather ipad
comes out and they go hey check it out
we ripped the screen off a laptop and
now it's just the screen you can't touch
it yeah right ban life's change you
didn't know you needed this product
product your life's changed yeah fast
forward five years later they've just
reassembled a computer yeah well that
was a my question is like okay so why
doesn't this why his macbook air just
have a touch screen like a removable
touchscreen yeah and then it's that same
thing yeah so my guess because the
biggest issue that people have had with
the iPad
like I like the iPad it's okay but in
terms of doing work on it you really can
i think not a product you just can't IG
typing is annoying and just like moving
files around doesn't really work and
there's just like a lot of issues with
it and and the surface sort of fell into
that hole where is like hey you can use
as a laptop essentially right you know
you're not going to do intense gaming on
it but certainly if you're just using it
for work it's like a viable travel
that's an option and it does seem like
that's essentially what Apple's trying
to follow but the but iOS still doesn't
really operate in such a way that like
unless you're just using like like Gmail
and drive and whatever to do work it's
still not really great for like file
management and all that stuff just
doesn't really work on iOS it's just not
made for that it's a and that's the
thing like a lot of people are saying
okay fine so now this is a clone of the
surface but like you just said the OS it
exists on is not a OS that lends itself
necessarily to product right it's really
just designed for entertainment
digestion and I mean and don't give me
no like yes they showed off the autocad
software and the film and photo editing
software sorry video and film and a
photo editing software but but if you're
a serious video editing person like
you're probably not going to use this I
can't imagine a situation where anyone's
like oh I I need to do a quick cut right
with this get all the like don't forget
that's also understanding like oh I need
to dump all this footage on the iPad
how's that all going to shake out how's
it gonna work it's crazy I don't I don't
really see like I get the demand for
using as an entertainment device beyond
that I don't know it just seems more
like more of a novelty and the size of
it is like I mean it's huge it's huge
and I mean it's the size of my laptop
essentially without the keyboard right
so let's just like enormous and your key
in your macbook also has a USB port
right and it's you know it's this
modular sort of device with a trackpad
to yeah I mean you put a touchscreen on
that thing and why am I ever
yeah I think that's the thing I you know
and and I know when the ipad first came
out I remember specifically saying this
thing's a joke it's never gonna take off
I ate for that obviously yeah and
you know now it's like all right the
ipad is such an established product
which explained to me you know the
reasons why i didn't know i needed this
and i don't know if i see that even
though the ipad is a type a pro is an
extension of the idea i still don't see
where it falls into my everyday life
where I'm not taking my macbook that has
a very better keyboard to that keyboard
that's attached to that thing that is
not gonna be the most fluid sort of
comfortable keyboard you've ever used it
be a travel keyboard essentially yes
it's it's it's it's a stream so i
thought they made a better argument for
the apple TV out of all the products
they revealed i thought that was the one
that like showed the best you know i was
hoping more certainly of a gaming focus
and it took a backseat yeah i mean the
games that they showed were like
basically wii games with like a lot of
waggle and like crossy road and stuff
like that fun like if you ignore that
stuff and like I mean it works with
third-party controllers is like a
high-end steelseries controller that's
going to work with the Apple TV and like
you could play like bioship like
Bioshock runs on an iphone 6 now and a
various other like hardcore games so you
could use this as a hardcore gaming
thing hmm you could ver a handful of
games for a handful games iphone is not
made for that and you're not in rarely
are you going to get a simultaneous
multi-platform release we're like you're
playing that game day one yeah no that's
not gonna happen because the price
difference what I do like about the
apple TV tricky from a gaming
perspective is I think it might be one
of the easiest systems to do multiplayer
with okay because it works you could
essentially use iPhones as controllers
gotcha which is kind of neat so so you
know if everyone at your party has an
iphone you can play a four-player game
without having to worry about like
charging controllers and and all that
stuff yeah so that's kind of neat I
don't think it's like a world-changing
thing
I like the Apple TV as like a concept
and like a very simple set-top box
solution to like do most of the stuff
you want to do media wise like Netflix
and Hulu and all that stuff and this is
definitely not Amazon not Amazon that's
true that's a big deal man it is it's a
big deal it's a huge deal it is a very
significant emerging platform with tons
of fantastic original programming and
there is a void yeah I this thing not
having it yeah I mean if I'm choosing
between a roku and this sure you gotta
take that into consideration yes don't
get me wrong the series stuff it's a
great demo it's a great I would never I
don't think you're gonna use it as much
as you as you might well the question is
do you use Siri now right I never ever
you never do but you don't have a well
no I still have a capable you know phone
that aucks to you does it have a name I
think you just say ok Google oh it's
google um you don't want to look like
you don't want to connect it is it a
show it doesn't matter because I don't
need him to write it's worth us because
it's pointless the only and the xbox
that's the same thing and I neurons it
yeah I don't even think connect deserves
to be in the same conversation it did
feel very similar that demo felt like a
kinect demo didn't it it did but to
apples credit as seemingly unfun as it
is to use Siri yeah the voice
recognition it works and yeah it's
pretty what connect does not work 30-5
p.m. in the time grade um so yeah the
only time I talk to my phone is a voice
to text I never use all the time yeah
walking down the street texting I will
each day stuff yeah what's that eat
there's a Simpsons moment where Nelson
has an apple newton yeah and he writes
out in script he writes beat up Martin
as a reminder and it changed to eat up
Martha yes that essentially that I'd
love you're saying yeah that's that's
what I'm talking about but it does work
like the what the voice the tech stuff
really works well yeah on google it
learns your voice it learns the things
you say often like i say a lot of words
that aren't common vernacular and
through like what like you know my weird
words like ginz I say oh yeah and it
comes through yeah and is that because
you type it a lot yeah okay yes there's
no other reason so if you have no idea
to talk about GI NS yeah is what I use
for the word dinner yeah what are we
doing for ginz what's for dinner yeah
anyway my freakish vocabulary is such
thing I never used that stuff it's it's
fun III have a thing so let's get into
the phone the apple TV I think we
covered enough yeah uh the phones I'm
not gonna lie i kind of think like this
is the closest I've ever been to wanting
an iphone really yeah cuz of the 3d
stuff that's icing on the cake what was
it for you I don't know I think I mean
we can go out on a women say androids
pretty crap no Andrew like no one will
agree with you android is good okay
android is a good operating system i
would then i haven't used an android in
several years i'm sure it's much better
than it was funny it improves by leaps
and bounds where's iOS has this like
stagnancy issue sure stagnant yes ah so
i think my whole thing for me number one
and this is gonna sound lame but like
there's gold do you want a rose gold yes
i want to roll is gold 128 iphone 6s
yeah no uh everyone i know has a knife
okay and it's getting to the stadium an
iphone yeah it's getting to the thawing
it's annoying yeah and it's not and into
me like now I'm at the point where like
okay I'm maybe one out of like 25 people
I know yeah that don't have an iphone
and you know you can stick to your guns
as long as you want and I've never owned
an iphone and I don't think I'm gonna
get one anytime soon okay I just I just
know life's face I message is that the I
message and just like compatibility Alec
I get asked a lot of questions about the
iphone I just don't know the answer yeah
and like if I just used it I feel like
people look I don't know I hear what I'm
saying it's interesting that this was
the 6s was like
moment when you realize that also the
camera is so goddamn good a phone yeah
i've never used an android phone that
comes close I know the LG g4 apparently
has like cherries unbelievable camera
and I like the one on the g3 that I
currently have but I can tell like men
that iphone 6s camera is super fast yeah
and to me that is the most important
thing about uh uh your phone's camera
yeah it's got to be super fast work real
well in low like actions and not suffer
from blur yeah and it looks like all of
those ingredients have lined up
perfectly for this new phone not to
mention they've bumped up the the the
what's called the resolution and did
they just add a transfer to aunt from
Android yeah feature there's no better
time jack I have a um I have a rooted g3
that I'm very happy with yeah I love
everything about it I just I i don't
know maybe maybe I'll do that t-mobile
thing where it's like you can try out
this phone for mobile yeah I'm gonna
switch to t-mobile I think really yeah
I'm getting I'm getting you think the
service is ok on tmobile in Manhattan
I'm sure it's fine yeah but what about
Jersey what do you mean like where I
live it up okay i'm pretty sure what if
you went home what if you want hope you
don't think it'd be bad I don't define
the sticks when Alex my fiance has
sprint and her reception is tarah yeah I
had sprint for 32 and I didn't get a
phone call for three years yes no that's
how that works yeah everyone knows
sprint is currently not very good but
t-mobile customer satisfaction is very
high okay and let us not forget the
insane amount of money you will be
saving yeah I will be saving feasibly
when I when and if I sweat what's your
cell phone bill at how much did you pay
like a hundred bucks really yeah wow
that's with that CBS discount weekend
wow that's crazy what do you pay I pay
80 bucks and i still have unlimited data
on verizon on 18 20 you have eighteen t
so what the hell what do you mean what
the hens technically like the best price
is more expensive though yeah my point
exactly i guess i think i just i like t
mobile's like
a few attitude also i mean their
marketing is smart like their CEO that
legate like he clearly done
carrier-grade wants to like you know get
dirty yeah he just wants the set aside
like he's got nothing to lose he's not
getting beat by sprint look I how do
people vote for their president whether
or not they like I like this guy I'm
gonna give his service a shot yeah um I
think we'll see okay but uh yeah I don't
know would it be totally like I wouldn't
be able to tell anyone no you'd be
really embarrassed you know I'd have to
like just be a hundred percent quiet
about yeah do it quietly and not tell
anyone yes they I have like maybe one or
two friends who are just like man I give
you credit yet you said that your guns
of that Android me it's honestly like
you've been a Red Sox fan all your life
and and then secretly you're like I'm
gonna be Yankee fan now and let's see if
anyone noticed it's the cameraman the
camera so Jackie's spend a lot of money
on camera oh and I'll jailbreak it and
I'll do what I gotta do my own but live
the dream Jeff I message is great it is
great I just and I can use my own
keyboard now Rio that's a big part
that's big deal big deal field big thank
you know all right let's move along
enough Apple for today we spent 15
minutes on Apple uh hopefully we covered
everything you wanted to hear or least
would you would expect from us covering
Apple moving along to a very important
man mr. Elon Musk yeah he's pretty smart
we need Elon Musk Elon Musk is just the
right amount of crazy for Humanity yeah
he is the guy who will bring us to the
edge of nuclear holocaust and dangle
that you know complete end of humanity
experience in front and then pull it
back just safe enough for all of us to
have a good night of sleep yeah you
think his I think his cars will come to
life as the robots are like attacking
and they're like the Autobots yeah in
real estate and they'll save us he'll
just have to like you know whisper into
a very small device protocol 8 15 X
activity and then we're safe oh yeah
it's it's all good if you haven't been
watching the new Stephen Colbert and
Late Show with Stephen Colbert fellow
CBS fellow CBS never i'm not saying this
because we I work for CBS yeah I happen
to think the show is pretty good yeah
it's been good I mean we're only three
episodes in but it's exactly what I
wanted it to be yeah which is like a
little bit of a smarter night late night
show yeah i mean look Jimmy Fallon's
entertaining but no one's ever accused
the guy of being cerebral ah I happen
like Jimmy Kimmel too yeah but that's
its own flavor that's its own based and
I think what people loved about the
colbert report the you know mr. Colbert
is a pretty big geek that's becoming
very apparent yeah I'm is the CBS debut
I think this is exactly what about what
we need in Anna I think it's good anyway
my heavy feeling for my own company yet
have you been liked you watch it on
television I've seen the first okay I
can't watch like the late-night TV
anymore I don't I am not glued to the TV
i am doing others earnings sure um but
you know I'm digesting it and it's and
it's on the level I needed to be sure
that said on Wednesday night he welcomed
Elon Musk as a guest which is sort of a
good self that's a good indication it's
like who you can like I think Joe Biden
was also I like he's definitely not just
trotting I George pony was on his first
episode but he's definitely not just
trotting out like you know pretty slept
with a week at least not for his first
week I you know I think it'll be a nose
I think it'll be a nice mix at the very
least right on and yeah he was he was on
mosque was on did you see the interview
I did and so musk as you may know has
these dreams of populating Mars Mars
being the closest planet to us and he
seems to think that it's possible to do
it with large clear bubbles you could
just live on bars even though Mars
pretty inhospitable but eventually you
would need to change the climate such I
guess make it warmer because right now
it's super cold it's very
old so he said he had a plan to do that
knee and colbert asked him do you have a
fast plan or a slope and he's like well
my fast plan is to nuke the poles that
is amazing like the poles and the fact
that like this guy exists is so awesome
is kind of fantastic and also a little
bit scared well cuz think about it like
if we had to do that yeah like just
hypothetically sure we have to do this
humanity in order for Humanity live on
there's a comet coming yeah its gonna
knock it what's into the site and Billy
Bob Thornton says the only way for us to
save humanity is to inexplicably nuke
the North and South Martian poles yes
that's what we have to do yeah who's the
first guy you would look I'd be like oh
 we'll get bringing musk he's
already been thinking about if he's in
years I got a plan and guess what he
does not only that he's already have
them planted in the polls here just
waiting for some of the ask Emery's like
okay I can take that that same little
Tobias execution execute Martian
explosion and I amazing he's a card he's
really interesting I when I was at e3 we
interviewed the guys that are making
what's that space game Rivas all planets
no man's sky no man's sky and apparently
while they were there they were invited
by personally by e1 must to visit his
plan and they like the gigafactory i
guess i think that's in nevada know
wherever was it was like near elica and
and they met with him and they just had
like they obviously all day long or
looking at people that are like in all
of their game cuz read a crazy game and
I we met with them like immediately
after they had gotten back and you could
see it in their faces they were like
awestruck like they just met bully wonka
and visited the Chocolate Factory it's
pretty crazy I love he is he's a
fascinating dude he also said he should
run for president he should yeah I don't
think he can you can't well cuz he's a
South African but now did about so you
have to be born in the US you have to be
American citizens so I think if your
lies have his American citizenship no
but you have
it's a little bit weird I think as I
understand it like if your trap if your
parents are traveling for example and
your parents are both American and and
they have you in France or whatever
you're still you can still be President
okay but you can't like turn 13 or turn
15 and then get your American
citizenship and gotcha God can't do it
after the fact that's essentially you're
born it well rules are made to be broken
true and if anyone's gonna break this
rule that's crazy Elon Musk man he's a
very interesting person but yet he sit
so the fast way would be to inhabit Mars
yeah make it suitable for human
existence well it would be to drop
thermonuclear weapons over the poles yes
so the greatest part of that and the
article we're referencing makes note of
that he says that and he doesn't even
flinch now he says it's so calmly and
nonchalantly like yeah I could whip that
up in 18 months if you need that yeah
yeah he what that would be the thing how
would there not be like a radiation
fallout though I mean it would be
located in the polls you doin
centralized to the polls theoretically I
mean I guess you could move right that'd
be bad but you're in bubble so it's fine
so if it doesn't work out worse comes to
worse that's another problem for him to
solve someone needs to just sit him down
for five hours and come up with every
science fiction movie for the next 15
years just from him battling ya get Elon
Musk drunk like that's what you gotta do
get him drunk and just have him like
completely have diarrhea from the mouth
and just science diarrhea and just give
us like endless amounts of inspiration
for sci-fi yeah that'd be so cool he's
he's terrifying he's put in a in a good
comforting way yeah we need him but that
seems like doom it's always the case
where it's like hey there's this guy
that's like super smart and a little bit
intimidating and he leads you into the
future and or leads you into 1984
high-risk high-reward sure you don't you
don't get anything significant yet
without actually putting it all on the
line yeah you gotta let it rot amen all
right before we hit the brake let's talk
about pokemon game
on okay so pick pick a man Jeff you're a
little bit older than I am by what it
would say nine years older than me I uh
yeah so I'm 31 what are you 33 3333 so
you 1984a 30 so you and your birthday's
in what October right so it's coming up
yes you're you're barely you're an old
man that's uh that's the upshot is
they're two years apart um what I would
say is when I was growing up I was sort
of in the like the heart of the sweet
spot for Pokemon cuz the game came out I
was like probably 11 maybe around that
age on gameboy and I it just like was
like perfect for my age you were into
Pokemon big time like I played all the
games i watch the show that's not such a
door I mean I'm yes there's no question
about that and you know in the in recent
years I've sort of like moved away from
it because like I'll play them but like
not with the level of passion and
obsessiveness that I used to but i still
like love you know the original 151 all
that stuff I don't know what that means
that in the original pokemon game there
were 151 different pokemon that you
could catch I think my pokemons uh what
sounds like hate it's not hate I
ignorance it's ignorance yeah cuz I just
I'm upset I was left out of that well
what was the equivalent for you I don't
know snap bracelets will do they like i
said less than to your separator songs
just see my age we're into what was the
like zeitgeist thing that I yeah I guess
people maybe but they were more losers
because they were even older no I don't
want to call anyone a loser but I like
familiy might when I think of my
childhood if you're talking like the NES
like sorta yes it was all Mario and it
was all sure I was like a fanuc mom was
a phenomenon in the way that like Angry
Birds became a phenomenon and I was but
then I'm thinking I was like Ninja
Turtles ghostbusters yeah you were that
yeah that was me too yeah anyway long
story short Nintendo as you may not may
or may not know has begun making mobile
games they actually just released the
Pokemon match game on iphone and various
other platforms they're making them with
DNA um who is a Japanese company that
makes mobile games that are their newest
announcement is this game called Pokemon
go we're just coming to Android your
favorite home and iOS and it's
essentially an augmented reality game
right where you walk around the world
and you hold your camera up and hey
there's there's Charizard hanging out on
that couch and you could like catch him
some way sure but in watching this
trailer I got like really into it for
some reason it's like this just live
action trip as a live action trailer
where people are like running around
like different cities pointing their
cameras and like oh there's Pikachu
hanging out in the fountain probably not
he's electric but hanging out in the
electric factory right and uh and then
there's this moment where everyone
converges on like Times Square yeah to
fight Mewtwo who's like the ultimate bad
guy right the original is he a pokemon
he's a pokemon he said there's bad and
good pokemon yeah Mewtwo's the ultimate
evil huge ethically created by
scientists oh all right there's also Mew
he was he was cloned from me he's the
sequel he's the sequel to the evil
version gotcha isn't the number two or
to spell that gotcha so Mewtwo is very
evil anyway everyone comes and they're
like pointing their phones up in you too
in spite of him as throwing balls at him
and and all your pokemon are going after
him and I just got like really pumped
it's like a really well-done trailer
it's definitely worth watching I don't
think anyone that doesn't like pokemon
it's going to be converted by watching
this but it really did tap into my my
love of Pokemon well and there's a
million people like you I'm sorry
there's 40 million yes yeah so I feel
like it's a it's a good indication that
the game is going to have the best
interests of your kind in mind yeah I
just wonder what its gonna do for
Nintendo's brand like are you going to
start seeing like kind of crummy mobile
games by Nintendo and what does that
mean for them no I don't think you will
yeah i think if nintendo is backing this
oh they they own pokemon by the poet
it's complicated but the pokemon company
is like a separate company that handles
the branding for it but they have like a
licensing agreement with Nintendo yeah
I don't think Nintendo is interested in
releasing crap anything and I don't
think they as we had so much crap but
like just sort of like forgettable
things it's possible but I think their
first significant foray into this world
would not be a half-assed one yeah
that's just my take um so yeah I'm
pretty excited I think it comes out next
year and I'm not related to this but I
don't know if you're familiar with the
diss track phenomenon that's going out
going on in the UK no it's like this
underground hip-hop phenomenon and
people are producing these diss tracks
and apparently they're very well
regarded in the hip-hop community and
this guy named JM e created a diss track
that I don't know going just play a few
few seconds of it what ok I've it yeah
here we go trust what Ronnie charmers
out for life just know when you see me
you're looking at a monster bug juice to
cop man get my vision of e buzz you
can't attack I only cash it's pretty
good video that's it yeah you guys are
like a hand-drawn I so dis track is just
like a song making like it's talked
about like how good you are
cable throw new contract it's just very
earnest than like spot-on for someone
that clearly loves Pokemon like he's
talking about link cables those were
used in the original Gameboy transfer
Pokemon he knows the stuff hey so uh is
cool yeah I believe it yeah I respect
passion yeah simply put so del the funky
homosapien also a big gamer yeah yeah
well thing about Dreamcast I feel like
I'm talking gibberish to you Jeff no I
get it it's not you're not talking you
know it's not all about Hoobastank I'm
just not connecting I just can't relate
you just don't have that emotional
connection I understand it's you are
kind of speaking a different language to
me because I am only on a very surface
level and my familiar I know Pikachu jar
there and nooo squirtle yep and like
that's it yeah yesterday Vinnie was tell
me about all this talking like did that
37 year old dude is all about it was
like all right you know I did I guess I
just missed the boat on Vesta boat yes I
don't know III won't lie like I
definitely remember in my own mind
making fun of those people yeah being
like oh they're a bunch of losers well I
made fun of the magic card kids so mad
and what's the difference nothing it's a
register my opinion could be more
creative it's certainly more social yes
you have to play with other people yeah
I don't know I'm curious to hear what
people think I was never into any of
that stuff no magic no pokemon no card
games none of that I was an NES kid
that's not sure but that's about it

Russell yeah I didn't want to bring I
are you know I'm sorry I'm bummed
somebody in San Francisco that wicked
sucks but you guys will hold it down oh
are you crying I'm crying I'll be
drinking jager this already and
explaining something ok ok let's talk on
I so on this freaking headline yesterday
and I'm just like you know why I'm done
with this yeah why are these things a
big deal maybe it's my fault maybe Jeff
you shouldn't be reading about the
trending topics on facebook maybe they
are only going to do nothing but
disappoint you ok why do i do it i don't
know but i saw this headline and I'm
like what who cares why is this a thing
headline said hey zack snyder confirms
there's going to be more Batman than
Superman in the new batman vs superman
movie coming out in march ok did he did
he give a ratio right did you give a
ratio sixty-three percent Batman what my
first thing and I'm gonna going to
breathe easy and calm myself and collect
it why does anybody need to know that
right now sure what why I'm why do you
need to why do you need to ruin
everything before this movie comes out
this what I'm gonna say I think there's
a lot of people that hated the last man
movie myself included I hated it I
thought it's garbage them which one is
that mana mana steel okay thought it was
guard shack Snyder do that Zack Snyder
director oh let's give him those give
him the keys to the castle again so I
don't think he's directing this one or
he's not he might be directing this one
but he's not writing it there's some
element of that anyway um I think that
some of this might be getting ahead of
things where people were like there's
like a lot i hate around it and people
are like we don't
like Superman he sucks he's not an
interesting character so this is like
them getting ahead of it and saying like
no no it's more of a Batman movie really
you think this is a play I think it's a
play the first blind to this freaking
article maybe want to throw my computer
at the window also while promoting the
doritos crash the Super Bowl ed contest
director and DC extended universe
Godfather's x night oh who gives a
Godfather he's made one movie oh I guess
he's working on like suicide squad and
all that stuff I would godfather denote
like some sense of authority yeah and I
mean I mean he is at the head of this
thing but there's only one movie that's
been released and it was poopy so it was
poopy rubbish yeah all right regardless
how we personally feel about Zack Snyder
and his inability to make me care about
any movie he makes I don't understand
why we need to find out everything yes
you say it's a play by Warner Brothers
to get get out of the fact that why
someone writing because Superman
inherently sucks no one wants to see a
movie where he's waited more than Batman
I get that fine mile thing is like why
do we care why do you the average viewer
want to do this to yourself don't you
want anything left for surprise do you
want to know do you want to know why
don't you just find out what happened
tonight why would you show you the last
20 minutes of the movie I can put that's
what's gonna happen i completely agree I
you were getting towards but people look
at me like I'm a crazy person when I sit
in movie theaters and a trailer comes on
for a movie I wanna see and I look down
and shut my ears like is that crazy
you're not crazy I do that with TV shows
next time on sons of anarchy I can stop
right I happen to like the art of the
trailer I like your so here's the thing
with trailers for me and you can't
compare a trailer to next time on those
are not the same thing no trailers are
highly produced there but these days
trailers are reviewing more and more
like understand or disagree short I
don't disagree um you know maybe there
will be a movie that comes out soon
where I care enough to not see the
trailer but Star Wars I don't know what
any more storage trailers yeah I guess
I'm with you on that even though I don't
care about services much you apparently
do uh Star Wars is a car yeah so I just
I just there's something about the
composition of the trailer and like how
much work goes into a trailer were like
I'm not sure the same kind of blood
sweat teacher goes into your next time
I'm sure plus like the proportion of
like the ratio of like a movie time to a
trailer yeah so there you have it I
don't know but yeah I mean but there you
understand that there's a large chunk of
people that just want to know everything
I don't care again that's nothing like I
don't I want to get inside the PERT the
mind of that guy the guy who's like oh
yeah give me more leak the whole thing
out like I just want to go for the
credits essentially because that's what
you're doing that's what you're setting
yourself up for ya and not only that the
more you see of a movie the more the
more and this is my opinion you could do
whatever the hell you want but the more
you the more you let yourself understand
what's gonna happen the more you form
opinions and the mail that compromises
the final experience I would much rather
go in raw for every movie possible yeah
um totally it all impacts it I have
known just in really seeing this movie
if it comes out and the rotten tomatoes
score is like 98 sure I'll even 88 you
and see it I don't know that I'd see in
the theaters of his 88th because I think
even Roberts this man of steel was
pretty high and people were just dead
like it was garbage right there's
there's times where you you you need to
see a trailer though like I need to see
my new Ghostbusters trail sure so I
watch trailers when I'm not sure about
the movie and I don't know if I want to
see it and then the second I see a
trailer and I'm like oh this is a movie
I definitely want to see for example
last night I saw the trailer for the
Johnny Depp movie where he plays Whitey
Bulger black mass and i was like well i
am in like i'm watching this movie so
now whenever I see a commercial or
whatever see another trailer I'm gonna
turn away right because I know I'm gonna
see it right it looks fantastic so I
there's definitely a value in showers I
get it one-hundred percent it's the yeah
it's this
in it two minute crap that I'm really
hoping for like again Star Wars I'm
excited about Star Wars and i think j JJ
Abrams is pretty good about keeping
things under wraps and and or at least
releasing stuff in uh in a manner that
is not offensively spoiler what what I
will say though is that JJ Abrams also
put out a trailer for that second star
trek movie and in the trailer is the
scene with the enterprise like falling
to earth yeah I don't want to know that
happens like that's in the trailer
that's a big reveal I know and it's
infuriating it sucks this movie came out
a couple years ago so I don't it's not
fun okay but that's what I'm saying is
like don't put that in there cuz my
crazy brain will be like wait we haven't
seen the enterprise fall out of the sky
you went seeing a trailer creates this
checklist in right hand exactly every
now and then you sure things like are in
the trailer or not in final film but
then you're then you're struggling with
that your mind that what time you're
watching it for the first time all right
let's go I want to talk about Mission
Impossible you saw last night so you saw
the trailer for black mass what are the
trailers you see nothing super memorable
clearly I don't yeah the black mass one
stood out I was like oh I'm definitely
seeing this movie I saw the Zoolander
trailer is it a trailer or tues it's the
teaser with you know the fake voice
robot I was named Stephen Hawking and I
don't live all right don't worry about
that mission impossible vogue nation but
it works 45 theirs was the brad bird one
was that was ghost protocol oh I didn't
see that how it so you haven't seen that
one so I've seen one two three that's it
yeah okay so this is the fifth one is
you like those Pro Ghost Protocol i get
actually today and on twitter i gave my
order which is 313 serve bet three is my
favorite i love the philip seymour
hoffman yes i think three is excellent
three is fun that's what like the the
windmills oh yeah this is even the
helicopter with the deep a wind
generating yeah thnkx yeah okay um yeah
so 3145 into good one is really good one
is quantum three
tied for me I I mean genre no other side
what's his name jump jon voight this no
estimated stand by an elevator there's
three seconds man that movie is so damn
good and it's like the perfect moment
that movie hit at the perfect time where
it was like it's just for like stuff was
like almost believable yeah but still
outrageous yeah actually I was as i was
walking over here i was listening to
that soundtrack on spotify sneaking
through music it's like I'm walking on
the street and you can't help but you
didn't feel like you're on a mission of
some sort it's fantastic to greg did
that soundtrack by the way i didn't know
that he can pose impose the score not
not originally there was an original
theme song but yeah the whole score of
the movie so good um so this new movie
and we're not gonna go with the spoilers
because i know i don't want to run it
for you I haven't seen ya um my first of
all I would say it kind of came out of
nowhere like I didn't know that they
were really working on it until the
first like marketing material Sura came
out I don't know if you saw this there's
like a stunt that Tom Cruise does that
was like a big part of the marketing
materials apparently was inspired by a
video game oh I didn't hear that maybe
think of video game inspired that stunt
ok well what I will say was nice about
that marketing material is like that
stunt happens in the first five minutes
of the movie so I was no longer like
waiting because they knew they did they
know I don't worry once we're gonna
check I can be box um so overall I was a
good movie pacing felt a little weird a
little slow at times and it kind of was
a little more serious I feel like
Mission Possible the good ones do it a
nice bounce between like goofy and
serious like there's a lot of comedic
moments especially in the later ones
good and this felt a little serious but
the biggest sticking point for me and I
think you can judge a Mission Impossible
movie based on its big ice scene because
they all have like one crazy heist they
do it's always something crazy and this
high scene was like very cg Laden and
kind of lame in my opinion oh no just
didn't really do it for me it was
okay but it just looked like it felt
very fake whereas like you think of the
best heists with you know breaking to
the CIA yes which they actually make
reference to in this movie is like an
amazing scene and it is no cgt it's like
crazy wirework and like the guy getting
diarrhea while he's having lunch
remember the guy that record yeah yeah
yeah they put the poison it is reckless
they gotta get the knockos it's amazing
and the third one has a really good the
heist in the third one in my opinion is
the when they're stealing philip seymour
hoffman from vatican city is like an
amazing high see that one again oh i
just rewatched it a couple weeks
tremendous really great um the fourth
one has the great scene in the burj
dubai jana i gotta watch that and ghost
protein this one oh we're not even gonna
talk about the second one because the
second one is dog duty it's like terror
which one is that the jumbo directed one
it starts with him a free climbing up
the rock oh right it's really Tom Cruise
credit I mean he's in shape doing it and
he's doing it yeah do majority of the
stunts he he does do a lot of the stunts
what I've heard among Hollywood is that
certain you travel in those circles read
interviews with people and certain
actors that are like action stars and
kind of feel it's obnoxious that he he
does his own stunts because you're
essentially taking the job away from
someone that would be doing those stunts
you know what I mean right like where
that's such a good point no and all
people only get commended for that right
they're never like oh yeah you're
actually removing 15 dudes job and not
only that if something goes wrong during
the stunt oh yeah that forget about like
the movies done like you're done like
yeah the Johnny stunt doubles not gonna
take your right place dramatic versions
of the movie so idiot I don't know I
mean it's impressive that he does it and
the stunts in this movie are crazy you
know that insurance policy must be I
don't yeah it's insane yeah but uh and
he's in very good shape good for him
yeah it was good I did I wasn't
disappointed that i saw it i would I
felt like I probably could have been ok
not seeing in the theater I was like
kind of that vibe um it was fine though
I don't know I one in three are just
so spectacular yeah one in the best
thing about one is it's always on I
haven't said I can always watch yeah and
it's antiquated to say legumes own to
view with this on-demand world but yeah
it's tough to look away from now yeah
all right there you have it kind of an
endorsement you're telling me I should
see it right I would say I wouldn't wait
you i would say wait okay i think it's
worth seeing but i would see for people
i didn't i liked for but I didn't like
wasn't over the moon about it people
love for okay and that was directed by
brad bird who did the incredibles and
pixar Tomorrowland but he's incredibles
and people like that so and and that is
has a lot of comedic stuff in it which I
liked I had a lot of Simon Pegg in it
for what it's worth okay so I enjoy him
a great deal um i was gonna bring up
real quick i totally forgot soccer yeah
we're gonna get into the soccer thing
and then I was thinking about more
mission impossible things oh the
director of rogue nation Chris Macquarie
I believe it's wrote the usual suspects
really really that's really interesting
i didn't know that mm-hmm i also
directed a fair amount of good stuff to
i believe if I yeah accurately recall my
Wikipedia IMDb deep dive i did on those
dude I'm not dude rather yeah he's uh
let's say I've got him a period love
that I love making those connections and
you realized stuff yeah like oh I think
that's why Simon Pegg was this guy there
well there's a lot I mean and you look
at Mission Possible three there's like a
ton of JJ Abrams normal like Felicity
what's her name the plate Felicity on
that WB show you know that which chick
she was Felicity was that that love
hewitt or is now sarah michelle gellar
was your way off i confuse all those 90s
women um anyway he had a lot of familiar
actors Chris McCrory for what it's worth
yeah so he directed he wrote edge of
tomorrow which I really like yes we we
love that film another really good
nobody saw it's funny because he hasn't
really directed huge movies he's written
a lot of good so this is the third movie
is directed he directed way of the gun
which I didn't see ya jack reacher which
was the other
x oh she's got a pre-existing regionally
and it but in terms of the movies is
written thou curry which is like real I
didn't see a people of all received
Coweta Tom Cruise stuff in here um check
the giant slayer which I think people
hate it yeah that was that uh edged with
the effects the Bryan Singer connection
yeah Bryan Singer so it's funny like
unusual suspects as you said right we're
so funny where's wonder what those
social like dinners go like a note i
love working with you tom no no no I I
want to read that no Tom let's just have
dinner we're here to talk about the
movie I love you he seems like he'd be
such an intense dude Tom Cruise oh my
god of course but everything I've heard
about ignoring the like crazy
Scientology stuff people have said any
time that they've like interacted with
him on set or whatever is great he's
like the nicest guy like super well I
want to believe that I want to believe
how you know here's why I will say
people stories about people tend to get
out right so like there's a kind of this
thing about like chris pine for example
who's Captain Kirk on the new Star Trek
and he has a bit of a rep for being not
super easy to work with even though
using wet hot he wasn't wet hot that's
true but he has a bit of a wreck a rep
and this stuff tends to get out cuz
Hollywood has so many people that work
on movies and like you say the wrong
thing to the wrong gaffer and that's
sweet and it's gonna be out there so
it's kind of nice to hear that Tom
Cruise is not super crazy maybe whole
lose the Scientology thing you know
whatever but let's put that aside as
much as that you know perks people sure
I owner of him I love the accent he is a
great act the actor Tom Cruise very
charismatic yeah I mean Minority Report
I love the sci-fi he does he can do
comedy you can do actions funny he's and
you know I'd let him leave me to Xenu
anytime any day of the week twice on
Sunday yeah speaking of Sunday's the
football season has begun but we're not
talking about American football we're
talking about the first football does
that happen on Saturdays though what
soccer I maybe I think it might i
understand i i i feel like the reason we
call soccer I know the reason I soccer
yeah is why there's the world hates us
do you know what do you know
why this is actually an impromptu
explain me like I'm five yeah why so in
England um you must do a British accent
and merry old England I we joined you
what you you physically cannot do it why
cannot do that accent and I know there's
like a long joke about you and the whole
Michael Caine thing but you can't even
try and do it you want like a real one
don't you try and do a British actor
like a genius like a normal walking down
the street British first 90 worn a merry
ol England I know Chuck not capable I
can't do a serious one I don't know you
can't be like what I love also the
problem is i frequently dive into
australian accents cuz I like I just
conflate the two all right well then
what do you want for me I want you to be
able to do it because most people I feel
like they can at least give it a college
try I'm sorry yeah give me a sentence
not i'll do it over to say okay so i'll
say something like that's stereotypical
let's say it normally don't say English
hello love okay you're looking smashing
today okay hello love you're looking
smashing today that's not the word
that's not that I'm in the Beatles any
of the Beatles ever since I'm in the
veto so long story short a parent as I
understand it and this might be
corrected on the internet but as I
understand it there was a thing called
association football and that
association football it was like the
organization that had a lot of okay
football games okay football being
soccer and association was shortened to
soccer that's where the sock comes from
Association so you understand what I'm
saying yes association was shortened to
soccer and well but there was the a yeah
whatever abbreviations do not need to
use every letter all right they called
it soccer what do you want from me got
it it was an upper-class thing it was
like a rich people thing they called it
to call it association football or
soccer was like an upper-class thing so
as a push against the upper class people
started calling it just football
was like a classist thing yeah but by
then it had already come over from
England to the US and it stuck here as a
soccer that is such a better explanation
than what did you have I don't have one
I just have like a stupid American
expectoration right so yeah we call it
soccer cuz beauty have a football it is
funny because they obviously make fun of
us all the time for calling in soccer
but it did originate yeah so it came
from a good place f you come to my place
nevertheless the reason we're talking
about soccer which is a fantastic sport
it is a lovely it is a fit like it's
like big hockey it's big hockey yes and
and the reasons I love soccer are mostly
in line with the reasons why I love hot
it's a very similar I mean almost almost
identical is a frenetic chaotic sort of
uh play style deflections close calls
goals are important lots of athleticism
logical athleticism and good looking
people and guess handsome people so
what's happening with soccer so I feel
like everyone has had this same
complaint about soccer forever generally
it happens during the World Cup because
it's the only time when the u.s. cares
about soccer but we say hey it's crap
that so much of soccer is focused on
yellow cards and red cards and people
essentially flopping there's a lot of
diving and there's like oh I touched you
like with a feather and you flew across
the few lot of diving and they're
finally seemingly going against it and
ruling against diving so the way the
ruling works is if someone has a red
card pulled against them for committing
a foul and then it's reviewed and it's
realized that the person that fell was
faking it how can you review this video
but I feel like it's easy have you ever
watched these videos of people I guess
that was the hard part was that they had
to make these calls on the spot right
but in a video you can tell you can see
the cognitive process where it's like
all right that hurt now I should fall
and it's like it's like those terrible
like stage combat things where they're
missing by like a mile but people are
like complaining about it so
retroactively so on it's retroactive and
it's not fine specific I
it might be fines but the big one is
that it's a three-game suspension who
just for any kind of incident so it they
have the scenario here Paille is sent
off for violent conduct dismissal over
termed after the referee reviews the
incident and sees that player B has
feigned an injury player B is open to a
charge and could face a three-match ban
I think that's fantastic it's smart that
this hasn't been to think so lights
crazy that it was now think about it
like all these now all the diving is
going to happen the last five minutes of
the game because there's no time to
review like what is this what you gonna
happen eight I could I don't know the
details of that specifically yeah but I
could see if they can't do reviews then
maybe it's like they certainly could
review it afterwards and say oh you're
suspended for the next three games right
because right that's interesting man I
feel like any time that anyone gets a
red card and gets thrown out for
something like that it should just be
reviewed like have someone in the box
just look at it for 30 seconds right I
understand the value of like keeping the
game moving and stuff like that I don't
want to slow it down but sure this saw
like what is the word for it sucks and
it slows the sport down it's sort of you
really discourage it a lot by doing this
sort of thing like that's fantastic you
keep things moving people stop doing it
and it's like the true form of the game
which is as you said a really good game
and I wonder if like injury time changes
yeah well right I stoppage time is very
crazy to establish time is I get the
reason for it but it's just very
confusing and yeah sure yeah there just
can't be a definitive 0 yeah like it has
to be it hacked like there just has to
be a time where you can call the game
off where the ball is not in jeopardy of
being scored well I I do like that idea
that you can't just end like if
someone's driving right you can't just
end it i would love for that to know
what ha yeah it should be like if you're
on a breakaway right 10 seconds left
yeah but hockey I think baguette by the
nature of its a small smaller and faster
yeah all right very good finally product
hunt yep game of the week product hood

check out all the games we got up there
today good man thank you tell you do a
really good job thank you i try i love
it today we have a game called cursor
tag actually a pretty neat idea so you
go on this web page and all you see is
like six or seven mouse cursors so the
arrows on the screen is just a blank
screen okay and your objective is to
click on one of the mouse cursors what
you don't know is that those most
cursors are controlled by other people
and when you click on them it takes a
photo of them with their camera it's
like snapchat so help but how like how
does that work what do you mean like you
have to have so you have to have the
camera to play you yes it requires a
camera gotcha and it you have to grant
access to use your camera when you're
playing the game and it's pretty awesome
because you're you're clicking on so and
then you see their face reacting to it
yeah like they're like you see much of
