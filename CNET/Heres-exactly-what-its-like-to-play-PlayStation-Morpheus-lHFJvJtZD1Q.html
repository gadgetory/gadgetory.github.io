Bakalar here with Scott Stein the two of
us just got to play a various amount of
morpheus demo kind of minigames on our
so let's run them down real quick the
first one we saw was this sort of
bicycle simulator thing a bicycle horse
flying simulator but when you're in
virtual reality oh it's not a bike it's
a horse you're riding a horse so that
didn't make a lot of sense to me right
that was sort of weird that they did
that it's like pedaling a horse right so
you're pedaling a horse yeah then you
fly with it you start flying with the
horse and as just like your dreams and
it's weird because you have that moment
of being jarred we're like you trying to
trying almost like lean to the side yeah
can it's a stationary bike it looks
primitive but but I thought when I
started flying it was actually
terrifying there a few things I was like
get me down off this flying horse but
then when I tried to turn I did want to
throw up long story short morris's is
weird okay so then I'm silver was super
hyper cube it was basically a 3d Tetris
yeah kind of gimmicky it looked okay
well gran and look at the cubes and get
them in the holes right what do you
think of that it was a lot like a it was
like some games I played on Nintendo 3ds
rights just like a mini game almost like
a virtual boy sort of thing yeah where
you're looking into like the the
distance it was fine it didn't do much
for me right and then finally the
headliner the getaway which was like the
sort of highway car chase where you're
shooting people on bicycle on
motorcycles and you're shooting at vins
isn't think of that that was that was
the best demo that was amazing because
you're able to open the glove
compartment right using the move
controllers and suddenly I'm picking up
a can of soda throwing out the window
grabbing the clip out of the bag popping
it in the machine gun yeah oh you would
shoot out the window and you would see
the bullet hole sort of appear on the
dashboard and then smoke would come lean
out the car door yeah door right that
was a lot of fun what tires I almost
killed my driver so here's the thing I
enjoyed that demo a great deal I don't
ever want to use Morpheus ever ever
putting on that headset you instantly
sweat and it just doesn't smell right
it's bulky it's video game peripherals I
mean it reminds me of a stuff in the
past usually those move controllers
again so it's super right in the camera
there's a lot of stuff you're setting up
are you gonna want to set that up all
the time right and the graphics are not
great please step down to run dr to step
down and also you're looking through
like a sort of a tunnel and it's also
not great in focus really didn't ever
get in full focus for me it kind of
rested over my eyes vs oculus is more
like a ski goggle where it kind of
settles a little bit more in my face so
there's a lot to consider with morpheus
we still don't know what it's finally
gonna be cold we don't know when it's
gonna be able to know how much it's
gonna cost but that's just a little
sample of what it's like to play
Morpheus that's gonna do it for Scott
and I here at e3 2015 thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
