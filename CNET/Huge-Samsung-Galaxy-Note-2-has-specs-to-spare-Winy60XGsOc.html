that you can use without a manual or one
that slips easily into your pocket then
skip over the Samsung Galaxy Note 2
completely but if you like an expansive
screen and features at every turn then
keep listening I'm Jessica's all-court
for CNN and this is your first look at
the note 2 let's start with the basics
the Galaxy Note 2 has a zippe quad-core
processor and will support 4G LTE and
HSPA+ speeds it's initially coming to
five US carriers AT&amp;amp;T Sprint t-mobile US
Cellular and Verizon costs will range
from carrier to carrier but expect
introductory prices at about $300 with a
new two-year service agreement it's a
little pricey yes but the phone also
packs in a ton of features the Galaxy
Note 2 runs Android 4.1 jelly bean and
it looks like a super-sized version of
the galaxy s3 both phones share the same
sleek lines and slim build and an 8
megapixel camera with flash both offer
storage capacity of 16 32 or 64
gigabytes with up to another 64
gigabytes in storage here's one place
where the two phones differ though the
note 2 has a gigantic 5.5 inch HD screen
that's terrific for viewing just about
everything and for creating all sorts of
stuff colors are vibrant and rich but
screen quality buffs may note that the
note twos display isn't as sharp as the
much smaller iPhone 5 and it won't look
as detailed as other smaller screens
with the same high def resolution then
there's the stylus Samsung's s-pen is
larger and square on the note 2 than it
was in the original note and that's a
good thing because it makes it more
comfortable to hold and it won't roll
around when you set it down the button
is now grooved to help guard against
miss presses but I still accidentally
pushed it anyway the S Pen brings with
it a tremendous amount of features on
top of what you already get with Android
4.1 pretty much anything you can do with
your finger you can also do with the
s-pen and it stays comfortable longer
you can use it to scroll up and down if
you have air view turned on the cursor
will
also pull-up tips and drop-down menus
and you can use it to preview photos
videos and messages in Samsung's email
app in addition to navigating around and
typing you can also handwrite into any
keyboard just by switching the settings
you can also do fun things like jot
notes on the backs of photos objectively
the writing quality is pretty darn good
on the keyboard and also in the S note
app yes your penmanship may take a hit
but the screen is sensitive to over 1000
levels of pen pressure rendering and
recognition are also fairly fast and
accurate however in practice any errors
that you or the software makes can slow
you down correcting mistakes is
frustrating and really highlights the
absence of a spell checker one of my
favorite features unfortunately isn't
part of the US version of the note 2 at
launch but hopefully we'll see it down
the road on the global model you can
press and hold the back arrow to open
two apps on a single page taking notes
or writing an email while also surfing
the web is extremely useful you won't be
able to use every app simultaneously but
Samsung is off to a good start
believe me when I say that the note 2
has heaps more features beyond what
Google brings in Android here are a few
more turning on one-handed operation to
shrink the keyboard so you can use the
phone with one hand loading on home
screen widgets through the easy mode and
transferring photos and URLs through a
theme the note 2 comes with Samsung's s
voice app but I prefer Google Voice
Actions with Google now which you can
easily access from many screens the note
2's camera and video recorder are very
good and Samsung's quad-core processor
is extremely speedy the phone's huge
3100 mAh battery kept my review phones
going all day but I still needed to
charge it at night remember that the
more features you use the faster your
battery will drain a few more thoughts
on the note to size before signing off I
won't deny that it feels as massive in
the hand as it looks but I did quickly
grow used to it and after using it for a
week I have to admit every other phone
looked tiny in comparison even though it
has a huge honkin screen the note 2 is
no tablet there's a lot you can do with
that that you may also want to do with
the tablet
so one device could satisfy both needs
depending on what it is you actually
want at the end of the day the Galaxy
Note 2 is Samsung's highest end
smartphone to date it offers some really
neat functionality that you won't find
anywhere else and the specs are
top-notch still the dimensions and s-pen
aren't going to please everyone which
makes a sort of a niche device however
if you are leaning toward the note I
think you'll like what you find
