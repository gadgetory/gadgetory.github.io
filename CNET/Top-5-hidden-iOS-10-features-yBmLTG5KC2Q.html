coming to iOS 10 like a really wacky
messages app yay but Apple kept some of
the most interesting features quiet here
are the top five hidden features in iOS
10 at number 5 iPad as a home kit hub
Apple's made a big deal that the Apple
TV can be used as your Smart Home Hub
however it did not mention that iOS 10
will allow the iPad to become a hub as
well a hub will let you control your
smart home gear when you're not at home
it looks like Apple understands that
your iPad may be less mobile than your
iPhone at number 4 control center with
3d touch Apple's control center bring
some nifty new features in iOS 10 we saw
it will feature more than one page
including a dedicated music panel and a
panel for Apple's new smart home app
control center will also include new 3d
touch functions when you 3d touch the
flashlight you'll get brightness options
when you 3d text the camera app you'll
get options for recording a video or
taking a selfie unfortunately a 3d touch
on the upper settings like Wi-Fi does
nothing fix that Apple fix it and number
three Maps knows where you parked in iOS
10 apples Maps app can mark where you
park your car on a map if your trip does
not end at your home location the Maps
app will do this automatically the Maps
app will even give you directions back
to your car number to optimize storage
and music during WWDC Apple explain a
new optimized storage feature in mac OS
sierra mac OS would automatically move
files to the cloud to free up space on
your Mac but did you know there's an
optimized storage feature for music in
iOS 10 if your iphone is low on space it
can remove music that you have not
played in a while you can choose to
allocate from 4 gigabytes to 32
gigabytes for music at number one being
able to delete apple's apps there's been
a lot of excitement about being able to
get rid of apple's apps from iOS 10 so
here's the real deal on this feature
apple senior vp craig federighi says
those apps are not really being deleted
instead you're removing user data
and hooks we're all hoping is that this
is just the first step and that maybe by
the time I OS 10 rolls around later this
year we'll have the ability to use non
apple apps as our default apps it'd be
amazing but I don't know if it's going
to happen get more top 5s at top five to
calm amaya's acts are and I'll see you
online I will I'm watching you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
