along that's so dramatically convenient
it lands on every kitchen counter some
of America's favorites have been the
microwave the slow cooker and oh yeah
the turkey roaster there in the
Westinghouse Electric roaster America's
favorite you've never tasted such a
delicious turkey as this electric
roaster turns out let's get the lid off
this electric roaster look it has a
glass panel in it so that you can peek
through if you want to watch the turkey
roasting the next game-changer could
replace a lot of those space hogging
appliances it's called the multicooker
it's a steamer a pressure cooker a slow
cooker a saute and a sous-vide machine
it's designed to be an all-in-one device
so that you can save space and use it to
make dishes that use multiple cooking
methods it's kind of futuristic and this
device takes it one step further it's
called the instant pot smart we're going
to make honey soy glazed chicken it's a
recipe that normally requires a few
different pots and pans for sauteing and
braising so we're going to do it all in
the instant pot except instead of
manually controlling the pot I'm going
to create a script the script is a
series of commands that the instant pot
will automatically follow for this
recipe I want to saute for seven minutes
then pressure cook for nine minutes and
finally saute again for five more
minutes
start the recipe
your glorious glorious
whoo Wow the script worked as planned
and the chicken was super tender but
making scripts isn't for everyone and
learning to use any multicooker is kind
of like learning to cook all over again
it takes some studying but once you get
the hang of it you might find yourself
using all your other appliances a lot
less
