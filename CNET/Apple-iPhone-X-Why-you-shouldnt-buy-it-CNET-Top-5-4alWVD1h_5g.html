buy the new Apple iPhone 10 apples just
announced three new iPhones but we're
going to focus mainly on the tenth a
word of warning this is a preliminary
list based on what we saw at Apple's
event things could change when we get to
fully test the new iPhone and number
five is gestures with the death of the
home button on the iPhone 10 you'll have
to learn new ways to call up
multitasking closing apps and calling up
Siri that may be confusing at first
which could make the 10th a bit less
attractive as an option at number four
the design this is controversial to be
sure the iPhone 10 has a notch on the
top of its screen now with its OLED
display the area surrounding the top
notch won't stand out too much when it's
black but when it's white the knotch
becomes very visible maybe Apple should
have just cut off those two bunny ears
and kept a more standard look number
three is the weight it's the latest and
greatest iPhone right but Apple said the
iPhone 10 would ship starting November
3rd that's a lot later than when the
iPhone 8 arrives and by that point
Google's latest pixel is expected to be
announced as well can you manage to
weight those excruciating days and
number two touch ID is gone
the iPhone 10 got rid of its fingerprint
sensor in favor of new technology called
face ID touch ID was an excellent
implementation of a fingerprint sensor
to the point every other fingerprint
sensor was compared to it apple says
face ID will be very secure and we'll be
able to recognize you even if you change
your appearance so far it's unproven so
this could put the pause on pre ordering
for now and at number one is the price
the Apple iPhone 10 starts at $9.99 for
the 64 gigabyte model you could buy five
new Apple TVs or two of the Apple watch
series three for that price the tenth
pricing goes all the way up to one
thousand one hundred and forty nine
dollars for the 256 gigabyte model then
again this is Apple's future phone right
what you expect remember this is a list
for those of you looking for reasons not
to preorder just yet the iPhone 10 still
looks pretty interesting in fact check

10 over at top 5 dot cnet.com
