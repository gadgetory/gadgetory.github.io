will still need an iphone to work
according to Bloomberg sources apple's
next apple watch will not include
cellular connectivity why not the report
says the problem lies in the cell chips
themselves they just eat up too much
battery life the next Apple watch is
expected later this year will reportedly
include gps and better health tracking
these points are in line with previous
predictions made by KGI Securities
analyst ming-chi kuo earlier in August
however the Bloomberg report adds some
more details Apple's goal is to untether
the Apple watch from its iPhone and the
company plan to accomplish this by the
end of 2016 that window seems to have
moved to 2017 also Apple has been under
pressure by wireless carriers to
introduce a cellular enabled Apple watch
Apple's been in talks with mobile
carriers in the US and Europe to support
the Apple watch so what would a data
plan for a watch look like if i had to
guess the plans would likely look like
the wireless plans for ipads in the US
one gigabyte of data costs about twenty
dollars on the two biggest wireless
carriers Apple is rumored to hold an
event on September 7th maybe we'll find
out on that day or not that's it for
