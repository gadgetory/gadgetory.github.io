mysterious Moto X phone I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update the
next big smartphone that everyone's
buzzing about is the Moto X and although
it has not officially been unveiled yet
Google's chairman Eric Schmidt has been
seen using it Schmidt was spotted using
the upcoming Motorola phone at a media
conference this week so you know that
was no accident they're just trying to
build up buzz on this new model all
motorola has said so far about the phone
is that it'll be customizable and based
on reports that likely means you'll get
to pick from several colors Google which
now runs the mobile division of Motorola
is said to be pumping in five hundred
million dollars into marketing this
phone which will be coming to the four
major US carriers and that's according
to The Wall Street Journal and according
to documents posted to the blog
phonearena the Moto X could go on sale
in August sprint has launched new
unlimited talk text and data plans
customers can now purchase unlimited
voice and texting for fifty dollars a
month but data is separate if you want
unlimited data it costs another thirty
dollars per phone line so if you have
one smartphone that starts at about
eighty dollars a month for everything
unlimited and that's much cheaper than
sprint's previous unlimited plan more 4k
televisions are hitting the market LG is
rolling out new 55 and 65-inch Ultra HD
televisions to go along with its massive
84 inch model this ultra high-def is a
resolution that has so many pixels is
the equivalent of four 1080p screens in
height and length and that's why it's
sometimes called 4k but with new
technology don't expect it to come cheap
the 55 inch LG model starts at seven
thousand dollars and the 65 inch model
is 8 grand but even if you do splurge on
a 4k TV movies and shows in Ultra HD
will be hard to come by if you haven't
signed into your yahoo account for the
past 12 months well then you're going to
lose your username for anyone who hasn't
signed into the site or their yahoo mail
by 1159 p.m. pacific time on july
fourteenth yeah
who is freeing up those account names so
other people can claim them basically if
you didn't use it you lose it now the
big concern here is with security since
so many people tie their logins and
password recovery reminders into their
email addresses but yahoo said it has a
process to safeguard against that so
data doesn't end up in the wrong hands
for example yahoo said before releasing
an unused account it would unsubscribe
that email from some services and
newsletters that your tech news update
