station extreme AC and 1900 dd-wrt n ex
T while it's Ralph in Buffalo now this
one has a second from the same company
that come pre-loaded with the open
source firmware called dd-wrt but I like
the previous one this one here comes
with a special build up that firmware
call and XT that supposedly worked
better with the router with better
stability now stable it might be but
that's downside to that because the NXT
firmware does not have all the features
and setting foul in the generic version
of the dd-wrt firmware and that's not
all with the Buffalo here the firmware
actually character crippled the router
for example the port right here is
report on the front and on the back here
they don't work yet and also there's a
button down here to chain the rarest
role for my router to a media bridge to
an access point doesn't work either and
that's because the firmware on inside
does not support those port and button
yet now admire might not support them in
the future but right now these port here
are just basically useless also when I
log into the web interface of the
firmware in fidi that there's not many
features and there's a huge like of
depth interval customization a for
example you cannot even view all the
connected client and if you want to add
one or two client to the IP reservation
list you have to manually Phi and type
in the mac address for each client in
short if you're a fan of dd-wrt for its
vast amount of features and crazy level
of customization well don't be too
excited about this Buffalo router here
but it's not a compass loss it has quite
a nice design here and over here is a
door that opened up to the place where
you can use it to mount the route on the
wall angle Phi the default setting that
allows you to use it right away and my
testing is performed quite well slightly
about the average of AC 1900 routers on
the market is range or than the best
about how to 60 feet away but it did
have very stable Wi-Fi signal working
for days
an end without disconnecting even once
so to be fair this one could still make
a great router if it caused hundred
dollars also unfortunately it costs
double that $200 make it quite expensive
and not a good deal at all because you
can get many other similar error for
much less in fact and get the exact same
one here from Buffalo without the open
source firmware 470 dollars still
expensive but unless all the ports and
button will work so I'm not sure what
the deal is with the Buffalo here from
all this one and check out my phone with
us cnet com basically it's not a bad
router quite good one actually which is
too expensive for what it has to offer
and put this way it's so liking that the
 I'm touching it right now when I
make it any better and I have very
appealing touch and that's because i'm
dumb going this has been the first look
at the Air Station extreme AC 1900
dd-wrt and xt wires router go buffalo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
