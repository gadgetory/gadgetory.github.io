welcome to Google issues for everything
google that we could pack inside of a
show each week so let's get to it now
lots of google news this week and we
start off with the chromecast the googs
recently announced a public sdk for
their digital media streaming stick
allowing developers to build support for
casting and android chrome and even iOS
apps and websites now the chromecast
already supports the main services like
Netflix Hulu HBO Go and Pandora and
recently announced support for Plex and
a few others but it's still pretty slim
pickings compared to the roku and Apple
TV and this is going to help bring more
content to the table very very soon now
Google glass is growing up fast while we
wait for its official launch after they
unveiled for new frames from what they
called a titanium collection they are
super light frames made out of guess
what titanium to counter the weight of
the google glass add-on and are
compatible with prescription lenses now
the glass hardware will be able to
attach the side with a single screw and
two different clip on sunglasses will be
available as well so you could look even
cooler in the clubs or not now the
frames will also be covered by vision
care provider VSP they're available
through google for 225 and the stunna
shades will be one hundred fifty dollars
and that's without the glass system now
the g unit also has released five new
minigames for glass in hopes that
developers will be inspired to create
games for the system they include tennis
balance clay shooter matcher and shape
slicer gaming with glass looks kind of
coolant it would be pretty simple at
first because of the available screen
real estate but i would advise not
playing any of these in the public if
you want to meet normal friendly people
or just women and following up on
google's mystery barge project that Cena
was the first to get the scoop on and
has been speculated to be everything
from a google glass retail store or an
interactive space to learn about tech to
even a party boat for events while a
california state agency says google must
move its mystery barge from its
construction site on Treasure Island
because it doesn't have the right
permits now once the project was
revealed construction has been going off
in
on Google can resume activities by
moving the barge to a fully permitted
construction facility in the San
Francisco Bay but then it would be
easier to see what they're actually
doing which Google doesn't want see
gooks it actually does kind of suck when
you have someone looking over your
shoulder knowing what you're basically
doing at all times when you don't want
them to and since our last show you
probably heard that google recently sold
motorola mobility a group they acquired
in 2011 and is now selling it to lenovo
42.9 1 billion dollars lenovo will use
the acquisition and motorola name to
continue their strong push into the
smartphone market that has been a
success overseas one piece that was not
part of the deal was the advanced
technology and projects group that will
remain with Google's Android team now
this is the group most well-known for
the project are a modular phone and it's
a concept that we've been excited to see
come together and the good news is that
the group will continue their work and
other projects like security tattoos and
biotech sensors I actually have one of
these tattoos but I can't show it to you
because my mom watches the shoe all
right let's check out some quick hits
buya the android based gaming console
will bring a new 16 gig 129 dollar model
that's double the storage in the color
matte black and will also bring improved
Wi-Fi performance improvements and
controller enhancements as well the
console was received with lukewarm
reviews in the game library really needs
to significantly improve to make it a
compelling purchase so we'll see what
they're up to also HTC's new flagship
phone the m8 has been outed by the ever
so reliable eveleigh for a late March
release with the launch in New York City
now remember sites have been pointing to
Mobile World Congress in February so
we'll have to wait and see how that
shakes out and some more cool League
shots of the red nexus 5 iphone i
actually want to get my hands on with an
internal notice from sprint that says we
could see it on februari the fourth now
it's the perfect gift and the colour of
love for that someone special on
valentine's day and who gets a new
smartphone for someone on Valentine's
Day i'm guessing the same people who buy
someone a car for christmas so all right
guys you may not get a phone but Google
Isha's is going to hook you up with some
killer cases from our friends expect
products for the samsung galaxy s4 and
the HTC One now
have three cases for each phone do the
math that six winner winner chicken
dinners all you guys have to do is tell
me what picture I used in last week's
episode when I talked about Samsung's
Galaxy glass plans because I care email
me at Google issues at cnet com or tweet
me up brian Tong and will randomly pick
and announce the winners next week
that's going to do it for this week's
show thanks so much for watching i'm
brian Tong and we'll see you guys next
