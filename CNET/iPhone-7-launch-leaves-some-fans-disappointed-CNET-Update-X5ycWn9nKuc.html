this year's global launch was a bit sour
for some fans Apple did not have any
iPhone 7 plus models in stock as stores
and apple also announced that stores
would not be carrying the smaller iPhone
7 in the jet black color the diminished
supply led to diminish lines at stores
around the world and some super fans
that waited four days said they were
disappointed that they didn't get the
model they wanted the larger 7 plus was
the popular one to get this year because
it has a better dual lens camera Apple
said it's sold out of the plus during
pre-orders one person in line at New
York's flagship Apple store left
empty-handed after waiting for two weeks
all because they didn't have the one he
wanted meanwhile Samsung Note 7 owners
are still dealing with the
disappointment of not being able to use
their phones because they will explode
the US Consumer Product Safety
Commission issued an official recall on
Thursday for all note 7 phones Samsung
announced it would have replacement Note
sevens in stores by Wednesday September
21st but it turns out people are
ignoring the warnings and still using
their note 7 phones data collected from
the app development company apt elegent
salt activity from note 7 phones
continued unchanged
I know phones are an important part of
our lives but come on just ask your
carrier for a replacement phone when the
fixed note 7s do arrive you'll know if
it has a safe battery by looking at the
blue s sticker near the barcode that's
it for this tech news update I'm Bridget
