extrude and 3d printer for monoprice but
before we get to it let's find out
quickly about 3d printing it's quite
simple
now here is my second cup of coffee for
the day is not very good but no worry I
have this right here and take a look
voila issue is better now but most
importantly I just printed a 3d object
on top of the cup now the same idea with
this printer you of course a lot more
complicated the preacher has a preacher
hat right here it comes with a dual
extruder now doesn't mean it can work
with two material at the same time now
in the back here there are two spool of
pre material called filaments like and
why they are also one of different cars
that you can buy these are basically
easily melted fast congeal plastic
string the string goes through this tube
right here into one of the extruder
where it got heated and melt and then
comes down on the plate below here
called the build platform now s is
coming down the pretty head your move
around and hands form the 3d object
underneath now that's how simple in that
but 3d printing can be very
time-consuming and intimidating now the
machine here for example is look nice
but it's not because I will put together
have the Box you actually have to
assemble part of it it's very similar to
buying furniture from Ikea now the
hardest part is the calibration or
basically make the platform right here
the BIM platform to stay in a perfect
position two things number one have to
be completely level number two we have
to be just a little bit away from the
pretty head about not too far not too
close now you can use the control panel
here right here would be the navigation
button to help with the calibration
process and there are three screw
underneath the platform for you to
adjust the high-end detail now the
second hard part is the software it's
very fragmented the printer here used
open-source software and it required two
pieces first is the replicator G which
is the print software and the second is
Python now we have to install those
separately and after they have to
actually configure replicator G to work
with Python now one that installed the
replicator G actually very powerful
software is allows you to view many too
late and print 3d objects now it takes a
long time to bring a 3d object for
example these Yoda guys right here it
takes an hour and a half to finish or
this iPhone 4 case right here 2 hours
obviously the largest object and the
more complicated is the long it takes to
print the printer connects to a computer
using a USB port on the back here but it
also come with an SD card slot the card
right here hidden inside actually allows
you to print without a computer that's
very helpful because the print process
can take hours and if you use a computer
for the printing and the computer go to
sleep mode the print is a fail before I
could bring something nice like this
thing right here I have to go through a
pile of fail right here and this
actually took hours so basically for
most of you I think for now if you just
stick with playing with the whipped
cream but if you're up to the challenge
of this emerging technology the motor
price is actually a really cool and fun
machine to have and I think it's worth
the current price of $1,200
would you actually cheaper than some
computing model I'm all the printer here
check out my full review at cnet.com by
the way all these right here is art
because I made it and that's because I'm
dumb more and this has been the first
look as the dual extrusion 3d printer
from monoprice and you know pretty good
next time I skip it entirely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
