headquarters CEO Mark Zuckerberg put an
end to some persistent rumors today
we're finally going to talk about that
Facebook phone um or more accurately
we're going to talk about how you can
turn your Android phone into a great
simple social device with its new
product that's only available on certain
Android phones the social network makes
a grab at precious real estate on your
mobile device the home screen is really
the soul of your phone you look at it
about a hundred times a day it sets the
tone for your whole experience and we
think that it should be deeply personal
facebook home transforms your home
screen even if your phone is locked into
a slideshow of photos and status updates
showing you your newsfeed without ever
launching the facebook app if you're not
a rabid facebook user then you might
find that this experience kind of
hijacks your phone and offers up a
learning curve that you have to overcome
in order to use it with another feature
chat heads messaging also infiltrates
your phone buttons with the sender's
profile picture pop up no matter which
app you're currently using just by
tapping on this chat head it pops me
into the conversation and think that's
so cool and so special about this is
that this is all happening right over
the article I'm about to read and write
over the app I'm using so no matter
Facebook home isn't an operating system
but it does change your phone enough to
make you relearn what you know about
using Android it still needs some work
but if you want to get facebook home a
shot here are five tips to help you
navigate this new interface the Facebook
home comes a new set of gestures you'll
use to navigate the system let's start
at the main screen the cover feed when
you wake your phone up notifications
will be stacked here you can swipe away
a notification like this or if you have
a bunch tap and hold one then swipe them
all away chat heads are controlled with
similar gestures by now you probably
know you can move them around the screen
but to get rid of a chat head tap and
hold then drag it down to the X you can
also do this for multiple chat heads now
in the cover feed you'll notice that
photos are cropped you never see the
entire picture as you browse around to
see the full crop of a photo just tap
and hold it to make life easier facebook
home combines your texts and your
facebook messages into one central place
here's how it works grab your profile
pic and swipe left to get to messenger
to send a new facebook message or an SMS
tap the plus button as i type someone's
name i have the option here to send them
a facebook message but if i want to send
a text i'll choose their name in this
list down here if you're texting
Facebook home will use whatever photo
you upload it to their contact info on
your phone in the chat head cover feat
is great but when it's plastered all
over your lockscreen it can be a little
overkill thankfully there's an easy way
to get your regular android lock screen
back from home tap the Menu button hit
settings and uncheck this option here
exit that lock your phone and you're
welcome you got your lock screen back in
that same settings window there are a
couple more things worth adjusting first
know that you have the option here to
show or hide the android status bar if
you hide it you can still access it by
swiping down from the top at any time
but you won't always have a quick view
of your phone status and the time most
important though is this data use in
image quality setting these options high
medium and low let you control the image
quality on the cover feed but it also
determines the amount of data you use
the high setting for example will pull
more data refreshing the cover feed
often and delivering high-quality photos
so if you're worried about saving on
data choose the medium or low option the
best thing about facebook home is that
it's not your operating system since
it's a launcher you can enable and
disable it whenever you want back in
settings turn off facebook home and
confirm now when you hit your phone's
HOME button you'll get this warning
basically your phone is asking you if
you want to use the Facebook home
interface or the regular Android one tap
launcher the Android one hit always and
Facebook home will disappear when you're
ready to enable it again just launch
facebook home but choose home as the
option when you get this message here
the most important thing to remember
about facebook home is that it's brand
new so as time goes on expect to see
updates to this interface and hopefully
some extra options for customizing it
until then hit me up on twitter with any
of your questions and check out how to
sina com for more tips like this for
cnet I'm Sharon Vaknin
you
Facebook you love it you hate it it's
complicated but in spite of the wild
popularity of Facebook I kind of feel
bad for them aside from their disastrous
IPO this company has released more dud
products over the past few years than
anyone I can think of I'm Donald Bell
and today's show I'm here to refresh
your memory with my list of the top five
Facebook product flops features that set
out to change the world but didn't at
all starting things off at number five
Facebook Lite now this was a
stripped-down version of Facebook that
was engineered to load more quickly for
users on slow connections or slow
hardware they tossed out the apps it
toss out the games they be cluttered the
whole interface oh and they also tossed
out a bunch of those annoying flash
based ads on the sidebar those are the
crazy pre-ipo days of 2009 turns out
that catering to poor people and serving
less ads wasn't a project worth keeping
around after less than a year Facebook
Lite got switched off at number 4
Facebook questions with 1 billion users
at your disposal why not put them to
work solving life's great questions
launched in 2010 and killed off in 2012
Facebook questions gave users a way to
pull their friends for questions like
where it's the best pizza in portland
ore which planet eh sequel is the best
or where the hell did Facebook questions
go it's supposed to be a fatal blow to
yahoo answers but instead of just kind
of withered away at number 3 the ticker
in 2011 Facebook that a major overhaul
their news feed and gave us a terrifying
and very annoying little window onto all
of our friends likes and shares and
comments it was like peering into the
naked soul of Facebook and seeing its
neuroses for what it really was and
people hated that thing so Facebook
quickly saw the error of their ways and
gave us a way to hide it please hide it
do yourself a favor
awful coming in at number two Facebook
deals oh this is a time when Mark
Zuckerberg had the huevos to take on
groupon and livingsocial I have to admit
it kind of seemed like a good idea who
better than Facebook to know where you
live what you like and where you like to
travel but maybe it was a little too
perfect a little too perfect not to be
creepy after four months Google deals
got slashed now before we get to number
one let's stop picking on Facebook for a
minute you know another internet giant
makes a ton of mistakes Google here are
my favorite five Google flops all of
which are really just as embarrassing as
anything Facebook is done that said at
least google has that whole don't be
evil mission statement thing Facebook
could have used that to help prevent
them from thinking up number one beacon
hey here's an idea let's make it so that
Facebook can keep track of all the sites
you browse outside of Facebook so that I
can share that information with all of
your friends what could go wrong not
creepy at all the idea was such an
affront to privacy that resulted in the
class action lawsuit and even Mark
Zuckerberg later admitted it was a
mistake which is not to say that he
won't try it again so there you have it
five ideas launched by the king of
social networks that will end up right
in the gutter more top fives like this
head over to top five cnet com Donald
Bell thanks for watching
today we began rolling out some new
controls to make it simpler for you to
control what you share on Facebook these
changes are a direct result of the
feedback many of you have shared with us
about our recent product launches I
wanted to share some of my thoughts with
you about how Facebook is evolved and
how what we're doing now gives you more
control when I started Facebook it was
built around a few simple ideas people
want to share and stay connected with
their friends and the people around them
when people have control over what they
share they're comfortable sharing more
when people share more the world becomes
more open and connected and in a more
open world many of the biggest problems
we face together will become easier to
solve a lot has changed on Facebook
since then but these core principles
remain true today we started Facebook in
a college dorm more than six years ago
and over time Facebook has become less
about colleges and more about sharing
lots of content with different groups of
people along the way we needed new
privacy controls and features to make
that possible a little more than a year
ago we began work on a big set of
changes to have sharing and privacy work
on Facebook we recognize that we've
changed a lot of things so we've spent a
lot of time reviewing your feedback so
we could address your concerns the
number one thing we've heard is that
there just needs to be simpler ways to
control your information we agree so
today we started rolling out three new
things to address this first we built
one simple master control that you can
use to set who can see all of the
content you share on Facebook and one
click you can set all the content that
you've ever posted to everyone friends
of your friends or just your friends no
need to go through multiple settings
anymore once you set the master control
it will apply to all new products
through release going forward and if you
prefer more granular controls for
specific types of content you can still
use those settings we haven't removed
anything in this update we've just added
a simple master switch to control all of
your content at once second we've
reduced the amount of information that
has to be visible to everyone in oh
to use Facebook you no longer have to
have your friends and your pages open to
everyone you can set those fields to be
visible to whoever you want third we've
made it simple to control whether
applications and websites can access any
of your information many people enjoy
playing games and using applications but
for those of you that don't we've added
the ability to turn off platform
applications completely so none of your
information is ever accessible to
applications or websites we've also
simplified the control for turning off
instant personalization on our partner
sites you can read more details about my
thoughts on this topic in a blog post
that I wrote today most importantly
though please check out the new privacy
page yourself when it launches for you
note that the new controls will be going
live gradually so you may not see them
right away when you do play around and
find the settings that feel right for
you on a personal note I just turned 26
a few days ago as I look back to when I
started Facebook I'm amazed at how its
evolved and have so many of you are
using it to stay connected all around
the world we've been through a lot of
changes together and we'll keep learning
and we'll keep working hard to build the
best service for you and for the world
so I just want to say thanks you've all
made facebook what it is today at an
event held at facebook headquarters CEO
mark zuckerberg put an end to some
persistent rumors today we're finally
going to talk about that Facebook phone
um or more accurately we're going to
talk about how you can turn your Android

messaging also infiltrates your phone
buttons with the sender's profile
picture pop-up no matter which app
you're currently using just by tapping
on this chat head it pops me into the
conversation and think that's so cool
and so special about this is that this
is all happening right over the article
I'm about to read and write over the app
I'm using so no matter what you're doing
you can just quickly pop into these
conversations a phone was unveiled but
Facebook isn't jumping into hardware the
new HTC first will be pre-loaded with
Facebook home this is not a fancy phone
it doesn't have whistles and bells it's
not particularly pretty to see it
doesn't have fancy accents or anything
like that I think it's going to be a
really tough sell the only nice thing is
the price the phone will run a hundred
dollars but Facebook addicts might
consider the device priceless in San
Francisco I'm Sumi das cnet.com for CBS

in at number 2 facebook deals oh this is
a time when Mark Zuckerberg had the
huevos to take on groupon and
livingsocial I have to admit
kind of seemed like a good idea who
better than Facebook to know where you
live what you like and where you like
and causes that move the world forward
in a significant way it's a place to be
inspired by the boundaries that we
thought existed but don't it's a place
for laughter I love this slide to enjoy
things the simple things in life and
it's a place for love it's our
collective belief that the world is
better off captured and shared more
permanently that's what Instagram is you
see Instagram is no single thing it's a
collection of ideas and inspiration best
captured and share it and that's why I
to us our mission is to capture and
share the world's moments and we live
that every single day we come to work
because we believe by doing that we make
the world a better place it's really
important to us we've been at this now
for a little over two and a half years
and it's come a long way so right now
I'd like to tell you a little bit about
how far it's come first sixteen billion
photos have been shared on instagram
that's a lot of pictures of coffee and
there's some other stuff too we have an
active and engaged community with over a
billion likes every single day that's
billion with a be tons of engagement
happening every single day across
accounts like athletes aspiring chefs
actors it's where people come together
to engage with each other it's not just
about photos it's about coming together
and staying connected and now 130
million people use Instagram every
single month that's amazing growth for
service that's only been around for a
couple of years and what's inspiring
about this is that these are people just
like you and me coming together to share
the world in real time this is really
significant
so I've talked to you about what
Instagram is where we were where we are
but now we should discuss where we're
going if we're about capturing and
sharing the world's moments what's next
what do we work on we've taken photos
and made them beautiful we've connected
people from all different countries
around the world all different cultures
what do we work on next I'm going to
tell you a story and that story is sep
tember of 2010 mike my co-founder and i
were sitting in front of a white board
pondering what's next to entrepreneurs
not really sure knowing what to do
what's next we were working on a small
location sharing app called bourbon and
as part of bourbon you could share your
location and the two parts of sharing
our location we're posting a photo and
posting a video we decided that we
needed to do something new so we created
Instagram out of bourbon the one part
that we brought was photos but we left
video on the side why is that because we
said the three things we want to be
really good at our speed simplicity and
beauty and i'll tell you at the time two
years ago with the devices as they were
speed simplicity and beauty we're
definitely possible with photos but it
was really hard with video today that
all changes and instagram is going to be
at the center of it i'd like to
introduce video on instagram
I'm really excited about this
announcement not because of how hard the
teams worked yes that's important not
because of how awesome this product is
yes that's important but because 130
million people day one are going to have
access to video in the way that they
have access to pictures so I want to
talk to you about three things we
focused on before actually showing you
the product first is simplicity
simplicity really matters in these
products okay video is a complex medium
we're used to seeing complex editing
interfaces it's hard to edit it's hard
to manage it's hard to upload so if it's
going to work inside of Instagram that
everyone knows for its simplicity it's
got to be perfect I'm so proud of our
team for working on an awesome product
that gets there the second part is it
wouldn't be Instagram without being
beautiful that is it wouldn't be
Instagram without allowing you to
produce beautiful content we need to do
to video what we did to photos and it's
got to fit in I've got some really
special stuff in store to show you the
last part and I touched on this briefly
before and the way that makes Instagram
so different from anything else in the
world is the community day 1 130 million
people with access to recording the
world's moments as they happen in real
time that's staggering so let's take a
look you'll notice Instagram hasn't
changed we have our feed here I'm going
to walk through a demo now what we've
done is make Instagram better so first
you tap on the capture button in the
middle of the tab bar and let's say we
were at blue bottle coffee in the city
and we wanted to record a moment there
now what you'll notice is it's the same
screen but now you've got a video icon
in the bottom right everyone's trying to
see I love it we'll move that up next
time so you tap the video icon and all
of a sudden you go into video mode slide
over you've got
a separate capture button all you have
to do is hold down the button to start
recording video so let's do that so
let's say we're at blue bottle coffee
they're using a Japanese siphon machine
to make some really beautiful coffee but
I'll tell you you can capture a lot in
15 seconds which is what we did 15
seconds of video it's the right balance
between not too short that constrains
your creativity and not too long where
you end up having to wait a lot of time
for something to download it's 15
seconds of beautiful video that you can
record very easily but not all the time
can you fit a single scene into 15
seconds without going to multiple clips
and we've heard loud and clear from the
community that's what they want so let's
go back and actually record our first
clip so we're recording our first clip
here of the bris tableau bottle now we
want to add some color of pulling a shot
of espresso this is making me thirsty so
we see the next shot of pulling some
espresso and then finally let's see the
Bristol pouring a beautiful latte so
here we are pouring the beautiful latte
and I'm recording it by holding down
that button but you know what his hands
in the way and that's not good so what
we've allowed you to do is very simply
get rid of that last clip or frankly get
rid of any clip all we got to do is
touch the little delete button in the
bottom left it highlights little bit
last clip and deletes it so let's
rerecord that last one to get a better
collage here we are with the beautiful
finished latte and let's just focus on
the latte itself now we're done
recording and this is a great video that
I want to share with my friends so I
click Next and this is where it gets
exciting as of today 13 brand-new custom
filters designed for video only what we
realized very early on is that the
filters we had for photos were great for
photos they really make her photos look
beautiful but we needed something new
for video we wanted to evolve so we
partnered with an artist who specializes
in video filters and we created 13
brand-new gorgeous filters to turn your
video into something
beautiful this is really special so
let's show you as we go through you can
select from any one of the filters all
new names we choose one and then all of
a sudden we can see the effect and
decide what we want to do based on the
playback I'm scrolling through here and
I'm trying to decide what looks best and
you know what the Vesper looks awesome I
really like the look of this latte let's
just go with that so I'm going to click
Next one other innovation that happened
here and I want to talk to you about a
problem with mobile video is that when
you see a mobile video and a feed often
the frame you see is the first frame of
the video we think that's silly it
should be the frame you want to show
your friends because if I see this frame
and a feed I might not want to tap and
watch but as we scroll through we can
decide you know what my friends are
going to be way more excited about
watching this video if they get to see
the really cool latte so when I click
Next you'll see the preview this is what
people are going to see in the feed it's
a beautiful cover frame that I've
decided and it's a little touch it's an
Instagram touch these are the little
details that make all the difference so
as per normal I can fill out my my
caption that I want my friends to see
hashtags work just the same way this is
the same Instagram we all know and love
but it moves you can add to a photo map
you can name your location or share it
to your favorite social network it's as
simple as that and with that we upload
in the background and before you know it
it's available for all your friends to
see 130 million people everywhere today
are going to be working on this taking
videos of everyday moments and sharing
them with their friends that's really
powerful so let's go through the feed
and take a look for a second about what
it might look like to see a video and
feed you'll notice this is the Instagram
we all know and love or scrolling
through and we come upon a video the
video is marked by an icon in the top
right my friend Josh was at a beach this
weekend and took a really beautiful
video
with a filter of some surfers going into
the water this is what we love and
expect from Instagram is just beautiful
content in the feed and then we're going
to scroll down here and we see Josh's
dog at the beach it's a cute everyone
thinks it's cute it is really cute and
actually this is the moon filter aptly
named after the dog moon we love naming
our filters so it plays once it doesn't
loop it doesn't get in the way it fits
right into Instagram all the details are
right as you scroll down and you lift up
your finger it starts playing
immediately we've worked a ton on making
it fast simple and beautiful I'm really
excited about this product and I think
the world is going to be as well so to
recap 15 seconds a beautiful video clip
by clip 13 custom designed filters that
make your videos gorgeous what we did to
photos we just did to video select a
cover frame to make sure that everyone
in the world can see what you're trying
to show them and finally it shows up on
your profile just like photos it's as
easy and simple as that and day one
Android as well this means that all of
our users can access Instagram and it's
on the web so no more pointing people at
the mobile app to see or videos you can
simply show them your profile on the web
and it's easy to access there as well so
that's video on Instagram everything we
know and love about Instagram but it
moves and you know had we gotten this
far my team all of us here would be
really proud it would have been really
exciting because everyone has the power
of video in their hands but I don't
think we wanted to give up just there I
have some really cool stuff to show you
filters certainly help make your videos
more beautiful but we needed to go an
extra step how many of us take videos on
our camera
and think about well I remember that
beautiful sunset or I remember that
beautiful time with my friends but you
know what's all shaky and wobbly and
doesn't look that great what if you
could take video just like the pros what
if you could produce a video that you
were really proud of let's show you what
i mean by video that we wouldn't be
proud of this is a meaningful video
we're at the park you know taking videos
of our kids this is the type of video we
would all take we're sitting there and
we're trying to keep track of a kid on a
bike and it's moving but you see it's
wobbling all over the place that's not
what we want this is what we all have
grown to expect from video and that's a
sad state of affairs why because we can
do better and we did better we teamed up
with a handful of the world's leading
video scientists and created something
really awesome we call it cinema
cinematic stabilization for your videos

show you what I mean this is us

the normal video and this is cinema
