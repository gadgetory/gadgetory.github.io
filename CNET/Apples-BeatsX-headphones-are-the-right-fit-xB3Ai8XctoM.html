years but if your knife on seven owner
cutting the cord is now basically a must
so why spend $150 on the newbie techs
well for starters they're made with
Apple's w1 chip which means stronger
Bluetooth connection better range and
seamless compatibility with other Apple
devices just turn them on and start
using it's a one-click deal and it'll
never forget a pair of Beats same with
the Apple watch you'll just have to
unpair to release to other devices when
you're done and they'll they pair
wirelessly they still have a giant wire
holding them together which turns out
isn't as bad as I thought especially if
you're on the go unlike other clunkier
models the soft rubber on the beats
feels light around the neck even when
you're bobbing up and down they'll stand
around your neck all day whether you're
mid plank at the gym hitting the trails
outside or just out grabbing coffee at
one point I actually tried to break free
but I found they fit more snugly in the
ear than your average ear pods as long
as they're in all the way and they're on
the right ear because the signage is
microscopic even if you're not an in the
ear kind of person they come with a wide
range of accessories so there's a good
chance you'll find your perfect fit
adding the wingtips when I ran made me
feel more confident that they wouldn't
fall out even though I really didn't
need them sound quality is great and
they're amazing at drowning out ambient
noise but perhaps too amazing
noise cancelling is convenient at the
office or on a plane when you're out on
the street you want to remain at least
somewhat aware of incoming traffic
because they have exceptionally good
range you could leave your phone nearby
and go about your routine with full
control of your music you can pause skip
a track take a call or summon series
right from the side buttons just don't
go too far we got about a quarter of a
soccer field away from the phone before
we had connectivity issues and as I
approached the halfway point I just
can't hear anything anymore they held up
beyond the eight hours of playback time
as promised on the box but they
oftentimes didn't turn off on their own
so they could have gone even longer and
when they do run out they're super easy
to charge especially if you're already
an Apple user lightning cable that's
lightning fast you won't have to worry
about knots but dirt does seem to be an
issue so take advantage of the darker
color options to avoid having to wipe
them down
every other day most of the time I
forgot I was even wearing them they're
comfortable low maintenance and I would
argue less embarrassing looking than the
air pause but just because there's 40
doesn't mean they're cheap and at the
end of the day you're still paying over
$100 for an accessory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
