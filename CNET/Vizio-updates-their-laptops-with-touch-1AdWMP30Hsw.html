you're at CES 2013 where I'm showing off
physios new line of thin and light
laptops that's what they're calling them
you get two different sizes you get a
15.5 inch and a 14-inch you also get two
different processors to choose from
there is an intel core i7 the latest
generation and the latest generation of
AMD processors so you can take your pick
on either one of those some other cool
specs here you get solid state storage
just as a default option here you're
getting a newly redesigned trackpad so
that you're getting much more touch
sensitive trackpad integrates with
windows 8 since these are both windows 8
computers and because their windows 8
and touches a big part of Windows 8
they've made these both touchscreen
laptops in fact pretty much their
computing line across the board now is
all touchscreen enabled it's a pretty
attractive looking laptop it looks very
similar to the previous generation that
we saw from Vizio in 2012 but this one's
a little bit more refined they've
definitely taken the time to make it a
windows 8 kind of flagship computer here
you're getting all the bells and
whistles you want it's in that ultrabook
category but because there's you know
the distinction between the different
processors there's an AMD option and
because they're also they're running the
processors themselves at their full
voltage and not at a low voltage they
don't qualify or there's it makes that
ultrabook distinction a little bit
harder to apply here but it's a great
laptop it's gonna be a powerful laptop
and although pricing is an announced yet
it's probably going to be an affordable
option for so there you go i'm donald
bell for cnet.com here at CES 2013 show
you videos newest laptops
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
