tough situations I'm Danny Ecklund and
this is the HP Elite x2 it starts off as
an 11-point 6 inch Windows 8 tablet you
can get it with a 1366 by 768 resolution
or an upgraded 1920 by 1080 model and
like a lot of other super thin systems
that we're going to see in 2015 it run
Intel's new core M processor as part of
the new Broadwell family and while it's
not quite as fast or powerful as your
standard Core i3 or Core i5 it's meant
to run in systems that are very thin
very light and in this case like many of
them run fanless ly which is great for
keeping things quiet and cool this is a
lot more rugged than a lot of other
hybrids because it's meant for
commercial purposes they test it to some
mil spec standards and it's got things
like a TPM chip and Intel vPro
technology and a smart card slot built
into one of the keyboard bases and these
are all things that your IT department
may require even if you as an end-user
are generally not aware of them the
tablet can plug into several accessories
including two different keyboards one is
a traditional sort of clamshell bigger
tablet keyboard that has some decent
ports and connections on it the other
one is a thinner more surface like
travel keyboard there's even a whi gay
wireless docking station those had a
little black cube that makes it easy to
connect to your bigger desktop monitor a
mouse and keyboard the x2 is going to
start at 899 in the US when it's
available in late January I'm Dan Ahmed
and that's the HP Elite x2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
