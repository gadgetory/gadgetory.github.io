wireless speaker that can work with your
phone or tablet don't forget about the
most annoying wire of all the power cord
rechargeable bluetooth speakers can be a
great flexible option that you can take
with you around your house or in the
yard or even bring on vacation i'm
donald bell on today's top 5 i'll be
counting down the best options and
portable bluetooth speakers ranked by
sina editors david carr noi and matt
Muscovy ack
starting things off at number 5 the JBL
flip very affordable at $99 it's compact
delivers good sound you can also use
that as a speakerphone which is a
surprisingly rare feature you have to be
charged a thing with an AC adapter
instead of a USB cable which is kind of
a bummer
also the carrying case looks a little
scandalous try not blushing during that
baggage check or you can man up to
number 4 the JBL charge for just 50
dollars more you get bigger speakers
bigger sound double the battery life and
a USB port for charging other stuff no
speakerphone on this one but do you
really want a phone call interrupting
your Motorhead marathon I mean seriously
for $150 the JBL charge packs a mean
punch and it's cheap enough to throw in
the back of the truck without having a
heart attack coming in at number 3 the
Logitech UE boom box UE stands for
ultimate ears which is a company
Logitech acquired a few years back and
now serves as their premium audio brand
this guy takes you up to around $250 but
you get eight drivers on this thing and
it is freaking loud even have some
respectable low-end six hours of battery
life though no USB charging also no
speakerphone this one's strictly for
blasting jams and looking cool sorta but
the ultimate Bluetooth statement comes
in at number two the jawbone big Jambox
this one's also $250 but you get a
jawbone quality speakerphone and the
pride of owning something crafted by
design superstar yves behar of course
there's no amount of star power that can
make up for the fact that this thing is
about as portable as a brick it's pretty
it's not the kind of thing you want to
bring out to a barbecue
speaking of which before we get to our
number one portable bluetooth speaker
let's take a minute to acknowledge the
kind of small affordable rugged speaker
that would be perfect for a barbecue our
top pick for under $50 is the Philips
sound shooter it looks like a grenade
because it's sound is the bomb actually
now it's just okay but at 50 dollars
it's a great value works as a
speakerphone charges over USB and
doesn't look like a personal massager
you're welcome but if you want the
absolute best when it comes to portable
Bluetooth audio look no further than
number one the Bose Soundlink mobile
speaker 2 the best sound quality of the
bunch and I would argue the most
portable design because it's easy to
grip and it even has a built-in magnetic
cover that folds back into a stand the
look is a little too buttoned up for my
taste but it's an extremely practical
design but what's not practical is the
price $300 unless you can find it on
sale which you won't because it's Bose
so there you go five speakers plus one
to grow on all perfect for taking around
the house or on your next vacation but
for even more Bluetooth speaker

until next time i'm donald bell thanks
for watching
