the nike hyperadapt 1.0 it's nike
self-lacing shoes that marries my two
passions Tech and sneakers and yes you
can also call it a wearable now this is
how it works a sensor in the heel
detects the position of your foot and a
weight on it inside the shoe a lacing
engine at the bottom of the shoe that's
completely protected wines Nikes fly
wire around your foot it's called their
fit system Nikes fly wire is a thread
composed of nylon and it's been used on
other nike shoes to minimize weight and
maximize support now it's also being
used in the hyperadapt 1.0 you might not
realize it but Nike has always been a
tech company creating new materials and
features for shoes like its most popular
nike air and countless others now you
can tighten the shoe by pressing the top
bun and you can loosen it by pressing
the lower one you can also set a custom
preset by pressing both buttons for the
perfect tension that you want the
sensation of a shoe lacing on its own is
just awesome it's something that's never
been done and you know what they're
doing it the hyperadapt 1.0 holds a
two-week charge you can check the
battery status by pressing a button
animals load different colors and yes
there will always be a bit of reserve
power left to get the shoes off if
you're at the very end too charging
pucks connect magnetically to the bottom
of the shoe and will take you only three
hours for a full charge there's also
some cool design elements and a story
with these shoes thanks to Nikes
legendary designer Tinker Hatfield the
shoe is named Earl which stands for
electro adaptive reactive Lacey they
gave it a name in a nod to pictures
Wally
now the glowing middle is inspired by
Eve from Ollie and the soul the shoe is
inspired by Wally's tire tread the hyper
adapts are lighter than you expect
that's really the first thing everyone
says when they pick them up and they're
easily comfy enough to wear the whole
day these shoes aren't just to wear to
show-off Nike says they've been tested
for running training and even basketball
these are functional shoes and off to
put those to the test but Nike isn't
going to stop here and has plans to
bring this technology to future shoes
across their lineup the hyperadapt 1.0
is cost seven hundred and twenty dollars
before tax I know a lot of you have no
desire to spend that much on a shoe I
can't recommend that you go out and buy
these that's really for you to decide
but I'm the guy who got the first
iPod iPhone and iPad I'm the early
adopter and this shoe is a first of its
kind and even if you don't want them
they just have that cool wow factor that
makes them special</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
