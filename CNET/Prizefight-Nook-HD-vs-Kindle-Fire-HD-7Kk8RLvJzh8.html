in the 7-inch tablet has proven to be a
sweet spot for price and size so we're
facing off to 199 dollar rivals it's a
prize five-foot out between the updated
nook HD and the kindle fire HD our
judges for this fight our senior editor
Eric the tank man Franklin senior editor
Donald taco taco bell and myself reeling
a ding dong will take all three judges
blind stores and average them out to the
nearest tenth of a point the final prize
fights for will be an average of all
rounds using the same system let's get
it on round one is designed the nuke HD
brings one of the more original tablet
designs with a plastic bezel frame
that's wider on the sides and their
signature ergonomic rubberized backing
that's more comfortable to hold it feels
much lighter in weight compared to the
kindle fire HD but the nook HD s biggest
win is its 1440 x 900 resolution that's
the best for any 7-inch tablet in the
market now the kindle fire HD brings a
more standard design with rounded
corners and a rubberized backing with an
accented stripe amazon's 1280 x 800
resolution is still very good for a
screen this size and we like physical
volume buttons but they're so flush here
that I found myself looking for them
many times the nook HD gets a 4 and the
kindle fire gets a 3 next round is
controls and user interface
the nuke HD takes a step back when it
comes to the UI wheel of a physical home
button but this feels like multiple
interfaces stacked on top of each other
with a carousel on the top a
customizable home screen with widgets
but then you go to your library to see
all your different media content there
and you still have access to
notifications and your settings there's
a little too much going on here all at
once and it feels like a mix of a nuke
Kindle and Android interface jumbled
together as one now the fire HD brings a
really refined and simple UI for people
who want to just access their content
and nothing else you can add your
favorite apps and content to the
carousel there's a row dedicated to your
different media content to jump directly
to you'll have the pulldown menu for
your settings and notifications and
related content or trending topics that
change depending on the app in the
carousel now it's still a limited
interface and that's a blessing for some
users but occurs for others who want any
real customization the kindle fire HD
takes this round with the 3.7 and the
nook HD gets a 3 after averaging two
rounds the note case V has a slight edge
next round is features both 16 gig
tablets bring Wi-Fi Bluetooth cloud
storage support multiple user accounts
and are running their own versions of
Android but each bring some unique
features now the nook HD is still the
only major 7 inch tablet with an
expandable micro SD card memory slot but
its biggest change is that it's now
opened up the entire Google Play library
with access to apps games and its entire
media library and it's really a game
changer for this device that it's never
had before plus you guys can always just
hack this thing and turn it into an open
android tablet now the kindle fire HD
brings a front facing camera and unique
features like x-ray for books and movies
that brings you more relevant
information alongside your content and
whispersync that syncs your location in
a book or how far you've seen in a movie
across multiple devices it may not be
the sexiest thing to talk about but
there are real parental controls here
and Amazon's free time sets time limits
on kids usage plus its biggest feature
is its content library for amazon prime
members live
sistah free movies TV shows books and
music content and that's a big deal if
you're a prime member but the bummer is
Amazon's google play store is overseen
by amazon and limit your app selection
it's just not the pure Google Play
experience the fire HD features are
great if again you're a prime member but
not everyone is still there's a lot to
like on both platforms so we're calling
this a tie at four points apiece next
round is web browsing and multimedia the
nook HD software update also raised its
game making Google's Chrome the default
browser is still the best mobile browser
even without flash and we found it to be
faster loading than Amazon silk browser
while bringing all of chromes benefits
but let's talk about that screen and
when watching movies the nuke HD clearly
separated itself with sharper image
quality and better color reproduction
movies really look great on this device
and make you say wow wow the kindle
fires silk browser is still solid but
there's no more flash support video
quality looked very good but it doesn't
match up to the nuke HD s and the
biggest advantage comes with its dolby
digital speakers that are the best
research on any tablet to date both
tablets stand out here but it's the nook
HD and its superior screen that get the
edge with the four and the fire HD gets
a 3.7 so after averaging four rounds the
note KC has pushed its lead the two
tenths of a point the final round that
decides it all is performance it would
be a stretch to call these top
performers because they both have
sluggish moments with their interfaces
and they just aren't on the level with
other higher-end tablets on the market
the nuke HD excels with better gaming
performance that even best the Nexus 7
in our 3dmark graphics tests plus it
also offers the best looking movies on a
7-inch tablet the fire HD is no chump
but it just doesn't stand out as much
now in our own cnet video playback drain
test the nuke HD gave us seven point
three hours of video playback with Wi-Fi
turned off and the kindle fire HD gave
us five point three hours of battery
life but increased to 6.6 hours when
using Amazon Prime streaming day-to-day
battery use will always fluctuate
depending on
usage so in the final round the nook HD
gets a 3.3 and the fire HD gets a 2.7 so
let's average out all five rounds and in
a battle between these two rivals the
latest software update to the nook HD
makes all the difference and it takes
this prize fight 3.7 to 3.4 and is your
prize fight winner now the decision
still isn't clear cut because if you're
someone that truly lives in the Amazon
ecosystem the kindle fire HD makes sense
for you and we're expecting a refresh
soon but it's the evolution of the nook
HD that has convinced our judges it's a
new man but it also might be too late
with new 7-inch tablets on their way i'm
brian Tong thanks for watching I will
catch you guys next week for another
prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
