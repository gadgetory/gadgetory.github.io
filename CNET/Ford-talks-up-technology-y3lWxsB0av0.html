right welcome to the cnet stage here at
CES 2012 I'm Brian Cooley and of course
we are in the midst of really just
kicking off CES 2012 if you're catching
us live right now you know my particular
specialty and passion within this wide
world of technology that we cover many
avenues of it but I get into the cars
love the car tech and joining me now is
one of the guys who will absolutely vibe
with me on that one please welcome Paul
Mascarenas Ford's chief technology
officer thanks bro good to have you here
now when you were here a year ago at the
last CES you were freshly minted as the
CTO at Fort I was I'm one year into the
jump now right it's a ambassador of
decagon is heavy diverse arree good to
have you here now the phrase you coined
last year is one that resonated in a lot
of people's minds i've been using it and
or butchering it ever since I kind of
have stole it from you you said what
about the car I said the car is the
ultimate mobile device and it's so true
and you like that we're looking
absolutely is CES who is that in the
future be called maybe the car
electronics show because we've got such
a huge presence of automakers here Ford
of course one of them Alan Mulally
giving the keynote again this year catch
me up on what you guys have announced I
think even more announcements this year
on the tech front at CES than any of
your previous couple of years that
you've been here yeah where do we start
so it's great so far as you say Alan
Alan Mulally's actually flying in later
today he's fourth career the detroit
north american international auto show
going on in what kind of juggling
calendars of the moment right on top of
this show which normally doesn't happen
someone has an alum will be flying in
italy participating in a vehicle reveal
this afternoon our fusion energy which
is a plug-in hybrid okay the plug-in
hybrid fusion yeah continuing the reveal
that we had it detroit yesterday and
then tomorrow who because I mean you
pulled it halfway back at Detroit and
the rest of the curtain comes on today
no no we're going to show it to the tech
community today folks you really get
yeah that's right right right and then
tomorrow he'll be participating in the
keynote panel CEO keynote panel with
Gary Shapiro encode but what we're
talking about here are really three or
four key areas the first is we're
showing for the first time
in North America our evos concept car
which if you haven't seen is absolutely
beautiful car it's a concept in terms of
design showing our future design
language for our global products and
actually when you look at the fusion
production car and the evos concept
you're going to see a lot of a lot of
similar looks and it's amazing how much
came across from that prototype concept
vehicle to the production vehicle so
that gives you an idea of where we're
taking out design globally but the fast
thing about the Evo's is that it's got
almost a almost a pulse with the driver
as you envisioned it very much
interpretive of what the drivers doing
the condition they're in even some some
health status interpretation right yeah
absolutely so so it's about the design
the powertrain plug-in hybrid so again
that energy technology exactly the same
technology that will be shown on the
fusion production car okay and talking
about this afternoon but in terms of the
technology is really about this
experience that we talked about last
year applying technology in the vehicle
in a relevant way to create an ownership
experience for our customers to you
latah nurse it because ownership means
you know one thing traditionally in cars
it means you know getting the keys and
paying off the note but you're
redefining that term right yeah I mean
there's the rational ownership
experience which is about the quality
would consistently deliver high-quality
vehicles affordable value for our
customers dependable over their lifetime
that's the very rational side of it
great fuel economy and so on but making
this emotional connection ok that's the
honors center and it's this what I
described is a seamless experience
between the home the office and the
vehicle so whether you're listening to
music you might be listening to internet
radio in the house as you move into the
vehicle our vision is that by connecting
the vehicle you can continue to enjoy
that same seamless experience whether
it's apps that you're using absolute you
would normally be running on a mobile
device your smartphone tablet or
whatever now throughout blink you can
access those in the vehicle yeah and
again guys were pretty early on that
move adoro open beak one or two others I
think around you're asking a couple
additional answers you
one just this week mpr rocks MIT I Heart
Radio what is Roxy oh you don't know
that one Roxy which is really
interesting when it's actually context
based information so knowing the
destination of the vehicle knowing where
you are when you're driving so if you're
passing a shopping mall you might get
access to shopping information are you
looking for a restaurant that type of
thing so its proximity days and this is
exactly where we're moving now is
providing more of this contextual
information to the driver so it's not
just bombarding you with information uni
it's actually providing you with the
information that you might need when you
need it based on the location of the
vehicle that's an interesting way to
attack distraction I think which I'm
sure you agree is starting to bubble up
as a topic i had a regulatory layer yep
what did you think of the NTSB
recommendation we'ens go away from cars
absolutely and you know we talked about
distraction even remove hair last year
yeah and if you remember along with the
ultimate mobile device I talked about
keeping your hands on the wheel and your
eyes on the road and the sync technology
that we're putting in with the voice
commands and so on being part of this
solution to people wanting to use their
mobile devices but in a vehicle and us
wanting to enable our drivers to
continue to concentrate on this primary
task of of driving there's a dressy real
wide okay and is right you know I think
our viewers and we absolutely support
the ban on handheld texting you know
we're putting the technology and because
we think it's bad for people to be using
hand-held devices while they're driving
right our view is that you can legislate
but that's not going to solve the
problem because people are still going
to want to use their devices in the
vehicle so we'll continue to develop our
in vehicle technologies to allow the
safest experience that we can and we we
believe the safest experience is this
seamless connectivity make it really
simple make it really intuitive to
connect and then provide an HMI
human-machine interface and interacting
with the device that is as much as
possible enable through voice the key
part I think is the first part you said
with all our folks get the voice part
keep your eyes and hands with it should
be hopefully not subdivide your mind too
much but the part about continuity where
the car can pick up where I left off
there's less sort of overhead of me
saying okay let me rethink what I'm
doing when I'm in the car because the
car is still somewhat of a digital
island except you do different behaviors
in the car with media and communication
but if that was not the case if it
followed you more from your other places
in your life there's less distraction to
say okay where am I let me get oriented
because most of us do that while we're
already up and running you're absolutely
right you're hitting on the point i
mention it's all about this familiarity
this intuitiveness yeah and as much as
we can make it seamless you know you can
really then continue to focus on driving
now on the other side I don't want to
get too lost in the driver distraction
issue because so we're putting the
technology and but on the other side
we're also putting in a lot of vehicle
technologies vehicle centric
technologies that actually help the
driver for example with the focus
launched last year with the fusion
launch right now you know we're
launching technologies active cruise
control for a collision warning
mitigation by breaking lane departure
warning the fusion vehicle has a lane
keeping assist feature your youth noise
gets down to a loss like planned and you
know I took last time as well about the
democratization of technology in here so
in offered not offering these
technologies to you know low volume
niche customers we're making them very
affordable very relevant and available
to millions of customers around the
world continuing to focus on the pillars
that we've defined of high quality
vehicles that are safe through the
technologies that we put on board
deliver the best or amongst the best
fuel economy yea high efficiency
gasoline engines EcoBoost plug-in
hybrids and so on and also smart
features and technologies and just
continuing to focus on those elements
one side of the technology seems to be
answering for the weaknesses and the
other whether it's distraction or
whether its inefficiency we know that
the human driver left to their own
devices drives typically inefficiently
right lots of high high change driving
modes a lot of breaking a lot of
acceleration bad stuff both of those
dynamics
right self or somewhat autonomous
driving systems will start to moderate
out bad driver behavior soon right we
were not too far from that not too far
from that and we're also putting in some
driver assist features so for example in
our current hybrids we have the fusion
hybrid for example yeah the little
system where you can grow leave throw
the leaves right you can look at your
driving style we have in the focus all
right we got to be busy get people with
video game they want to enact again what
we want out of them right the butterfly
future and so on so again putting things
in that it's a little bit of fun it's
not distracting but it's encouraging
this efficient driving style there is a
thought out there that the autonomous
car is closer than we think there's a
lot of this bubbling up no one's ready
to put a stake in the ground and when
they're going to deliver an autonomous
car what is what's in the way of
autonomous car self-driving cars are we
going to get there with one sort of a
big jump or are they going to be a very
gradual continuum as we move some kind
of self-driving in the market what do
you say it's a good it's a great
question my my view is it's somewhere in
the future I haven't got a crystal ball
myself so how does 10 years grass are in
general crazily maybe nothing crazy for
full autonomous continuing to see a
progression of semi autonomous vehicles
that are moving towards own yeah when we
talk about these technologies I don't
think people always relate to what's in
our vehicles today so for example things
like active cruise control that are just
managing speed the big piece of autonomy
is sitting there or we have the auto
park assist feature which allows you to
parallel park your vehicle on the fusion
we have a pullout feature that chill out
helps the driver to pull out I haven't
tried that was way so that's interesting
still these release again and these are
autonomous features the self-parking I
gotta hit a self parking in an
affordable car as you've rolled it out
is it's the best I've driven I've given
a lot of self parking technologies in
cars that are up to six figures that
can't quite get the nose in and this man
twenty-thousand-dollar Ford can do it
over and over and over so I give you
kudos on that but as we look at these
what I call perimeter technology lane
departure forward collision prevention
active part all the things that work
around the sensors around the outside of
the car
are we at the point where we can start
to just roll out more software that
turns those physical devices into what
we need for autonomy or is there some
additional tangible tech we need to get
to autonomous car know what we run very
focused on is we've got the hardware in
the vehicle so we've got radar sensing
we've got camera sensing we've got
electric power steering that gives you
control over the keyboard these these
are what we call the fundamental
building blocks the smart thing the
innovative thing then and this is how we
make it affordable is not to build in
more hardware but it's to develop the
software algorithms and the control
sister so for example your toe
parkassist no no no extra harbor in the
vehicle that's just rolled right it's
the ultrasonic sensors yet the palace
terry electric power steering and a
really a smile algorithm so that's what
i think differentiates are in our smart
innovative company this does to put a
car company on the television cycled a
CD company right technology company and
that's what we've been emphasizing yeah
now if you talk about full autonomous
vehicles lots more hardware and a lot of
a way to make it affordable ok i'm
talking about some very very expensive
ok a lot of that Karthik our
communication thing is really green
right now we can take our communication
i think we can talk about in a different
context because that's using Wi-Fi yeah
short range Wi-Fi DSRC dedication
short-range communications very
affordable very practical a lot of big
pilots around you know not just the
country we've got a big program up in
Michigan in Ann Arbor but in Germany
Japan so I think that offers real
opportunity in the near term there's
speaking of your locations let's talk
about your newest lab mm-hmm you've come
to Silicon Valley we have we announced
last week that we were opening a lab in
Silicon Valley we didn't talk about the
exact location but somewhere in those
you know i'll be coming out a lot yeah
welcome you though express or something
together but no well that's really about
so it's a natural extension of the work
that we've been doing for the last four
or five years to really connect not only
with our
more mature tech partners people like
Google and Apple Microsoft a little bit
further up the coast but the University
of Stanford but I think most importantly
for us having a presence in this really
innovative community here and it is
amazing for me it really is one of the
most remarkable innovative communities
in the world and it's everything from
you know entrepreneurial innovative
individuals yeah startups working out of
their garages the kind of tech shop type
approach all the way through to the tech
giant's like Apple so we've been working
in the valley area for a long time what
is this fellow's the right time to
establish a hub for us well especially
if to be closer to those partners and
sources and inspirations and places
where you can hire the best people or
some of the best people ever those
universities is this is also part of the
faster turn of product and design right
you got to be faster which means you got
to be closer to where some of the
resources on road assume right so again
we you know we continue to drive down
the development cycle for the vehicle
program yeah but you still measure that
in years all right it's two or three
years right what we're trying to mesh
here is this consumer electronics cycle
that you're measuring in months you know
six to nine months a lot of folks don't
realize that no different yes really and
part of the solution for us it's like
meshing the small gear with the big gear
at this very small fast turning with the
large one you've got to have an open
architecture so you can introduce the
latest technology and keep it up to date
an example I'd give would be my fault
touch we took hear about my fault such a
year ago we're just launching our first
major upgrade on my home touch faster
simpler more functionality but we're
doing it purely software-based you're
staring at USB Drive reactor the metal
cases right ending the us please had an
interesting day knows that experience
like last question I've got for you
although experience like for you guys to
go through what was really wasn't
intended that way and then it of being a
little bit of a beta cycle right i mean
software companies technology companies
here are kind of used to finding out
from the field needs some work here and
there was that difficult culturally for
Ford to deal with to get that kind of
feedback from the market very different
for us really the vision of where we
be as a tech company the ability to
launch industry leading technologies
yeah in a high-quality whey robust
weight but at the same time be able to
very very quickly respond to a customer
feedback both in terms of the things I
really like and then the areas of
opportunity for improvement and then get
those out quickly to do it efficiently
and to do it in a way that is obviously
free but not inconvenient to iCarly's
and I think the software based updates
is absolutely perfect example of the
direction we're moving in as a company
completely technology company as being
here could see appreciate it thanks Paul
Mascarenas CTO of Ford and looking
forward to Ford's announcements through
their CEO Alan Mulally coming a little
bit later here at CES 2012 in a minute
another life backpack shot here at the
floor of CES you know that means BTW
brian Tong is out there somewhere ready
to make your jaw drop yet again stay
tuned i'm brian cooley at CES 2012 with
cnet com away boy
