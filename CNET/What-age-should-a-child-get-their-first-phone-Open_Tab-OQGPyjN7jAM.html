back-to-school tech is the sort of theme
that we're going with right now we're
all parents some very new some
experienced more experienced so you have
a three-month-old yes right Joe how old
are your kids well my son is eight
you'll be knighted right my daughter is
gonna be three November third
so yeah I got that nice little gap
between the two but they are both iPad
savvy with children already yes yeah my
son actually has an own cell phone what
really that's a thing a hand-me-down or
like a new one I gave him he has a 5s
okay yes oh there's a better phone than
my mom is that about if you pass your
mom down one of your phones
you'd be doing better the 5s was my
fault it was my older phone I think it
was small enough for me actually
originally that started with the 4s I
moved into the 5s I got an upgrade I
upgraded them because I got so old age
yeah I got sick of carrying two charges
a 30 pin and a lightning it's one one
Lightning so alright let me explain my
right this is how I come to have all
these phones what I do is no I don't
care i buy it i buy a new phone every
year yeah and instead of you paying for
the insurance I keep the older one it's
my backup in case I lose it or break it
so basically I have I don't pay
insurance I just live on the edge yeah
well I'm glad you it don't wear
underwear ever well I I definitely do I
buy the new one and I keep the other one
as a backup so fortunately I've been
lucky so far because I don't have a
backup as of now cuz I gave him my 5s
and Leah's phone got stolen and I gave
her my my six well I got a question okay
so eight years old a time of grand
imagination sure a time of running
around with more energy than we know
what to do with do you feel any regrets
over giving him a phone like he's going
to the phone to play games instead of
doing other fitness like you know
running around physical toys or
certainly thank you David karna he gave
me a life proof case so he has had it in
his pocket and ran through the sprinkler
before and everything okay he was still
active but that's not what we're getting
at whereas but he does he does he does
use his phone but there was a case where
he was out with my mom and he got
separated and the first thing he did was
call me and I asked him look up at the
street sign he told me where he was all
right of course I was playing Pokemon go
and I talked well I talked him home I
even talked him across yeah he was only
two blocks away that's not coming on but
yeah yes but so here we are so so that
worked and also the fact that when he's
in summer camp and he goes on trips yeah
and see where he is because I find my
friends I know his location
look no I we're not judging you well I
oh I by no means I'm telling you I'm
telling you my reasons of it I think I
think it's important to talk about how
old is it okay how old should a child be
before they have their own phone I feel
like most people would think aid is on
the earlier side it's definitely earlier
but the thing is is that I learned from
from him breaking one of my iPads that
it's better to have let him have his own
thing to break glass is like the only
one with the phone in his class the
other other kids in Africa
so here's what I think should happen and
they're not really allowed to bring it
to school yeah I would not think you
would be allowed to bring it I think the
thing that I'm gonna look for when my
son who's what is he he's a month a year
in five months when he's ready for
something like that I might want to get
him like a watered down like hit this
button for emergencies but on watches
now yeah like you know GPS I was
thinking of terms like that cross your
mind yeah before I was I was fortunate
because I had a line that I wasn't using
and I was paying before I just dumped it
down all right what are you saying so I
catch yourself from like that we're
talking more about like the you know the
general like not everyone is in your
position with all your lines you don't
know what to do with them and stuff like
that
you got phones coming every hole well I
pay for my mom's phone a favorite brain
but like do you we're getting down to is
like eight-year-old should they have a
cell phone versus
you know I want to I keep saying like a
jitterbug because that's the whole you
know what I think it also depends on
each particular situation like you know
you know you're still married you're
what Stacy you're married my son's
mother and I are no longer together
right so it's kind of good for me
because I can also reach out directly to
him without it feel like I'm cramping
her style like okay okay this dude that
complicated bothering me is accessible
kid I call him directly he can FaceTime
me anytime he wants it's not like if his
mother is using her phone and he should
call me so I kind of like that he can
always a lot of layers
I'm always accessible I mean you can ask
a report today an outcome you can ask
him he's like take it in the other room
because one of my son calls me I get up
I take his call and never want him to
feel like Oh daddy's not gonna be there
right okay you never have a leave a
voicemail for dad I mean if you call me
during the show I may have to reply what
attack right now
that's fine um what about other tech
like outside of a phone I mean loans are
like that I think I think the segue to
him getting a phone was he's had an iPad
for a number of years I got him when he
turned I think like four I bought him an
iPad Mini and I just felt there was like
such a big investment that I went
against what I would normally do and I
got him the 16k because i yeah or it
also you know so I got on the sixteen
gigabyte which is okay but he had it
he's had it and he still has it to this
day
it's it's still intact it's also in a
lifeproof case I was like okay he took
care of his iPad and I kind of transit
it to the phone because the phone has a
cellular connection and I mean this kid
loves him some YouTube yeah he's made
YouTube videos he wants me to upload but
I mean I've seen some some of the
comments in our cruel they are with us I
can't have mr. on my son before puberty
that's that's like the big question one
like it's on a case-by-case basis with
kids and how mature they are you started
with the iPad to see how he was with it
you also don't want to not give them the
opportunity to test out things like oh
get really into YouTube videos or want
to create things you know so you want to
like not set them behind when everyone
else in school has anything like that so
there's that funny balance but I
actually I was surprised with something
with my three month old yeah I was gonna
say your daughters super young but but
my parents are in Florida okay
and we FaceTime and she
miles at them like my husband went on a
work trip and she recognized him on a
totally totally that blew my mind and I
also had that moment of like am i doing
a wrong thing because you should look at
a screen that's young but it's amazing
screams daddy like this is like almost
magical future moments you know where
you can you know read a story you know
from a from across the country you know
so I know she's gonna be seeing mom and
dad always do this because it's our job
and she's gonna want to play with the
phone because it's what parents do so I
want to do that too really I'm gonna do
my hardest to not give her the screen if
it's possible but then I can't judge
it's gonna be a time where I'm at that
restaurant
and just like every toddler you know
maybe or I'm on an airplane and you're
held hostage with everyone else you
don't want a crying kid on the airplane
so you'll do something to entertain them
and you'll put a screen in front of
their face I'll have to go through those
lessons as I as I hit them I guess it's
it's tough definitely starts when you're
on the road yeah I you know right now
I'm at the point where my kid he get he
totally understands like what the
FaceTime is it's so funny because like
when it hangs up heat like it's the
phone's off and it's down and then he's
just like waves by like that like ten
seconds later he's like okay bye like I
don't know where you went you over here
a second ago
and to me it's like oh man he's like
something's going on in his brain that's
just not connecting the dots like it's
poor kid like you know like he'll reach
out to it a lot like he wants to he
wants Stacey to like pick him up I was
like sorry dude she's like 40 miles away
it's weird it's a really it's like a
heartbreaking kind of thing and I wasn't
expecting him to be that sort of
engrained in it this early in his life
but he's already I didn't even
understand what they're looking at yeah
he know like this is maybe a little
tangential but like he'll you know we
don't watch a lot of TV with him yeah he
maybe has like two hours a week of TV
right but he'll sit on the couch and he
knows the remote like does something so
he'll just like pick it up and just look
at the TV and be like why okay like I
have one you know and that's the
connections they make their basic but
they're their own with an infant you can
you in a newborn you can kind of watch
TV and you know it you know last night
we were watching stranger things and she
was watching it too yeah like the whole
time is on it and I'm going are you
watching identify with know it's tough
there there's a lot of you know weird
things that I'm just getting into right
now and you know you dealt with it
you'll get there yeah it's weird
and children and technology it's funny
years my daughter's too and like I said
she's going on three and she'll get up
so like when she facetimes me she has to
hang up yeah I mean her mother sent me a
video one time because she was kind of
being a little running around not paying
attention so I hung it up
her mother recorded her throwing the
biggest tantrum because she couldn't hit
the button because she had he likes to
go bye-bye and hit the button she has to
hit the ball and there's stuff like that
on we have some interaction here on
Facebook Jim says kids do not need
smartphones and definitely not at school
but Jim I feel like a lot of people
might disagree with you especially some
of the effed up stuff that happens in
schools these days maybe having some
sort of communicative device is
necessary I don't know his problems
yeah things like yeah yeah come along no
loss problems with high school kids so
because these are terribly mean right
that's the thing like there's no
streamlined situation there's there's
just the best you can do
I agree like I don't think kids need
smartphones but you know
I think in this day and age there is
something you need to give them that
lets them call for help like their we
can't like we can't live in 2016
given the technology we are afforded and
have a child who is by themselves happy
in a situation where they're helpless
without something like they I think like
the old school equivalent me being old
and dating back to like that dude I grew
up without cell phones to generation my
console thing before cell phones these
have prepaid cards and my mom gave me a
prepaid card like the home card it only
allowed me to call the home phone from
an outside payphone so even as a child I
had that where I guess now the
equivalent would be a cell phone so
growing up even I had some way to call
home from a payphone I've had no money
or yeah also on Facebook someone says
that there should be a low tech phone
for kids they're like four buttons
pre-programs
yeah it's like call my cell her cell or
the police it's a plan its money so if
you're gonna earn that money down for a
plan do you do what Joey did ago oh I
have an old phone let me just attach it
to that
like I said also the fact that I have a
really good deal on my plan yeah it's
unlimited its I have three lines
unlimited data unlimited taxing and
three gig hotspot okay here's the part
where Joey shows off his plan well I'm
just saying it's just it's just
unlimited everything and get a Joey
you're super cool everyone anyway okay
so basically how my son's phone came to
be okay I guess his arm my godson
yeah he lived he lived in New York and
he his mom worked at five world trade
and she was there 9/11 and it just shook
her up and she moved out of the city she
just could not get far enough worthless
okay so he wanted to come stay in the
city one summer so he stayed with me his
family couldn't reach him he has family
in the city but they live like upstate
he wanted to stay with me because I was
in Manhattan so I initially got the
phone for him and I just never shut it
off and then when he got old enough up
he's 28 now when he got old enough he
was like I can't have you paying for my
phone so he has his own line I literally
had the line sitting there he had to do
something with it
something to be said though about having
access to a computer for garlis of the
phone or the computer but but really
just being comfortable enough to just be
around it in my home growing up we only
had one PC now everyone's got their own
laptop sure but I paused it and I was on
a mall the time I became a faster type
or more confident in talking to people I
I was able to play around with stupid
little things and I was more comfortable
to computers now I ha get from my little
brother and I don't know if he's as fast
of a diaper as I am you know this game
it thinks you know and also there are
benefits to doing your homework now you
cannot you need an internet connection
they expect you to have you know
computer access at home now if you want
to succeed so you don't want to set your
kid back by not giving them the best
yeah I mean the way it's it's just like
it's just like when I was growing up you
know we all didn't have computers at
first and we just went to the kids house
who had it so it's not it's not a
question of them not having a you know
accessibility they will get their hands
on it yeah at least this way you can
govern it you can monitor yeah you can
set the parental play yeah they're gonna
talk anyways their kids online my son's
you know five nights at freddys this
fine line I mean he has like every five
nights at freddy figure but he's afraid
to play the game it's the funniest thing
yeah he knows it from other kids I
cannot believe how much they've license
out that brand that's crazy um you guys
feel you don't know the game five nights
at Freddy's I'm not know has nothing to
do with that don't worry about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
