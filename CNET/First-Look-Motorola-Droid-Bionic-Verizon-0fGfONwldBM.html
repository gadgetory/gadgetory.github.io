cnet.com and this is a first look at the
motorola droid bionic it's been nine
long months and we finally have it in
our hands you may remember the droid
bionic from our CES 2011 coverage
however this droid bionic is a little
bit different than the one that we
showed in fact it's a little bit sleeker
a little bit sexier and definitely a lot
thinner in fact verizon says that the
motorola droid bionic is its thinnest
LTE phone it's also the very first dual
core phone to support 4G LTE on verizon
it shifts at android 2.3 point for which
is the latest update for Gingerbread at
this time and it is free of the usual
motoblur interface it is up to five
customizable home screens and the menu
is a little bit different as well the
4.3 inch display on the droid bionic mix
this phone a little bit big but the
screen is amazing the qhd display really
pops of color on the back it is an 8
megapixel camera lens with an LED flash
it's also the first 4G LTE phone to
shoot full 1080p HD video since the drug
Bionic has both a 1 gigahertz dual-core
processor and 4G LTE speeds the overall
phone experience is very fast navigating
through the phone is very zippy
multitasking was not a problem at all
the browser was also quite impressive it
supports html5 content as well as adobe
flash video in fact we were able to load
a flash video pretty quickly the Droid
Bionic has very strong multimedia
features not only does it have the 8
megapixel camera and camcorder like we
said those as a front facing camera for
video calls aside from multimedia
features the Droid Bionic also has very
good business features it has strong
device and data encryption you can also
remotely wipe the device as well as the
SD card the Droid Bionic comes with an
app called zumocast that lets you easily
share
transfer files from a PC application you
can do this over 4g LTE and 3d not just
Wi-Fi like with the atrix you can dock
the Droid Bionic into this laptop
accessory and use it as a portable pc
other accessories include an HD station
which requires an external monitor you
can also plug it in into little tiny
webtop adapter that you can attach to an
external monitor as well the webtop
applications definitely extend the
functionality of this phone the webtop
app allows you to access different apps
like Firefox in facebook as well as a
variety of office apps like Citrix
gotomeeting and Citrix documents and of
course the Droid Bionic is all of the
usual Android features like Gmail Google
Talk and more the Droid Bionic ships
with the aforementioned 1 gigahertz
dual-core processor it also has one
gigabyte of ram and 16 gigabytes of
internal storage it also shows the 16
gigabyte SD card however it is
expandable up to 32 gigabytes on the
whole the Droid Bionic is a slim slick
powerful and fast device the webtop
application lets you use all of these
different accessories however it's
around three hundred dollars if a new
two-year service agreement with the
verizon wireless the laptop dock is
around three hundred dollars as well the
HD station top one hundred dollars the
webtop adapter is around thirty dollars
so is it worth the wait we think so but
is it worth the price we have our doubts
i'm nicole lee this has been the first
look at the motorola droid bionic
