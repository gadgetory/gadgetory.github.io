model comes to market raving about its
lap time around the Nurburgring that
most enduring of irrelevance II is to
the average car buyer this one does
exactly that but also a lot more let's
drive this all-new 15 now the key thing
to bear in mind about a Range Rover
Sport is that it's not the sport version
of a Range Rover a Range Rover Sport is
its own distinct model and it carries
some of the design cues from the Evoque
particularly what they call this
diminishing diello it's the side windows
that get narrower as you go to the back
of the card when car makers make a
hotter car they always give it a more
aggressive chin with bigger holes in it
to get air in different wheels you get
some lower body cladding here and out
back you got four exhaust pipes that are
very nicely chiseled and what they call
a splitter for airflow management down
the middle this is the first of a new
line of cars from Land Rover that are
kind of like BMW M if you will they come
from the special vehicle operation of
Land Rover but Ford already has a
trademark on SVO so there s vo is badge
SVR
now Range Rover for that matter Land
Rover interiors I'm always struck me as
some of the most handsome it's a great
layout
ergo is good handsomeness is everywhere
yeah I could do without this two-tone
stuff you also notice we have pseudo
sports pseudo racing seats in both the
front row and in the back row because
those and movable headrests are always
there it can make it a little hard to
put back seats down so that's a bit of a
sacrifice for sport pretension versus
practicality and as you can see the fold
flat is kind of pseudo flat this is not
optimized for cargo nor is there a third
row available and we've seen this head
unit before in jag Land Rover products
it's a unique interface to them one of
my biggest gripes is the slowness of its
touchscreen response and the fact that
you have to do voice input of navigation
destinations in little itty-bitty pieces
two three five two three I mean just
compare how fast it is to tell your
phone to take you somewhere and to tell
this thing to do so
ok Google Drive to 235 second Street San
Francisco California
my third gripe is how many screens
interrupt what you're seeing here I
can't tell any warning or notification
screens like God could just blot out
what's on the main screen that I care
about and even when I turn the volume
knob after a moment or two it brings up
a confirmation screen that I don't need
my ears tell me how loud it is that just
gets in the way of what I care about
and again overlaying all of this is so
much lag and delay it's not measured in
seconds parts of seconds but that's not
okay in a car much brighter spot is up
here in the upper left in control apps
now here's where you get an apps
platform you can decide what you want on
which of these screens very much like
you do on your phone or your tablet and
it's all managed here through the Jag in
control apps app on your phone that is
very much a projector app to get things
here up here but obviously not your
whole phone their own curated basket the
apps all come from this control panel on
your phone you've got some new ones that
are called out here like RTO and glimpse
or apparently recent you can add cynic
navigation if you
don't like what Land Rover's got as well
as a few other apps most of which aren't
exactly globally famous and then down
here you can see the ones I do have
installed like parka pedia stitcher are
do and this is where you set up the
layout of your apps on the car these are
flip through screens on the vehicle I
mock them up here first and then they
get pushed out to the car now the
cameras on this vehicle are interesting
you've got a variety of views and
settings parked right now I've got the
junction view I also have a curb view
that looks out to the sides off the
front wings I can set up new
combinations of cameras that you don't
see on any other car so they're very
camera centric on this vehicle
too bad that camera in the rear at least
is so awful
cuz it's so bad I'm pretty sure it's
defective and I'm not gonna knock it
because nobody would ship a camera with
that bad registration of colors and
fuzziness
into a production car
now up here in the engine bay is some
fairly familiar jag Land Rover stuff a
five-litre supercharged v8 but because
you got an SVR badge on it it puts out
more 550 horse that's 40 more than
without that badge 41 more pound feet of
torque gives you up to 502 and of course
it goes out to an 8-speed automatic only
but it's a sport automatic with faster
shifts and that powers all four wheels
either in a trackage mode or in an
off-road mode depending where you have
your terrain response knobs set now this
vehicles heavy 50 100 pounds despite the
extensive use of aluminum still gets up
to 60 though in four and a half seconds
or better so where do you give on the
MPG of course it's rated at only
fourteen nineteen but if you're buying a
vehicle like this you didn't buy it in a
shootout between it freeze your the
first thing that impressed me is I got
in this Range Rover Sport SVR was not
what it did when it moved but what it
did when it comes to a stop this vehicle
has the best auto start/stop technology
every it starts the engine almost in the
time it takes to lift off the brake
pedal that's very nicely done
and it helps you get the most out of
that pretty poor mpg the next thing you
notice is definitely about going
any major car maker right now
jag and Land Rover are obsessed with
obnoxious exhaust systems and they're
fun the power of course is four digits
this Sport Automatic as they say is
definitely tight it's quick
all and the fundamental takeaway I get
great this to one of the hot Connie
hands or an x5m is it it's less severe
and yet it handles like a very capable
car when you press it though I imagine
if I went head to head it's not as sharp
as those two turbines okay let's price
our Range Rover Sport SVR this is not
gonna be a cheap date as you can imagine
all in about 117 3 the way I would do it
what they've done here in this category
is to hit - I think more bases than
their competition it's also a very
comfortable daily driver not all the
competitors are they can be high-strung
and it's got serious off-road cred
