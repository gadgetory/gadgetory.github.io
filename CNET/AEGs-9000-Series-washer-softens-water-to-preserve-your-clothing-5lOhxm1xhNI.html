the new AEG Electrolux 9000 series
washing machine
now this washing machine has some very
interesting features the first one is
that it uses smart water technology to
actually soften the water it uses to
wash your clothes why do you want to do
that because it supposedly will treat
your clothes with better care and a
little gentler than other washers that
use traditional water supplies so the
upside of that say Electrolux is that
you will be able to put your wool
sweaters yes I said wool sweaters and
other very delicate items like
sportswear things that have special
treatments like waterproofing and you
will be able to use them for a lot
longer what also sets this washer apart
is that it has a smart connected
capability which means it talks to
smartphones and tablets that enables you
to get alerts for when your washer
cycles are done you can also control the
machine directly from your phone and
mobile device and you'll also go to get
advice on how to handle certain fabrics
if you don't understand what those crazy
labels mean you can punch it up in the
app and you'll be able to get specific
advice for how much you need to wash and
what kind of cycle you need to run if
you want to get this machine and put it
in your house yourself you're going to
wait a little bit it's going to be
coming by the end of the year 2016 and
the prices range anywhere between $9.99
euro and 1300 euro hopefully this
product is going to come to the United
States soon so I can watch all of my
wool sweaters finally enough to worry
about them getting completely messed up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
