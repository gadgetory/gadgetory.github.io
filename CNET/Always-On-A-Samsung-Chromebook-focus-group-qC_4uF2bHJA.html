another operating system Chrome OS and
it's been a little slow to take off they
have a new product out though the
Samsung Chromebook this is the 2012
Samsung Chromebook series 5 550 it's
running the Chrome operating system it
has a 16 gigabyte solid state drive an
Intel processor it's pretty lightweight
about 3.2 pounds and a 12 inch display
it does have an Ethernet port USB and an
SD card slot it retails for $449 with
Wi-Fi only or 549 for Wi-Fi plus 3G but
some people have argued that a
cloud-based operating system where the
whole interface feels like the browser
might be a little too much too soon for
your average computer user so we decided
for our road test here on always-on to
stage a little focus group we go beyond
pompous engine
welcome to our major Frank said you know
what the people beyond your bless yeah
used to be in a Camry wasted you are I
do a lot of paintball tournaments
oh I'm all over YouTube okay here we go
good group hey guys hi everyone I'm
Molly so what we're doing today is
testing out the Samsung Chromebooks
which are these laptops in front of you
is anybody familiar with the Chromebook
you heard of it no no so what we'll do
is take 10-15 minutes to just do
whatever you would do with a new laptop
and then I'll come back in and ask you
some questions and we'll just talk about
it a little bit all right sound good
okay these guys are barely saying
anything I wonder if they like it could
that be I'm just going to log on to
Pokhara cyber hold on I just looked up
the good way oh yeah you're going all
over the place I actually haven't been
able to find it yeah the one went
straight to Facebook that's America in a
nutshell
just looking remotely I like that's
pretty great I'm gonna start doing focus
group testing on my work from home days
because then I can get paid twice to do
my work okay this is pretty good one of
these guys actually made it to the
chrome store like he's actually trying
to find apps that's as far as anybody's
gotten it's like a video game or
something like a cheap 'men unlocked
Chrome App Store I feel like he she
winds like he should get one I should
give him one to take it home he figured
it out so much although apparently I
didn't find anything that he liked cuz I
think he's going to sleep and trying to
find the end K does all playthroughs one
I'd see she's discovering like that the
keyboards a little bit funky and the
other woman I think is in yahoo mail and
somewhere somebody at Google is like nah
he's Yahoo so I'm pretty sure that
everyone who has come in has been on
Facebook for the majority of the testing
time forget about a Chromebook Facebook
book they'll come up with a better name
what do you think of the the Chrome
operating system is not bad
does it happen anything at port or is it
only Wireless I tried to login to my
gmail account and it kept directing me
to another screen that seems like Google
shouldn't have a problem with Gmail yeah
but okay yeah it I reminds me on my
tablet I guess I noticed the internet
connection itself I was trying to watch
my soaps I'm not sure how then that book
differentiates itself from something
like a tablet other than it has a
keyboard does it seem like it would be
useful to have a computer that kind of
just mainly got online and that was it
good question it assumes 100%
connectivity wherever you are and if you
don't have that then you have a nice
pretty paperweight I see it for like for
my four-year-old as people quiet you
know I can definitely see like my
parents using something like this yeah
and if I could have rented this for the
month that would have been fantastic I'm
just kind of skeptical of cloud
operating systems with what they're
trying to do with the internet and how
it could affect like people's everyday
lives so you wouldn't necessarily be
comfortable having all your information
like stored on Google's server no
definitely not especially not Google no
offense to Google but especially not
Google so in that case then how much do
you think you would want to pay for a
device that kind of is like a tablet
with a keyboard no more than 300 I would
want to see
a three-digit price tag yeah sure like
anything I did that yes turn and walk
away
so laptop prices tablet functionality no
way no all right well here are some of
the lessons we learned from our
Chromebook focus group first people seem
to like it best when they compare it to
a tablet but with a keyboard second the
cloud operating system is not as hard
for people to figure out as we thought
it might be and third you know who
really needs to make a laptop Facebook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
