looking at the lumen LED color smart
bulb now this is the bulb right here
it's a warm white 3000 degree Kelvin
bulb it's got a light output of four
hundred lumens and that's about
equivalent to a 40 watt incandescent
bulb and you know I would like it to be
a little bit higher than that for fifty
maybe but 400 is fine the thing about
this bulb that's great is that it
changes colors based on what you do with
your smart app now there's an app for
the iphone now and there's an Android
app coming and all you have to do is
press a button and change the light you
can go to any color you want you can
make it green pink purple yellow
whatever you want millions of choices
use this color wheel here I need to
select what you want you can also use a
couple of presets in the app there's
this one that will do a fast flash of
colors and then this one that's a little
bit slower just between red and green
and blue just fun for atmosphere there's
also this romance mode I'm not sure how
romantic this is but it's just warm
tones of red yellow and orange kind of
cycling through fading back and forth
and finally you've also got the cool
midnight mode that's just light colors
the opposite of romance I guess it's
blue and green and purple cool shades
not a bad feature I wish the presets
were more customized well wish you could
say i want it to flash these colors in a
row and not just red green blue the
lumen Bowlby's is bluetooth so it
connects directly to your phone you
don't need to have a hub and that gives
it a bit of a leg up over the philips
hue because the philips you has to have
that hub it looks like a smoke detector
you put it up and it kind of works as a
router for your bulbs and with the lumen
you don't need that it's just the bulb
and it goes directly to your phone also
with bluetooth it can detect your
proximity so it's easy to have it turn
on as soon as you walk in the room or
change color or whatever you want it to
do when it senses that you're near the
lumens going to retail for 69 99 and
that's about the same as you'll be able
to find a single philips hue bulb for
but the philips hue bulb you'll also
need to get a hub so it's actually more
cost-efficient if you want to get
Phillip to you you're gonna probably get
that starter pack that costs 199 and
that's a little more expensive option to
get in you get more bulbs if you just
want one color changing bulb you have a
Halloween display or you just want to
have a party light in your kitchen or
something this is a great option and
it's a fun gift too i think so i like
this bulb and I'd probably recommend it
seen it I'm right wrist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
