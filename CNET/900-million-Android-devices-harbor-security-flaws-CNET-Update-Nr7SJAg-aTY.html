million Android devices researchers a
security firm checkpoint say that a
quartet of security flaws in Qualcomm
chipsets
could be exploited to give an attacker
full control of your Android device
checkpoint has dubbed the flaws
quadrotor there's no word on why the
company did not go with a much better
nickname the Four Horsemen of the
Android apocalypse but I had to guess
I'd say was so Google would find
checkpoint site first with a term
quadrotor anyway checkpoint says that
quadrotor is a set of 4 vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices using Qualcomm
chipsets if any of the four are
exploited an Android device could be
compromised an attacker would have to
get you to download a malicious app this
app would not ask for any special
permissions so that you wouldn't even
know that this app is up to no good
after installation the app could take
advantage of the flaws to gain route
control of your phone when a phone is
rooted anything can be installed or
changed qualcomm chips are lots of
popular phones here are just some of the
phone models affected the Google Nexus
5x and 6p the HTC One em 10 the LG g5
and the US versions of the samsung
galaxy s7 and s7 edge this all sounds
horrible huh so here's the good news
checkpoint says there is no evidence the
flaws have been exploited in the wild
additionally the research firm told
Qualcomm about the issue back in April
then way to the industry standard of 90
days before telling the world
Qualcomm confirmed a checkpoint it
released patches to the phone and tablet
makers Google told ZDNet that one of the
flaws will be packed in a September
update to Android if you're concerned
that your device is affected checkpoint
released a free Android app called
quadrotor scanner on the Google Play
Store download away that's it for this
