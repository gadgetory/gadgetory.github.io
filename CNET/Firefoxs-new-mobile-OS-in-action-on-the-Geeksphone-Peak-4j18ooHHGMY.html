at Mobile World Congress checking out
the geeksphone peek for top model of
geeks phones to Firefox OS offerings a
Firefox OS is the new software from
Mozilla visually it looks a little like
a cross between Android with the
multiple home screens and iOS with the
big grids of icons you'll see four icons
at the bottom of the screen to always
stay there giving quick access to the
essentials of the Firefox web browser
your phone contacts and your messaging
it's quite a clean interface and seems
fairly straightforward to use but we
will have to spend a lot more time with
it before we make a final verdict it's
based on html5 rather than Java which is
apparently easier on low-end hardware
now have good news as this only has a
1.2 gigahertz dual-core processor that
is bigger than the one gigahertz single
core you'll find in the geeks funky are
but in comparison to phones at the
galaxy s3 or Sony Xperia said it's not
really that much power visually it's not
a bad-looking phone it's got a clean
white design and it has a satisfying
weight to it that's not unlike Nokia's
Lumia phones has a 4.3 inch screen with
a 960 x 540 pixel display which seems
reasonably bright and sharp enough for
the essentials on the back you'll find
an 8 megapixel camera with a 2 megapixel
camera and the front for video calling
geeksphone haven't come through and
pricing for the peak yet but we are
expecting it to be somewhere around the
two hundred dollar mark when it goes on
sale in a few weeks from his website I'm
Andrew Horrell for cnet and this is the
geeks phone p</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
