basically a radar gun on a stick but
those are easy for the speeder to beat
slow down for a few hundred yards and
then pick it up again so the new trend
in u.s. speed cameras may soon be
corridor averaging with ALPR cameras
those are automatic license plate
recognition now if you're one of our UK
viewers none of this is new to you
having debuted back in Scotland in 2004
here's how corridor averaging in a LPR
is used a camera recognizes your car's
license plate at one point on the road
as you drive down the road further
additional cameras recognize your plate
again and again and record it each time
with a time standard since the distance
between those cameras and the times at
which they spotted you is known a little
simple math results in an average speed
and potentially a ticket one of the
first major US tests of corridor
averaging with a LPR was in Montgomery
County Maryland which added the tech to
its standard speed cameras in 2012 the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
has since used it as a study base and
just released a few numbers they
estimate these cameras generated about a
30% decrease in fatalities and serious
injuries that would mean 21,000 fewer
deaths and serious injuries if this was
used nationwide and that in Montgomery
County fatalities and serious injuries
fell 27% even on nearby roads where
these cameras weren't specifically being
used a spillover effect because I know
you're wondering Montgomery County posts
the location of all of its speed cameras
on a County webpage they're moved
regular and you can be sure that drivers
share those locations on crowd-sourced
nav apps like Waze and there is of
course a vigorous debate as to whether
some municipalities sneakily deploy
traffic cams to generate more revenue
than speed reductions and in some states
notably California this corridor
averaging license plate camera
technology is expressly prohibited as a
speed trap for now at least
it pays to double check what kind of
speed cameras are in use where you
travel and not give them a reason to
notice you at all or car tech
