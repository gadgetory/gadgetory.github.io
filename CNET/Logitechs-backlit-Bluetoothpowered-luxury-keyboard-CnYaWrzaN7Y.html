going to take a look at the Logitech
Bluetooth illuminated keyboard k810 so
as its name implies this is a wireless
keyboard that connects to your various
devices via bluetooth it has some unique
features to it it's also pretty
expensive so one of its biggest selling
points is a series of buttons here at
the top and the function row you'll see
they're labeled 1 2 3 and what they do
is they actually swap between devices
you've already paired to the keyboard
and which you can take the keyboard use
it with a computer but then grab a
tablet grab the keyboard go get some
coffee somewhere and just hit the button
to swap over the pairing and then you
can just type away so you can pair the
keyboard with up to 3 devices and it
works with Android iOS OS 10 Windows 7
Windows 8 I even connected with the ps3
all which had no problems now it is
actually Windows specific keyboard and
that it has a Windows button down here
but it will work with those other
devices no problem along with those
other buttons on the top there's also a
home key that gets you back to the home
screen on whatever tablet or smartphone
you might be using
so Logitech pitch for this keyboard is
that you'll take it and use it with your
computer then your tablet in your
smartphone I'm not really sure that
that's the most obvious scenario
particularly using with a smart phone
but where you might use it is in a
living room if you have multiple tablets
in a house so backlighting is another
feature that's pretty unique this
keyboard and it's interesting because it
has a number of sensors that actually
make it pretty cool so bring your hand
over the keyboard and the backlighting
automatically comes on then an ambient
light sensor detects the amount of
lighting in the room and sets the
backlighting brightness you can also
manually change the brightness with
these two buttons here on the top row
now the k10 doesn't have any batteries
you charge it via this micro USB port
Logitech says a charge will last for up
to 10 days although of course the power
depends on how much lighting you use etc
what I also like about this keyboard is
its design it has a really crisp look to
it it's got metal up here the rest of it
is plastic the keys else are missing
responsive although you'll note that it
looks a lot like Apple's wireless
keyboard you can see the key design is
basically the same the pitch is
identical between the tooth about 19
millimeters they're even roughly the
same size Logitech board is a bit wider
but otherwise they're basically the same
of course if you're looking for hardware
design inspiration Apple is a great
source so all that makes this perhaps
the most feature-rich of this new
two wireless keyboards the only problem
is the price tag it comes in at $99 that
puts it at $40 more than Apple's keyword
or Microsoft's new wedge mobile keyboard
which is also designed for Windows 8
now the backlighting is cool and we can
certainly see some utility for being
able to swap this keyboard between
various devices overall though that
price kind of puts in a luxury territory
that said it does what it does very well
and it looks great doing it so I'm rich
