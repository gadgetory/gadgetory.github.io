virtual surprises this is vrla and I am
standing in the middle of an 84 camera
3d capture rig from blue Vishnu this is
their small rig and just about
everything else on the show floor is
pretty fun so let's check out the show
we're checking out Odyssey vr which you
might be able to see at your local mall
but since we're here we get to see it
first oh it's a swing I'm afraid of
heights I'm all right all right oh wow
that wow that really feels like it's
swinging Bailey's is like and swinging
oh I'm closing my eyes and I'm invert oh
my god oh no I feel like I'd be scared
to do this at a mall my friends would be
making fun of me over guys Heights are
terrified
3d live and meteor mation have partnered
together to bring you this crazy a TV
experience where I am an awful driver
called ion torque and I'm going to focus
on helping not crash this ATV
here at b school they have protective VR
headgear killing the Lightcap keeping
germs off my face and also after I'm
done playing dr i'd go rob a bank
face space is using cameras and led that
can track weapons or just about anything
you can 3d print which is pretty awesome
because I'm wielding a sword that I can
shoot and protect the crystals that's
how it works
in addition to all the virtual reality
happening at vrla there's also mixed
reality i'm wearing hololens and i'm
doing an easter egg hunt inside this
really cool setup now there is one
problem that everybody hasn't quite
figured out yet and that's how to make
it look like you're not hallucinating
while other people are watching you that
isn't red then again it's a pretty good
trip for cnet com I'm Ashley if Kevin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
