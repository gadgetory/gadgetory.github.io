this guy the most compact of their
crossovers the cx-5 first thing I
noticed is kind of chiseled lines
getting rid of what's been kind of an
Archie loopy thing in their design
language and thank you they got rid of
that goofy stupid smiling face I wanted
to slap the out of all the time so now
it's got a more serious front and a more
handsome look I'm seeing some infinity
here but I'm sure they wouldn't want me
to say that inside the cabins gotten
more handsome as well now I can't tell
you a lot about the powertrain because
we're here at the European version of
the vehicle which is a SKYACTIV diesel
however there's another option let me
show you what that is here is the gas
direct injection SKYACTIV skyactiv-g
they call it the key Mazda says is to
get compression ratio higher you get
more out of a gasoline fuel mixture
therefore using less fuel to go as far
as you would on more fuel it's pretty
obvious stuff compressions a tricky
thing them as these pistons come up and
they're compressing it more and more
that charge that mixture of fuel and air
just wants to detonate all by itself
so-called decently even before this
spark plug fires so they've beaten that
three ways ones is little well here on
the top of the piston that they say
improves combustion so the combustion
happens and gets out in front of any pre
detonation they've also got this
interesting injector here which they say
has multiple holes to spray the mixture
more finely and keep it a little cooler
because temperature is the enemy of high
compression and finally they've designed
a very high scavenging exhaust manifold
here it's almost like a set of headers
four into two into one and they say that
draws more hot gas out of the cylinders
faster all of this brings down cylinder
temperature and allows you to run up
compression higher without detonation or
what we all know is spark knock fifteen
percent improvement in efficiency and
fifteen percent improvement in low-end
torque they say the cx-5 is a
good-looking vehicle it's got a handsome
smart look that should play well in this
category where they've been absent until
now and it's a hot category it's one of
those that comes back quickly as certain
kinds of fuel economy
aid from the consumers mind and
eventually as the US recession comes out
of its slump as well now we don't have
pricing on this vehicle to see how
recession friendly it's gonna be one
hits the US market that's down the road
aways because European introduction is
sometime in 2012 with Japan and us to
follow at that point we'll also know
exactly what the power drains gonna look
