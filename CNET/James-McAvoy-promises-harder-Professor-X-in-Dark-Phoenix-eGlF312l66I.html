be a villain in the bondage I've been
asked this always I'd love to be a
villain in a Bond movie but I don't
think I'm James Bond I've never been
I've been asked that a few times I don't
think he's me nor a super villain or
something or henchmen maybe a henchman I
might be a henchman either mean body
okay better don't about henchman that
stuff some kind of gimmick maybe like an
animal or the Easterner like this is my
Pokemon I love him I'm very short hair
