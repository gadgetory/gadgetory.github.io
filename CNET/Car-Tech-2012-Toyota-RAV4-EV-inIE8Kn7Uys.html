electric cars this one yeah kind of
didn't have to exist it was mandated by
law in California not by consumer demand
anywhere but let's see if a shotgun
wedding can actually produce a happy
marriage in this case between Toyota and
Tesla as we drive the rav4 electric and
check the town okay the big headline on
this car of course is the fact that it's
a Toyota with a Tesla powertrain the
other interesting story here is this
electric vehicle is not built on the
latest rav4 which is radically different
but on the outgoing most recent rav4 and
of course it's got a big old battery
slung underneath it which shows if you
look in the back that you're not gonna
have any impediment to cargo carrying or
passenger space inside now spot one of
these guys by the different face
obviously it's almost Gorillaz electric
badges abound all around it you might
spot the little lower ground clearance
it's like an inch or so maybe two inches
depending where you measure it and the
fact that you'll probably be standing in
California if you buy one because that's
the only place they're sold talk about
screens we've got plenty of them here
one two three all LCD no gauges no dials
the one in the center the instrument
panel pretty basic electric stuff you've
got range and charge level on the left
along with that arc that tells you if
you're dipping into power or
regenerating in the middle is your
speedometer odometer gear position
selector indicator but there aren't
really any gears it's a different thing
and that big blue ring says you're in
normal mode that guy turns to red when
you're in sport mode we'll talk about
that at the moment on the right is a
multi display you roll through that with
this button on the right and it's going
to give you a driving range indicator
efficiency trip efficiency Eco coach you
get the idea co2 reduction all these
things that are electric powertrain
oriented that's the IP now let's go to
the climate control this is all new for
Toyota notice as I go through
temperatures it kind of rolls them
through cool little animation there as I
raise or lower the temperature and that
screen is all of your climate control
system including level of eco nests now
this means I can go to four different
settings of how aggressive the climate
system is Eco low it's gonna buy us a
little more toward power savings Eco
high it's really gonna
store power savings personally I'd
rather that be figured out by the car
there's a little bit too much in terms
of levels of settings from me to worry
about but we're at that kind of gimmicky
era for electrics so I'm not too
surprised okay now to the main show the
big LCD here now an 8 inch so big they
had to get rid of dedicated buttons
there aren't any everything is on screen
now well save for one you've got a home
button here I'm surprised Apple hasn't
sued them yet that's just like on an
iPhone or an iPod or an iPad first off
they break up the media across an
endless number of buckets radio is under
here which includes am/fm satellite and
HD radio on those same tabs you can go
over to USB for a thumb drive or an iPod
bluetooth streaming auxilary jack as
well now you're into the Entune apps
which are still kind of class-leading
being open table pandora movie tickets
iHeartRadio and unique on this vehicle a
charging station map that's where you're
gonna find out where the nearest
charging stations are if the damn thing
would ever work which it won't
which brings us back to the navigation
system in this car which we've seen
before on Toyota vehicles except it's
got a couple of different tweaks first
of all here is a split screen with
energy efficiency taking up part of the
map if you want it to but you've also
got this evie menu down here which will
give you a range map and this is kind of
like a sonar around your current
location that will show you in that big
blue circle roughly how far you can go
as the crow flies that's not the same as
driving distance before you are flat out
of gas hit it to round-trip and die cuts
it in half so they've woven a number of
Eevee centric features throughout the
different screens however oddly enough
on the navigation map you still have a
set of POS that include gas stations now
one choice on the sound system as there
tends to be in electrics and plug-ins
it's not going to be a huge power big
thump and multi sub system because that
draws a lot of current instead up here
you've got this sort of persistent music
icon that takes you to one of the
annoyances on this vehicle you have to
go up here and go to this slider to get
system volume first of all it's not very
accurate it's always laggy behind me
same thing goes for tuning there's no
knob that tuned to do either kilohertz
megahertz or satellite radio stations
you're gonna miss that and I wish they
had a back button so often I want a
physical back button not one on the
screen that tends to be in different
places at different times now in terms
of techno
she controls for the drivetrain you've
got a Prius style shifter it's an
electronic selector it doesn't move
anything up here to reverse is gonna get
you into your rear camera which is
standard on the rav4 electric neutral
Drive pretty simple and then over here
to be gets you additional regenerative
braking or a drag braking for going down
hills or long great pretty handy here's
your sport button this actually
increases the amount of torque though
not amount of horsepower available from
the powertrain
we're gonna talk about that in a minute
when we get underneath the hood steering
of course is all electric there's no
engine to drive hydraulics and we'll see
how that feels and we're out on the road
no paddle shifters because there's no
transmission this is a single speed in
the tesla style a reduction gearbox but
there are no gears synthetic or
otherwise now about half of Tesla's
secret sauce is here under the hood the
motorist associated electronics let's
talk about the power is in this car it's
a very interesting story 154 horsepower
you'd say that is not much for a big
crossover but the torque is what it's
all about this guy will have either 218
or 273 foot-pounds those are nice
numbers why two numbers sport mode
number that button if you're in normal
mode this guy has less torque and a
lower top speed 85 if you're in sport
mode the higher torque number and a
higher top speed 100 miles an hour zero
to 60 on this guy is either 8.6 seconds
or 7 seconds flat again sport mode makes
the big difference and of course you're
gonna peel off a lot of bit of range if
you're LED footing it now in terms of
range at mpge the mpge is relatively
soft in this vehicle it's a big 176
miles per gallon equivalent range is
middled at 103 though Toyota says you
may get as high as 113 if you're driving
in
now just as that power plants got a
multi-tiered story so does the charging
side of the vehicle because you've got a
couple of different charging modes first
of all there's a normal mode that gets
you a little lesser range about 92 miles
on a charge they say but it will prolong
the life of the battery or there's an
extended range mode that's gonna tax the
battery a little more and that will get
you 113 miles of range
hence the EPA Middle's it at 103 like I
mentioned now let's talk about charge
times if you've got the top charger a
240 volt 40 amp charger you can do this
guy up in four to five hours from pretty
much dead flat again that standard or
extended mode is the difference in time
if you've got a 240 16 amp kind of the
wimpiest of 240 circuits you're looking
at 12 or 15 hours now here's the kicker
if you're on a 110 or 120 outlet 44 to
52 hours to do a full charge I mean
you'll forget you own this thing in that
much time so absolutely it must be
hooked up to a high current charger
that's gonna run you about 1600 bucks to
have the Toyota approved one installed
at your place okay put her into drive
and immediately you hear that noise
electric cars have to make up to what is
it 22 miles an hour
very space-age on this one but more
importantly what do you feel and that's
where of course electric torque just
never fails and this is a big boy at
over 4,000 pounds but it still moves
effortlessly because of all that torque
I mean I'm in normal mode now and if I
trounce it hello yeah we got everything
we need now that's normal mode if I put
it in sport it's it's crazy fun you
heard that this car is just all torque
you've got some body roll because this
doesn't have any kind of an active
suspension so you know it still comes to
tip over a bit but again there's more
weight down low to even fight that okay
a rav4 electric is fifty thousand six or
so V's are always pretty stout tee and
knockoff tax credits currently that's
ten thousand total federal and
California the only place this guy is
sold so we're down to about forty
thousand or so and there really aren't
any options to
to go CNET style whether or not that
price makes sense for you is going to
come down to a number of things
including whether you think the
relatively limited range of a hundred or
so and yet the broad utility of a
crossover are pulling it cross purposes
that may or may not be the case
depending on how you intend to use the
vehicle but it could be a crux issue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
