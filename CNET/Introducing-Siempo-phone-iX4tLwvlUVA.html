project that helps to limit the
distractions of a modern smartphone we
demoed its software features on a nexus
5 but this device if funded will be its
own phone that will cost three hundred
and forty nine dollars first it has a
super simple interface you'll get the
essential apps like email a browser and
maps but you won't find any social media
or even the Google Play Store here to do
anything on the phone you have to type
an intention you can call or text your
contacts or make a note to yourself the
sample phone also lets you set up your
notifications in time batches by setting
a regular tempo this helps you retrain
yourself so you don't feel the need to
compulsively check your phone throughout
the day third if you're in a meeting or
just need a break you can silence
notifications immediately for a given
time period by pressing a quick access
button on the side in this demo unit
it's been programmed into the volume
rocker but you get the idea lastly
sample lets you set up a mindful routine
for small goals you want to accomplish
at a set time you can set timers for
tasks like journaling meditating or
exercising this feature is meant to keep
you focused and more goal oriented on
daily tasks that you actually want to do
again this phone doesn't give you all
the bells and whistles of the latest
flagship and it doesn't really aim to
it's for users who consciously want a
calmer and I know this sounds cheesy but
sort of a more peaceful experience with
their phones and Sampo could be a way
for them to finally do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
