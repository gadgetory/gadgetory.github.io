technology getting a lot of attention
right now because TV makers like Samsung
and LG are building LCD televisions that
use them but what are quantum dots and
what do they mean for you quantum dots
themselves are tiny crystals otherwise
known as nano crystals they're way too
small to see but have a special power
when light is shone on them they become
luminous and give off a very precise
color depending on their size the size
of the dots can be very finely tuned so
they give off whatever color light you
want there's a lot you can do with
quantum dots from solar panels to
medical applications but you've probably
heard them discussed most in relation to
TVs what tech companies are doing now is
to put quantum dots in LCD TVs something
television makers say makes for more
colorful pictures to understand why they
say this let's look at how color is
created inside your television in a
normal LCD TV light is shone from blue
LEDs coated in yellow phosphor to create
a white light this light hits a layer of
red green and blue color filters these
are called sub pixels and because red
blue and green can be mixed to create
any color these use the glow from that
white light to create the distinctive
colors that make up a TV picture LCD TVs
that use quantum dots are a little
different instead of a white lights they
use plain blue LEDs which as well as
shining through to those sub pixels also
illuminate a bunch of quantum dots that
have been tuned to give off red and
green light TV makers say that because
the red blue and green colors produced
in the quantum dot set are very pure
they can shine through those filters
with less wasted light than TVs that use
the white lights this the companies say
makes for a better more colorful picture
the quantum dots can be arranged in
narrow tubes right in front of the LEDs
or as an additional layer covering the
entire screen itself the layer method is
the newest and is being used by Samsung
in its su HD TVs for 2015 as well as by
LG the LCD TVs with quantum dots we've
seen so far look great but don't
expect a total revolution in the way LCD
TVs look the jury's still out as to how
much quantum dots can improve LCD sets
but we do know one thing they'll be more
expensive than standard LCD TVs they'll
still be cheaper than OLED however a
completely different display technology
that as far as we've seen has the best
picture of all for now all you need to
know is that quantum dots are a way of
augmenting an existing kind of TV
technology that TV makers say will give
you a picture that's more colorful and
nicer to look at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
