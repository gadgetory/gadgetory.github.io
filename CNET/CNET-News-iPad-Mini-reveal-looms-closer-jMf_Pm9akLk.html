I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com joined by staff
writer Josh Lowensohn to talk about the
latest roundup and iPad Mini rumors so
Josh we hear that an announcement might
be coming soon sure so this is an
announcement about the announcement
really there was a report this morning
from all things D that said we would
have an event on the twenty-third of
October which is a tuesday so that gives
us about a week to get that invite okay
and that means that the product could
then come out ten days to two weeks
after the announcement typically for
Apple right yeah they like to give
themselves some time to get the the
product out to stores of course they
have almost 400 retail stores now and
presumably this will be sold in places
like target and walmart you know they
got to get those devices out and it
takes time and to make that happen so
you can expect a little bit of a delay
right but sooner is obviously better
because let's not forget holiday
shopping has begun the holidays are
right around the corner and this could
be a hot hot gift I'll hide this yeah
there's no doubt that it will be a
sought-after gift and they really have
to get it out at the same time as a lot
of competitors you're putting out their
devices amazon already has their 7-inch
tablet out with the kindle fire but they
also have a larger version coming out in
early november and you can't leave out
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble which has their nook HD
that's coming out too I mean it's a very
very kind of growing market that Apple's
not even in yet right let's reiterate
what is the size again for this iPad
Mini presumably or what are the rumors
for it sure the rumors are that it's
going to be seven point eight five
inches to put that in comparison the
current iPad is nine point seven inches
so it's smaller the whole idea is that
you could potentially use it one hand
you use it in the subway and then it's
just smaller and talk to us about price
do we have any idea what these are going
to retail for sure a bunch of rumors and
supplier reports have put this around
250 to 300 dollars you've got to think
that they have to price this less than
the current ipad of course you can buy
the lowest iPad the iPad to it three
hundred ninety-nine dollars so they have
to do it cheaper than that but they also
run into this kind of problem with the
low end which is their new ipod touch
and this is a device that starts at
three hundred dollars for their their
new and latest and greatest version
that's crazy so this ipad mini what
has a lot more capability than an iPod
Touch could be 50 bucks cheaper that's
where you run in some other problems so
I mean it could it could even be more
than that we don't know hopefully Apple
will kind of explain that I think they
need to explain that because these new
ipods just came out they're not going to
change the price absolutely all right
well as we get closer to the possible
release date i'm sure more views will
start leaking so we'll check back in
with you then right thank you so much
