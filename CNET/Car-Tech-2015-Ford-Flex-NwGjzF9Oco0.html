cut to the chase
I actually like Biff car more than I
thought I would I mean it's big and it's
boxy but something about it just sort of
in gears itself to me it's a big box on
wheel for moving people and stuff around
and the flex is technically an older
vehicle it hasn't changed very much
since this introduction so many years
ago so it is sort of hampered with food
kind of old tech in the dashboard we've
got forged MyFord Touch system which
I've already complained about a number
of occasions it's very slow it's not
really great it gets the job done but it
just feels crunchy and dated on the
positive side though you can get this
vehicle with a lot of cool tech features
including Ford automatic parallel
parking system which is great if you
want to park the car while eating a
two-handed sandwich
here's a cool feature out back we've got
a motorized 3rd row seat that at a touch
of a button fold into a flat loading
floor and then pops back up in the two
seats that adults can fit into but we've
also got a third setting called tailgate
mode that allows the seats to do a sort
of back flip so that you can hang out in
the back of the flicks while you're
tailgating or picnicking it's pretty
cool
the flexes boxiness sort of works in its
favorite what gives it this really
awesome interior volume for example
we've got a really flat roof and on the
outside that's sort of you know a
generic looking styling feature but on
the inside it means that on the third
row you've got as much Headroom as
you've got on the second in first row
which makes this a really awesome seven
passenger SUV in case you ever decided
to shove some adults back there but the
flex is sort of car like ride height
means that it's also very easy to get
into without sort of having to climb up
or grab a handle and hoist yourself up
you just slide into the thing like you
would with a small crossover that's when
a 15 flex is available with a choice of
three engines or the 3.5 liter v6 engine
naturally aspirated and there's an
all-wheel-drive variant of that
powertrain this particular model is the
3.5 liter EcoBoost v6 that's going to
add a twin turbo charging system to that
kicking the horsepower up to 355
horsepower torque also jumps up to about
350 pound feet
the 2015 Ford Flex again started around
$30,000 but this EcoBoost limited
version is pretty close to fully loaded
starting at around 40 but we've got a
couple of options I have bump it up to
that fully loaded line including special
paints a towing package and a tech
package that's going to add the
automatic parallel parking that I talked
about earlier all in we're looking at
around forty nine thousand eight hundred
and forty five bucks now price is one of
the last things that I look at when
evaluating a car I like to decide
whether I like it before I figure out
whether it's worth the money and in this
case almost fifty thousand dollars is a
lot more than I expected this car to
beat so you're going to want to be more
conservative with your options or spend
a little time haggling that price down
at the dealership
