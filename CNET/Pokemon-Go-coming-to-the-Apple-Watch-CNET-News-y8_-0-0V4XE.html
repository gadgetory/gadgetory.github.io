Pokemon can hatch from the egg by
walking with it good news from a
complication on the watch face I can't
see how far I need to walk to hatch an
egg the main screen shows my current
level and XP I need to get to the next
my walk is recorded as a workout this
helps me make faster progress towards my
activity goals all right let's take a
walk during my walk I can see how far
I've walked and the calories burned at a
glance I see which were nearby
so let's keep walking a while Snorlax
appeared if it wasn't for this demo I
definitely will have taken out my iphone
to catch it
oh well let's keep walking when you
approach a puka stop a tap on my wrist
lets me know focus tops are located at
interest in places such as public
artworks and historical landmarks
this one is Bill Graham interesting
let's collect some items I just swipe
sweet I got alterable
with Pokemon go on Apple watch I would
never miss a bouquet stop
oh I think I just earned a gold medal
this means I visited 2,000 pokey stops
that's pretty impressive
I'm going to keep walking to see if I
can hatch an egg oh here we are
this is what hatches yes it's a Pikachu
isn't that exciting now that I've done
walking
let's end my workout the summary screen
shows all my activity and all the items
I collected along the way Pokemon go on
Apple watch will help you to be the very
best thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
