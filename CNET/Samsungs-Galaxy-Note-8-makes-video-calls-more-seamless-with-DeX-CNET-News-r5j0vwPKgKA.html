with Dex it's super cool because it lets
you harness the power of your Galaxy
device sending it to a monitor mouse and
keyboard this is what I travel with a
laptop no bulky bag let's say I'm on the
High Line and I need to talk to Suzanne
about our no-date
presentation we've partnered with zoom
to make videoconferencing completely
seamless so I can just open up the zoom
app and start the meeting with Suzanne
and I love this flexibility where I can
be doing this while I'm strolling down
the High Line oh there she is
hey Suzanne hey I'm just actually
getting back to my desk here so let me
just dock into the deck station what's
great is because I started that meeting
while I was walking down the High Line
on my phone when I'm back up my decks
all I have to do is open up the app and
the videoconference is still connected
pretty cool gonna have to rejoin
reconnect so Suzanne I think I owe you
that updated photo of the note 8 but I'd
like your help with that all right so
let me just share you my screen so you
can see what's going on nice so pull up
Adobe Lightroom go to the photo that we
need to edit here alright it's a
good-looking photo but I think it's a
bit dark so let's do a selective edit
and Wow with the mouse this is actually
really really easy that's cool so
Suzanne I might need your help with
letting me know when the exposure looks
right to you right there perfect
and just to finish it off let me do a
little bit of a crop at the right angle
here I think that's about good I'll save
that
Susannah how does that look awesome
thanks Suzanne which have to do later
now do you see why I love using decks
all the time super simple super easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
