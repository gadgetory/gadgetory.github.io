standing here with John ABS Myer the
director of the Delphi labs in Mountain
View California and the car behind us is
about to go on a very extraordinary
journey John can you tell us a little
bit about where it's going absolutely so
this is the first and longest trip
across the United States it's going
coast-to-coast from San Francisco to New
York we're gonna set off on March 22nd
Sunday it's about 3,500 miles and our
intention is to arrive in New York in
time for the New York Auto Show that's
that's a long route you know mainly be
on freeways you're gonna have to stop in
cities at some point you so we are gonna
have to stop but the purpose of this
Drive is to collect data about highways
across the country so we're really
taking this chance to test our automated
highway pilot and collect a lot of
information to improve the technology
we've spent the last year or so testing
here in California as well as in Nevada
and so we have a ton of information
about urban driving in fact you got a
chance to see it I think at CES this
year in January but this trip the
purpose is really all about automated
highway
but you will be driving automated in the
cities no we will not we can't and of
course if we have high fidelity map
information of those cities but in this
case we're really focused on the highway
okay so driver will take over when you
get ready it's on man stop overnight on
ramp to off-ramp highway pilot
registered the sensors on the car you
got radar you mentioned them lidar yeah
so there's roughly 20 sensors on the car
it has radar which are high-volume
mass-production sensors those sensors
are on all four corners plus front and
rear there's also forward vision systems
and the vision systems are used for
things like traffic sign recognition
pedestrian detection as well as a
traffic light recognition and lane
marking detection it also has light
hours around the car which are a third
sensor for redundancy but also for
higher fidelity information like in
urban driving and then it has high
accuracy GPS as well as vehicle to
vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure
communications okay and the then it's
got a brain that obviously processes all
that information what we have is we call
a multi domain controller and it's sort
of like the the brain of the vehicle
it's pulling all the information
together fusing the data and then making
complex decisions about how to make the
car move down the road and as it's
driving are you worried about getting
traffic tickets or speeding tickets or
anything like that
we don't anticipate that this car is
going to be hands-free 100% of the way
across across America in fact we're
hoping to learn what those corner cases
are and what areas in the country there
could be differences where we need to
develop the system further do all the
states are gonna go through permit
autonomous driving an awesome question
so actually five states regulated or
actually five places right Washington DC
California Nevada Florida and Michigan
there's regulations in place that
require documentation and training
programs etc the rest of the of the u.s.
does not have regulation and what that
means is that self-driving or automated
driving is not precluded but it doesn't
necessarily mean it's legal we've
reached out to all the states that we're
going to be passing through we've
notified them and in some cases gotten
feedback just reminding us that we have
to follow the laws what's the next step
what's the drive after this yeah not
really sure yet but but but we'll see
hopefully then next step is is really
being able to bring these to mass
production bring these systems and
software solutions into the mass market
all right well thanks John appreciate it
thanks Wayne right when cutting I'm
gonna see that here with John ABS Meyer
looking at the autonomous car that's
going to go from San Francisco to New
York
