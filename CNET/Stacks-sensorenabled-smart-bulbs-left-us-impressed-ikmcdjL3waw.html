smartest smart lights I've tested in a
while they're not Philips hue bulbs
they're not lifx bulbs either they're
the stack LED downlights now I've got
the starter kit here comes with two
floodlights and the hub that controls
them for ninety nine dollars the bulbs
are really interesting because they
change color temperatures tunable so if
you wanted a nice hot white light in the
morning and then a relaxing yellowy
light at night you can set them to do
that automatically you can also schedule
them to come on in the morning to wake
you up or change color temperatures
during the day based on a schedule a lot
of the basic features you might expect
from a smart lighting kit what's really
interesting about these bulbs that they
also have sensors inside of them sensors
both for presents and for ambient light
so there's a lot of sunlight coming in
through the windows during the day they
can automatically dim down to help save
energy and if they see you walking into
the room they can turn on automatically
these bulbs also sync up with the Nest
Learning Thermostat in the stack app you
can set your rooms based on how warm or
cold they are so if they're a little
warmer than the average temperature in
the house or a little cooler you can
tell the app that and then when the
bulbs know that you're in those rooms
they'll tell the nest that and the nest
can heat a little more aggressively or
cool a little more aggressively based on
what you want the bulbs also work with
if so if you wanted to craft a custom
ifft recipe that works with Alexa like
Alexa trigger movie mode and the lights
dimmed down you can do that too the
stack bulbs tested well in our lighting
lab they also have a very comprehensive
app that has a ton of setting so if you
want to get really specific with how
they work you can do that and at 45
bucks of bowl over ninety nine dollars
for the two bolt starter kit they're
less expensive than Philips hue and lifx
bulbs that don't have extra sensors in
them I think that's a pretty good deal
and that makes these one of my favorite
new bulbs at the market</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
