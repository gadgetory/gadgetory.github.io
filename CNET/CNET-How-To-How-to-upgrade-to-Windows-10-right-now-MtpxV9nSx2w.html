we've seen from Microsoft in a while and
it's free for Windows 7 and Windows 8
users so there's no reason why you
shouldn't upgrade your computer or
tablet today I'll be showing you how to
install Windows 10 on your machine
without waiting one more day now before
we begin make sure you're eligible for
this upgrade meaning you have one of the
two versions of Windows I just mentioned
and that you're the administrator of
this machine and once you clear these
hurdles make sure to backup your machine
in case anything goes haywire during
this operation you can check out Dan
Graziano's article on cnet.com about how
to prep your computer before installing
Windows 10 next check to see that you've
installed all the updates available for
your machine if you're up to date you
should see this window icon on the
bottom right-hand side of your screen
and if not head over to the Start Menu
on your computer I'm using one running
Windows 7 now select all programs and
click on Windows Update and if it's not
up-to-date you'll get prompted to
download the latest version check the
box or multiple boxes select ok and
install keep updating until you see the
window icon appear on the corner and now
the fun begins
click on the icon and reserve your free
copy of Windows 10 once you've completed
the reservation process you're at
Microsoft's mercy you'll get an email
confirmation for your reservation but
then you'll have to wait for your copy
to arrive this may take days or even
weeks luckily there is a workaround that
can get you up and running the same day
but proceed with caution because this is
a bit more complicated than just waiting
it out head over to the windows download
page scroll until you see the download
tool and click on the version you need
most users will be on 64 bits but you
can always double check by going to the
Start menu right click computer
properties and check next to system type
now back in the download page run the
download tool and select update this PC
and click on next now let the waiting
game begin once the first part is done
you'll have to click next and then
install it'll restart a couple times
before it's ready to go once it's all
done you'll see a welcome message click
next and now you'll begin to set up your
new operating system I'm going to use
the Express settings for this video but
you can customize your own on the left
hand corner
complete the installation process and
when it's done setting
up you'll have your new windows 10 up
and running complete with your
refurbished Start menu and live tiles
and there you have it now enjoy your
smoothly running machine remember we
have more tips and tricks on Windows 10
at cnet.com or you can tweet me if you
have any more questions for CNET i'm
