back to the late 60s then a wonderland
of things like color TV high five and
just living better electrically it also
raised the curtain on new ideas like the
VCR the camcorder CD players and
high-def TV in 1998 the same year the
show moved to its annual top of the year
position in Vegas signifying the
beginning of a new year in tech in many
ways here's what we're on the lookout
for this year phones are the biggest
category in consumer electronics today
dominated of course by Apple and Samsung
but keep an eye on lenovo huawei and
Alcatel as they seek to become big
players in the US market also trying to
build a major phone business in the US
is Microsoft which has avoided CES the
last few years but may make a big phone
push this time the first year since it
fully integrated Nokia's phone division
and of course vast square footage will
be devoted to cell phone cases ear
pieces and accessories some of which we
don't even sure what they do TVs have
always dominated CES once you get past
the usual announcements of televisions
too large to fit through your front door
look for 4k resolution to declare its
dominance in 2015 4k content streaming
will be just as important as the TVs
themselves and while we expect the new
4k blu-ray disc format in 2015 CES may
be a little too soon for its formal
announcements
there will again be curved and flexible
tds and again the editors of seen it
will be asking why the Fitness wearables
market exploded at CES two years ago and
it's now starting to congeal into a more
manageable array this CES should bring
heart rate monitoring to the must-do
list on all those fitness bands that
currently focus on stairs steps and
sleep virtual reality and augmented
reality glassware may be the most
innovative thing we see at the show this
year as developers show more finished
and elegant glasses services and apps
that bring this category we believe into
the mainstream in 2010 Ford CEO Alan
Mulally delivered the opening keynote at
CES the first time the auto industry
took the top stage and since then the
show has been a major car tech showcase
Ford Mercedes Audi Chrysler Hyundai
mazda they're all going to be there
expect them to emphasize connected apps
often through apple carplay and android
auto increased self-driving technology
and new interfaces in cars including a
big push toward head-up displays it all
unfolds first and best at CES cnet com
