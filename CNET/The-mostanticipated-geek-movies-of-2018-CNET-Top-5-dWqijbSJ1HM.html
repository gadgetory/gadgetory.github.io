geek movies of 2018 as chosen by the
CNET audience we asked you as cnet.com
to let us know which film you can't wait
to see out of a possible 9 here are the
top five vote getters let's get to it
we've got a tie to start at number 4 is
solo a Star Wars story garnering 13% of
the vote the film has seen very little
promotion as of yet but it is a while
before the May 25th release date however
that doesn't mean the solo movie has not
been in the press all kinds of reports
popped up including why the movie's
original directors left the film
hopefully the story in the solo movie
will eclipse all the pre-release stuff
in a good way
also number four is black panther which
also got 13% of the vote
unlike solo Disney has gone full steam
ahead with its promotion of black
panther the film will take us at two
challahs homeland of Wakanda which has
tech not widely seen within the greater
Marvel Cinematic Universe black panther
hits theaters on February 16th coming in
at number three is The Incredibles 2
with 14 percent of the vote speaking of
14 it's been 14 years since the original
Incredibles movie so they could be pent
up demand for another one also The
Incredibles isn't tied to a much larger
universe so maybe it's just easier to
get into as an aside you should check
out the Pixar theory online this theory
says that all the Pixar films are
actually part of the same world but at
different times coming in at number two
is Deadpool - with 15 percent of the
vote the trailer for the sequel suggests
the tone of Deadpool - will be similar
to the first film oddly it's the first
superhero movie in years to use the very
famous John Williams Superman theme what
an idea
and at number one is a vengers infinity
war which grabbed 35% of all votes the
entire Marvel Cinematic Universe has
been building to this movie for 10 years
it pretty much has every major Marvel
character like Iron Man Captain America
Hulk spider-man and the list keeps going
so far the MCU has been great at
superhero interactions and we're bound
to see some fun combos like Thor and the
guardians of the galaxy a quick note
before we wrap up and man and the wasp
grabbed only 1% of the vote that shows
you how competitive things have gotten a
big thank you to everyone who voted
