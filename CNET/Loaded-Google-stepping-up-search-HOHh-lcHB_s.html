loaded Google is revamping its search
function to stay competitive according
to The Wall Street Journal the new
google search will apparently dish out
information that's more relevant to how
we think for example Google is working
on improving semantic search it means
searches we better match with entities
like people places and things so when
you search for Lake Tahoe you won't just
get the website for Lake Tahoe but also
get facts about the lake like location
altitude average temperature and salt
content there's no specific timeline yet
though for the launch microsoft is
working on a new way to blend physical
and virtual worlds with something called
the Bema Tron microsoft research teams
combined a projector with a Kinect
sensor and it beams the image of a toy
car into a room the sensor can quickly
detect 3d objects in a room like walls
or even someone's foot and that toy car
image reacts to real things it can't
drive through a wall but it could say
drive over your shoe researchers posted
a video showing the Bema Tron car
navigating a room bumping into obstacles
and reacting to real world ramps aside
from games researchers are thinking this
technology can be used to project pop-up
alerts and notifications about objects
