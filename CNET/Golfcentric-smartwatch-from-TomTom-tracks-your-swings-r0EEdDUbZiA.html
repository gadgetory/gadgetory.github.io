gadget that their hopes will improve
your game it's called the golfer - it's
a SmartWatch let's see what the company
is driving at get it
so this watch has two new main features
the first is auto shot detection which
means that as you're following through
on your swing it'll give a little buzz
to let you know that it knows that
you've taken a shot every shot you take
will be logged using the watch's GPS so
that you can review it later on a
smartphone and let you know where your
game was going well and where it wasn't
a satisfying amount of what this watch
does is automated so if you use this
four-way navigation key down here you
can see nearby golf courses there are
40,000 golf courses logged in here and
if you dive into the information you can
also see the distances what the par is
for each hole there's lots of
information to dig into because of the
watch's GPS powers you'll also be able
to get key distances like the distance
from you to the all-important hole and
it's also got interesting maps of the
actual green itself which shows you
hazardous areas that you'll want to
avoid it's water resistant so if you're
determined to trudge around the green in
the pouring rain this watch can handle
it it'll also count calories it's got a
step counter and it tells the time
expect 11 hours of battery life when
this thing is in its GPS mode it's going
to cost two hundred pounds or two
hundred and forty nine dollars when it
goes on sale in May</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
