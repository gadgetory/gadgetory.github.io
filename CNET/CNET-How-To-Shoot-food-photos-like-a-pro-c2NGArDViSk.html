and you've got beautiful food in front
of you you might be tempted to take a
photo of it and upload it to Instagram
but there's a lot more to consider than
just applying a filter I'm Sharon Vaknin
at Dobbs Ferry in San Francisco with a
few tips on how to take spectacular food
photos
lighting can make or break a great food
photo it can make your salad look even
better than it tastes or it can make
your food look like something the cat
dragged in
so look for a spot in the restaurant
with soft natural light it'll really
bring out foods natural textures and
color for times when you're dining in a
dimly lit restaurant do not use your
Flash not only will it annoy all of the
patrons around you but it's the fastest
way to make your food look super
unappetizing instead use what's around
you right now the restaurant is pretty
well lit but if it was darker I'd move
this candle closer to my plate and use
it to light the food and I move this
stuff out of the way and hold your phone
very still as you take the photo also if
your phone has HDR mode now is the time
to enable it once your lighting is set
it's time to start thinking about
composition most of us will naturally
put the food in the center of the frame
but you'll get a much more compelling
photo if you put it off to the side and
crop out some of the plate take one like
that and we'll move it around it's
always good to take as many photos as
possible so you have lots to choose from
check out these two photos the one on
the right is the one I'd want to eat
personally I really like the overhead
angle it lets you see everything on the
plate plus it just looks really tidy
same rules apply here shoot off-center
and crop out some of the plate that's
beautiful
but if getting out of your seat in the
middle of a restaurant makes you feel
kind of weird the 3/4 angle is the go to
so those are the biggies but here are a
few extra tips for really good looking
food photos first always shoot the
pictures as soon as the food comes out
of the kitchen when it's still hot and
it looks really fresh you can also
create a cool-looking photo by putting a
little bit of it on your fork like this
so just hold the camera in one hand get
some of that goodness on your fork and
then bring it closer to the lens so that
that's in focus and everything in the
background is out of focus now is also a
good time to use that focus and exposure
lock option on your phone just tap and
hold to set the focus now once I've got
a few photos that I like I want to
upload them to Instagram but first I
like to apply a filter using an app
called vsco cam so just add a filter
give it a final polish and now it's
ready for uploading now I'll just wait
for the likes to come in and let
everybody be jealous of my fabulous food

your own hit me up on Twitter and check
