premium bluetooth headphone which is
where products like JBL z55 bt come in
and over ear headphone and top-end model
in JBL value e series line of wireless
headphones the e55 bt is the successor
to the e 50 bt and retails for a hundred
and fifty dollars it comes in multiple
color options this headphone didn't blow
me away with its sound or build quality
but it's a likable headphone that sounds
quite decent his attractively designed
fits comfortably and has good battery
life at 20 hours at moderate volume
levels like the on ear e45 bt the e55 bt
has integrated music control buttons on
the right ear cup along with a
microphone for making cell phone calls
and also comes with a detachable fabric
cable with a one-button remote for Wired
listening no carrying case is included
unfortunately equipped with 50
millimeter drivers this headphone
delivers a good helping of bass but
manages to avoid sounding boomy or muddy
there's a decent amount of detail for a
bluetooth headphone but this model
doesn't quite offer the richness and
sparkle of some higher-end bluetooth
headphones nor does it have extra
features such as active noise
cancellation found in JBL step up
Everest elite 700 Wireless noise
cancelling headphone I do like this
headphone better than the earlier a 50
BT and hopefully like that model the e55
BT should drift down in price well it's
not a bad deal at $150 I'd like to see
it in the hundred to $125 range to call
it a really good value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
