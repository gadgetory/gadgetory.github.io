2017 i'm brian tonya with me is the
handsome David Katz Marv have you been
introduced like that before always see
okay my assistants part of my contract
yeah they wrote that in the actual
prompter he is reviews TVs and among
other things has obviously been super
busy this entire week and what we're
here for we're talking TV shows and
really we want to talk about what you
love you and I exchange basically sat in
a booth for two hours and talked about
exactly this so they're like hey why
don't we just put these two guys and
talking about the same exact thing yeah
the Sony booth it's just crawling with
new TV technology we were there you know
shooting videos making making it happen
on the opening day but yeah it was fun
now the day one the keynote I felt like
LG basically threw down the hammer and
was like you know what CES 2017 first
keynote boom this is the most
sensational product you might see here
at the show talk to us about it and what
makes at least that special and why
maybe we should care so this is the
wallpaper television we're talking about
so w7 it's their first TV that is what's
three point five no three point eight
millimeters thin so like about that thin
and that you put that up on the wall and
it basically blends completely in a
while you can see the video here the
coolest part about this like I've been
reviewing TVs for a while and I'm always
like oh nothing on TV Oh what are we
gonna do it's like okay fine it's a TV
but there you put them on the wall there
like that
you know they're there they're sticking
out a little bit this once it's
completely part of the wall it kind of
blew my mind now I had seen this thing
on a trip to Korea a couple years ago in
concept form guy hands me this sheet
basically like a thing a cellophane
black thing like flopping around and
he's like we're gonna make this into a
television and I'm holding it like what
are you gonna do it was like this ribbon
dangling from the bottom of it how do
you plug anything into it so what they
did is they just basically created the
sound bar you know that got all the the
HDMI and everything connected to it
there's a little ribbon cable that runs
up you can see right there runs up
through the wall and that supplies the
power and the HDMI so they solve that
problem of course you have to use the
sound bar you know it's an $8,000
television actually they just the
pricing just kind of leaked on Best Buy
so LG wouldn't tell us until now we went
you know total Google search found out
that thing is actually built for
pre-order now for the 65 inch size 8
grand
oh it's eight grand see I we were we
were trying to guess is it gonna be like
maybe 10 grand somewhere around there so
eight grand is what I'm going to start
it all so now it's it's eight thousand
that means there are other Oh LEDs which
by the way have the best picture coral
have you ever tested and why appear yeah
amazing television those guys they have
four of them this year step-down series
those are going to be progressively less
expensive my hope is at the cheapest one
which LG says has the exact same picture
quality's all the more expensive ones
meaning you know that's the one you want
to buy I'm hoping that things like maybe
2500 for 65 inch come holiday season
maybe two grand if we get really lucky
so that's kind of the most exciting
thing that I've seen at the show and
also for those of you that don't even
know what we're talking about all I can
tell you is I we implore you to go to
LG's booth up when you're here at the
show and look for this you can just ask
well you won't even have to ask you'll
see they're everywhere you'll see it and
it's their wallpaper TV and really it's
I haven't seen anything like you said
that's kind of blown our mind from the
TV space until then after all these
years and you've seen so many TV well
the thing about CES it's all concept
stuff there's a lot of mind-blowing
stuff here but you're never gonna be
able to buy it and and again it's for
fail to preorder de Beauvoir so you know
it's OLED and they can do some really
amazing things with organic
light-emitting diodes obviously they
give you perfect black level viewing
angle is great it's a lot like plasma
used to be even better and super super
super thin and it's the first time
you've seen that really thin application
differentiate itself from what you can
do with LCD and I don't I do want to
keep on talking about this for one
second because when you and I have been
talking about this you told me that they
literally had to make the TV thicker
than they needed to really to create
some sort of a frame so they can allow
sound ship yeah yeah hold right yeah
yeah so I'm sure when I open the box of
the review sample it's going to be you
know the styrofoam is gonna be like you
know the little thing maybe like
gingerly pull it out of there but yeah
they had to stiffen it and basically
just you know put some plastic on that
floppy you know OLED element that I
described before to make it you know
something that you can sell and it does
the bottom of the of the frame that
comes with it is a magnet the top is
basically screws so it's a standard you
know well mount 18 pounds you could put
it on it you don't feel worried about
studs or anything like you put it on
drywall don't forget about it so even
you could lift it up on the
yeah I mean well I need a friend there
they probably tell you to use two or
three people just for a you know to
cover their there asked with the lawyers
but yeah it's it's it's a pretty amazing
totally awesome what other stuff stuck
out you I mean you are our TV gurus yeah
so we were in the Sony booth you and I
and we saw the press conference and it
had been rumored but now yes Sony is
also making an OLED television so
they're using LG displays panel you know
LG Display Korea they're the only ones
that can make these large format OLED
things and not you know throw away 90%
of them but they're finally selling now
to Sony and and Sony is marching that TV
United States so you're going to have
competition for the first time between
LG and Sony with this new technology
OLED and you know from what I've seen
it's a really good-looking television we
did some some demos it's impossible to
say which one's better or even more
importantly whether the Sony one if it
is better will not be too expensive to
be worthwhile for most people
Sony hasn't talked about pricing yet but
that's going to be available in the 5565
77 inch size again and Sony did
something really cool yeah so I don't
know do you see that that like the sad
thing a little if we have the video
plane up in there's probably moments
where you can see it but on the rear
side you'll see this this bar I think
we're starting to get to it but it
stretches from one side of the back it's
a black bar and those are actually like
transducers that vibrate the screen
right you want to talk about the
acoustics or some bizarre yeah so so and
again I saw this earlier at the LGD the
LG Display booth which is private booth
over here
and they they walk me over that does the
coolest thing we have and they can to be
this little like thing that looked like
a watch battery almost bigger and
they're like this vibrates the screen of
the OLED TV to create sound and like
okay uh you know does it make the
picture while Bowl that was my first
question like no no it's a did a little
demo and you can even see the stuff is
bouncing around on the on this you feel
the screen and it's got you know actual
vibrations the point is supposed to be
that it you know it removes the issue of
voices coming from a speaker above below
if you have a center channel from the
either side it localizes like somebody's
talking on the screen the sound comes
right out their mouth oh the middle of
the screen yeah I mean I did a demo
whatever
that's not a huge deal but the best
thing about is I guess that it hides the
speakers but again if you're paying this
kind of money yeah we always say invest
in a decent speaker system because you
know the speaker's building TV are one
thing but you're going to get so much
better experience if you spend a few
hundred dollars and get a surround sound
or even a good sound bar with something
like this so it's it's a differentiator
for Sony and it's a cool design you can
see it's got this kind of angled back
that that cloth looking thing is
actually subwoofer so they try to do
something with a sound on it and they
have you know a nice design but we'll
see what happens when it compares to LG
and more importantly how much Sony want
to charge yeah that's the question that
we all have I mean are any of you guys
and gals out there right now are you
even in the market for a TV or you come
here to kind of Google and Google at
that stuff in the market excellent yeah
so I'm so he's we'd all my prices to
fall right that's basically yeah
everybody everybody I mean that's and
that's really what's happening yeah it's
it's already starting to happen uh even
LG's current o o LEDs this holiday
season right all of a sudden there's
like this 40% discount drop that came
out of nowhere yet they were four grand
and all of a sudden they're three and
then they ran it like a thing where
they're twenty hundred they're just talk
about a 65 inch again so six five
hundred TV 65 inch TV for twenty eight
hundred bucks is you know it's it's in
some people's wheelhouse you could make
that argument you know the other people
that have a stake in your home so you
know and I think next year you mean
translation significant other yes like
we can lose those are discussions that
need to be at a certain point you know
and and that's where it's realistic
because you know you turn to Samsung and
that's LG's principal competitor by the
way if anybody doesn't know Samsung is
still by far the number one TV
manufacturer in the world and they sell
you know exclusively LCD based
televisions which is not OLED they
didn't you know they came over a few
years ago but they're they're
concentrating on LCD they're innovation
this year is Q LED which you know by the
way is still an LCD well that's what I
was going to ask right they're using and
we have it here for you guys to watch on
screen they're touting this Q LED
technology but you are saying it's
actually LCD technology with with kind
of we know with their own twist in there
a name to it right yeah yeah so last
year was so HUD or su HD or that one
yeah see you actually that's too much
insight yeah super was it super ultra
high definition
I got thrown out with the bath water um
but now they have cue LED which stands
for quantum something led so it
light-emitting diode the point is there
they have a quantum dot layer that they
just had the same one they had last year
they've improved the quantum dot layer
so now they have a better blight output
because fun about to help improve the
efficiency of the backlight and they
also improve the color so they have a
wider color gamut probably a very very
good looking television samsung says
it's their best LCD television whether
it's better than OLED is a really tough
you know row to hoe especially because
at the high end they got rid of full
array local dimming on their sets and
now they're all edgelits so long story
short samsung has it has some tough
competition and that's the high end of
the TV market where oullette has been
really really getting share Samsung's
advantage and LCDs advantage is that the
large very large screen sizes you know
are only available in LCD so if you want
something bigger than a 60 75 85 you
want to go to those right yeah and and
you have those dudes you know I want to
be one of those dudes one of those dudes
yeah you could be because the thing is
they're so there's so much inexpensive
now I mean that the prices on 70-inch
TVs the 75 inch TVs are just going down
85 inch TVs are available now and
they're not gonna I mean they're they're
still super expensive but my point is
OLED is only 65 so it you gotta some
people are all you ask me like you know
is it better to go to 70 inch you know
blah blah blah or or a 65 inch OLED
doesn't how close you're sitting you're
you know how you know how big your room
is that sort of thing but you know so
that's where LCD at the high end is
really still going to be the choice do
you do you know when will even see
larger than 65 OLED or they're they're a
little apprehensive about that well
right consistency yeah that so the issue
now is they do make 77 show lights but
the problem is that they don't have the
yield they don't have that we talked
about for thrown away 90% of the panel's
did still issue to get the yield up so
they're extremely explicit that LG's
7000 latest 20 grand right now yeah buy
one you can buy one too right I can't -
I like it by 10 for sure right um so
those that that price they's tell me is
probably not going to come down this
year they're going to continue selling
even Sony has a 77 inch you know model
in line but that's not gonna help
anybody you know so it's a question of
when they can get that 70 70 size
they're saying that you know it
still work-in-progress to be able to
compete with the very large screen LCDs
and then you know we talk about size
everyone what's the biggest and baddest
screen but we saw really one of the
coolest things that can help you
accomplish that with really without a
traditional screen right this is a
Sony's 4k HDR throw short throw
projector yeah this it's not necessarily
affordable everyone you can buy it but
this was pretty mind-boggling when we
went to go see that demo yeah so I mean
and that's kind of a you talk with you
very large 85 inch TVs
sorry this is BCS day to ya gonna make
some make it 3-2 what I sleeping with a
bag over his head on a chair that was
you so this is a hundred inch projector
screen basically and it's basically a TV
because it's 2,500 nits that's very
bright you most projectors you think you
got have a darkroom you got up you can't
walk in front of the lens it's it's a
whole dedicated home theater thing and
those look spectacular when you turn the
lights down but you want a television
you can watch anybody could watch
anytime so yeah I just want to really
quickly show here people that are
watching yeah this is think of this as
like a box that sits against your wall
you could put it in a built-in cabinet
and it shoots that image onto your wall
you know it's not it's nothing
traditional so when you look at these
images like well where's this coming
from
it's that rectangular box that you see
right there yeah and and the thing I
mean it's 25 grand one reason it's
really really bright another reason it's
4k resolution its HDR compatible not
going to have the kind of HDR forms of
an OLED but it's 100 inches and 120
inches depending on how large your
screen you want to put on it
interestingly a high sense the Chinese
manufacturer that's been making inroads
on the budget end in the United States
they announced another product it's very
similar 4k HDR really high light output
includes the screen and a 5.1 surround
system because why not
that's 13 grand so this type of
technology is a pretty cool alternative
if you're that guy that's like you know
what 85 just not big enough I want to go
and you know yeah gotta go large herb
yeah might as well
but that Sony's a pretty pretty
beautiful looking piece and then also
like at CES we like a lot of companies
like to show off the biggest the baddest
the best and I don't know about you at
least from the most visually impressive
screen that we saw was the Kalidas demo
from Swedish come
all ladies demo Cletus and finally my
everything is stands for crystal LED
integrated system um I got a Chancellor
how did you
Thanks did you yeah dude that's pretty
good thanks let me say that I had times
you guys know that crystal lol will see
it I know something that a cat's mayor
doesn't know what type of world are we
living in good you know Cletus yeah so
um this this display here you can find
it in Sony's booth it's basically a wall
but what makes it special is its 144
little modules they're about 16 by 18
inches there crystal LED modules they're
all stacked together they kind of call
it like the Legos of TV sets but when
you look at this you can tell even from
this video there are no seams on it
whatsoever obviously this is something
that you could use for you know
industrial use I'm sure we'll see this
at future CES is yeah other booths
sporting events but that's a 32 by 9
foot screen 8k by 2k just ridiculous and
it's bright yeah I mean a lot of these
things it's like they have these big
bulbs the resolution is not there this
thing looks like a TV that's 32 feet
long it's so it's one of those things
that you definitely want to go and check
out and see you the good thing is also
it's not a prototype I mean it's going
to be available in production in summer
they said yeah and it's just up to these
companies that want to use it you can
build different types of shapes if you
want to support it with different types
of videos it's really cool up here it's
very nice
so as we kind of keep on talking about
television sets I guess you know we we
talked about the the hot stuff and what
stuff everyone should look at and not
everyone's like well I'm gonna buy that
wallpaper TV like most of us are right
but what about someone who's in the
market because you and I were like I
have a plasma TV I have a panasonic
plasma TV Oh boom
based on your recommendation which I
still love right right but you and I are
kind of that spot like what will be the
next TV yeah so where are you at with
all that well I mean personally uh you
know I'm still rocking Panasonic Plasma
to 65-inch I don't know how long you
know I'm gonna continue doing that but
you know it's it's a tough nap because
if you want a really good you know the
highest quality television oullette I
think is the way to go and but you know
if you know you don't want to pay twenty
hundred dollars because 5ms TV there's
some really good TVs out there available
sometimes for half that
or for you know two grand or whatever
and they're superb televisions so you
know LED LCD is out there we gave some
really good reviews of vizio last year
for those affordable televisions this
year we talked about Hisense and TCL
both those guys are really trying to eat
Vizio is lunch this year and they're
putting out televisions with full array
local dimming which is a technology that
allows you know really good picture
quality LCD TVs
these are lesser-known brands but they
really want to get shares so they're
really relatively inexpensive for these
televisions TCL's coming out with the
full array local dimming Roku TV which
is awesome by the way the Roku operating
systems great yes
500 bucks for a 50 inch model Wow it has
you know really good and it also has
Dolby vision HDR by the way so you know
it's got all these things that the
high-end TV manufacturers putting their
TVs for a lot less and that's kind of
why we've looked Vizio recently visited
announce anything to show by the way
they were recently acquired by Leko
which is another Chinese brand so some
stuff shuffling around they're going to
see what they come up with for 2017 but
those those TVs are really recommendable
but it's hard for me to say you know
what don't just wait you know if your
TVs is good enough now yeah waiting for
OLED prices to fall maybe you know
holiday season 2017 might be the way to
go okay well you know what I'll also
just write the discount what about you
know one quick thing what about don't TV
prices do they tend to drop around Super
Bowl time is that is that a thing
alright it depending often you'll find
the lowest prices around Black Friday
but you know when when TV maker win that
the retailers want to get rid of their
inventory to make room for the new stuff
that we've all seen you know that's why
CES is when it is they go ahead and and
liquidate them you know so the Super
Bowl sales are kind of becoming around
soon and you know you see some really
good prices I know the problem is if
you've waited this long often the TV
that you want might be rare enough they
don't have put it on sale or whatever so
you could get really lucky get some good
2016 stuff that's why it's nice go to
CNN check out our reports of what's out
now then you can decide well do I want
to wait for this newfangled new
technology or is the you know last
year's model good enough
I heard seen that's a pretty good site
to go check I mean I I you know what I
kind of go there
I know I do too all right hey thanks so
much David we've got more good stuff to
come next up Lego is is in the house
stay with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
