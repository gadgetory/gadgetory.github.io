about health whoo so developers have
created a vast array of health care
devices and accompanying applications
everything from monitoring your activity
level to your heart rate to your weight
and chronic medical conditions like high
blood pressure and diabetes but up to
now the information gathered by those
applications lives in silos you can't
get a single comprehensive picture of
your health situation but now you can
with health kit
health kit provides a single place that
applications can contribute to a
composite profile of your activity and
health and health kit comes with a
corresponding application health and
with health you can monitor all of your
metrics that you're most interested in
your activity but not just that you can
use third-party applications now we
carefully protect your privacy so you
have total control over which
applications have access to which part
of your health care information but you
can for instance provide different
activity weight heart rate information
to the Nike app and Nikes working to
integrate health kit so they use that
information to help you in your pursuit
of your personalized fitness goals
now we're also working with the Mayo
Clinic innovators in health care and
with their integration with health kit
they're going to be able that when an a
patient takes let's say a blood pressure
reading health kit automatically
notifies their app and their app is
automatically able to check whether that
reading is within that patients
personalized healthcare parameters
thresholds and if not it can contact the
hospital proactively notify a doctor and
that doctor can reach back to that
patient providing more timely care now
now we think this is going to be really
important for health care and the CEO of
the Mayo Clinic agrees he said that we
believe apple's healthkit will
revolutionize the health industry how
the health industry interacts with
people we're proud to be at the
forefront of this innovative technology
with the Mayo Clinic app we agree now
we're also working with leaders in
healthcare applications like Epic
Systems now they provide the technology
that enables hospitals serving over a
hundred million Americans and so now
with their integration with health get
patients these leading institutions will
be able to get closer and sharing their
information with their doctors and that
is health</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
