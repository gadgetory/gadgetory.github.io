through and through it is part of the
Moto Z family which means that it's got
magnetic connectors on the back that can
accept mods of all sorts view those
cases battery packs or anything else
what makes the z3 place special is that
it comes with a mod in the box this is
an extra battery pack that will take the
phone to two days of battery life on a
single charge
you can set the battery to keep your
phone at a hundred percent or to keep
your phone at 80 percent but you'll get
a little bit longer life if you keep it
at 80 percent I was able to do pretty
much everything on the phone with the
battery pack on one thing I will say
about the mod though is that it's not
very attractive the back of the phone is
pretty sleek it's glass it looks really
nice and but it looks a little haft
finish when you don't have something on
top of it when you put the model on it
it snaps on easily like all the mods do
and it starts working instantly but it
feels a little bit bulky and the backing
which was glass and pretty nice now has
this like semi plastic semi rubbery feel
and it doesn't pick up fingerprints I
like that but it just doesn't really
feel that nice it definitely looks and
feels like a mid-range device unlike
last year's moto z2 plate the z3 play
loses the headphone jack which is a
bummer it's got this USBC connector
which is standard but if you want to use
your own wired headphones you're going
to have to buy a dongle one thing I do
like about the design is the fingerprint
reader on the right side of the phone at
first I thought it was really awkward
because I hold the phone lower so I was
sort of lunging my thumb up to unlock it
but even after a couple days it just
became second nature let's talk about
the cameras there's a dual camera setup
on the back you've got a 12 megapixel
lens and a 5 megapixel lens you can take
portrait shots all the photos were
pretty much middle of the road and all
sorts of lighting conditions indoors
outdoors portrait group shots low light
you name it all of the photos are
totally usable sharing them with friends
directly uploading them to social media
but these are not the kinds of pictures
that you're going to want to use to
print onto a mug for example there's an
8 megapixel front-facing
for all of your selfies it does a pretty
decent job there is a beauty mode and
then there's also an automatic mode if
you don't want to manually adjust I've
always been a really big fan of
Motorola's take on an Android this phone
comes with android 8.0 and the motorola
UI is one that i just find really easy
and nice to work with one example is the
one hand in button navigation at the
bottom of the screen instead of seeing
three buttons to navigate around go home
go back to live reasons etc there's one
slider button and you do everything with
this so you compress it hold to pull up
Google assistant you slide to the left
to go back and you slide to the right to
get your recent apps I think it's really
seamless it's fluid it was easy for me
to pick up and use right away it's kind
of like a better version of what
Google's showing with Android peace so I
do like that it's totally opt-in so it's
not there by default and if you try it
and don't like it you can always switch
back to the stock navigation I like the
Moto z3 play but I don't love it and
part of that comes down to price I do
love the value-add of having this add-on
battery pack that comes in the box but
when you look at some of the competition
for about the same price you're looking
at the 1 + 6 even last year's LG G 6 and
those phones are just they're faster
they're better they do more so until the
price comes down I say go with one of
those when it drops this will definitely
become a better value mid-range offering
