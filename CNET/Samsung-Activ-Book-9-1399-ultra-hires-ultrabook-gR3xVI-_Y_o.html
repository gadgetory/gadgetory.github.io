so long ago that I really loved this
Ultrabook and it was called the samsung
series 9 and now years later Samsung has
gone up and changed the name they're
calling it the book 9 and there's two of
them there's the book 9 lite and the
book 9 plus it's part of the active
series which is really oriented towards
Windows computers the point being that
the series 9 is still out there it's
just changed names and got into a
witness protection program of sorts this
is the book 9 plus and it is the rebirth
of the series 9 and it's pretty awesome
but you're going to pay a little bit
extra for what it offers let me tell you
about it it's a 13 inch ultrabook there
are a lot of these out there why are
there so many do you really need this
many well this is a pretty nice basic
ultrabook under the surface for gigs of
ram 128 gig SSD core i5 processor of the
4th gen the new one that has better
battery life so that's nice what you're
getting here that's pretty pretty slick
is a touchscreen first of all with a
crazy resolution 3200 by 1800 so it was
one of the highest resolution displays
out there what do you need that for I
mean you know you could actually put
your desktop into some sort of crazy
tiny micro text mode but everything just
looks really crisp really readable you
don't have to have the text be that
small but it's got fantastic viewing
angles anyway we always liked the series
9 screen and it's gotten better but you
are going to be paying 1399 for this
laptop it's about three hundred dollars
more than you're going to pay for an
equivalent macbook air with the same
type of specs under the hood so what
you're paying that upgrade price for
here really amounts to that screen now
it's a pretty nice screen really nice
high resolution and if I were shopping
for a Windows ultrabook at this point
this would probably be the one that I
would gravitate to because I like touch
for windows 8 and I like the fact that
its a bright crisp screen and I love the
design this is really one of the
smallest footprint thinnest designs
metal feels rock solid the track pads
good it's a really good solid overall
package it makes me happy and I wasn't a
big fan of the Samsung book 9 lite
because of its more
stick design and the fact that the
processing was not quite as fast but
then again that amounts to about half
the price of the book 9 plus that
language may make you think about going
for that 749 laptop but in my mind I'm
already paying about a thousand so it's
a matter of whether you're going to pay
a couple hundred dollars less or a
couple of hundred dollars more than that
thousand-dollar baseline nevertheless
this is the samsung book 9 plus and it's
the one that I'm more positive about I'm
Scott Steiner that's a little quick look
at the samsung ativ book 9 plus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
