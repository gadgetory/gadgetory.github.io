at us this year from 3d to connected to
LED but of all those features LED is the
one you're going to use every time you
turn on the television I'm Brian Cooley
here to rank the top 5 LED LCD TVs
according to see net reviews corpse
number 5 the Samsung UNC 8000 series
these guys have better black levels than
many other edgelet televisions which are
the really thin kind we also love the
streaming and the Samsung Apps platform
for widgets it converts 2d to 3d which
works better than we expected but don't
buy it for that reason it doesn't even
include a pair of 3d glasses which
should tell you that's not the point
here
it's kind of pricey with a best street
price of about 20 170 the day we shot
this and you give up some off angle
viewing which you'll miss when a lot of
folks come over to watch number 4 is the
sony xba-1 series great black levels
here which is the holy grail for LCD TVs
of any kind and it handles films on DVD
really well which not every television
does it's also 3d compatible has a cool
monolithic look we love but it is pricey
at 2160 street price as of today and as
a local dimming LED it's not as thin as
the edgelet variety more on that in a
minute number three is the LG le 8500
series superb black levels accurate
color really good off angle viewing but
this local dimming LED set does have
some uneven backlighting issues they
don't clobber the overall picture
quality but they impinge on it no 3d on
this guy which is kind of refreshing but
there are streaming services it's ready
for wired Ethernet right out of the box
but Wi-Fi requires an additional dongle
for about 70 bucks number two is also an
LG but the step-up Big Brother to the
last one it's the LX 9500
so take the 8500 add a thinner profile
just one point three inches a super
skinny bezel around the screen 3d 2d to
3d conversion but again no 3d glasses
are include
and they would have to be the pricey
active shutter type to talk to by
yourself and it's not worth it anyway
since the 3d quality we don't think is
fully baked on this set before I get you
to our number one a couple of FAQ points
about LED televisions first of all all
LED TVs are LCD TVs LED is a new way of
lighting the picture for those
televisions and technologically in
applicable to plasma LCD TVs
traditionally have had fluorescent tubes
behind the picture that's how they got
their light well LED LCD sets replace
those tubes with LEDs sometimes they're
around the edge those are edge lit
televisions or there's a full array of
them behind the picture those are called
local dimming sets local dimming tend to
be more accurate in their lighting
Angela tend to be thinner televisions
both are fairly new technologies and
improving fast if you can wait it's
probably a good idea okay let's get to
the number one LED LCD TV according to
see net reviews from q1 2011 it's the
only one that gets a C net editors
choice the vizio XV t 3s v series it's a
local dimming set great black levels and
just about everything else
excellent streaming services and
interactivity widgets built-in Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth because it has a Bluetooth
remote with a built-in keyboard it's
also the cheapest TV on our list by at
least hundreds it does suffer from some
bloomin issues which a lot of local
dimming sets do and doesn't do 3d at all
which can be a plus or minus depending
how you feel about 3d simply put you
can't spend your money any more wisely
on an LED television right now which is
particularly impressive since Vizio used
to be a value brand just a couple years
ago now it's an industry ass-kicker for
more top fives like this go to top-5
