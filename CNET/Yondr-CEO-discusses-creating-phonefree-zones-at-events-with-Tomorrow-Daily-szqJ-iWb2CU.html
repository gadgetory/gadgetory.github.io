there
you're out of concert people right in
front of you trying to videotape the
artist ah can't see anything one company
is trying to change that that company is
called yonder and we have the founder
and CEO here with us to tell us all
about it
gram to goney thanks for being here yeah
my pleasure so well you have the
solution to our nightmare scenario the
worst problem in the world ever this is
this is a device that will stop people
from using their phones at public events
right yeah I guess in the simplest sense
yeah we create phone free spaces but
conceptually
I like to think that we're just kind of
the tip of the spear and in general
movement I love this I think you're I
think you're right because I've gone to
so many shows for example when I saw
Queens at Stone Age at The Wiltern when
they did like clockwork you know as
people do listen that's a humble brag
the Josh Homme II was he said hey guys
but before we start show just put your
phones away let's all enjoy tonight when
Ashley was backstage I'd be dead if that
happened I'm happiness um but like there
is a movement for that and there is
something to be said for really being in
the moment at a concert instead of
getting shaky cam video and and poor
audio from it but you know and always
having your cell phone up and this is
something artists want right this is
something that you're finding not just
audiences want audiences all right
artists one yeah definitely both I mean
if you look at it as artists are the
most sensitive people in the culture
then of course they're gonna be the
first to see kind of what the impact of
radical technological change will be and
so creating spaces where people can be
swept up into a shared mood is something
they value probably above all others so
how does it work
yeah very simple we have three sizes of
case that every phone in the market so
when someone comes to show their phone
slides into one of these cases I guess
boom whoa pops open phone goes in it now
locks your phones now inside yonder
pouch you cannot access it you keep
possession of it
you leave just tapping on one of the
unlocking mechanisms front so I've been
I've been at events where you have to
check your phone and it's always such a
pain because I was at like for example
the Star Wars world premiere the you
didn't check your phone and when you
leave if there's such a line it's such a
hassle so this is a way to not have to
check your phone at all you actually
possession of your own device you have
to worry about getting stolen or lost
exactly and if someone needs to use it
emergency or something like that they
can always step outside the phone free
space and unlock it and use it so really
what it creates is the idea of
essentially phone for you it's it's like
smoking versus a non-smoking sections
but for phones kind of reprieve it this
this is also I would I would imagine it
would extend very much so to comedians
as well because when you are if you guys
don't know how comedians are work out
their bits or there's specials
specifically they'll spend a year two
years three or something I mean they'll
spend a while work shopping out an
entire set and a lot of times they don't
want that work shopping because it's not
the finished product out there for
people but they need to get that
feedback from their audiences so this is
also something that you were mentioning
that comedians are also interested in
definitely I mean exactly what you said
work shopping new jokes but also just
the ability to enter space and know that
what happens there stays there the kind
of fundamental I think to the art form
itself so it hasn't been until very
recently that this has been a problem so
hasn't been until recently that there's
a solution yeah so so you sell this to a
venue or you have this available at a
venue are you finding as places adopt
this technology people are complaining
or having a problem with it is it is it
hard to convince people to use it yeah
what's the what's the audience response
when they come up against something like
this because it's obviously something
they've never experienced before
yeah no the audience reception is
incredibly positive I mean that's one of
the things that early on I kind of saw
by being outed a lot of venues and
talking to people is that the average
person they're kind of understanding of
the problem this general angst about not
just this at shows but the role of
Technology and society generally a lot
further advanced than most people I
think realized so most people are
incredibly
positive if they understand as soon as
they realize they get to keep possession
of their phone they're fine with it if a
few people who get angry but they'd be
angry anyways yeah that's a good point I
think you could actually sell these to
families for a time like everybody put
your phone in your hand
you could make this an IOT thing where
you're like Alexa locked down our phone
somebody just had Alexa wake up I know
I'm sorry
I'm sorry you say miss a from Amazon the
robot in the machine of the echo please
lock our families phones so it there's
really nothing that the no damage to the
phone there's nothing limiting the fun
you can still you'll still hear a ring
potentially well we have different
models that do different things okay
weird answer sort of some of the block
all signals altogether some that don't
they've different use cases so depending
on who the customer is
we'll give them a different case because
I would love to be able to go to the
movies and have everybody's phone not
ring or make a child light up at all
yeah that would be great
so there are versions of this that
actually limit the signal that I can
receive exactly but it's important for
now that this version that I have right
here doesn't because you know if
someone's at a venue they're expecting a
call from the babysitter something like
that they'll feel their phone vibrate
and they can step out and that's
important just for people's you know
comfort that's also where it where it I
think is superior to a check system
because you still as you said if you
remove yourself from the situation or
the area you still have access to your
phone you don't have to go to a a co
checker right own checks well and also
you don't know if you're getting that
call so I think there's if there's an
emergency if there's you know things
that are happening where someone's
trying to eat a hold of you this is a
much better system to have in place as
opposed to a phone check because you
would have no idea until you got out of
that event yeah that's something would
happen so how long have you been
developing Yonder um the concept I had
kind of fully fleshed in about 2012 I
guess and sat on it and started
developing about a year and a half ago I
thought back then it was the issue kind
of had boil to the surface enough people
didn't see the problem so clearly but
the first prototyping everything I did
myself just through Alibaba I'm just
using a Chinese manufacturing and
everything and then hard to design for
him after all of those you know steps
but it's
process so this unlocking mechanism
reminds me a lot of the type of thing
that you would see at a clothing store
or they take off the security tag it
sort of reminds me of that where it's a
survey security tag s like you've kind
of popped out and then you see it's kind
of an interesting were you inspired at
all by that proprietary technology yeah
could you explain how it works in detail
for us I'm just gonna take some notes
yeah was there what was there a moment
in which you were like I need to build
this like what was there a convoy that
you went to was there a time where you
were like okay a news story something
like that where you were like okay I've
got this great idea what was the light
bulb and someone record you when you
didn't want them to yeah no I guess it
was going to a lot of live shows and
just seeing kind of what was happening
in general and kind of observing doing
social trends and etiquette changes over
time which kind of people have a short
memory for things like that but I'm
looking at that and then I guess I was
at one show backgrounds living in
Atlanta and saw a guy there's pretty
drunk he's dancing to strangers
recording him and posted it through the
internet right after the record it and
just sitting there looking at that and
going well if you follow that line out
and see where that goes yeah I think
you'd find it actually what a lot of
people are saying especially in Silicon
Valley about the future of technology is
actually not just not tenable from a
psychological physiological perspective
so I thought for a lot of reasons just
to be social the need for some element
of privacy you know yeah so that was
kind of for me realizing that to me it
became very clear that you know this was
something was going to exist then it was
just figuring out the form how to do it
right I think that's interesting of the
point that you make that it's not just
about creating a safe space for the
artist but also for the people enjoying
the show
sort of let loose have a great time
unselfconscious me unselfconscious about
you know you know if they're of a
terrible dancer for example you know
even if they're not drunk like some
people here at this table to be able to
enjoy themselves without having to worry
about you know being posted to the
internet on somebody else's account or
something like that you really feel like
it's a safe space not again not only for
the artist but also for the attendees I
think that's really cool yeah I agree I
mean that feeling of being onion
it is really important and yeah I mean I
could chew your ear off about this about
kind of the philosophical side of the
whole thing for me but at the end of the
day it's what people go to shows and if
they enjoy it more than a show with
phones then yeah that's it they've made
their association with the idea it's
really not more complicated than that
have there been any specific places that
have adopted this so far yeah so there's
venues all over the country we work with
more artists we're now working with
artists and Europe UK as well and then
our other big customers schools which
was unanticipated but um has turned out
to be really I can imagine yeah yeah no
that's a great point again like having
possession of the phone but not having
access that's that's actually since it's
almost anti cheap technology as well
right yeah that's a good point that is a
really good point um so just out of
curiosity do you are there any other
unanticipated use cases that you were
really surprised about that you said oh
my gosh like I I haven't thought about
that as a use for this but yeah I guess
we could use it for that um no I think
there's different types of utility for
different spaces or different areas so
some of them are pretty practical
whether it's preventing people from
ripping off copyrights and stuff on a
production floor or stuff like that
that's very just kind of utility okay
and then there's more that you know kind
of experiential side which is live music
in these creating these spaces where
people can be swept up into a shared
mood and that's really kind of the most
important to me these other ones are
fine they're good but it's you know
education is important because I think
that we have really figured out maybe
how new digital tools fit into education
in a meaningful way and then
entertainment yeah yeah it's so
interesting that we you know we give
ourselves these these technologies bits
of technology these tools as you said
and we have to figure out a way to force
ourselves to not use them sometimes it's
fascinating yeah and you made a good
point before we started out doing this
interview where you were saying that you
know we're conditioned it's a habit now
to sort of always have our phone either
checking it out constantly or you know
always using it or always kind of being
in that habit of having it out and in
use and so I think this is a really
interesting sort of
to kind of again with the whole you know
keeping people mollified by letting them
have their phone on them but also kind
of saying okay just for two hours just
be in the moment and let's just enjoy
this are you know are you selling these
as a product end users or is it sort of
only a corporate or you know we have
families that have ordered them and use
them at home but more than that it's it
goes with venues and artists or to the
school so it's not really directly to
those people but you know we're getting
kind of new types of deals every day so
very cool who knows so where can people
find out more about yonder over yonder
calm the yonder without an e yes why oh
and ER because when dr it removes your
electronics just trademark stuff would
have added the e if we could and then uh
and then what is like over yonder calm
and then are you guys on social media at
all but anybody want to tag you or ask
you questions things like that we do not
have any social media no Twitter no
Facebook all their phones are locked out
inside the building so that's part of
the movement I like this as more than
just a product but it really is a
philosophical stance that you're taking
which i think is kind of necessary where
we are now yeah it's just more fun yeah
with it thank you so much for for coming
and talking to us about Yonder guys get
ready for the bag put your phone in the
bag well okay if you're watching the
show don't put your phone back yeah put
it in the bag right now
don't finish watching the show and then
for your phone bag we will be right back
we are gonna have a major discussion
about virtual reality B's there was tons
of VR news that happened this last
weekend we really want to talk about it
all week so we decided to make it its
own segment but thank you and stick
around it's tomorrow daily great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
