tainted software I'm Bridget Carey this
is your scene that updated many popular
trusted apps in Apple's App Store have
been found to be infected with malware
and Apple says it's pulling these
problematic programs from the iPhone and
iPad app stores the infected apps were
developed in China
and include WeChat it's a very popular
messaging app in Asian Pacific countries
also infected is the Chinese version of
Angry Birds 2 as well as apps for
banking music streaming a ride-sharing
service stock trading even one from a
mobile carrier the malware hides inside
of apps spying on your personal details
and it can even send palpable Ertz to
trick you into giving up your password
some security experts think as many as
300 apps could have the malware so how
did it happen they were infected before
they even got into the App Store in the
coding process you see when you build an
iPhone app you need to download
developer software from Apple it's
called Xcode and for some that software
can take a long time to download but
there was another version of the
software floating around on forums that
promised to be a faster download for
developers in China and that version of
Xcode was altered and infected and it
tainted every app born from it in a
statement Apple said it is protecting
consumers by removing apps created with
the counterfeit software this was first
discovered and reported by the security
firm Palo Alto Networks and it's being
called the first hack of its kind it's
assumed that Apple's apps are safe
because Apple reviews the code before
apps go into the store but Apple didn't
catch this malicious code as Apple's
popularity grows hackers will target it
more at makers are now reuploading fixed
versions of their apps so if you have
WeChat delete the app and redownload the
new version speaking of Apple being a
target for hackers there's now a 1
million dollar bounty for anyone that
could find a way to remotely break into
an iPhone or iPad running the new iOS 9
software as first reported by Wired a
company called zero DM is paying the
bounty and if there are multiple hacks
discovered the firm will pay multiple
rewards to get the reward you can't
report the bug to Apple they don't want
it fixed the company profits off selling
the secrets to other hackers or
government agencies to
the hack against us it's nasty meanwhile
amid all the drama around problem apps
Apple released a software update to the
Apple watch
it's called watch OS 2 it was supposed
to go live last week on Wednesday but it
was delayed due to a bug found in the
testing process the big feature in the
update is that now apps can run directly
on the watch and tap into data collected
from the watch sensors and that makes
watch apps more useful that's it for
this tech news update you can head to
cnet.com for more details on the new
watch OS 2 from our studios in new york
