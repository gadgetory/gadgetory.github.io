okay we here we have the the chassis and
that the drivetrain of the dual motor
model s I've still got that the front
drive unit the rear drive unit and the
thing that makes this unique and special
and sort of better than or wheel drive
in the past is because you can
dynamically shift the power from front
to rear at the millisecond level so you
can very quickly adjust torque more than
is is possible really with the
mechanically linked system so all all
wheel drive systems out there are just
mechanically linked with with the shaft
so it's like the cooler being sort of
analog whereas this is this is a digital
system with all-wheel drive systems out
there the that you get less mileage it's
less efficient to have to have an
all-wheel drive system but in the case
of the model is because we're able to
have two drive units where we can shift
the power from from front to rear and
and constantly be at the optimal
efficiency point for for each motor
we're actually able to overcome the
penalty of the increased mass of the
motor but this is this literally
everything improves about the car with
dual motor this there's no there's no
sort of technical drawback in this case
but this this car is is nuts it's like
it's like taking off from a carrier deck
it's just bananas it's like having your
own personal roller coaster they just
use it anytime so that I mean it's
really mind-blowing fact that the target
that we had for performance was to try
to meet one of the greatest at the port
the acceleration were the greatest super
cause of all time which is the McLaren
f1 and so we were able to actually
achieve a 3.2 seconds 0 to 60
yeah it's mad okay in fact just just you
know what we're going to have an option
to be in the option selection you'll be
able to choose three settings which is
normal sport and insane it will actually
say insane it's true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
