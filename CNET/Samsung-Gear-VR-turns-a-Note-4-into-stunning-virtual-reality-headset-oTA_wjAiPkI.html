it only costs $200 I'm Scott Stein maybe
that sounds a little grand but you've
heard of VR right virtual reality is in
everything from the oculus rift to
Sony's project Morpheus
and that technology involves you
plugging into a PC or a console but you
can plug into your phone as well Google
cardboard showed that it could be done
and now here is the first one that you
can really buy that's a rig this is the
Samsung gear VR and is $199 accessory
available only in the US for now that
works with just one phone the Samsung
Galaxy Note 4 it's really just a bracket
for it if you open up this here you plug
in your phone right at the top and it
takes advantage of the note 4's 5.7 inch
quad HD display inside there are two
spherical lenses that bend everything
and suddenly turn what you're seeing
into an immersive 3d experience now what
happens in VR we'll imagine you put this
on and then suddenly you see perhaps a
3d concert somebody playing a guitar and
you're sitting in their living room you
can look at them up down all around it's
everywhere behind you has a built-in
accelerometer that tracks head motion it
doesn't allow you to do full head
tracking like some of the more advanced
virtual reality rig scan so you can't
bend down and explore the space but you
can turn around in all directions like
this and use a touchpad on the side to
navigate or pair a Bluetooth controller
to play games with right now in gear VR
there are only a handful of apps and
they all run through an oculus app that
allows you to download the experiences
they're all free and they range from
games to panoramic photos and videos and
immersive theatrical experiences what
you feel like is that you're immersed in
that space but the experience is a
little bit limited because even though
the screen resolution on that phone is
fantastically dense when it's expanded
out in virtual reality you begin to see
the pixels individually and videos are a
little more low res than you might
expect
still that immersiveness create
something that's more eye-popping than I
think I've ever seen before
and I've shown this to so many people
ranging on my family friends a lot of
the tech
experience cynics out there and nearly
everybody is more often than not blown
away by the experience and I can't think
of anything since the debut possibly the
iPhone that's created a technology so
futuristic that everybody wants to line
up and try it out we don't know how many
more apps it'll support down the road
but hopefully with the oculus
partnership this is developed in
collaboration with oculus that you're
going to see a lot of stuff down the
road what you get for your hundred
ninety nine dollars is you get this
headset you also get a micro SD card 16
gigs that's loaded up with some other
experiences that you can put on it and
you get this carrying case but if you
have a samsung galaxy note 4 this seems
like a really good treat to yourself to
just dive in and have fun with it
provided you want to play around with VR
there will be a lot of virtual reality
tech coming up in 2015 from a lot of
different companies new types of input
ways that you can reach out and explore
and this limited set may not fully go
there but it is an amazing first step if
you want to be in a virtual movie
theater swimming and aquarium explore
the solar system play virtual arcade
games that are floating in front of you
and more the Samsung gear VR is the
first available and right now it's
definitely the best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
