reality right now is here you're
immersed in this world and you're there
you're in full 3d you feel like you're
there but then you look down and you
don't have hands you don't have a body
it's something where you actually can't
interact with it and so having a mile in
this environment really helps because
you can actually put the hands in the
game so this is chris here he's inside
of our oculus rift demo this is a very
early preview of what can be done by
combining these two technologies you'll
notice that when Chris moves his arms in
real life his arms will move in the game
and that's exactly what he sees on the
oculus rift headset so this is something
that provides that extra layer of
immersive pneus to the game or to the
content that he's looking on he's able
to actually have his hands in there an
average video game you're sitting on
your couch and you're you're kind of
taking outside of the game like you do
kind of get into it after maybe three
hours of gameplay but you know this one
it takes like five seconds for you to be
like deep inside of the game and almost
forget where you are so that's that's
totally different compared to other
video games the oculus rift allows me to
enter this world where you know I look
around and I'm in an environment that
you know I'm not actually in and I
looked down and thanks to the Myo I you
know I have my arms in here as well you
know I can make a fist and it makes a
fist same with the other side and now it
allows me to do some like pretty wild
things like for example I can hang on to
this lightning bolt and I can shoot it
off to the distance you know same on the
other hand I can go like that i can go
crazy and shoot even more it just like
it brings me into this world that I you
know never been in and it's it's pretty
wild
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
