because now I'm pleased to introduce iOS
10 now Siri services over 2 billion
requests a week from customers and
there's so many things that you can ask
Siri but now an iOS 10 series going to
be able to do so much more because we're
opening up Siri to developers but the
big news and photos this year is
advanced computer vision we're applying
advanced deep learning techniques to
bring facial facial recognition to the
iPhone now we're applying all of these
new designs to navigation as well so you
get more information it makes it easier
to follow and control and we even
include traffic on route now when you're
driving it'll automatically zoom in and
as you get to a long straightaway it'll
automatically zoom back out and you can
even pan and zoom way further ahead to
see what the traffic conditions are for
you I love for you it's my favorite part
of Apple music I know why because it's
all about me yes that's correct
so now you'll see that at the top of for
you there's a discovery mix now this
contains the songs that have been picked
just for me so I can discover new
artists and new music there's also the
recently played like we just listened to
the Sugar Hill Gang so it's right there
I can navigate easily to it and daily
curated playlists now it's Monday I
usually like to strut into the office on
a Monday and look at the playlist today
it's called the fashion runway strut
that's all about me it's right here okay
but we wanted news to be the place where
you read all of the stories from your
favorite publications and that's why
we're introducing subscriptions
so now you can read every article from
magazines like National Geographic
newspaper newspapers like the Wall
Street Journal right inside of news when
you launch the home app you get to see
your own personalized wallpaper and all
of your accessories no matter who
they're made by and you can control them
so easily if you want to turn on the
light of course just tap it if you want
to adjust the dimmer we'll just press in
a little harder and slide and you can
adjust the dimmer just like that you
know we all receive a lot of calls but
we want to make sure that when you miss
their calls if the best experience
possible so now you can actually get
voicemail transcription of your incoming
calls so you can see what what it's
about without having to listen
VoIP apps can now integrate into the
lockscreen they're integrated into your
phone reasons they're in your phone
favorites and your contact card has been
enhanced so it remembers how you like to
call each person and you can access them
that way with just a tap now people
really love emoji and now we've made
them three times bigger in the
transcript which is fantastic
and to help you always reach for the
right emoji we're providing emoji
predictions as you type super handy but
you know sometimes you've typed a whole
message and you realize at the end that
you're totally lacking in a moja
fication and so we've provided the
solution when you tap on the emoji
button we'll highlight all the emotive
liable words there and you can just tap
tap tap tap and emoji pie
