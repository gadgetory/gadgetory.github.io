skills before the force awakens I'm
Richard Carey this is your scene that
update the force is awakening and the
hype train is on hyperdrive early
reviews for the new Star Wars movie are
now all over the web but you may not
want to read anything to avoid spoilers
and go in for a pure experience instead
of browsing the web like this you can
distract yourself in a few ways google
has a new game to test your lightsaber
wielding skills it's called lightsaber
escape you log into the game from a
laptop or desktop on a Chrome browser
and it gives you instructions on how to
sync up your phone as a controller for
the game your phone becomes a lightsaber
that you swing to deflect blaster fire
from storm troopers but dodging all
those pew pew race which is the
scientific term is not easy also you may
have some trouble playing this on a work
internet connection because a workplace
may have extra security settings that
can muck up the syncing between your
phone and the computer you can also
spend time creating animated gifs with
star wars flair on the new giphy cam app
or maybe you'll call it the jiffy kamath
it's been updated with six star wars
filters and it's only for a limited time
to promote the movie you record a little
looping video clip and then you can make
the Millennium Falcon flyby or bb-8 can
just roll into your shot among other
effects I'm sure Hollywood has a good
feeling about ticket sales for this
movie after the online rush to buy
advance tickets The Hollywood Reporter
has sources saying that advanced ticket
sales reached a hundred million dollars
in North America it's an unheard-of
number which means it's going to be very
hard to avoid accidental online spoilers
if you're not among the first to see it
there is a tool that can help if you're
really worried force block is a Star
Wars spoiler blocker that you can
download for the Chrome browser before
you load up a website it's checking if
there are a critical mass of keywords
related to Star Wars so if there are too
many terms or certain really serious
spoilers you're going to see a variety
of warnings popping up stopping you from
visiting someone on the team saw an
early screening and the engineers
program super spoiler
keywords into the blocker so this team
means business that's it for this tech
news update and there's always more to
explore at cnet com from our studios in
New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
