with Intel's chief financial officer
stacie smith stacy thanks for being here
my pleasure so Intel the world's biggest
chips company is coming off of a really
strong 2014 revenue was the highest it's
ever been stock went up 40 percent on
the PC business which was down for a
couple years actually rebounded last
year so I wanted to start off kind of as
a retrospective what worked in 2014 in
pcs you know how did you guys manage the
turnaround I'll just start by going a
little broader it was more than pcs the
company grew but it was broad-based
growth we saw really robust growth in
the data center so that business was up
eighteen percent year-on-year and that's
become a very large business for us and
we saw fast growth rates in the Internet
of Things business specific to the PC
business what we're seeing is we're
seeing a reinvention of the personal
computer we're creating these very sleek
cool devices that people want we're
seeing you know at least that market
stabilizing based on all the innovation
that's going into it price points coming
down so all of that led to a PC market
where we saw some unit growth we saw
some revenue growth so how do you guys
keep that going this year our baseline
forecast for 2015 is a PC market that's
relatively flat you're on your and then
but we still expect that the company
will grow in the mid-single digits and
that's based on growth in data center
and out of things we're going to see a
lot of innovation in the marketplace and
what that means to a consumer is that
they're going to be able to get devices
that have extraordinary performance even
longer battery life there's been a lot
of talk over the past couple years about
this concept of the post-pc era in Intel
do you guys buy that and if you do where
does that leave a company like yours the
post-pc era as a market that's you know
circa 300 million units with more
innovation happening in it then I've
seen it any time in my career in the
industry today you just have this
explosion of devices you can have a you
know all in one with a touchscreen that
you use in your kitchen you can have a
convertible
high-performance PC that you know maybe
has a detachable screen that you use
when you're on the road you may have a
tablet you're likely to have a
smartphone as well so you have these
multiple devices that compute and
connect what Intel is really well
positioned to do is to be the company
that provides the technology that's
inside all of those different devices
you bring up the idea of diversifying
with mobile that's an area that you guys
are trying to diversify into but so far
I'm trying to be nice here it's been a
bit of a mess so far in 2014 you guys
lost 4.2 billion dollars in mobile is
there a point where that becomes too
painful you're not going to be doing
this business anymore we expect that
this year will make a substantial
improvement in the profit rule of that
segment we won't get it to profitable
but we'll make a substantial improvement
and profitability but if you zoom out in
our strategies to participate across
this wide range of devices ranging from
you know high-end PC all the way down to
a phone and we think that we're one of
the only companies that has you know our
own factories all of the different kinds
of intellectual property blocks that go
into those devices at CES Intel came out
with a tiny tiny chip called the Curie
which is for wearables how big of a
market do you think that's going to be
for Intel no idea you know I think
there's probably two mega trends that
have been playing out over the last five
years and I think will be the dominant
forces over the next five years one is
that technology is becoming more
personal and the second is that
technology is becoming more mobile so
it's becoming smaller with with longer
battery life I think Curia is a great
proof point of how that can evolve in
you know what that was was in essence a
fully capable computer that can connect
that was in the size of a button and so
you start thinking about the kinds of
applications that has there's a lot of
different places that can play what we
see in that segment of the market the
Internet of Things is it's a very
chaotic segment there's lots of
innovation going on it's if anybody
tells you they know what's going to be
the the winner of three years from now
they're making it up because nobody
knows and so we want to be there early
want to be
early with great technology and then let
this delightful chaos play out and kind
of see what a balls from there great
