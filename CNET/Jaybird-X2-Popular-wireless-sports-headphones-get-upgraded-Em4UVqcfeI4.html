sports oriented in your wireless
bluetooth headphones and his blue buds x
headphone which hit the market a few
years ago has a loyal fan base would
like to extol its secure fit and strong
sound quality so what's j-bird do for a
much-anticipated encore the jaybird x2
which comes in multiple color options
for $180 and looks almost identical to
its predecessor but offers some
improvements including a new matte
finish better sweat proofing a slightly
more comfortable ear fin design a better
carrying case and improved battery life
to eight hours which is good for this
type of headphone the x2 is actually one
of the best sounding in-ear headphones
out there and jaybird hasn't made any
changes to the sound as far as I can
tell it's a pretty well-balanced
headphone with good clarity and decent
bass that isn't over emphasized there's
a slight bit of trouble push and bass
lovers may be a little disappointed the
bass doesn't have more oomph to it but I
like the sound for me the best way to
get a tight seal was to kind of screw
the headphone in clockwise and have the
headphone cord wrap around my ear I was
able to get a tight seal and Jaber now
includes some foam ear tips if you can't
get a seal with the included silicone
ear tips I did have a couple of small
problems with the headphones first the
earphone itself is kind of big and
because of the shape of my ear the inner
room just didn't feel super comfortable
press up against the entrance to my ear
canal secondly I don't like to have
cords wrapped around the top of my ear
you can wear the x2 with the cord
hanging down under ear but I had trouble
maintaining a tight seal in that
position so I stuck with the over ear
method the other thing I don't like is
the cord shortener you get a little
extra accessory to adjust the length of
the cord which works fine but I think
the designers need to figure out a way
to create a more integrated elegant
solution having the cord double up on
itself with a removable clip is
something that may be acceptable on a 50
or $75 product but this thing cost $180
don't get me wrong I like the j-bird x2
and think it's one of the better
wireless sports headphones
there but it's also one of those
products that's going to work great for
some people and not so great for others
so despite the improvements I've got to
hold back a little on my rating giving
it 3.5 stars instead of four of course
that may change if the price goes down
but for now that's what I'm going with
particularly with Plantronics backbeat
fit sitting out there at less than $100
