new design for the same low price as
last year's model is it still a solid
cheap tablet to buy i'm Xiomara blanco
frisina and i'll be taking a closer look
at the Amazon Fire HD 7 the seven-inch
tablet looks different than last year's
and not in a good way the angular design
is reminiscent of the Fire HDX line but
the Fire HD 7 has a plastic back that
gives it a hollow feel despite its
average girth to make up for the flimsy
feeling amazon offers the tablet in a
variety of fun colors though our review
unit was a simple classy white the top
edge houses the power button and micro
USB port while the volume rocker is
located on the left edge the back of the
tablet is home to the rear camera as
well as the dual Dolby audio powered
speakers there's no expandable storage
option but like with every fire tablet
you get unlimited cloud storage for all
of your Amazon content the Fire HD 7
runs on Amazon's recently released fire
sangria operating system which also
isn't too different from last year's
version new features include the ability
to set up individual user profiles and a
shareable family library which at the
time of review has yet to roll out
Amazon didn't splurged on too many
upgrades for the Fire HD 7 but it's new
quad-core processor is purportedly twice
as fast as last year's model with
improved graphics performance the 1280
by 800 pixel resolution also stays the
same however if the standard spec for a
tablet in its price range and the humble
IPS display looks sharp with life light
colored performance is smooth and study
for basic tasks like checking email
reading and surfing the web the tablet
slows down when downloading large files
and launching large apps or games but
the wait times are nothing atypical for
a tablet with mid-range specs the rear 2
megapixel camera has a manual focus
panorama and HDR option but photo
quality at full resolution isn't very
sharp and colors appear dull the
front-facing VGA cam
similarly struggles with producing clear
and colorful photos but it has face
detection and works fine for
videoconferencing
despite the downgrade in design the Fire
HD 7 is still a good 7-inch slave its
feature filled software is it saving
grace and starting at a low one hundred
and forty dollars only the Dell Venue 7
comes close to beating it however if you
can upgrading to the 16 gigabyte model
is worth the extra cash for more
information on the tablet check out the
full review on CNET again i'm Xiomara
blanco and this is gonna first look at
the Amazon Fire HD 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
