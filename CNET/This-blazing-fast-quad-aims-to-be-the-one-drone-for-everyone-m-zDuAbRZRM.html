company teal is introducing the teal
drone which has a top speed of 70 miles
per hour and I can fly on up to 40 mile
per hour winds it is meant to appeal the
hobbyist
consumers and racers all in a single
model it sounds good on paper but there
are a few issues the first is price
the teal drone costs $12.99 and despite
that it only flies ten minutes at a time
from an 1,800 milliamp battery the range
is about 300 feet and it has a
stationary 13 megapixel camera that can
record 4k at 24 frames per second it's
powered by a fast Nvidia octa-core
processor which allows most of the tasks
to be processed on the unit itself
rather than on your phone tablet or a
laptop teal even built a drone OS and
will be releasing an SDK and API which
will hopefully create a platform and App
Store for the drone this way specific
applications for different tasks like
racing or stunts could be created by
fans normally if you break a leg on a
drone has to be sent in for repair teal
is opted for modular arms which can be
popped on and off after removing a few
screws there's a proprietary connector
for each one which does mean specialized
arms and other modules could be released
in the future
the teal drone is definitely not cheap
but it looks cool and has a lot of
high-end features teal is taking
pre-orders now for the teal drone and
the company says it should ship before
