products through unconventional means
here's an overview of how one plus works
and what it means for you thanks to
technological advances high-powered
hardware such as smartphones are getting
cheaper to build which means more and
more companies have the means to design
and sell them one plus is one of the
smallest upstart firms out there and one
of a handful of Chinese companies aiming
to break into a very competitive market
to date it has only made a few
smartphones the oneplus one in 2014 the
oneplus 2 which went on sale earlier
this year and now the angular 1 plus X
which comes in either glass or a
limited-edition ceramic version all
three phones feature powerful technology
such as big high resolution screens and
powerful processors and use custom
versions of Google's Android operating
system with price tags much cheaper than
other flagship phones the oneplus
Mobile's that have gone on sale so far
have earned positive reviews for what
really sets the company apart from other
makers our phones is how you get its
products instead of buying from a shop
or online to date one plus are sold its
phones using an invite system whereby to
get one of the mobiles you need to
secure an invite either from someone
who's already bought one of the phones
or by joining in with competitions or
promotions the invite system helps 1
plus carefully control stock but has
also served to create a strong fan
further around the brand making one plus
a favorite for passionate Android users
these powerful Mobile's aren't for
everyone however and something to
consider is that because it's a smaller
company 1 plus may not be able to offer
the same levels of customer support
you'd get if you buy from a much larger
firm whether or not you want to buy one
of its phones however one plus is
interesting because it shows that there
are new and interesting ways to
distribute tech and proves there is
scope for smaller organizations to
challenge the products put out by major
players like apple or Samsung</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
