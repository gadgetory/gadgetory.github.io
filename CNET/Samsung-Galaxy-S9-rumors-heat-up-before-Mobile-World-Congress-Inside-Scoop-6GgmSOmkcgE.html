about the Samsung Galaxy S 9 is that it
will indeed be called the Galaxy S 9 and
that it will be launched February 25th
in Barcelona we know that samsung is
going to be focusing on a major camera
upgrade we're hearing that the larger
version the Galaxy S 9 plus will have
two camera lenses on the back so it can
take portrait photos much like the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 which is already
out we're expecting that the s9 will
only have one camera lens on the back
we're hearing that the camera could have
some flexibility with the apertures and
improved low-light and perhaps even
faster capture we're also hearing rumors
about super slow motion video which
means that when you go like this it will
look really cool kind of matrix style
we're hearing there could be a new way
to in lock the Galaxy S 9 it doesn't
sound exactly like it's gonna be like
the iPhone 10 that sprays out infrared
dots and maps your face instead it could
be called intelligence scan and it could
combine face unlock with iris unlock
which are two mechanisms that already
exist in the galaxy s 8 and Note 8
phones there are also rumors that the
galaxy s 9 could get something kind of
like the iPhone 10 an emoji
which can turn your face into animated
emojis but it might be a little bit
different we're just not sure at this
point
from what we're hearing so far and
inspects land there might just be an
incremental difference between the s8
and the note 8 phones with the exception
of the two cameras on the back of that
s9 plus I'm most interested and if that
fingerprint reader moves and some of the
renders we've seen it's not off on the
side anymore by the camera as it was
with the s8 it suggested it could be
located underneath the camera module
display which would be way more
convenient that would put it in the
center of the phone and it would make it
look like a lot of other phones that are
already out there but a lot of the other
elements could remain the same including
battery storage capacity screen ratio
waterproofing and ability to charge
wirelessly
last year the Galaxy s8 was the first
phone to come out with Qualcomm latest
chip this year I think there's a very
good chance that the galaxy s 9 will
come out with this year's latest chip
which is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845
processor that is supposed to promise
much faster speeds better security and
longer battery life I think it would be
really interesting if Samsung made the
galaxy f9 and s9 + foldable we do know
that samsung is going to come out with a
foldable phone by the end of 2018 that's
what the companies told us however I
think it would be way too risky to do
that on a flagship phone instead I think
that's gonna be something really niche
maybe it will only come out in one or
two countries animal sort of be an
experiment for Samsung to build on
further down the road not everybody is
going to want that kind of device and
again it's just too risky here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
