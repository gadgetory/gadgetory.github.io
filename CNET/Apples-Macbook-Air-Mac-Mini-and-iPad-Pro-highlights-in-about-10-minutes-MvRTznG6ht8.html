introduce an all-new MacBook Air with a
Retina display and a whole lot more the
number one feature customers have wanted
in a MacBook Air has been a Retina
display but we've made the display
better in every way
the familiar aluminum bezel sorry about
that
the familiar aluminum bezel of the
current MacBook Air is gone the new air
sleek design takes the display glass
right to the edge of the enclosure
forming borders that are 50% narrower it
features a 13.3 inch display which is
the perfect size for such a portable
notebook and when it comes to resolution
we've taken the pixels and quadrupled
them providing four times the resolution
for over four million pixels
so both text and images are sharper and
more detailed and with 48% more color
those images are more lifelike than ever
all of this comes together to give the
new MacBook Air a Retina display we know
our customers are going to love and even
with this narrow or border design we
were still able to keep the FaceTime
camera at the top of the display which
is exactly where you want it when making
a FaceTime call and now with the group
FaceTime feature in Mac OS Mohave you
can invite all your friends to the
conversation now next the MacBook Air
has another new feature that customers
have been asking for and that's touch ID
so now with just the touch of the finger
you can unlock your MacBook Air buy
something cool on Apple pay or use touch
ID with a third-party app like one
password with a durable sapphire crystal
surface we've put the touch ID sensor
right into the keyboard I can't wait to
tell you about the biggest update ever
to the new Mac Mini now I'm sure you've
noticed that we've given it an awesome
space great finish for one we know our
pro customers are going to love that but
to this new Mac Mini is an absolute
beast on the inside here's why the
number one thing our customers wanted us
to do is give it more powerful
processors so now every Mac Mini starts
with 4 cores but we didn't think that
was far enough so we're also giving Mac
Mini 6 cores processors as well
and these are mobile parts no these are
higher power eighth-generation CPUs with
faster graphics - next up is memory now
the previous mackaninee went up to 16
gigabytes of memory
so naturally the new Mac Mini goes to 32
gigs of memory but we didn't want to
stop there either so the new Mac Queenie
can now go up to 64 gigs of memory next
up is storage now many Mac Mini
customers depend on the speed and
reliability of SSDs so now every Mac
Mini has all flash storage with SSDs
that are up to 4 times faster and
capacities up to 2 terabytes and that's
double the capacity of the previous Mac
Mini and every new Mac Mini also has the
Apple T 2 security chip with as many new
features including HEV see video end
code that get this 30 times faster so
the cool wall is powerful new technology
the new Mac Mini has an entirely new
thermal system with double the airflow
while still being super quiet and
finally connectivity Mac Mini customers
love having lots and lots of ports and
the new Mac Mini delivers with Gigabit
Ethernet for count them for Thunderbolt
3 ports an HDMI port two USB a ports it
can connect to almost anything and not
only that you can configure the Mac Mini
with 10 Gigabit Ethernet as well the
entry config has 8 gigs of memory a 3.6
gigahertz quad-core processor and 128
gigabyte SSD and it starts at just seven
ninety-nine
you can configure it up to 64 gigs of
memory a higher frequency core i7
processor up to 2 terabyte SSD and with
10 gigabit ethernet there's new iPad pro
we have an LCD that stretches from edge
to edge and top to bottom
now we achieve this design by rounding
the corners of the display using the
same pixel masking and anti-aliasing
technology that we introduced in the
iPhone 10 are just like in the 10r we
call it a liquid Retina display
now the narrow border design gave us an
opportunity to take a fresh look at our
iPad pro sizes the original 10.5 inch
iPad pro is an amazing device it offers
plenty of area to get your work done and
an enclosure that's large enough to
support a full size keyboard but it's
still just one pound and super portable
it really has been the ideal option for
most of our iPad pro customers so we
decided to maintain that perfect
footprint but give you an even bigger
display this is the same take anywhere
size you loved in the 10.5 inch design
but now with an 11 inch display and it
has a quarter million more pixels but of
course for customers who want to even
larger canvas we also offered the twelve
point nine inch display all that real
estate makes multitasking and working
with Apple pencil an incredible
experience well this new iPad pro we're
able to offer that same large screen
experience in a much more portable
package and this is the new 12 point 9
inch iPad pro and it's not just smaller
it's also thinner these new iPad pros
are just five point nine millimeters
thin you really have to hold one to
understand it and we think when people
do many more folks will move up to the
larger size it really is the ultimate
iPad and that's especially true because
it now has face ID now face ID is
enabled by the true depth camera which
is tucked away into this thin bezel it
uses depth technology to deliver greater
security and accuracy than any 2d face
scanner now with support for face ID it
might have noticed there's no longer a
home button well now home button means
that all those familiar gestures from
the iPhone 10 now come to the iPad so
for instance you can swipe down from the
upper right hand corner to get to
control center you access the dock by
swiping up from the bottom
if you continue swiping up and pause you
get to the app switcher and you can even
swipe along the bottom edge to quickly
switch between your most recently used
apps you can work with two apps at once
using split view you just drag an app up
from the dock to the side and then you
can easily drag and drop between them
and all that is possible because of what
we put under the hood because these new
iPad pro
are powered by the all-new a 12 X Bionic
the a 12 X features an 8 core CPU with
for performance cores and for
high-efficiency cores and with our
latest generation performance controller
multi-threaded workloads can now
leverage all eight of those cores
simultaneously these iPad pros are
faster than 92% of all the portable pcs
sold in the last 12 months including the
most popular core i7 models from the top
manufacturers these new ipad pro's
aren't just faster than your last
computer they're also smarter and more
capable there's simply nothing like this
in other traditional PC chipsets and
this year we have a new fast storage
controller on the a 12x which enables up
to one terabyte in storage capacity one
of the most important game-changing
accessories for the iPad pro has been
the Apple pencil and with these new iPad
pros the second-generation pencil has
been completely redesigned the new Apple
pencil attaches magnetically to the iPad
pro it automatically pairs and starts
charging wirelessly
and if because it's always charging it's
always ready to go the moment you need
it tapping the screen with the Apple
pencil will wait the iPad pro and lunch
instantly into the Notes app and this
year there's a whole new way of
interacting with the Apple pencil just
tap twice on it to switch modes in notes
you can switch between your current tool
and the eraser and in other apps this
behavior will be customizable which puts
even more control into our users hands
also this year we have a new smart
keyboard folio it continues to deliver a
great typing experience in a thin and
light design with no pairing charging or
batteries required and it's even simpler
to use it magnetically attaches to the
iPad pro and it protects both the front
and the back it has a screen angle that
is great in your lap and another that's
great at your desk not only his iPad is
I've been amazing for all the things you
do today but also the perfect tool for
creating totally new experiences like
augmented reality with its large display
and a thin and light design iPad is the
best device ever created for AR
and we've optimized these iPad pros to
make AR even better
we've calibrated the cameras and sensors
at all of these components in a 12 X to
deliver realistic graphics real-time
lighting and object tracking an
incredible texturing and reflections and
with AR kit 2 we give out some hints
surface detection and persistent
experiences and all of this comes
together to completely transform how you
can interact with the world around you
these new ipad pro's are packed with our
most advanced technology there's the new
all screen design with liquid Retina
display advanced face ID the a 12 X
Bionic chip delivering incredible pro
level performance for speaker audio and
this time with woofer and tweeter pairs
in each corner they sound amazing and
they offer wide stereo output gigabit
class LTE and ECM technology and our
cellular models for great connectivity
wherever you go and so many more
features that make this our very best
