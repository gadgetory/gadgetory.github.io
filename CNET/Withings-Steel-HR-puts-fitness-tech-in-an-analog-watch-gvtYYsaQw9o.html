the last few years but here's one that's
a little bit different it's the witting
steel HR so while most smartwatches have
a fully digital display and just mimic
the look of an analog watch this is the
real thing this is an analog watch
display but if you look there's a little
screen here the displays the watch is
smart functions so around the back
there's an optical heart rate tracker
this little digital display shows you
your heart rate it also shows you
activity and notifications when it's
synced to your phone it comes in two
sizes I'm holding the smaller one here
but it comes in a slightly chunkier size
too if you prefer a bigger watch and
impressively it'll last 25 days before
it needs recharging it'll actually last
a bit longer than that that's 25 days
with heart rate tracking and beyond that
goes into a low-power mode where it'll
still display steps and sleep
information it's water-resistant too so
you should be alright if you take this
swimming what I think is really
interesting is the design because it's
just a very simple fairly elegant analog
watch and that's something that actually
has been really really tough to do we've
seen with smart watches so it's not a
spooly function to something like
Samsung's gear s3 but maybe by being a
little bit more of a compromise what you
end up with is a slightly more elegant
product it's going to cost 180 dollars
when it goes on sale in October</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
