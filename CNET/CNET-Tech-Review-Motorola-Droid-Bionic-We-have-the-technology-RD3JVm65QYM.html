motorola droid gets a bionic makeover
honda raises the bar with a 44 mile per
gallon civic hybrid toshiba is back in
the desktop pc business and we're not
making this up another iphone prototype
goes missing it's all coming up right
now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer our own unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's start with the good
apparently good things come to those who
wait because nicole lee and the mobile
team have been dying to get their hands
on the droid bionic from motorola now
you may be tempted to run out in slow
motion of course and pick up the droid
bionic too but be warned it's going to
cost you I'm Nicoli senior associate
editor for cnet.com and this is a first
look at the Editors Choice winner
motorola droid bionic it's been nine
long months and we finally have it in
our hands you may remember the droid
bionic from our CES 2011 coverage
however this droid bionic is a little
bit different than the one that we
showed in fact it's a little bit sleeker
a little bit sexier and definitely a lot
thinner in fact verizon says that the
motorola droid bionic is its thinnest
LTE phone it's also the very first dual
core phone to support 4G LTE on verizon
it shifts at android 2.3 point for which
is the latest update for Gingerbread at
this time and it is free of the usual
motoblur interface it is up to five
customizable home screens and the menu
is a little bit different as well the
4.3 inch display on the droid bionic mix
this phone a little bit big but the
screen is amazing the qhd display really
pops of color on the back it is an 8
megapixel camera lens with an LED flash
it's also the first 4G LTE phone to
shoot full 1080p HD video since the drug
Bionic has both a 1 gigahertz dual-core
processor and 4G LTE speeds the overall
phone experience is very fast navigating
through the phone is very zippy
multitasking was not a problem at all
the browser was also
impressive it supports html5 content as
well as adobe flash video in fact we
were able to load a flash video pretty
quickly the Droid Bionic has very strong
multimedia features not only does it
have the 8 megapixel camera and
camcorder like we said those as a front
facing camera for video calls aside from
multimedia features the Droid Bionic
also has very good business features it
has strong device and data encryption
you can also remotely wipe the device as
well as the SD card the Droid Bionic
comes with an app called zumocast that
lets you easily share and transfer files
from a PC application you can do this
over 4g LTE and 3d not just Wi-Fi like
with the atrix you can dock the Droid
Bionic into this laptop accessory and
use it as a portable pc other
accessories include an HD station which
requires an external monitor you can
also plug it in into a little tiny
webtop adapter that you can attach to an
external monitor as well the webtop
applications definitely extend the
functionality of this phone the webtop
app allows you to access different apps
like Firefox in facebook as well as a
variety of office apps like Citrix
gotomeeting and Citrix documents and of
course the Droid Bionic is all of the
usual Android features like Gmail Google
Talk and more the Droid Bionic ships
with the aforementioned 1 gigahertz
dual-core processor it also has one
gigabyte of RAM and 16 gigabytes of
internal storage it also shows the 16
gigabyte SD card however it is
expandable up to 32 gigabytes on the
whole the Droid Bionic is a slim slick
powerful and fast device the webtop
application lets you use all of these
different accessories however it's
around three hundred dollars of a new
two-year service agreement with the
verizon wireless the laptop dock is
around three hundred dollars as well the
HD station dock $100 the webtop adapter
is around thirty dollars
so is it worth the wait we think so but
is it worth the price we have our doubts
I'm Nichola this has been a first look
at the editor's choice motorola droid
bionic no it doesn't cost six million
dollars but if you buy into all those
accessories you are looking at a hefty
chunk of change although I'm sure the
phone works just fine without them of
course you iphone users are accustomed
to spending money too and you're gonna
get a chance to do it again very soon
Ryan Tom got a sneak peek at the beta
version of Apple's new iTunes Match
service here's his look at what you can
expect when it goes live later this fall
hey guys Brian sean here with the cnet
com preview we're going to show you a
first look at the iTunes Match service
that was recently released to developers
with new features that Apple hasn't
officially announced and will be coming
this fall now itunes match is Apple's
service for 2499 a year and you can turn
on iTunes Match by going into the store
menu it matches your own personal music
collection with the same tracks on
iTunes and then upload your remaining
songs that can't be matched to the
iCloud and allows you to listen to your
entire collection anytime on your iOS
devices plus you'll also be able to use
this service with up to 10 iOS devices
and computers total and a maximum five
of those can be computers now once the
iTunes Match service completes you'll be
able to either stream tracks to your
computer by playing them or click on the
download icon to store them locally once
they're downloaded the icon goes away
and the size of the file changes from
stream to a physical file size now also
here i have my iphone running the latest
developers build and i'll go into my
settings then music and i can turn on
iTunes Match on my phone now jump into
the music app and just like in itunes
you'll see your tracks with the cloud
icon next to each one now I can select a
track and it will initially take some
time to download it as is streaming and
it might also be intermittent because
the first play basically behaves as if
it's a streaming track but once it
downloads it will remain on your phone
and you can also click on the cloud icon
to download all your tracks locally also
if you choose to download an entire
album click on download all instead so
there's your first look at the iTunes
Match beta it's still a little
inconsistent playing through songs
cleanly on their first play and I've had
to jump around traction
but overall the service is pretty solid
and delivers on its promise of giving
you access to your entire collection on
multiple devices and we'll wait to see
the final product this fall prasina calm
i'm brian song once you get all your
music in the right place wouldn't it be
nice if you could find it here's Richard
Peterson with a tip for keeping iTunes
organized have you tried listening to a
complete album on your iPod only to
realize that some of the tracks are
missing for some reason they aren't
grouped with the rest of the album hi
I'm Richard Peterson and today I'm going
to show you how to make sure all the
songs on your iPod stay grouped in the
album they belong now this is a common
problem with compilation albums like
movie soundtracks or that songs of the
70s CD you bought off the infomercial
but this also happens when artists have
songs on their albums the feature
another artist for example i have
britney spears femme fatale album on my
friends ipod touch that i borrowed when
i look here at what seems to be the
entire album you'll notice the track 6
and 8 or missing where are they well
they were categorized under a different
artist here's track 6 which is Brittany
featuring savvy and here's track 8 which
features will.i.am right now we're
looking at the artist view be even if we
look at the album view the same problem
exists the ipod thinks there are three
separate albums one of them with the
majority of the songs and the other two
are the two separate songs with featured
artists another example is this movie
soundtrack which has a different artist
for almost every song it has sort of the
songs into separate albums this can be
really annoying if you want to listen to
the entire album from beginning to end
to fix this we need to go into itunes
click up here to sort your music by
album and then locate the album you want
i'll start with the soundtrack select
all the songs in the album right click
and then click on get info click yes
when it asks if you are sure you want to
edit multiple items now from here click
on the options tab and then check the
box that says part of a compilation and
then yes and now after we sink our ipod
and sort by album all of the songs we
selected will be grouped
together into one album if you sort by
artist however they will still be
separated this should be fine for the
soundtrack album because all the songs
really are by different artists but for
the Brittany album it's all essentially
the same artist with just a couple songs
that have a featured guest so I'd rather
just have them all categorized under
Brittany instead of separated as
multiple artists to fix this select all
the songs in the album and go back to
the Edit multiple item window like we
did before now you'll see a field called
album artist you can type in the name of
the artist here but this will only help
you sort your music and iTunes it won't
solve the problem we have in the ipod
because ipods including iphones
currently won't sort by album artist
possibly the easiest solution is to just
change the artist field so all the
selected songs have the same artist this
of course gets rid of the featuring
artists all together so if you want to
give well I am credit for reaching his
goal of collaborating with every
recording artist in the world you can
just add his name in parenthesis next to
the song title now the next time we sink
our device to iTunes we can find all our
music organized by artist and in the
right albums they were meant to be i'm
richard peterson with cnet com
I hate it when I try to look up a song
and I can't find it because I don't know
the name of the guy who did the guest
vocals me come on iTunes you sold me the
song why are you hiding it from me
anyway while we're in Apple how to mode
and spending money mode Sharon Vaknin
has one more piece of advice for you get
ready to kiss another hundred bucks
goodbye hey guys I'm Sharon Vaknin for
cnet.com here to show you how apple
airplay lets you stream music photos and
movies from your iOS device to your TV
without any cables to get started you'll
need a $99 Apple TV it's a cheapest way
to get airplay right now but we expect
apple to integrate it with TVs in the
future once you've set up your Apple TV
and connected it to your wireless
network go to the settings menu and make
sure airplay is turned on when you're
done grab your iPhone iPad or iPod touch
before doing anything make sure your
device is running iOS 4.2 or above which
is the minimum requirement for airplay
also make sure you're connected to the
same network as the Apple TV once you're
all set up streaming a simple just
launched a video stored on your device
or watch a YouTube video and hit play
you'll see a new airplay icon show up
click it select Apple TV and the video
will be streaming on your TV seconds
later you'll notice that once the video
starts playing on your TV you won't see
it on your device any longer but you can
still use it to press pause fast-forward
or rewind music works the same way
launch a song or playlist and hit the
air play button to stream it to your
home theater
you can't you see that is just and for
photos head to an album open a photo and
tap the air play button airplay doesn't
only work with files stored on your
device it's also compatible with some
apps and websites there aren't many of
them but the list includes iMovie VEVO
Ted NPR and IMDb all of which are
available on any iOS device to see the
full list of apps visit my blog on how
to get started with airplay if you have
any questions or tips head over to my
facebook page and visit how to cnet.com
for more videos like this first seen it
I'm Sharon Vaknin and i'll see you on
the interwebs now there are any number
of ways to get videos from your computer
or home network to play on your TV but
airplay is just so easy I cannot wait
for other TV / tablet manufacturers to
figure this out you hear that Samsung
and Sony and how about you Vizio you too
fact I'm sure there are more like
toshiba but it's time to take a break
and there's a lot more tech review
coming up right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at seen it
continuing on in the good when it comes
to all-in-one desktop PCs the imac
remains the one to be but a new offering
from a company better known for their
laptops is hoping to grab some of the
spotlight hi I'm rich brown senior
editor for CNN com today we're going to
take a look at the toshiba DX 1210 so
the first desktop we've seen from
toshiba in about 10 years it's decided
to come back in the desktop game with an
all-in-one and it actually has done a
pretty good job with this system goes
for about nine hundred thirty-five
dollars and for that you get a 21 and a
half inch screen a wireless mouse and
keyboard relatively fast performance and
a generally versatile system it has a
touch screen although there's no big
touch application that sort of rounds up
the touch experience it's more like a
series of apps that are pretty good we
also like that the system has an HDMI
input which means you can use it to
connect external devices like cable box
now that really makes the system useful
in a smaller space like a dorm room or
den where you might not be able to have
both the desktop and a standalone
display so you can see this issue is a
fairly clean design it's a basic black
here in the front there's some silver
gray acts sending down at the bottom
here as well as a pedestal base and we
can show off the touch interface a
little bit here so here we have this to
achieve a real-time app which
essentially takes your recent
application to document history puts it
into a carousel that you can control
with your finger now of course the
standard Windows desktop is a touch base
and it works as expected here you'll see
it's pretty simple there's an SD card
reader so as a couple of analog audio
outs and USB 3 Jack's which is actually
not very common on all in one so that's
a nice touch and over here on this side
you can see there's a DVD burner right
here now the upper portion of the side
here you can see various buttons they
control the screen brightness volume as
well as swap the video signal if you
plug in an HDMI component now on the
back here's the HDMI Jack we've got a
couple of the USB ports over here as
well as an Ethernet jack and that's
really about it for the inputs in the
back of the system there is one nice
touch though behind this little door
here is another USB port that has the
wireless receiver for the wire
mouse and keyboard now we've liked that
this is hidden over here but yet it's
still available if you say don't want to
use these devices you can take out that
receiver and you get another USB port
now the system doesn't quite hit the
sweet spot for this price range it has a
relatively fast core i5 CPU as well as
four gigs of RAM in a one terabyte hard
drive that's a pretty decent hardware
loadout but the display is maybe a
little bit small for this price we've
seen 23 inch monitors for example in
all-in-ones for under a thousand dollars
it's also no blu-ray drive which is not
unheard of an on one's around this price
if we were going to improve the system
we'd probably get rid of the touch input
and use that cost savings to either have
a bigger monitor or maybe have a faster
CPU or some other feature that's maybe
more generally useful overall though
toshiba's done a pretty good job
configuring the system we recommend it
to anybody that needs an all-in-one for
day-to-day productivity as well as the
convenience of an HDMI input time rich
brown this is the toshiba DX 1210
welcome back to sheba it's nice to see
you in the desktop game again right now
for a look at a story ripped from the
headlines let's turn our attention to
the bad it's deja vu all over again for
apples security squad as yet another
alleged iPhone prototype has gone
missing after being left in a bar again
brian Tong has the story in this clip
from the apple byte
what's happening Brian song here and
welcome to the alpha bite it's all the
good stuff and bad stuff inside the
world of Apple now I've said that 145
times and sure feels a little like deja
vu but so will this story Apple has lost
another iphone in a bar now according to
cnet exclusive sources say the latest
iPhone prototype went missing in San
Francisco in late July and may have been
sold on craigslist for two hundred
dollars and apples attempts to find the
device have been unsuccessful details of
the device are still unclear such as
what version of iOS it was running and
even what it looks like but this time
the iphone was lost at a mexican
restaurant and bar called cava 22 known
for their tequila and shrimp lime
ceviche yummy and sparking Apple to
contact San Francisco police saying the
device was priceless so you would think
Doug guys why don't you just use Find My
iPhone well the big a trace the phone to
a home which then led them to a man who
had been at cava 22 that night San
Francisco police and Apple investigators
were given permission to search the home
but found nothing then before leaving
the house Cena sources say an apple
employee offered the man money for the
phone no questions asked but the man
continued to deny he had any knowledge
of the phone so the lesson of the day my
friends blame it on the alcohol and keep
him away from the bars you crazy
alcoholics now one time is bad enough
but twice that's a bad apple so the
apple byte crew decided you know what
we're not going to sit here and do
nothing we're going to do whatever it
takes to find the missing iPhone
you
missing iphone missing an iphone i
really want to find him
wait have you seen this iphone missing I
fall have you seen have you seen
have you seen this
hey
we'll keep trying Tim Cook you can count
on us and this story just keeps getting
better and better so keep an eye on our
continuing coverage at cnet news com and
now it's time for this week's bottom
line now we all know the honda civic
isn't the most stylish fastest or best
handling car in the world but for just
about 40 years it's been the kind of
dependable and economical car that
people cannot live without and the 2012
civic hybrid is all that and then some
when 40 MPG is something you get with a
standard gas engine the Civic Hybrid has
to do a bit better is 44 enough let's
drive the 2012 honda civic hybrid and
check the text the new civic hybrid is
revised right along the lines of all the
new 2012 spot it quickly by blue chrome
accents on the outside a couple new
screen modes inside but mostly by its
bigger engine yet higher MPG now inside
the Civic there are barely any cues that
tell you this is a hybrid versus the gas
engine car which we just looked at a few
days ago you've got this econ button
over here in this car of course it
changes a very different powertrain it
makes the hybrid powertrain extremely
stingy as opposed to making modest
changes in the gas engine car right
there dead center is your IMA logo this
is Honda's integrated Motor Assist
that's their technology that competes
with Toyota's hybrid synergy drive up
here on the I mid that's a 5 inch LCD
that is new on the 2012 Civic there you
find some more cues that you're in a
hybrid aside from the usual fuel economy
and distance to empty you've also got a
green gauge here and one that shows
power flow on the vehicle stuff you
wouldn't have in a gas engine car
there's your battery level also and I
think unique to the hybrid I'm not
mistaken is the ability
to set a wallpaper for that I mid
display I didn't see that in the gas
engine car kind of a weird
differentiator if that's the case and
what really makes sense in this car
because it's a hybrid are those two
segmented bars alongside the digital
speedo those are the ones that coach you
from blue to turquoise to green how
efficiently you're driving handy on the
gas engine car really makes sense on
this one we know this head unit all too
well it's an optional navigation head
unit if you get that trim level it's an
okay nav interface it's not my favorite
the whole thing that was kind of busy
and dated but make sure you check out
our 2012 standard Civic video for a full
detailed look at this new cabin one
choice transmission on this guy as with
most hybrids it's a CVT a continuously
variable transmission doesn't have real
gears that's just one belt pulley system
it varies all the time to keep this guy
on the sweet spot now let's go see
what's plugging into it quite a few
changes here under the hood on this new
2012 civic hybrid they bumped up the gas
engine from one point three liters to
1.5 still has the electric motor
attached to it of course the totals on
this are 110 horsepower all in and 127
foot-pounds of torque perfectly good
numbers you're going to get to 60 in
10.1 seconds again not the point on this
car the mpg is so here's where they are
44 City 44 highway guess what 44 average
and that's up a few mpg from the
outgoing model
honda's IMA hybrid system hard couples
the electric motor to the gas engine so
they always turn together but the
electric motor can power the car alone a
small amount of the time it's something
you'll barely detect and like many of
the newer hybrids the Civic turns
driving into some little video game
where you earn leaves as you drive
Greenlee and they in turn that up to
some vehicle lifetime score but I don't
think you can win anything I recall the
previous civic hybrid teen kind of a
coffee grinder of a thing just kind of
crude around the edges this car does not
suffer from that it's got electric power
steering which is really nice and linear
than a very good job on that and
everybody who drives this car comments
on the ride quality it's got a smooth
both in terms of this how it's sprung as
well in terms of this how it motivates
itself there's no lumpy engagement any
more than you normally get with a hybrid
which kicks an electric motor in and out
from time to time let's check the
start/stop technology that can be bulky
in cars like this I'm coming to a stop
sign now let's see how it goes off and
more importantly how seamlessly it comes
back on there's my stop it goes right
away yeah really quick that's one of the
better restarts in the start/stop world
right now the power comes on nicely
they've dialed in the torque for
everyday driving so that it's there when
you need it and handling in a car like
this is as you might imagine it's fine
it's you it's good transportation
quality handling really it's the ride
quality I think people are going to
respond to in this vehicle and the
overall smoothness of how the power
comes on and of course the mpg I get the
feeling there's a little bit less
mechanical noise intrusion as well I
don't hear things worrying as much as I
do in some lower-cost hybrids where you
hear things that sound like an elevator
mechanism going up and down when you
come to lower speeds I'm not picking
that up here it's a better sound
insulation than some
our 2012 civic hybrid this all-new model
is going to run you 24 8 base now couple
of big options in one small one on top
of that the nav package adds $1,500
that's navigation live traffic via FM
not XM radio but it does add XM radio in
that package and voice command for the
nap and also you go leather for 1,200
bucks you're only ala carte tech is XM
radio by itself for about 350 the bottom
line this week 44 miles per gallon sold
now I know you're not going to turn a
lot of heads driving a civic as usual
but hey you won't be spending much time
at the gas pump either alright that's it
for this time everyone but come back
next week for an all-new cnet tech
review until then there are tons of
great videos available every day at cnet
TV com see you next time and thank you
