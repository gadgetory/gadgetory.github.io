funnest ways you'll ever surf in the
world obviously every waves unique
somewhere is a short summer long your
legs are burning after you're done it's
a really long ride this wave offers a
little bit everything but what it really
offers is a perfect wave hi I'm Kelly
Slater and we are at surf
if humans want control so I think this
is tapping into the control element of
making a wave this surfer is an
artificial wave that we worked on
starting in about 2005 2006 finally has
come to fruition here this is our
prototype the first man-made wave that
has a lot of power to it what they call
a solitary wave or a soliton which is
which the way that essentially you could
send for a long period of long distance
over a long distance and not lose any
energy there are a lot of angles and
sections and kind of quirky weird things
that that happen on waves in the ocean
that definitely don't happen here you
know this thing is built to be kind of a
perfect wave more of something you would
draw or imagine your in your mind
right now we probably run maybe like a
dozen different waves you'll see halfway
down here there's a control tower so if
a surface in the water and he said I'd
like this type of wave and we have
different names for the different waves
the bigger ones smaller ones and so they
can radio in to the control tower and
the operator will set it for that wave
once he once the wave is called the
operator will press a few buttons and
then inside these houses over here at
either end we call them the winch houses
there's large winches that will then
start pulling that rope that you see
rolling there and it will pull the big
blue thing which is a hydrofoil with
that select wheel makes the wave that
object is designed such that when it's
pulled at the correct speed and in the
correct depth of water with the correct
width symmetry the reef that we have the
built in here it will create these
select selection of waves one of the
things we have been working on is air
sections so we worked very hard to
create a nice section towards the end
where they can we generate a ramp and a
landing with some nice white waters we
didn't know 100% it was gonna work like
we had designed it to as my partner Jeff
says he said if it doesn't work we can
just shut the whole thing down and cover
it over no one will ever know but I
think the ultimate for us is just to
keep keep working keep redesigning this
is we've always had this our prototype
it's a work in progress and we'll sort
of keep it that way I think
hi I'm Samantha Sibley I'm a member of
the USA search team and we're here in
Waco
this is the home of USA Olympic surfing
this is our first official training here
at the BSR cable park
ere's are something that I struggle with
and here it offers the repetition and I
can just practice them over and over
again
VSR surf resort is the world's first
high-performance open to the public
wave technology the way that we power
our waves is actually pretty simple it's
air pressure and gravity so our machine
is a pneumatic machine and that's
different than other technologies which
have moving parts in the water
we have no moving parts in the water
so the way we produce our waves is we
generate a lot of pressure and then we
make a way of utilizing that pressure
the secret sauce to all that is that we
can sequence how that pressure is
applied to the water so because of that
we can manipulate and change the way the
waves form and spit out of our way of
generating chambers
up in the tower I have a console or
controller as we call it it's
touchscreen and that's what we use to
design the waves it's also what we use
to produce the playlist play them
throughout the public sessions and
everything
we have a three wave set that has 12
seconds in between each wave now we've
produced that once every one minute and
10 seconds
the average wave duration that you're
standing on the board is eight to ten
seconds the beauty of our system is that
we can keep creating new waves
it's just really good for working on
like progression in the ocean you're you
never know what's gonna happen and out
here you always know that the wave is
going to be the same we have the
technology now through our alliance with
surf line surf forecasters in California
we can go back and look at the storms
from the last 50 years and look at how
those swells hit the beach break in
Tokyo where the Olympics is at and
literally a computer model replicate any
type of wave angles swell direction that
we're gonna see and then we can take
that information and put it in the
system here at DSR feels really close to
the ocean it's just weird because you're
surfing in like a totally different
scenery
this one is more fun like way better for
like training and stuff like Kelly's
just longer and like we're perfect but
you don't get as many ways and this
one's more like your real wave kinda
like house is more fake but perfect
nothing will ever replace the ocean the
feeling that you get when you show up on
the beach and the waves are just perfect
and no one is around and you don't know
what to expect that I don't know what's
gonna happen before you paddle out but
you still throw yourself out there
nothing will ever replace that from a
performance and a sport standpoint the
wave pools offer something we've never
had which is a training tool there's so
many different variations in ways that
you can manipulate the way water moves I
mean this is the tip of the iceberg</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
