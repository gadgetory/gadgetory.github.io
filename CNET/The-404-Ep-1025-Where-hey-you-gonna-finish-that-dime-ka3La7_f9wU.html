for tuning in to the 404 show the best
damn show on the Internet I'm Jeff
Bakalar and I'm Justin you and this is
the show where are you gonna finish that
done cuz i'm pretty pretty hungry bad i
got some expensive tastes as kids in
africa that can t times there are
children in africa would love to be
eating money right now we got to that
conversation that's why we have that
weird show that'll talk about like crazy
stuff you maybe did well no realize this
conversation because you were bragging
about what you were getting back in but
i wanted is right and then I dared you
to tear up that dollar bill right to
show how rich you are right because I'm
not and in return I would swallow this
here dime so have you did you the
recollection rowing up growing up did
you ever do anything really silly for
money I have plenty of zai me personally
I was not interested in stuff like that
yeah it felt prostitute ish yeah
exploited ish yeah sure sort of like the
cast of jackass uh I didn't I was that
kid that would always eat things for
money okay you mean like people would
like mixed together everything in their
lunch plate in their cold pack forget
from school you know like I just put
these like beans and pepper and hot
sauce together so you were like that for
a quarter so you were like the master of
concoctions you were like all right
we're gonna put some you know battery
acid and this uh you know like squeeze
out the rain for my socks and then oh oh
no yeah yeah so gross you know it's like
being poor man times are tough it's
rough out there you're full of it I mean
maybe not the sock thing but battery
acid for sure would you eat so you've
eaten coins before Hoynes I've eaten
what's the saying like if she swallows a
quarter that's fine yeah she craps out
two dimes and a nickel they it what what
what's saying is that from that's from a
movie I think it's a grumpy old medicine
like that it's pretty funny uh making
change in your stomach yeah well like I
had a friend we'd always go on a ski
trip and we'd always go to this diner
outside the
like right outside the base of the
mountain okay and one year money wasn't
good and he was desperate he could
barely afford I mean it's like first
world problems he couldn't afford to go
skiing he couldn't afford like a second
day lift ticket a rare so he was trying
to scramble like 50 bucks together okay
so he's like I have to earn it right now
I'm where and you were sitting at a
diner it's like eleven o'clock at night
and we only had a few things in front of
us so we're like okay gonna make you
like snort a line of salt right which I
don't know if you've seen anyone do that
yeah that is not a pretty sight and then
just like take shot after shot of
Tabasco sauce oh my god right after
doing the line of salt yeah we were like
16 yeah I'm sure the other pages of the
restaurant love see you ignoring white
was off the table it was funny because
we were the last ones there mountain
town ski towns close down early this is
like way past that everyone's bedtime so
he's like yeah I'll do it and he did it
and he like he turned green yeah crazy
we were like freaking out yet do not try
that at home is what I is the moral of
that story this was also around the time
when like videos like CKY came out which
I feel like was probably really bad
thing can't kill yourself was like the
worst thing to ever happen to kids
because it was pre jackass right when
and jack has had that disclaimer and
like there was you know look whenever
stuff like this hat there's always gonna
be a few kids who accidentally kill
themselves or hurt themselves like even
planking took a few victims up heaps
kids kids have killed sure so you know
it's gonna happen but ck what that was
like really early Jack a sort of stuff
for kids were imitating that yeah and
then that was also the time when uh
videos like faces of death were out you
know there's like a lot of that was airs
a lot of messed-up stuff going through
uh no preteens heads I just feel like
don't you think like kids now are just
so are desensitized so much earlier in
life uh yeah it was the is it I mean I
know it's easy cuz of the internet but I
feel like there is no filter anymore
yeah and I and it happen to me too but
not until I was a little older I guess
until I was maybe 14 yeah when it was
like hey guess what I've pretty much
seen everything there is to see had
nothing to discuss you know did you ever
play poo dollar
hahahaha hell is that you've never heard
of that before can you say without being
disgusting yeah I mean two dollars when
you take a dollar bill and then you know
was that walk around looking for animal
def occasionally but isn't that what
they didn't mighty ducks but what do
they do they did in the in the Mighty
Ducks 2 or something and then you put it
on top of the poo right right or known a
little bit on the bottom what they did
was they got like an old-looking purse
okay and they found duty and they put me
in the person then let like a dollar out
of it someone season I all mayors and
personal money the dog threw up and like
all wait a minute just picked up a bag
poo this was a little more nefarious
that you would find uh poop on the
ground and you take your dollar bill or
five dollar bill if it was a good month
and then you you know because on how
much of the prank you could afford yeah
you would spread a very thin layer on
the other side of the dollar bill yeah
that would kind of serve it as an
adhesive that you would stick on the
ground you know you hear that thing
that's like oh that's disgusting it you
hear that store like Oh ninety percent
of our money has traces of cocaine on a
shirt yeah how much has fecal matter I'm
a lot of significant amount which is why
I'm gonna go ahead eat this nickel right
now grab at five pennies then we got
something to worry about on with the
stories of the day the news of the day
puto okay Arizona such strange state
they always seem to be in the headlines
for making really weird ass backwards
laws yeah well they're back at it
trolling might get you a quarter century
in jail right what the hell is this
about uh this just goes to show that
government officials that barely use the
internet shouldn't make laws regarding
the internet and this is so this is
about a Arizona House bill 2549 it
passed last week in both legislative
houses and now it's uh I think it's
waiting for approval from their governor
in Arizona right now and the bill states
and I'll just read this off it's
unlawful for any person with intent to
terrify intimidate threaten harass annoy
or offend to use any electronic or
digital device with regards to obscene
lewd or profane language that may
suggest it lewd or
or lascivious act okay so this is a
class three felony this is a class for
federal felony if that electronic device
was used to stalk a victim yeah or to
victimize anybody but I mean the problem
with this is that the language is so
generous it's so generous and that to
anything that you do on the internet
from a maybe a harassing YouTube quote
yeah to a mean facebook comment it is we
go shockingly unfounded and and
underexplored in terms of what that kind
of sentence carries and how huge of a
net this casts right it's so so why do
all the people in power have no idea
what they're what about internet law and
the reality of the Internet you're
basically saying every person who's ever
been on the internet is going to jail
for report chorea so the class 3 felony
which carries a minimum sentence of two
and a half years right for non dangerous
offenders with no prior record what yeah
class three felonies are really serious
um those are not misdemeanor charges and
you would go to jail for maximum of 25
years in jail if prosecute you that'll
go over real well right that homicidal
maniac in the cell next to you would you
in 40 I was trolling someone on the
internet Raoul guess what we're gonna do
and you'll be in there with for the same
reason that a second DWI convict right
in there those i think is a tree felling
which i think is equally as as as you
know the poor miss mischievious oh yeah
yeah definitely or skipping bail is
another class 3 felony what the hell is
going on why is this okay yeah um so how
can this be fixed like what's the what's
the takeaway don't live in Arizona I
think so dude don't get an internet
account don't go on the internet if
you're in our zone just I'll just stop
going on the internet I mean I don't
know probably everybody like you're
crazy when yours only that you feel like
you're crazy yeah I don't understand
it's the same thing with people who are
uneducated and ignorant about uh you
know a lot of things that go on in the
world that that certain people just have
no connection to yeah and I know we
always bring up this example but it
always comes back to it it's like
putting the blame
on something like video games for one
kids you know murderous tirade right
okay and they're just like all if he
didn't play call of duty he woulda
killed all those people no you're wrong
there are things that you can do though
I mean the the governor's supposed to
represent the people so he has a
facebook page and just go on right now
just go to like red check it out so here
facebook.com slash gov jan brewer yeah
of arizona and people are already
sharing links are they trolling her uh
can I troll her out of over state lines
across state lines yeah you can anyone
can do this so uh yeah I mean this is
like you can message her I want to get
her on the show and ask her how long she
spent in a reddit forum yeah you know uh
hey governor what's going on well don't
troll her because not trolling her only
her it would basically be doing what so
was Katie cure trolling sarah palin i
did see that was that the case she being
trolled don't you think that was a
little reactionary that it wasn't that
big of a deal when matt lauer cut her
off was that the story you're referring
to talk about that the infamous
interview Oh Katie Couric was sort of
giving her the benefit of the doubt
right I'm saying look I'm just asking
you a few questions if if you know a
normal person papers do you read right
what newspapers do you read some the
questions that any normal vice
presidential candidate would be able to
answer right I mean come on yeah the oh
you you're asking uh someone to post
questions to this Arizona matter about
the internet just be like you just
haven't done any research be like hey
what's your favorite subject right
exactly you know how many book would Eve
you bookmarked lately like what do you
mean yeah I don't know I don't want to
pass judgment but come on a governess
does not sound like someone who's been
on the internet for that long yeah well
I hope that doesn't pass yeah me too
moving right along this is something
that you and I wanted to talk about for
a while and it's basically a entry on
the freakonomics website talking about
how a you know copyright infringement
identity theft all that kind of stuff is
one category and then you come to the
category of uh you know what a lot of
copyright holders are all up in arms the
content distributors the people who make
the
the music the movies and whatnot right
talk about copying stuff online right
like oh you download a file sharing you
downloaded something illegally and this
is maybe more of a philosophical
argument than rather a you know straight
fact sort of issue but the freakonomics
website is talking about how copying is
not theft the way that the word theft is
defined in our language right arm
without getting too technical and the
article is shockingly not technical it's
just basically saying you can't say that
copying is theft because theft the
traditional sense of theft means I had
something and now I don't have it yes
sir my problem with that is uh you know
saying that people are losing money by P
by other people downloading their
content online is assuming that they
would have bought it had the content not
been available right i mean right like
and there's no way that you could tell
that maybe they're just downloading it
because it's available so you're not
necessarily picking things out of their
pocket and taking it like you would if
you would steal a car right exactly well
and that's what everyone's problem is
with remember those uh PSAs at the
Motion Picture Association you know what
steal a car yeah you wouldn't I don't
know skill mobile phone or DVDs you
wouldn't rob a bank right no robbing a
bank is not the same thing as
downloading 21 Jump Street right it's
just not you can't equate the 2 i'm not
saying they're both not crimes hmm but
you cannot look the relay this them
together in that same thievery category
right it's just not the same i think it
all sort of like boils down to in
tangible objects and you know the door
swings both ways the whole elimination
of physical media when things become
intangible right you sort of don't
possess things like you used to I have a
CD I flip through the book is not the
same as I downloaded the latest lady
gaga album and I have it on my computer
it's just not the same and from the
artists perspective to I remember I was
watching a documentary about Henry
Rollins and piracy and he had some
pretty cool things to say about it let
me hear
sounding off he was talking about how
artists shouldn't ding their fans at
every chance they get you know like the
way that you release an album is you
don't charge a lot for CDs right put it
for like a five dollar drm fee online um
and he had this line that said I'd
rather be heard than paid and I think
that's a good model for when artists
release content like that it's more
about getting your music out there if
you're if you know if you're really
hundred percent agree i think why do you
think it happens why do you think
there's such a change in in like the the
attitude of people of artists i mean i
understand and i think maybe it really
did start with the Metallica's of the
world right when they you know when they
came after individual fans demanding
their 35 cents for downloading right
exactly I mean that just gave the entire
aggressive you know downloader debate
this whole sort of negative connotation
right we don't get me wrong it's not
cool if you just download music all the
time and you're not but that like your I
what's a matta my eyes are your eyes are
it's just raining in your eyes um you
know I mean like Asia there's a
difference um I I i we say this all the
time we reiterate it all the time if you
truly love a band see them live is that
is the best way that your money winds up
in their pocket go see him live and buy
a t-shirt yeah even if it's fifty
dollars uh so I found the quote here
online this is funny he says uh this is
from henry rollins he goes if you want
to steal my stuff and do what record
labels have been doing for me for years
now you get to play the man good for you
go ahead and do it but am I going to
come after you for my 35 cents know if
you can't afford to listen to my music
and you got to get it off the internet
hey at least you're rocking yeah I mean
you know that is that's almost like no
one downloads using for sell out yeah I
love it I love him wrong but he makes a
good point no one's downloading music of
bands they don't care about her that
they hate true I mean you only download
what you love yeah I mean look at it
like this you know I get but at the end
of the day you're never gonna download
something that you don't want to listen
to write exam loading you know a katy
perry city
ever yeah yo desire to ever listen to
you never downloaded a justin bieber CD
exactly so he's really making all that
money yeah I like that line I'd rather
be heard than paid yeah it makes sense
because it's the same sort of mentality
of like any publicity is good but you
know even bad publicity is good
publicity Henry Rollins is a good
moneymaker though he probably doesn't
have to worry about eating I'm not
worried about him at all he goes on tour
on the country rise uh talk you know his
talk sessions he spoken word spoken word
stuff he's acting I'm not worried about
him at all yeah but he's got the right
message sure that's for sure don't
download our podcast yeah free it's free
last story before we hit the brake um I
guess this sort of makes sense Daily
Mail at a UK saying that iPads could
possibly be ruining our eyesight at an
earlier age because get this and it
makes sense they make you forget to
blink yeah a little dubious about this
study this is from a dr. Christine pers
lo she's saying that the mind focuses so
much on the screen throughout its daily
use that you sort of subconsciously
forget to blink that's I'm sorry that's
true and you keep your eyes open longer
so you can read sentence I find that to
be true I find myself not blinking when
i'm using you do it consciously I'm just
like all my guys feels like clockwork
orange I just don't blink I know I don't
blink because when I do it's like you
know your contacts what's a real tough
blink right you know there's a lot of
crap that goes on your eyes my eyelids
have a tough time making it all the way
back and it's not just iPads its
computers your smartphone's it's every
electronic device you're looking at all
day long and there she's saying that it
develops drill eyes drawn yeah well
here's the thing is as we normally blink
12 to 15 times a minute but using a
computer screen can cut this down to
seven or eight so it's basically have
right I don't know is is is a health I'm
sure a healthy I I'm sure the reason we
naturally blink is to keep the I
lubricated or keep it clean and free of
dust and crap and stuff like that so
maybe yeah it does cut in to what keeps
our eyes hell
hmm so you can't deny that no I mean I'd
I'm short of counting the amount of
blinks you do a minute not sure if this
if this actually holds up but she is
saying that there are ways you can get
around this blink more blink more that's
it more Blake more of the also says
taking a screen brake helps of course
and then changing the focus of the eye
by looking into the distance regularly
so look at things further away test your
eyesight a little more maybe hold it at
arm's distress tout that Retina display
yeah it's ridiculous I don't know or
maybe Apple will come out with their own
brand of I lubrication oh I drops coming
too I want to come out with the app that
just sort of give pops a little message
and she says don't forget the blink yeah
hope you did it 15 times this minute
maybe a little thing will come up and
squirt you in the eye is it like a foot
yeah but you blink down thank you that's
what i wanted to i sent out this tweet
at a CES and i was really hoping that
someone would come out with a display
like an actual computer monitor that
would spritz you with water every 15
minutes or whatever intervals you want
like a cat yeah yeah that would really
help you know for the summertime when
it's hot out or when you're falling
asleep at your desk you guys be nice if
like a steering wheel did that too yeah
exactly car feels like it's veering off
the sign a little bit yes Oh huh huh put
those windshield spritzers inside the
car give me a break we'll take a break
and after this more 404 including emails
and voicemails so stick around we will
be right back this is the 404 mr f'ers
the show where we all sing song
alright welcome back to the 404 a lot of
exciting things happening with our fine
program yeah we let a little sneaky bit
out the other day on our twitter feed if
you people know what that is yeah they
do not grow shots where you do not sure
you could tell no I think they do yeah
okay I mean it's no secret what the show
is changing remove we're moving along
with our schedule and gonna get a new
logo and new music and a lot of new
packaging and whatnot yeah well here it
is new guess you already put it as a
profile picture yeah it's just like a
little tidbit like may or may not look
like this is one of the initial
rendering this is just like this is a
pre-alpha yeah pre-alpha we're actually
and we're also talking with Morgan
Spurlock's people I'm trying to make
that happen he's got a new movie out
about comic-con oh really yeah so we're
trying to get Morgan Spurlock on the
show so that should be a lot of fun too
he's a busy dude man yeah you made that
uh the greatest movie ever sold I'm a
daddy made the infamous supersize me
yeah which he was nominated for an Oscar
for you know they made another film like
the like the rebuttal to that right
super high me no that's that what all
that was when smoke I'm smoking weed for
I think two months no I think it was
that he what I can he quits my family
that poor guy um and then no someone
made one where he wanted to try and lose
weight by eating McDonald's every day
okay and I think he was able to do it by
eliminating all the other sugar in his
diet mm-hmm why you're looking all I'm
just trying to think about how that
would even work I mean there are healthy
options healthy up I'm sure you don't
eat McDonald's every day not you know
right I get fat but Morgan staying in
the in super size because it he had to
try everything on the menu right and it
was more about state of the food
industry in America and what we're
feeding two children right I'll tell you
man the next thing sugar that's the next
one yeah first it was fat and calories
now it's sugars next damn sugars gonna
get its ass kicked its soda I think it's
a lot of a lot of its soda I'm guilty
that too you're terrible
25-cent soda machine I know it's like
it's like free soda but you know what
you're gonna pay for it in the end I
would say caffeine too might be the next
culprit in art I don't know man yeah I
don't know because a caffeine I don't
think has the negative effects that
sugar does yeah you're not getting died
there pointing the finger at sugar at
like cancer now right yeah yeah who said
that yeah Sanjay Gupta said I'm serious
really there's actually a really scary
report on this past weekend 60 minutes
huh that sort of said you know there are
certain things that sugar does to you
that increases the risk of heart attacks
and strokes and stuff like that and now
they're starting to say well maybe it
has a hand in cancer geez I mean think
about it think about people in the 50s
right and they were saying how I people
thought they were eating cheese burgers
and milkshakes all day and then we were
having the same amount of heart attacks
as they did then yeah but the
cheeseburgers back then we're probably a
lot smaller though I don't know I mean
that's probably the various I wasn't
alive I don't know yeah oh I'll start
slapping the coax out of my hand when
you see me walking out how many times if
I said ah man you're gonna have you're
gonna put coke in your coffee yeah well
if they start serving milk out of the
vending machines I'll drink that milks
after sugar man dr. milk like dude that
milks up here drink so bad for you human
digestive system hasn't figured it out
yet no tell any man all right it's uh
let's get to a few calls its calls from

the Sean I was a feature yesterday about
Game of Thrones haven't actually watched
yet but he totally hates the nail on the
head and you had to comment about the
language because that reminded me of
another show and if you guys ever watch
Spartacus cells on stars its effects on
netflix instant queue to but their
language was just as modern as you guys
don't we can obtain games ability
justice system it's crazy it is weird
they say F and s and everything and
they're just it doesn't make sense yeah
monkeys FS bitch is so weird and then
but then someone wrote in was like hey
they've been saying the effort since the
1400s yeah it's fine Game of Thrones
doesn't take place in our past right it
is a fictional universe yeah so
we're just we're just saying that the
words are out of place contextually
speaking and also because everything
they say is so formal and calculated
that it sounds weird when you just throw
a filler word yeah like effing right and
it's not just f2 they use it as a verb
like I and even when they save this they
seated balls a lot too yeah that doesn't
make any sense yeah haven't they be like
just stick your fortitude know they say
ball they say cock2 yeah they say cocky
you can say yeah they say that yeah it
doesn't make sense oh weird yeah the
cannonballs it just doesn't make any
sort of that I wanted I want to skim
through the novel and just see if George
Martin was like oh okay yeah he did say
I get it all right last thing about Game
of Thrones will be off it hey guys this
is Atlantis and Colin I wasn't here
yesterday show and I heard what the
other saying about Ned sockets med
things and agreeable that it is a
terrible terrible name for a so-called
Europe however art is important to note
that it names actually load ederd short
EBD ard bedard and i believe matt is
just short all right so is that better
his name is entered they still call I
mean editors that makes more sense
entered is more sense for that sin
textually right but they still call him
and his sword is Ned watch out I'm gonna
slap you with Ned they couldn't he says
this sword is net call him Ned okay oh
really that's you're gonna name your
sword not Excalibur you're gonna name it
Ned yeah here's my sword Larry watch out
for Larry yeah it sounds of guys a curve
in it it's weird and then there's Rob's
to let me talk about a lot of Roberts
all right we're done with Game of
Thrones go watch it and enjoy it we're
talking a lot about like Jamie too we're
talking a lot about people watching
video games and hear someone saying that
eSports as it goes is actually becoming
quite popular in this country hey guys
this is Minneapolis from Brandon and I
just wanted to make sure you guys were
aware of eSports I know you guys are
talking about audience driven gaming and
the death of arcade in the US but
eSports me
u.s. is actually starting to really take
off it got really big in south korea
with starcraft 2 but it's starting to
really take off here the most notable
league is MLG and they have things like
Halo and Call of Duty and just started
getting street fighter and mortal combat
so yeah these live events are pulling in
probably I would say five or six
thousand people get it uh eSports is
competitive video electronics portray
what it's saying I don't know man what
do you think you would you ever watch
somebody play call of duty competitively
yeah pay up ticket on own time stadium
probably wouldn't pay but if I played
that game I'd probably be interested in
seeing the top what do you know what am
i what am I asking you for what i would
i would pay to see the top street
fighter care of players in a competitive
game and if you go on youtube you could
see some of those tournaments it's
pretty cool ok why do not it's my phone
I don't know why I'm so against this I
fen ething I should be for it I mean I
can feel like it's in my best interest
yeah for a career in what I do for a
living why are you not interested in
this but then we can still talk about
movies like wizard where they had
tournament's first Super Mario which is
the least fun it's a movie about games
yeah okay but unfriend yeah totally
different yeah well what's your problem
with it I just don't I just don't think
people want to watch this I don't think
it's as accessible as they want it to be
well I don't think that these
competitive games have uh just
spectators going I think everyone
watching it I've probably played you
know I know I just struggle with the
whole thing on a philosophical level
plus just this is too easy to make fine
I mean look at this magazine cover here
it's a nice part yeah yeah look at this
oh man a magazine about playing be I
mean this is a this is old too this
looks old just halo tues walsh that's
like come on it's good that's like
forever ago it's photoshopped but anyway
it's ridiculous finally speaking of
video games star wars kinect fell victim
to awful reviews widespread awful
reviews on the internet and here's our
buddy who thinks he's got a couple good
Kinect game suggestions this is brad
from buffalo just like to make a comment
on you talking about us star wars kinect
my solve those of it and looks horrible
i laughed out loud at the dancing videos
but I anyways in terms of Connect um in
terms of a good game you mentioned a
fruit ninja kinect and you also have to
mention shadow eden and both of those
are good yeah another good kinect game
is one called a gun a stranger and you
basically control a puppet show set in
gold west and its really creative and i
liked it a lot yeah gun stringer was
actually pretty good if if you have a
connect and you're dying to get some use
out of it aside from yelling at it in
mass effect 3 or screaming out nine iron
in tiger woods golf is that really you
can do they scream at your caddy yeah
like a pitching wedge yes you can do
it's uh what what is that is that like a
gun shooting game where you like have to
hold your fingers up more or less it's
sort of like that i don't get it i mean
i even for an in this is the one thing
that I feel like we were right about
from the get-go yeah we knew I hated on
it and you know it just it's not working
out yeah I know it's the fastest selling
electronic device of all time whatever
the hell it you know but it's just
there's a novelty and a honeymoon period
and then it's over I can only see the
dancing games being relevant you know
that that because your mutes detecting
your movement can sure somewhere you
have to pretend like you're holding
things or position your hand cannot be
overstated enough does it make sense to
dance central games are fantastic yeah
yeah I planned it myself yes so I want
to want to make that clear it's not all
bad but do you need a by a how much is
it connect again think they're selling
for 150 yeah then look is right um
alright let's get into some what you
McCall its emails from the public emails
nice um ok let's do she here ok talking
about watch people watching video games
already says it was just listening to
Monday's episode we were discussing
people who enjoyed watch
other people play games I am that person
and this is from a woman this is cory my
husband plays often and i thoroughly
enjoy watching him i also partaken few
games myself but only but only when he's
not home so he can get her hands on the
xbox oh when he's playing something like
Call of Duty it's fun to watch because
he freaks out just about every time he
gets killed that's odd Stacy hates when
I play call of duty the reactions of the
game is more entertaining than the game
itself we also hook up the xbox live
audio through connect so I can hear our
friends freak out as well it usually
winds up in hilarity sure yeah that's
that's cool yeah I think that's I think
that's a good sort of thing that people
don't realize you know especially with
the if you're playing with a lot of
friends you can use Kinect another good
use of connect four uh Mike like speaker
phone chat right it's like watching your
friends play game sports right oh yeah
we got another one from Dave similar
subject he's like I don't have all that
much of a problem with video game access
on the 42 inch screen my wife is a world
of warcraft player and is using a
desktop computer uh every evening after
work and weekends as for watching video
games i couldn't watch a full game but i
do watch my wife when she is rating with
about 50 other players in a large world
of warcraft instance some of those
instances are pretty intense huh so I
don't know maybe not all the time but
for the bigger more exciting events
makes sense yeah I guess um let's pull
this one up to on the screen here Justin
this is from fafa and Eve we saw this
after we saw the shaun of the dead lego
vote on Conan someone wants to do a set
for back to the future but the need more
votes we think it's time for this to
happen we know they know we're fans of
the trilogy check it out back to the
future Lego edition how freaking cool is
that I love that it was we're looking at
a DeLorean and I don't know why they
chose the third movie to put the there
cause I think i mighta done because that
has the most decoration okay yes they're
in their western wear I mean Jeff's
let's be honest by the third Back to the
Future move the DeLorean has been
through the you know wat yeah and it has
just had so many add-ons and
augmentations and whatnot
it looks pretty badass thank you fafa
and eve for sending that in that's
pretty awesome I'm trying to figure out
what is this like their version of
Kickstarter Legos original yeah I think
so um so there's an idea stage that this
is in right now and people pledge their
support so where did the put the end
they just like make that DeLorean out of
like existing parts or something that's
pretty freaking awesome yeah yeah it's
pretty cool yeah it is pretty cool put
that in the show notes yes um this is
from Maxwell from Toronto I know how
much you guys both dislike QR codes so I
thought he would send this story over
well dot CA is Canada's Amazon because
our Amazon doesn't sell groceries or
home goods I didn't know that you know
that no I didn't know that either I
actually went to the mall to see this
thing in person and it's exactly what
you expect you scan the code and it
takes you to the product page on well
dot CA I and everyone else looked
incredibly stupid taking pictures on all
our phones isn't that weird yeah so it's
like a real-life store that you have to
take QR code photos in person
interesting so yeah I guess uh it's not
all green Canada that doesn't make sense
away I'm a little confused by what pull
up the side here yeah pull up the site
he's saying that you have to go in and
there's apparently QR codes everywhere
in the store so okay yeah you go into
this physical store you scan the
products with your phone and then they
send it to you it's like a it's like a
walk through amazon oh it's like hi
visiting a website in real life but
there are no actual products here no
it's just like pictures of stuffs haha
you believe that that seems crazy yeah
that's an omar point boy Oh point of
having a website said you don't have to
pay to have a free-standing store right
or the point of shopping on a web sites
that you don't have to physically leave
your house to go to it oh this is super
convenient you mean I have to get my car
drive to the store and then go home and
wait for it to get my freakin thing yes
ridiculous let us know if you have any
experience with that store in Canada
that's going to do it for us today 866
