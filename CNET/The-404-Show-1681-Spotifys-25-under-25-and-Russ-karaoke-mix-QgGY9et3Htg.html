episode of the 404 it is friday october
twenty eight twenty sixteen i am russ
fresh dick we do not have mr. Jeff
Bakalar here he is out this week
unfortunately so I have taken on the
role of hosting duties thankfully I am
NOT alone I don't think this show would
be very good it was just me monologuing
for an hour it's not true I you think
it'd be good hot on yourself and I'm
here your lawyer welcome Shannon she is
a well-respected and long-running guest
of the 404 she is from Spotify and
whenever she comes on she teaches us all
a little thing about our hearts my
musical hearts that are constantly
beating that would I think that's what
you do did you realize you were doing
that every time he came on yeah its
first thought I came here and brought
with me lots of noise a lot of which
upsets Jeff's ears yeah so this could be
kind of cool not having him here well
have you sensed that I'm more open
minded about music than Jeff is yes
you're more embracing of pop music
that's definitely true he's more of a
metal guy yeah we was not he likes the
harder stuff he does I can everyone
smile get down on that stuff that's fine
yep no no we I think the last time I was
here we had a fun time actually we were
just we just sort of started playing
songs that we like yes it's like fine
young cannibals and and Jeff got very
excited he did today I'm gonna be
talking about songs that Jeff doesn't
like oh dear uh mainly because uh pop
music yes popular right did you know I
think that's where it comes from
breaking you know the origins of pop
music as a term no I don't I don't know
either and now I want to know cuz it
seems very vague does it well it has to
just be because it's not just like like
you could have like a metal song that's
like on the pop charts no you can never
but it wouldn't be considered a pop song
no I think pop song generally is
positive but even that's not true
because some there's some sad songs
that's true it it's the only genre which
apparently appeals to a very broad
audience but these days it's it's such a
hybrid you know
these are so many pop songs you know
incorporate rap right and then copy em
so it's it's getting broader in the
order and you know an EDM songs
sometimes I will classify as pop and you
know same with some hip-hop stuff yeah
does Spotify how to Spotify determine
what a pop song is oh gosh I don't know
that's a good question and that's a good
question for some of our curators you
have a really great curation team at
spotify who curates some of our most
popular playlist which have lots of
followers one of them is a guy named
mike begane who is such a wealth of pop
knowledge music knowledge for me and is
very helpful he curates the our biggest
playlist which is called today's top
hits oh yes and it has about 11 million
followers but that's not all pop it's
those are hits those are songs that are
streaming in really high numbers of
people are sharing a lot that listeners
are not skipping in playlist listeners
are saving these songs so we deem those
popular song yeah but he's still jumping
in he's not it's not like an algorithm
we're just like well no it's no no it's
it's a lot of it is human human curation
which is an important aspect of the way
Spotify functions we don't want it all
to be algorithm I feel like if you
invited one of those curators to a party
at your house you'd be very
self-conscious of like what you put on
yourself great like yeah I'll just be
judging it I i yes and actually Mike
once asked me what my music taste was a
nice day love and I was like sweating
buckets oh oh is that the time I have to
catch a trick no but um but as for
what's pop today and what's popular
today what I brought for you today is a
list that we come out with once a year
this is actually our third time
releasing this list I'm very involved in
how this list is shaped and who's which
artist land on this list and it's our 25
under 25 Wow okay so 25 artists who are
under the age of 25 yeah Jeff doesn't
like anyone under 40 he does he does is
the cutoff what's wrong with that Miss
Zoe like smart I hope he likes his son
cuz I believe his son is on
you know that my turn him around on it
hahaha he's changing his ways he likes
people under 40 no he likes people over
40 and under one right that's the real
time exactly very effective I ring it
down but this list is always a fun list
to put together because you know Spotify
score listeners are pretty young yeah I
you know around the age of 22 we have a
huge number of listeners of users and so
it's always fun to eke out the artists
there p is essentially they're listening
to and looking up to then feel bad about
themselves because they're they have a
crappy job is making millions yeah yes
and there are idolizing the pants off
this person while also possibly sending
them nasty messages on social yes very
common but this was interesting putting
the list together this year because I
felt like there were a lot more artists
to choose from and a lot more artists in
this age group if we're going to call
under 25 age group who are doing really
really well and one of the ways we're
measuring I guess success at the moment
and Spotify is by looking at an artist's
monthly active user number ok so we hone
in on a month long period and we
determine how many listeners how many
individuals are listening to this
person's music so these are unique
listeners exactly sorry I kinda said
that I forgot I'm this is the tech crowd
yes I by should I need not dumb things
down um but it's fun too don't it is it
makes you feel very powerful but these
the numbers are staggering their example
shawn mendes who's on top of a list he
has 25 million ok monthly listening do
you think I know his song his saying I
don't know do you think I know it you
owe me to play yeah this is this is the
one that's kicking but it the name does
not ring a bell but Sir see if I know it
I have a feeling you've heard it it
rings kind of a bell
oh this has a good hook doesn't I know
he's change not feel if you like I can
speed up it's always something I see it
on your face when you say that he's the
one that you want he's only 18 that's
crazy I hate I hate I hate people under
20 that's why I don't oh yeah yeah yeah
right yeah it's a great song it is our
listeners love it this is a guy who
started out hosting six-second vines
yeah oh right peavine I know it just
died yesterday that's crazy it did a
wheel released this list yesterday and
bright as the plane he got out right at
the right time but he he would basically
post six second covers yeah and
attracted a lot of attention got a
record deal from that yeah and now he
feels arenas crazy it's amazing he he
has a another big song which is kind of
his breakout song called stitches which
has you know 500 million streams yeah so
he's kicking but we're happy to have him
on the top yeah and so when you guys are
picking this list this is top 25 under
25 list is it is it a big conference
room table nah it's not like a dramatic
like white board table for one which is
me no no no we we discuss you know with
our genre experts you know who were the
curators of these these top playlists
that we're mentioning early you know
there's a rap play later there's a rock
playlist that's doing they're all doing
really well Hot Country believe it or
not is an incredibly popular okay listen
on spotify so obviously you know i
consulted these guys sure which had it
at length about who are the artists who
are popping in their playlists which is
another thing that i factored in this
year which was new as well as the
monthly active monthly unique users yeah
is how these songs are doing in
playlists you know I used to focus da
sure I used to I used to just focus on
charts really our viral chart yeah
popularity chart but this time I wanted
to know which songs are doing well in
playlists so so you mean like people at
making a playlist and adding it
yes if a sign of a hit or a sign of a
song that is going to be a hit is a song
that people don't skip sure as they're
streaming a playlist if they listen to
the song in its entirety that's an
excellent sign yeah also a song that
they save mm-hmm if they save a song
that's a big check shirt yes I'd that
song and it boots that artist standing
we then Spotify yeah um so you mentioned
saving and I so discovery playlist comes
out every week right and it's designed
for me and my tastes and i usually like
it demise very nice but they tell me
that i should save it if I like this mix
right but if I save it that week and it
changes over is a am i saving just that
week's playlist I believe so by date cuz
I don't know well have you tried no
that's right i'm scared i believe you
can't break it so we're finding more
than what we're finding is that people
don't save the whole playlist kathy you
know we're never gonna get it completely
right sure there are 30 songs in that
you get it right oh we do sometimes
citizen it's always gonna be at least
one or two songs is more than i'm lazy
right I just won't like individually
save songs right well that takes a lot
of time does but we do find that on
average listeners and save at least one
song from each discovery weekly playlist
which comes out every monday and that's
great yeah you think about that you know
after in two months you're saving say up
to ten songs which you've just
discovered which you now like and maybe
you're listening to on a regular basis
um so yeah okay keepsafe say just say
the songs you like yeah it's too i think
it's too cumbersome to save the whole
whole plan yes i think but if you're
lazy there's a done button to say the
whole thing that's pretty good but then
you're gonna just accumulates women yeah
i have a lot i'm all about keeping my Oh
music well prunes you're saying it is
yes it is we're talking about my music
okay just to clarify but um should we go
back to 25 oh yeah what if I've let me
point out a few others we've got ariana
grande sure
she's only heard of her she's and how
old is she she's got to be aging out
pretty soon she's 20 she's 23 she's got
a couple more years ago Joe she's been
on this list out to pasture good time
she'll join Britney in the past years of
pop stardom well it's funny cuz we do
you can't be 25 to be on the list and
some of those genres pertz were saying
to me here what about this artist he's
great and I me like 25 he's 25 yep go on
yeah but ariana is just incredible she
just turns out hit after hit from her
latest album dangerous woman and our
listeners love her yes songs just go off
off they're like more than 200 million
streams age that kind of thing yeah
we've got some rap in here of course
wrapped very popular Spotify we have
chance the rapper Chicago rapper who's
kind of a bit gospel e okay and his
mixtape coloring book has been one of
them most sort of critically acclaimed
of the year especially in the hip-hop
genre here Obama is President Obama is a
fan oh oh so so I saw the Obama mixes
obviously he got my play in the summer
playlist and the and was so was that was
he included in that he wasn't okay
that's where I probably heard it yet I
don't know if you it was the day cuz
Obama released to playlist yeah daytime
some are listening and a nighttime I
can't remember of chance was in the Sun
them you know daytime or nighttime yeah
we've also got EDM EDM is hugely popular
Spotify and actually who's the young EDM
kid right now well we've got a couple in
this unless martin garrix is one he's so
with an ex I garrix yep with an ex that
seems very EDM accident I Skrillex
covered that base really well oh there
there is the ed immodest cold Zed okay
but it's spelt ze DD I think so it could
have just been Aziz outside of the US
well in us via right well in Australia
yeah in Australia we stay Zed I still
have a hard time saying z
feels very very strange but yeah he's a
he's a heavy hitter I mean he's like in
the top 60 out of civil time yes that
makes sense if we were to rank all the
artists in terms of who's streaming the
most yeah at the moment he's like in the
tops Wow is huge yeah another EDM
artists whose on this list and I have to
wonder do they like the term EDM cuz why
not you think it's too broad electronic
it's better than what it used to be good
does electronic dance with the shoot
there was a shorter electronica I guess
techno exactly needs to be techno which
I feel is derogatory at this point but
that's kind of yeah no one wants to be
called tec-9 I forgot about the techno
days yeah there's another dude in this
list who I'm a huge fan of his name's
flume I'm playing one of his songs
that'll never be like this he's
Australian to which represent which is
really why he's on this not true that's
a dude
No
so far it doesn't sound like an EDM song
hasn't yeah I could play that's an idiom
staple is this one yeah it's good I've
heard this song before q it does feel
like dubstep has like moved away from
that period of like this is just
discordant noise and is much more
melodic yeah i agree they've toned it
down a little bit or just using this lab
or like a beaver dubstep equivalent kind
of like in that spirit of his last album
when I first came across flume it was he
did a remix of a disclosure song it's
called you and me it's used in a TV
commercial I can't remember the actual
commercial better what the product is
but it's there's a couple running and
they're about to jump off a building
okay of course they survive because
they're under 25 sure but um it's a
great song I want to play you a little
bit of that and you must have heard this
okay yes sir I have let's see this is
kind of the song that put flume on the
map flu what is strange names sounds
like flu
oh yeah yeah yeah I'm gonna fast-forward
it this is like this is where it kicks
into the course which you will have
heard
sorry
Yeah right such a great yeah sound that
I don't know just punch people it does
sort of feel like the music they would
play in like the w hotel at like ten
o'clock at night and the lobby is that
were you hang out that's right hang out
oh really know where to find you yeah
ten o'clock it you're not responding to
my only the coolest you gotta tell um
flume is that spelled like a flume ride
like the water flume I don't know FL you
Amy yeah and this guy just how old is he
he's super young he's annoyingly young I
haven't listed his age I think he's like
20 yeah he just got nominated for 11
aria awards which means nothing to you
but it means a lot to me that's
basically the Australian equivalent of
the Grammy okay and he had the most
nominations out of any artist I always
find that fascinating that every country
has their own like award shows that i
might totally not looped into why would
you be well but then so I heard about
what is it the eurostar or like
phenomenon which I didn't know about
told it just this year well really in
the last couple of years America started
paying attention yeah cuz of streaming
it's probably gets a stream because of
us yeah right exactly and it's very it's
like it's like a sports event it's like
super bowl yeah and most of the songs
are awful I noticed there are a few good
song well it's interesting how different
pop music and we're going back to the
discussion about what is pop different
pop is in different batteries and um in
the UK we're night whenever I'm in
London I am I I feel like I'm hearing
the music and it's it just has a
different sound to it it's like jeans
you know what I mean jeans if you're
walking in New York City you can pick
out the people not from the US based on
their jeans right because the cuts are
so weird that's really right great
analogy can I steal that you let it know
jeez that is it Lily you know what I
mean don't you yes some of them so some
people will play me a song and they'll
say this is gonna be a huge hit in the
US and it's from a UK artist
also well I'm not so sure because it
sounds like a UK hit right and see you
today do you think it's like they're
behind like a year behind where we are
is it just different I don't think
they're behind because a lot of their
stuff does cross over and just really
well yeah and it you know bounces around
the world and does really well it's just
it's just a different sound that it
appeals to a different audience yeah and
that's what they I guess they get used
to that it's familiar and then they
might hear some American pop stuff and
be like oh that's yeah kind of weird but
then American pop does pretty well
mm-hmm everywhere at least we noticed
that speaking of pop I want to talk
about this lady now her name's Holsey ok
I'll halls esto es h al sey ok she's
very buzzy at the moment everybody's
talking about her because she is the
featured singer on the biggest hit in
the world at the moment the most popular
song in the world really is a song by
the chainsmokers ok that's called closer
don't worry you miss nice i'm here to
educate so just relax it's all right i'm
stressed that i'm out of the loop don't
be stressed this song streams about four
and a half million times a day and has
done since august just before you've
heard this for sure yeah that's an issue
ok so your friends it was nice to meet
them this song is I I it's become this
phenomenon and
palsy sings she doesn't really come into
the song till about a third of the way
she featured her shoot did she write it
she's featured it is a chain smoker got
it the chain smokers are a New York DJ
duo I don't know that you would call
them EDM but they are EDM ish but is
that them singing or is that why this is
one of the guys I believe he's named
Andrew taggat I sometimes mix up their
names he is the he's one of the djs and
he just sings on this song which is kind
of a surprise cuz normally he's behind
the board yeah the ones in two years
they call it once as I understand it yes
yes sounds a bit gross um but he's kind
of done a calvin harris think calvin
harris huge scottish DJ producer guy who
has sung a couple of times on his songs
yeah and he has like this guy a very
understated voice its kind of doesn't
sound like it's trying hard but it
sounds nice though it's smooth and I
think that's part of the appeal of this
song I here comes Halsey the game let
you catches why I left you yeah and she
has been toiling away as in as a solo
artist and she's released a lot of songs
and albums but I think one or two
Alvin's that um I've done okay there's a
song called Americana which our
listeners love but this song has just
brought her to a whole new level and I
think she's now going to really take off
she's a sweet girl from New Jersey who
has a great social media following but
this song is really weird because it's
not that amazingly no it's just like
this sort of thing you would have in the
background likely and it has this almost
cheesy some people describe it as cheesy
cynthy bit yeah in it and it's really
nothing amazing about it but it's
striking a chord with people and I have
to admit it's striking a chord with me
the song is actually about meeting up
bumping into someone who you had a fling
with ya four years ago okay you bump
into them and you're attracted again
sharp if flames it's like do you like
pina coladas baby and getting caught in
the rain I know right um and there's
just something about the way they sing
it about the lyrics that gets you yeah
and I I don't fully understand it but I
think a lot of people are having this
strange experience with this song yeah
it's also kind of a post summer you know
like joys of summer oh yeah it's like it
was like a summer fling that perhaps
fizzled out now I love the boys of
summer song by the way it's one of my
fav nice place yeah let's hear that I do
want to say while we're while we're
playing by the summer which is an
absolute classic it's interesting with
these top 25 under 25 lists that the
older you get the more likely it is that
you're gonna appear on one of these
lists ah so you're saying that most of
these I'm saying if you're 300 years old
you have 299 chances to be in a list so
the let's get longer the older you get
they do I'm you know I did suggest doing
a 50 under 50 but that didn't go over no
the too much effort I love that list
well what about 40 / 40 that would a gun
really wrong I feel like you need cuz
it's clear you have the kids the kids
are in right you need the adults you
need the old people yeah so like
appreciate and the jeff's of the world
to appreciate Spotify as well yeah and
maybe start making some all Celine Dion
mixes I'm sure they were there very
popular well you can find all that stuff
and keep in mind she's loyal if she's
still doing stuff Susan Boyle um her
version of auld lang syne is one of the
most stream songs really easy at the
stroke drink oh yeah yeah sure so
everyone has a bit of a soft spot there
Susan what are you doing these days I
feel like haven't heard for hope she's
well I think I miss her yeah she didn't
have a charm about her she was hilarious
glorious so anyway there's that big song
um there let's talk a little bit about
rock which is kind of underrepresented
these days sure feel this is a great
band from the UK they're called nothing
but thieves okay they have this great
song wake-up call which I'm
ling these guys every song that goes
into our rock playlist which is called
rock this it has about 2 million
followers which is great it's growing
every song that goes in there does
really well listeners really really dig
this ben
yeah I mean this doesn't sound like I
wouldn't call this pop right it's
definitely and it's not hard rock lee
always like Jeff Jeff was here he'd be
like man right no it's it's like what a
bunch of pussies like Jagger essentially
it's a bad spirit of rock Oh kind of but
it's kool aid to me it reminds me these
guys remind me a little bit of Cain okay
man is just yeah but they're perhaps a
little hotter because they have guitars
I was just piano um anyway I'm excited
that that they're doing well and I'm I
feel bad for rock yeah it's not it's not
doing so well I mean it is do you think
it's because it's it's more of an active
choice whereas I guess a lot of people
use Spotify is just like a background
thing I think yeah maybe but also I was
someone said this it might have been
sting um in an interview recently
thought just to you at a party no no i
didn't i use viewed him less Oh lovely
but um was he wearing the shirt which
 the shirt that he got his name from
you don't know how why is called sting
ah the stripey she had a stripey shirt I
don't think he that would use him
anymore cuz I think it was probably
that's a few more new ones right I think
he's also just kept in very good shape
people still ask him how he got his name
I'm the dude is like 65 years old if you
haven't looked up right on i'll be the
first line of his Wikipedia page is how
you do not ask you that question it's
ridiculous he complained to you about
how people still ask him that no no but
I just I just know that they do he's
kind of a feat like he's just been
around forever and still like he's just
a phenom right he just released an album
which actually since we're talking about
rock is a bit of a return to rock yeah
and it's called 50 seventh and ninth
which is a corner of in New York City
right nice who taught you sure that's a
kitchen he effectively not the Marvel
version the actual version it's Hell's
Kitchen apparently there's a great hello
sort of pop-up things yeah I kind of
hate that neighborhood but yeah it's a
bit noisy for me yeah it's not for me
but um he that's where his studio was
where he recorded the almond he liked
walking and he completely ran out of but
he was like I'll just here's the
right here no well he loves to walk yes
to walk around the city I've actually
seen him more oh really City yeah he
lives not far from where i used to live
and i'm stalking that's very much in
every breath you take do you know not
really but his album is his first rock /
pop album in about 12 or 13 years sure
and I think he might argue that if you
go back and look at some of the you know
really big rock bands that solidified
rock whether it's some van Halen turn
pink floyd the rolling stones there are
lots of them they were kind of um there
were rebels yeah and i think i think
these days people want really rebellious
in the same way cuz i already been done
right that's the issue people can't find
that angle that's like oh this is a
wholly unique sound right and so and how
do you be rebellious with a tweet people
are rebelling in different ways you know
so i think that might have play into
perhaps why rock is not as recognized
your celebrated these days it doesn't
stand out as much maybe sara lee it
could be totally wrong yeah but i think
that's it but sting considers us at rock
album yeah yeah yeah i don't mean to
play you so sure another one we go off
track no I love doing your shows running
the gamut this is his single I can't
stop thinking about you oh wait this is
the acoustic video let's not play that
one
he's performed it live on its heat or an
hour I don't know if he's tearing
actually he just toured with um uh oh my
god what's his name white hair come on
what's his name yeah but this sounds
like police eresting it does sound like
we waves of barley or whatever it was it
sees a barley fields of gold yes which
is his top songs yeah but if I and
actually when I interviewed him last
week I shared this interesting stat with
him if you took all his streams on
Spotify just his solo work not including
his police stuff yeah and you lined up
all those tracks one ups the other and
play them curiously guess how many years
of stings music would play throw out of
how many years of state so years of how
many years so if you dig me Oh of people
listening this thing's music I'm not
obviously I haven't explained why not
okay take the number of streams that
he's okay total stream title streams
just for stings music yeah play all
those songs back to back okay got it how
long do you think his music will play
for 50 years that makes sense doesn't it
I don't know but it's actually much
higher than that really it's 2035 whoa
Jesus would man I think this thing at
this point right thank you pretty good
isn't that amazing yeah and when LOL
nerds wash in cold and then it's awful
the other shared um that's statistic
with me it was like there's no way yeah
there's just no way and when i shared it
with sting he was like that can't be
true right but when you do the math you
break it down um it checks out yeah so
2000 same two thousand years almost
enough to cover one sexual encounter
with i was about to say he can probably
sustained a psychic you probably right
that all right have I want to point out
one more artists from 25 under 25 and
then we'll move on how about that sounds
good
um I feel bad I haven't really talked
about rap we've got tory lane to his
Drake under 25 he's not and actually I'm
glad you brought that up yes the rap
artist like Kendrick Lamar Drake who are
you know Kanye West you're really
pulling the massive audience on Spotify
they're older right like Drake just
turned 30 oh wow Kendrick i think is in
his 30 very early thirties maybe even
late 20s Kanye is in his third and
easily I think about like like Tupac
when he hit it big was not that young
right right i snoop was so snoop came up
and was like very young Eminem was
pretty young but like a lot of the
biggies baby so to speak yeah we're
altar and I wonder if there's a level of
maturity that's required there well
obviously yeah I mean I don't know how I
don't know if you necessarily hear a lot
of maturity and a lot of the music but
in some of it you do they like with two
 certainly like a lot of is like
more deep like darker stuff yeah you you
kind of need that nuance right to stand
out these are artists who have lived a
decent amount of life to have
perspective on things and to express it
in in richer ways yeah music so I found
that interesting i was thinking you know
i should be able to put some more rap
artists on this list and I could have
but it's hard it's hard because you've
got an artist who has like six million
monthly your listeners and then you've
got artists who have like 25 billion you
can't you can't ignore it but rap is
huge huge on TV are very popular right
yeah very popular such a great playlist
too if you do want to keep in the know
is who's doing well and rap and who's
new on the scene you definitely want to
follow that playlist let me take race
rumored two brothers have better numbers
there they are actually brothers they're
related they have a song called black
beetles which is doing really well in
rap caviar at the moment and they've
been on this list three years in a row I
think they've got one more year in them
before we have to throw them to the curb
because they're too old but let me play
you just one more song this is from an
artist name
daya she was featured in I'm going back
to the chainsmokers who had the number
one song they the chainsmokers had
another big hit over the summer called
don't let me down okay really big song a
really great song and she was the singer
on on that song she's really building up
at the moment lovely seeing a songwriter
she's from Pittsburgh and this is a song
that's doing really well in today's top
hits it's called sit still look pretty
which is what i'm going to do for a few
seconds so you can listen to this
yes
you know what it has a vibe of is the
song that I was go out on Spotify called
i think it's called whistle while you
work it in my penguin I don't know if
that's the title but that's a hook and
um Katie tues I guess as Katie tis oh I
don't know who's this song let me check
I like the Sun this is it yeah this is
my pump up song pump up song so what
does that mean wendys your skin Ian did
you listen to it before I arrived yeah
is this so i get piped
like it right it's good and classic
example of a pop song which infuses a
bit of EDM yep which is why it's a good
pump up yeah isn't it it is indeed yeah
kept he keeps me up on driving good
stuff that's good so important to be
awake when you're driving there
something i read an article online about
a music psychologist pinpointed a song
that's really relaxing it's like he
thinks it's the most relaxing song in
the world so dangerous listen to it to
destress right what don't listen to it
while you drive what song is it I come
on oh my god dangerously I'll get up
it's just it's an instrument what is
this one we can fall asleep I'd new
stuff this one it's very slow and
soothing and I juice into it while I was
just sick waves of go a wee of whatever
field the ball that's very soon but it
would make you drowsy yeah driving very
dangerous yes um right now we're gonna
take a quick break we'll be right back

kook from Spotify I did want to we don't
have a ton of time left but I taught me
about your you have something you wanna
share right exactly so do you want to
get off your chest we've already heard
your pump up song what about my pump up
song so everyone so while I go to
karaoke do do karaoke at all I am
deathly afraid of care you've never done
it never done it really I'm I'm
embarrassed by my reluctance right you
do need to be somewhat drunk especially
the first time but certainly even
afterwards it really helps yeah um which
kind of also reaffirms why like van
Halen all those groups got like
faced right it's cuz it's you know you
and put yourself out there yeah so I've
been doing karaoke not like religious
probably like once every six months or
eight months or so right and what I
found was there are so many great songs
that are terrible for karaoke because
they're too long or they have too much
build-up or they whatever so I basically
whenever I do karaoke and I like hear a
song that someone else singing that I
think is good for karaoke or I hear a
song on the radio that I think it's
Karen I write it in my phone under a doc
called karaoke and this is the doc and
I'm not going to read it you can pick
whatever you'd like out of it have have
a little hint that you have and the ones
with triple stars on them are ones that
I've sang and they went over really well
well one of them is an absolutely
beautiful song and that's kiss from a
rose by seal right it's very do you tell
me this do you sing the data yeah you
sing on that as well cuz that's seal
singing that song I know if seals things
that I gotta sing it you know he's put
himself out there I gotta do it the same
okay this is a great carrier song Ouisa
say it ain't so right that is a great
song right absolutely I can see you kind
of drunk just I mean your eyes closed do
you sing these with your eyes sometimes
yes when the emotion gets me I need to
close my eyes um the song song oh so i
have not had the balls you'll you'll
notice that one has not been gr i just
like that sorry doctor I language song
he sang the courage to sing that song
just because there's a lot it's very
quick you know what the words really do
and that's really the key a good karaoke
as well as knowing all the words so we
can play my favorite karaoke song right
now which is Harvey danger 5 polska is
my favorite right now I don't know this
song euni definitely yeah Harvey danger
you definitely know the song was lag
pole-sitter yeah
I'm not sick that I'm Brian doesn't like
Brian our producer does not like the
fact that i like this song is judging me
for it that's a good son right when you
do yeah yeah yep yeah that's a good one
cuz he did me Ellis is interesting
because this is a real mix you know what
um you've got let it go frozen that
impresses me cuz that is a hot song yeah
that's that's three shots in I'm a
shower singer I I won't do karaoke but I
was built sure song in the shower and
that's one of my shower so yeah cuz cuz
my my daughter's this intuitive and the
acoustics are so good in the shower and
you've also got a song that I listen to
a lot um when it came out and cuz it's
by an Aussie artist yeah Natalie
Imbruglia oh yeah I love this nah
delicious from Australia oh she's an
Aussie she's one of ours in that cute
video where she does that cute dance

Australian days yeah this is great well

I so I say it goes in waves what to
Peyton I let me ask you sure what song
of you song and people there I assume
you know by yourself no dude Carol I
dunno thank your dad carry that would be
very sad yes i would have to the first
time i would have to do it but there are
those ringers though you go to karaoke
and they'll be like the guy that goes
every night and like is like I've seen
guys fully dressed in like a suit and
they go up there and no one is in the
crowd for them but they just like the
performance reads like doing like open
mics damn right we're right I have a
friend who does that and I think she's
she's she's she's got balls yeah it
takes balls um what which song from this
list if you song and people listening
have gone that was great um I've got
that from kiss from a rose um I've she
sees me maybe oh yeah you've heard the
call me maybe yeah that's good that's
pretty good gin and juice I've gotten it
and yes a check guys laughing yeah Brian
appreciate yeah yeah so Jin Joos well a
few rap songs I know all the words to so
that is not really seeing my skinny
super pale ass singing gin and juice is
very comical I don't know no because it
is not appropriate for this I don't want
to it I so angry yeah it gets a little
hairy do you know what I want to do
karaoke with you one day absolutely I
would love to bring me out of my karaoke
shell yes one hundred percent I feel
like if you can do it I we gotta get
some sound like a conference it takes a
lack of shame that's really can i have
that i have a complete luck i'm sonya
like you know substances there was good
job of diminishing that cheers just
something that I think I sing quite
nicely getting honest I'm in okay singer
I'll sometimes sing in the you know in
public toilets okay i'm in my stole and
i'll say really and I've heard people in
now like mom I can't like what level are
you singing yet loud enough where I
think I'm alone okay and then I'll hear
someone say you have a nice voice that's
very awkward and I've done a lot of live
TV stuff especially at CNN and to warm
up my voice I would go to the restroom
where the acoustics are great and I
would sing yeah hi Mike gotta watch
yourself and I should have really
checked to make sure all the stalls were
empty before this but sometimes people
would come out and say that was really
nice so you're ready for it I am but I'm
so afraid yeah hang in front of people
like as soon as I find out some stranger
in the toilets was listening I shut down
sure that's a tough situation but I
think alcohol could ya oh it does make
yourself it is the miracle drug it
really is well thank you so much for
