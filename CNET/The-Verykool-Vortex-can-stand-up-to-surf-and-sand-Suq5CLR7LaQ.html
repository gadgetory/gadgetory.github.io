and frankly quite bland hi I'm Sara my
troth with Cena and this is a first look
at the very cool vortex the big selling
feature of the 280 dollar vortex is at
its water resistant and dustproof it can
survive for up to 30 minutes in a metre
of water without getting damaged the
phone has a rugged plastic build to make
it look extra tough on the top of the
vortex is the headphone jack which has a
sealed cover to soft water from getting
in on the left side you'll find the
power/lock button on the right there's a
volume rocker if you turn the screen on
but don't unlock the phone hold the
volume button the phone's flashlight
turns on which is a nifty feature behind
the textured back cover there's a
watertight sealed compartment for the
battery SD card and SIM card the vortex
has a scratch-resistant 4.5 inch gorilla
glass screen the 960 x 540 pixel display
is bright and easy to read in full
sunlight though the colors look muted
the phone is running Android 40 ice
cream sandwich which launched in 2011
and looks dated still the phone comes
with all the typical Android apps like
YouTube and Google Play performance wise
the vortexes 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
processor and 512 megabytes of RAM give
it enough power to handle everyday tasks
like checking email or watching videos
without any problems and mobile games
like temple run ran fine in my testing
the phone only supports 3g HSPA and 2g
data connections which means apps won't
download as fast and you'll have issues
streaming high-definition video on the
back of the phone there's a 5 megapixel
camera with autofocus and flash there's
also a point three megapixel
front-facing camera near the earpiece up
close indoor shots turned out great with
lots of fine detail but outdoor shots
looked washed out video recorded with
the vortex looks fuzzy all in all the
very cool vortex is worth considering if
you need a budget phone that can hold up
to dirt dust and water though many other
rugged phones have nicer designs and
newer Android software the vortex cost
much less and you can use it with any
carrier worldwide what
both pluses in my book you can read my

and this has been a first look at the
very cool vortex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
