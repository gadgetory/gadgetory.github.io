from cash and cards but are they ready
to replace your wallet and which one is
best this is Apple pay versus Samsung
pay versus Google pay Apple and Google
use NFC or near field communication to
make a payment where you tap your phone
on a terminal most newer terminals come
equipped with NFC but not all Samsung
pay uses NFC and a technology called
magnetic secure transmission when you
hold the phone to a terminal it sends a
signal that simulates the magnetic strip
on a card this means it works with older
terminals and all three let you make a
limited number of payments even when
there's no signal so I've been taking
this test very seriously and only using
mobile payments for about a month now
Alexi but why is that because I lost my
credit card oh my physical credit card
is nowhere to be found I already
memorized the numbers and I just haven't
replaced it so I actually appreciated
having the option to do either Google
Play or Apple pay but even in San
Francisco a city that you would expect
to be ahead of the game in terms of NFC
terminals there's still a lot of
merchants that don't take either form of
payment and that's the clear advantage
of Samsung pays because of that MST
you're gonna be able to use this pretty
much everywhere and especially for
merchants has been a bit slow in
updating their terminals - NFC your
contact list you're gonna be totally
fine with Samsung pay Samsung pay even
though it's worked 99 times out of 100
in all of the places I've tried it there
is that one time where it's a different
kind of terminal maybe it's like an iPad
based system something that's a little
bit different it won't work and it's
really embarrassing because the
shopkeepers like oh it's not gonna work
we don't do mobile payments and I give
them the big spiel about Samsung pay and
how it's definitely gonna work this
technology will work and then it doesn't
work in then I'm
and they're not just on your phones
Apple pay works on other Apple products
like the iPad and watch Google pay will
work with newer Android phones and
watches and Samsung pay is also on some
gear watches they also work online Apple
pay has browser payments in Safari and
in several apps just confirm with your
fingerprint or your face and you're done
Google paid just rolled out browser
payments as well in Chrome Safari and
Firefox but not many online stores use
it yet Google and Samsung pay also work
on sites that use visa checkout if
you're shopping on your phone so I do a
lot of shopping online and as a result I
really love it when a site accepts a
mobile payment system so I don't have to
into my details again when they do take
Apple pay or Google pay it's pretty
seamless you don't have to put any cream
all you have to do at least for Apple
pay is authenticate the downside with
Apple pay is that it only works in
Safari we will pay you can do in any
browser right and the one thing I did
find with Google pay which was really
interesting when I did find an app that
supported it there are quite a few it
actually tells you when they do the pay
up like exactly which ones it will take
through the checkout process but because
when you use Google pay your phone is
already unlocked and you go and actually
start to process the payment through the
Google pay interface there's no second
layer of authentication like you don't
need to use your fingerprint or the pin
again to verify that you want to make
that purchase I accidentally bought
stuff on Google pay check out in an app
because I didn't real syndicate I was
like yep continue it's got my payment oh
it's processed the order and I didn't
want it to sorry that was a bit of a
pain point for me it would be great if
there was just an extra layer in
checkout for people like me who bought
things accessed or
Apple pay cash lets you send money to
friends through iMessage and split the
bill Google's version is called Google
pay cent as you might expect only Apple
users can send money to each other but
Google lets you send money to Android or
iOS users or through your computer
so sending money to friends we have the
option of Apple pay cash or Google pay
send at the time we recorded this video
samsung pay does not have a peer-to-peer
payment option out of those two which
one do you use so if I have to be
completely honest I don't need this
either very much okay because there's
other options other options that perhaps
are better or that I had already been
using so for me Google pay the fact that
I have to download get another app
that's my biggest barrier of entry I
already have an MoU stalled in my phone
I already use others like social media
to pay friends Apple pay cash is fine
for other people with iOS devices it's
always a gamble just they have it do
they don't same thing with with Google
pay and so I don't I don't want to be
guessing I have to say I kind of agree
with you here I don't use one of those
as my primary source of sending money I
use gel which is in the u.s. it's that
bank based peer-to-peer transfer system
because it's fast like we did five
minutes of hitting chatted like send
that money it's in my account which is
kind of crazy Google pay same is
probably the second fastest for me it's
usually within like one business day
it's in the account and then Apple pay
cashes unfortunately slowest it's one
two three business days but again all of
this depends on the bank that you're
with and compatibility mobile payment
systems use a method called tokenization
to keep card details secure once you add
your cards to the app it generates a
virtual account number and your real
card number is never given to the
merchant if your phone is stolen all
three let you wipe your device remotely
which will remove your virtual wallet
right along with it
but is your phone really ready to
replace your wallet we challenged all
three to see which one could buy us more
stuff in San Francisco I took google pay
an Apple pay and I took Samsung pay to
find out
finally
sorry Vanessa I think Samsung pay
clearly won this challenge no it's not
even a competition here you have way
more stuff than I do I couldn't even get
my morning coffee which would have been
pretty upsetting if I was relying on
Google pay and Apple pay alone I did get
some nice flowers and maybe it would
have been a different story online also
in other countries around the world like
Australia where I'm from and if say and
tap to go is huge like you can really
get away with never having your wallet
and only ever using your phone if you
want to on the other side of the coin
there was El Salvador where I'm from
where these type of payments aren't even
on the radar so we probably wouldn't
been able to buy anything so at the end
of the day knowing the benefits of each
which one would you choose Samsung pay
definitely I mean I know it's only
available on samsung devices but I think
it's enough of a game-changing feature
for me to totally get rid of my wallet
if I don't want to carry it with me I
would probably choose Samsung pay as
well obviously I'm their number-one
target I lost the card but I do look for
other factors in a phone so I don't know
if that alone would be enough to sway me
to buy the phone but what do you guys
think which one would you choose please
hit us up on the comments below and tell
us what else you want to see compare
next all right okay rolling if the
windows ok reporting live from a
hurricane in centre</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
