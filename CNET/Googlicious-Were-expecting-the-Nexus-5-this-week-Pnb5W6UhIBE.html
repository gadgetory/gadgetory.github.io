google issues for everything google that
week a pack inside of a show each week
and we start the show off with the nexus
5 rumor that started last week and is
coming out to play again the latest
tweet from f leaks shows a full high-res
version of the rumored white Nexus 5 on
the back side with the expected black
front and it also mentions November
first as the possible launch date now
previous rumors have targeted October
thirty-first as the official launch date
but it looks like it's happening this
week and that's not a trick on Halloween
that's the tree now in other Android
news the Nvidia shield Android handheld
gaming device guess the Android 4.3
jellybean update but it brings a few new
and powerful features the big one is
console mode which allows you to plug
the shield directly into your TV via
hdmi and then you can use a bluetooth
gamepad as your controller the update
also adds support for thousands of
android games that allow you to map the
touchscreen controls of games to the
hardware controls with a button mapping
app now it's still a niche product at
three hundred dollars that lacks the big
blockbuster games even if you can stream
some from your pc but i like the fact
that nvidia keeps pushing to add new
features and content now Samsung has
said it's officially rolling out its own
Android 4.3 jellybean update that will
let us phones like the galaxy s4 s3 and
note to work with the new galaxy gear
smartwatch that previously only paired
with the note 3 now this alleged grid of
release dates shows verizon will get
first dibs with the s4 right away and it
will roll out through other carriers and
phones all the way through December
second for the t-mobile note to an LG G
flex phone is official after all the
rumors over the past couple months the 6
inch quad-core smartphone that features
a curved touchscreen and rear control
buttons will hit korea in november but
us pricing and availability remains
unknown now the screens pixel density is
a little disappointing for screen buffs
at 244 pixels per inch which isn't the
end of the world but its coolest feature
though might be the g flex is curved
booty that sports an elastic
self-healing coating that LG says men's
and protects the phone from day-to-day
scuffs and scratch
is you know they should have just called
this phone of the Wolverine that would
have been much better all right let's
switch gears and check out our app of
the week he used to be called mini
Tasker but it's now called condi but
let's see how it can help you out I'm
Dan Graziano and I'm going to show you
how to automate your Android device with
an easy-to-use app called mini tasker
unlike many of its competitors that is
free in the Play Store for devices
running Android 4.0 or higher mini
Tasker is designed to automate different
Android actions say you want music to
start playing when you plug in your
headphones or maybe you want the
brightness to be turned down when your
battery is low all this and more can be
set up in just a few steps open mini
tasker and click on the plus icon select
the launch an app option and choose the
app you wish to use for me it's Pandora
next click on headset connected and
choose which kind of headset you plan to
use one with a mic without a mic or any
type for automating the brightness once
again click on the plus icon but this
time select the screen brightness option
and set it to your liking after hitting
ok scroll to the bottom of the page and
select low battery mini Tasker can also
be used to silence a call from an
unknown number send a text message at a
later time and even change settings like
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth at a specific time
or place all this can be done by
clicking the plus icon but be warned
setting up automated tasks based on your
location may affect your battery life
because your phone will constantly check
your coordinates you may have noticed
the cloud icon next to the plus symbol
clicking this will reveal a list of
pre-written task that you can enable on
your device you can also share automated
tests that you have created with a long
press and selecting the three dots
symbol alright thanks for all that Dan
and we'll wrap things up with to what I
call different stories surrounding
Google now see that exclusively reported
last week that Google has set up shop in
the bay area and has been building a
large structure made from shipping or
cargo containers on a barge now some
evidence even suggest it might be a
floating data center and Google already
has a patent for the concept now the big
boobs wouldn't comment and the
Berlin Press Herald in Maine also ran a
story recently with a structure that
looks similar to the one being built in
the San Francisco Bay now they're also
both owned by the same company now other
follow-up reports claims it's going to
be a floating google glass store but
that makes no sense at all so we'll just
have to wait and see what Google is up
to and the new report from MIT
technology review says data gathered
from Google's self-driving cars shows
that they're safer and smoother compared
to when a human takes the wheel the
reports come from two studies of data
from the hundreds of thousands of miles
Google vehicles have logged in
California and Nevada google has already
been testing its cars on public roads
since 2010 and to sum it up driverless
cars are already testing better than us
and contrary to popular stereotypes I'm
actually a very good driver yeah no no
so look I know what gets you in the mood
I know how you like that sorbet and I
put a little bit of those mint leaves on
it I know yeah well look we put a little
bit that with some champagne on asian
drivers anyways baby check this out so
all right that's going to do it for this
we show email us at Google licious at
cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong and
we'll answer what we can I'm Brian Tom
thanks so much for watching all the
Google goodness this week I will see you
next time for another taste of Google
issues
