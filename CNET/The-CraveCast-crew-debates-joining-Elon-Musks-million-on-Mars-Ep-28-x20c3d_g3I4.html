think it must be a lot we are alive all
right the grave guess I am Eric act and
the 20 feet cnet studios in san Cisco
today we shall see out of its funny bird
Jeff Sparkman and behind controls
Stephen beachy and how did he really got
a one topic to discuss that's because
today they're going to go down in
history as they that is just that a
historic or a day that will be forgot
and they had a ridiculous presentation
I'm talking of course about Elon Musk
founder of SpaceX who today in
Guadalajara Mexico of the International
Astronautical gave laid out over the
course of an hour is in our vision for
not just sending a mission to Mars not
sending a rover trouble just not ours
but he laid out an entire vision for
building a city of a million people on
Mars and doing it like within about a
hundred years yes we covered it in a
live blog Iran's and you can check out
the whole thing is just insanely
audacious how do you think he came out
and the very first thing that he said
was you know today I hope to show that
not only that we can get to Mars but
that maybe you can go to Mars like as in
you as in anybody and the holding is
just kind of a little off the wall and
I've been spending the last couple hours
trying to decide whether or not he's
delusional or a visionary and I don't
I feel like if you're gonna say this can
happen in a hundred years then I can say
that because I'm not going to be
accountable because I'm not gonna be
here in hundred years so I think we
should have unicorn farms in a hundred
years I was wondering I mean he brought
up the Hyperloop we don't have the
Hyperloop what is what is he saying now
to me have the Hyperloop what we do yeah
yeah we have there's a there's working
prototypes I haven't been on the
Hyperloop know so we just gotta sell
running we don't have the Hyperloop I
think there's like a half-mile test
track of a Hyperloop is what we've got
going on so far um and I think that's
the same as yeah I feel like this is the
simpsons montr√©al episode all over
again yeah i did you know it that's kind
of my impression too I mean you know
before i was working writing about
science and technology i spent the first
half of my career covering a lot of
politics and covering a lot of but
environmental issues so that that's kind
of a field of journalism that tends to
breed a lot more cynicism than optimism
you know so there's there's part of me
that gets really excited about the idea
of this guy's actually talking about
starting to send people to Mars like
within about a decade and then a million
there know within a hundred years and
laying out concrete steps for how to do
that but then there's the other
political reporter side of me that's
like you know as a as a species we have
a really hard time pulling off the
olympics every time haha uh so yeah i
don't know it's just so audacious um but
but you know he's talking about like
getting going over the course of the
next decades starting to actually send
spaceships to Mars within about five
years and then maybe by 10 years we
start to send people and that you'd I do
have to give him credit you know he did
say that the first trips tomorrow's are
going to be really dangerous that
there's a pretty good chance people will
die so there is some realism man about
fighting me to sign me up yeah the only
thing I kept thinking was bring potato
plants
potato plants bring potato plants save
the feces yeah I I don't know I want to
be positive about all this because I
think space travel is important to us as
a race like just as human beings we
should be thinking outside of our normal
goals as a culture and through
technology and and everything and that's
great to see his optimism I just think
promising something like this with a
time frame of a hundred years is kind of
silly because none of us are going to be
around in a hundred years ago hey wait a
minute remember when that guy said a
hundred years ago that we'd be on Mars
and we're still trying to figure out how
to rebuild New Orleans right and by the
way that's like that's like the
long-range the actual time frame he gave
was a million people in a
self-sustaining city on Mars between
about 40 and a hundred years so in his
mind this is possible by like the 2050s
and it which is is like even more insane
demand we've we've sent one like maybe a
dozen people to the moon that's as far
as we've gone and we haven't gone back
in 40 50 years and is he planning that
self-sustaining city as well or is he
just focusing on the transportation I
think he's focusing on getting there was
definitely no urban planning and you
know his one hour um I think he
envisions getting it going that SpaceX
is going to provide the transportation
infrastructure to get there and that you
know investors are going to take over
and start to build you know the
propellant paint plants on Mars and
start to build the infrastructure and
that capitalism will basically take over
at some point that's the impression you
get yeah so the propellant station is
going to be that's like the biggest
thing I felt like they have to make
their own propellant on Mars and also
refueling in space as opposed to just
launching a giant ship that's gonna fly
straight to Mars think I felt like that
was like one of the biggest most
important parts of it did you feel that
same way to air yeah yeah and you know
and that's kind of their specialty right
as kind of the logistics that's what
SpaceX has been doing is trying to make
space travel and space exploration
more efficient that's why you know it's
been a big big deal that they've been
doing the reusable rockets the Falcon
minds that go up and send something to
the deliver something of the space
station and they come and land back down
so they can be reconditioned andrey
fueled so you know they showed that
animation today of how work which is
basically that you've got yeah these
ships that are going back and forth you
know they get launched from Earth once
and then they kind of seem to travel
back and forth from orbit to orbit so
you basically have these refueling stops
it'll happen in orbits you got the
spaceship with people on it that's
another crazy thing the spaceship would
carry up to a hundred people huge plane
it's huge yeah and they had they had
photos of like the huge carbon fiber
capsules and they're just another small
buildings that'll carry 100 people and
then he said eventually 200 people but
yes so you have these spaceships to get
refueled in orbit and then you have
rockets that are basically carrying the
fuel back and forth from the service the
earth to orbit or from the surface of
Mars to orbit and then you just kind of
taxing back and forth through space in
these shifts like that's kind of the
plan and then as if that weren't enough
at the very end it's like and I think we
could probably set up gas stations
filling stations maybe on Europa or on
Pluto we can go all over the solar
station as if the assessment of ours the
million people wasn't enough I mean it's
just it's just kind of bonkers but then
you know that there's just that part
that it seems easy to dismiss but this
is a guy that has achieved pretty insane
things already he's not a person easily
to be dismissed and you know obviously
the Wright brothers were dismissed at
first as well as were you know any other
number of visionaries so it's like I
don't know if I'm betting on him but if
I would bet on anyone to do it it might
be him yeah for sure what do you think
is driving him to bring it up right now
that's a good question yeah what does he
know that we don't know that's I feel
like is there a giant asteroid coming
towards us and he's the only one that
knows it like I I don't know I i love
visionaries but sometimes i have to
agree with kelsey like what dry it what
drives him at this certain point in time
aim to make all this happen I mean I
he's always been like a Silicon Valley
you know green technologist right I mean
he's he's always been animated by clean
energy and he's obviously concerned
about climate change and about
sustainability I mean his three
companies right now our solar city solar
power company Tesla which is electric
cars and and SpaceX which is kind of the
furthest form of his ideas which is you
know we're probably not going to be able
to create a fully sustainable earth so
eventually we're going to have to move
off of it so I mean I I think this is
what he's actually been working towards
for 15 years now and it's just this is
just the next step in the process yeah
during the keynote he also mentioned
like he was concerned about his
replacement if he was to die and that he
wants out and was uh he'd want someone
who wasn't so hungry for profits and
stuff but more like changing the world
and making more energy-efficient travel
and stuff like so I thought that was
really cool I was like that's very
interesting that he would say something
like that you know yeah I mean I think
the guy is totally sincere if he was
only about you know turning his billions
into more billion serve you know and
he's you know basically almost lost
everything a covered with frost yeah
getting to this point here's one of his
Rockets landing reason I don't know I
feel like you should just pull a blade
runner and make a replicant of himself
and then he wouldn't have to worry so
when he dies he can still be there I
think we should all do this sorry I
guess I was a blade runner spoiler for
someone but you know I don't know I just
I love visionaries that want to get us
the space i just wish we had more
visionaries to fix us down here because
we have a lot of problems that need
fixing on earth and it would be nice if
we just didn't give up on earth and go
to another planet and screw that planet
up it'd be kind of awesome if we had
more visionaries down here that we're
like well here's how we save the oceans
here's always stop climate change here's
how we like keep each other from killing
each other like i don't know there's
just so many so many problems down here
i wish we could fix before we just go at
while Earth's a crap zone let's just go
to
Elon Musk in particular is like the one
guy you have to give credit for trying
to do both you know I mean he is he's a
solar power guys gonna solar power
company so is kind of trying to work it
from both ends you know I just think
he's probably a little bit over
optimistic and there's other problems
you know because the first thing there's
a couple of things steve and i sent i
sent you a link to a post that Iran
actually last year when we were talking
about Mars one which is another less
likely effort to get to Mars and so we
would put up a post back in February
about all the ways that you could die on
Mars really you know it it's not easy to
survive on Mars and there wasn't a lot
of i link those those problems yeah um
by the way I want someone to make a
short film out of all those ways to die
I think that would be great if someone
made a film so anybody who's listening
that's a filmmaker if you could make a
short film out of Eric's article out of
all the different ways to die in Mars I
would totally I would back that
Kickstarter I'm gonna try to tackle that
yeah I know be hilarious I mean like the
radiation alone um you know I was at a
space conference and it was basically a
conference of all the companies that are
interested in doing business in space
except SpaceX they're like the only one
that wasn't there and it was kind of a
more realistic view and there was a guy
who literally spent decades as one of
NASA's chief doctors and he's like you
know the amount of radiation on Mars you
can't like be walking around even in a
spacesuit look that's not gonna protect
you I mean you basically would have to
be in a bunker under you know about six
feet of soil to protect you from from
the radiation you're not gonna be able
to do a lot of work so there's like
entirely new you know technologies to
like have a fishy efficient radiation
shielding you know it's like it's funny
like that the idea is to become a
multiplanetary species because I don't
know the earth know there might be an
apocalypse oh the earth might not be
around forever climate change whatever
your whatever you're concerned about
because it's like okay but Mars wants to
kill you people think
sounds of earth' you can argue the same
thing about Earth bingo on earth earthy
wants to kill it jared is yelling
Australia hola yeah it's like if you
don't leave me alone I might have to
kill you it's kind of like a hesitant
mobs it's almost like your house is on
fire so do you stay in the house that's
on fire or do you run next door where
you know a serial killer lives you run
next door yeah yeah exactly like to the
melting down nuclear plant yeah earth
doesn't want to kill us but it might
have to Mars really wants to kill us you
know and there's other there's other
problems too when you get into it you
know in advance of this this press
conference I started reaching out to
some people who know a lot more than we
do about this in fact I talked to Joe a
professor Joanne and I'm gonna mess this
up gerber nowit's I think and she is the
editor in chief ameri de of the Journal
of space log get ready this is going to
be exciting so there's this concept of
planetary protection which is kind of
like the environmental version of the
prime directive ok like the prime
directive is like you know don't harm
civilizations or don't it one time a
Star Trek sorry you're not never forget
that but in Star Trek you're basically
not Swift to interfere in civilizations
that are less developed and so there's
an idea called planetary protection that
is kind of the same idea like if we're
going to go to Mars we have to do it in
a responsible way where we won't disturb
you know what might already be there
like we're not even supposed to really
mess with any microbes that are there
that's why when they sent the rover to
mars had to be totally sanitary it was
like a big deal that the Rope the rover
might have been contaminated with
molecules of methane um no Elon Musk's
terraforming plan or am I getting ahead
of what you're saying yeah no that's
where that's where I'm going so like you
know he moscas talked about doing things
like nuking Mars to get heated huh what
an atmosphere going um so you know we
have what Professor Cooper nowit's told
me was you know she referenced the outer
space treaty that basically states the
parties
to avoid harmful contamination and also
adverse changes in the environment
resulting from the introduction of
extraterrestrial matter on earth and
that would also apply to other planets
is the way I understand it I love how
precious we are about that stuff because
it's like you know we're just humans and
we only have one planet and we're
putting all this rules on other planets
we don't own we don't own those plans
they're just planets and we have enough
space junk in space that if we really
cared about these things we wouldn't
just dump everything into space like we
have been for how many decades now so
the fact that we have some sort of
interplay it's kind of like Miss
Universe like it's not really miss
universe it's just this planet so why
are we acting like we own the solar
system like we don't we don't have any
other species to be accountable for yet
there's no other quit jinxing it there's
no aliens out there going oh those
humans are at it again not as far as we
know yeah as far as we know like we
could do whatever we want at this point
until someone you know brings down the
hammer ever done killer kills and things
I'm jinxing it and that the aliens are
gonna uprise I'm sure all of them are
watching this right now and yeah but
anyway I I am curious about the
terraforming I don't know Kelsey you
look like you want to say something
about terraforming so no our video the
video they showed at the presentation
today it ends with multi like they they
zoom out you see Mars and Mars spins
around and it morphs from being kind of
dead red mars that we know to like on
Mars with an atmosphere in an ocean and
it's green and blue and red it's like
okay so that is is that does that means
is the serious about the terraforming
stuff basically wants to turn Mars into
Miami well during the keynote he said
this is possible to do that we can warm
up Mars you said there's plenty of water
there he made it sound like it's a
no-brainer likely to do this not don't
worry about it so I mean that's that's
what scientists have been talking about
for a long time is heating up and
getting the you know melting all the ice
under the ground and creating a new
atmosphere on Mars so
plenty of people think that's possible
so yeah I mean I've watched enough of
the Alien films to know how well that
turned out when someone goes yeah don't
worry about it no problem we could do
that we just need to find the the little
alien hand thingy in total recall oh
yeah put a hand on that I think sci-fi
has worked us to the point now that we
expect all these things so when you say
that I'm like I kept to give every
sci-fi movie that's done yet already
been just watching the video reminded me
of like in Star Trek to where they're
showing the yeah proposal video for the
Genesis torpedo and I know we're so
warped the thing that I want to know
about the whole you know getting to Mars
thing and having people colonize it what
the hell are people gonna do on the what
two-year ride to Mars I mean oh yeah
well that's like a lot of net that's
another thing he talked about was it has
to be fun we have to have a restaurant
below in space yeah totally but yeah I'm
only going if Charles going then I'll go
it's gonna be like a cruise ship I'm
gonna be partying there's me shuffle
board you know all kinds of just for
luck why don't they just name is Mike
Titanic Titanic to trap then white jinx
it so it sounds like you guys wouldn't
want to go then no I would totally go no
I'm not gonna in the first crew are you
kidding I don't know as I I oh I would
almost kind of want to rather go on the
first one then the second one because
you figure the first one although be
like super cautious after they get it
right the first time they're like no
screw we know how to do this and then
you know people start gettin I feel like
they're gonna turn they're gonna treat
it like a prison colony first so they're
gonna send out expendables first okay so
like the movie Expendables they should
just send everyone that was in Los three
oh my god what a great movie would that
be so be expendables it for so it's all
the actors from expendables who are
clearly expendable and throw in the
Suicide Squad just for good measure
because I would want to spend up on two
years with Jared Leto in space hahaha so
I hesitate to repeat this because it's
so mean-spirited but during the Q&amp;amp;A
session today oh my god I got a hold of
a mic from funnyordie
and yes and said you know we've actually
calculated who the most expendable
person on earth is and it's michael cera
like i said mean-spirited Elon was not
amused Oh Michaels well he is kind of
well no hahaha Jeff weren't you saying
that there is a lot about this question
oh my god little like they next time
they do this they really need to vet the
questions because that some of that was
I mean I am like no paragon of being
smooth or anything but like I was
cringing was a comic con was like common
comic-con QA asked if she could come up
and get a high did someone want a hug
yeah note one of the kiss oh gosh
there's a lot of four-letter words being
dropped in questions about Martian
toilet zoo I mean that was a good
question i just don't think you know it
was presented as you know scientifically
as it could have been though it was dead
pain an evocative yes sure it's really
hard um so you know it I agree with what
you said Bonnie about that I think
sci-fi is kind of warped us I guess you
know to the point where we have
billionaires that are like really
pursuing this with their fortune but I
mean I feel like you know you know
talking to scientists who work in
planetary science I have to assume that
I talked to some before the speech but
not after I've to assume that some of
them are freaking out right now because
most of them are concerned about even
like sending you know like like
astronauts like half a dozen astronauts
in space suits that that could you know
contaminate this place if they still
want to explore for science I actually
I've got so I've got a quote here this
is from Peter Doran who is a professor
at Louisiana State University and he
says the big issue with all missions to
Mars is we don't want to create a
situation where we are impacting future
life detection science we don't want to
discover earth life that was transported
there on a spacecraft this is pretty
straightforward with robots but with
humans it's a huge challenge picture
picture humans like the Pigpen character
and the peanut
cartoons walking around shedding
microbes everywhere we go spacesuits as
we know them do not take care of this
problem so you know you got a scientist
here who's worried about the spacesuits
we have going and we're talking about
nuking the place and building city of a
million people well that's why you have
a difference between NASA who are
scientists vs SpaceX which has
scientists but also has more of that
human business men entertainment value
right so NASA would never make those
kinds of promises but then SpaceX wants
to make those kinds of promises because
they want to get people excited they
need the funding blah blah blah my
problem was imes we're so warped as a
species when it comes to space because
of sci-fi we have these really
incredible expectations we have the same
kind of expectations with robotics we
are the same kind of expectations with
just regular travel it's it's hard it's
kind of like law and order and the good
wife has ruined jury duty for me because
I expect when I get a jury duty I mean
I'm pretty boring to begin with but with
you binge watch Law &amp;amp; Order and then go
to jury duty I guarantee you're gonna be
like why aren't why aren't they saying
something quippy like we're the bon mots
where's the dun dun yeah where's the
where's that you know speeches even if
you watch to kill a mockingbird that's
better than jury duty so when you go to
jury duty it's boring a lot of lawyers
aren't very articulate none of them look
like actors half the jury's on their
phone secretly like it's not the same
thing so in space I feel like we have
these Star Trek Star Wars Battlestar
Galactica red dwarf ticker pic and
whatever your idea of what space should
be and we're not there yet and we're
taking too long and it costs too much
and we're taking too many like almost I
would feel like a scientist we're kind
of we're being too careful and I feel
like SpaceX is kind of like that eh
let's just nuke it and terraform it like
you know what I mean like that's not
careful planning to me that doesn't feel
like it's very systematic or scientific
it's kind of like well a hundred years
we're going to do all this great stuff
and we're going to be on this other
planet and I love his sense of adventure
and excitement but I just the skeptic
get me is just wondering if any of this
is really plausible because again we
have these stipulations of we don't want
to screw up the planet by doing all
these things thinking that it's going to
help us get there faster but it may mess
up future endeavors so I don't know it'd
be interesting to see what happened if
we did in fact Mars with earth life I
mean what would you get yeah I almost
think it's like something you can't stop
it's just nature like yeah comets fly
over and they drop DNA or whatever on
this planet and all kinds you know moon
rocks whenever it's just something we
can't avoid so why why worry about it
like which would we end up getting a lot
of really tall people laughter well no
because there's less yeah is gravity on
Mars so eventually unless they have a
way to counter that you know mm-hmm so I
can answer I can actually answer that
question oh good um this is from the
same conference I went to last year this
from a guy named Al Globus that's a
great name NASA guy forever and now he's
big into space settlement he's well he's
a guy who's like thinks we should like
you know have orbiting like cities like
the torus you know like that's his thing
he's not too big on Mars so he pointed
out that this is quote from him we know
absolutely for sure that kids would grow
up week on Mars and they would probably
never be able to visit earth so if you
actually raised a family on Mars you're
stuck there because of the difference in
gravity if you took your Martian raised
human back to earth the gravity would
probably like break their spine oh my
god I'm just thinking of the best spec
script I'm gonna write for CW now I was
just thinking Elton John was right Mars
ain't the kind of place to raise a kid
is that really what he said yeah he's
our visionary Rocket Man that's that's I
mean I can't look it up right now but
that I'm pretty sure that's right I just
think where I like how we're already
thinking about bullying possibilities
these poor kids from Mars about how
they're never gonna make the football
team because they're too fragile well
you know if you're on Mars though Elon
was talking about this like it'd be fun
you can like lift heavy cars and like
other things jump really high in the air
so he said to be kind of fun so maybe
sports on Mars would be awesome I like
how he's selling it with like Superman
ability this is only 38 what was it 38%
gravity compared to earth
Tom something like that so we a we would
weigh like 38 pounds if you're a hundred
pounds on earth you weigh 38 pounds I
just find it would end up kind of like
Blade Runner in the sense that earth
would be where all the poor people end
up because they can't afford the
offworld colonies and so it's going to
be all replicants and really good
chinese food because that's what was in
Blade Runner and really awesome bars and
synthetic snakes and strippers and not a
neon and Harrison Ford and then
everybody else gets to be in the
offworld colonies I it's going to be
interesting because if this does happen
just the possibilities of what that
means for culture for society for the
gap between the haves and have-nots and
who gets stuck here and who gets to go
to Mars so I mean obviously that's not
going to happen in the next hundred
years that's probably 500 years
situation unless we just get blown up
for like some sort of intergalactic
highway I still think I'm a big
proponent of all the sci-fi out there i
do think Hitchhiker's Guide to the
galaxy is the closest to what's going to
happen is we're gonna be in the way of
some sort of construction project of
some other aliens never be like just
blow up earth it's in the way yeah and
that's the end so Elon better hurry up
when it's right I had an insight today
watching the presentation on kind of why
Ilan style is what it is you're like why
he's like the only guy doing this space
stuff but doing it with like the pizzazz
and like you know promoting every
landing even when like they don't work
and then things crash and blow up like
you know it's like all completely
transparent and he's all about marketing
and exposure and attention when nobody
else in the space can be even NASA's not
as good as he is about are pretty good
and it's because look if this is his
vision and this is something he actually
thinks is going to happen in his
lifetime he's going to have to build
enough support around it enough
enthusiasm around it to number one have
the amount of investment he's going to
need to change lives to make this
possible to probably change treaties to
make this possible so this they're like
has to be like a groundswell of public
support for this idea like you had with
the space race maybe so you know based
on what we've seen of SpaceX and kind of
the enthusiasm over the last five years
since curiosity
did I mean do you think that's possible
is there enough public support to you
know let's pretend that he's right this
is possible who do you think people get
behind it crickets I mean sure that
happened with Mars before yeah I think
people get behind it but again i'm
wondering if people get behind it
because we're so warped and we want the
sci-fi it becomes real sigh real and so
sci-fi that we would do this or I don't
know like I mean it's hard to get this
country let alone the world to agree on
one thing so I like you said you know
treaties would have to be figured out I
mean I don't know the International
Space Station has it figured out that
it's not too political I would assume so
maybe there is a way to do this and
there's there's ongoing interest in all
of this what's his first milestone the
as in mind like what's the next step
here so if i recall stephen he was
talking about starting to launch some
the dragon landers which are the Landers
that spacex has that could land
apparently on any surface that's water
or solid in the solar system so sending
you know for sending the couple of those
unmanned to Mars over the next five
years and then sending people and then
starting to build the infrastructure
yeah sublime at all starts what
according to him within about ten years
yeah he also talked a lot about mass
producing rocket boosters you know so
now he's they're able to make 300 i
think it was 300 rocket boosters in one
year which is pretty phenomenal you know
so that's almost one a day that's pretty
incredible so he's talking about
mass-producing these getting the cost
down of all this and making a very
efficient spacecraft when i was watching
this whole thing I kept coming back to
interstellar like yeah I learned
everything I learned like everything you
say from watching uh what's his name uh
what's the actors name of that movie
Martin Short know uh Matthew McConaughey
oh I'm thinking entertaining I think
yeah yeah that movie is great too that's
even better I think I just kept going to
interstellar and I kept going to Martian
you know and i'm like okay yeah I
efficiency that makes sense well
yeah I mean they're building these
rocket boosters they're gonna be
building these ships he said those the
models that we saw in all these videos
that they've been showing were actual
CAD models of these ships so I mean
they're well on their way towards making
this a reality and then you know this
whole event was like it was like a pitch
it was like a giant pitch you know for
funding basically yeah and he talked it
all so about like even if you guys don't
give me some money i'm gonna be putting
my own money into this you know I'm
unmask my masking a large amount of
money to make this happen so I'm going
to do it with or without you so I
thought that was very interesting and
very ballsy all I needs is like maybe a
handful or a hundred other really
eccentric billionaires to help him like
create some sort of Justice League of
rich billionaires into space and we
could probably get there look I mean
once the system was set up to get people
back and forth to the point where you
can actually survive there you know he
was talking about it would cost about
two hundred thousand dollars in today's
dollars for somebody to move to Mars and
crazy if that if you get to that scale
where that's possible there is probably
a million people yeah in the developed
world it would move to Mars for two
hundred thousand dollars I mean that's
still cheaper than San Francisco Oh big
time if you got a house once you got
there yeah yeah exactly don't even those
numbers where those numbers come in from
he could just be pulling that out of
thin air I think that's like his
projection of what he's hoping it you
know that's that's kind of the number he
hopes it to be in the future right using
solar power and in these in the farming
of potatoes yeah the fuel farming
whatever they gonna do electrolysis on
Mars to separate water from you know
separate the chemicals in the water to
build fuel so so weird I would throw
down though it is kind of like a why
like the old I mean it's just like I
guess climbing Mount Everest look
there's no reason to do it except to do
it why would anyone actually do this
except to do it there's no I mean yeah
rising sea levels like maybe don't live
on South Beach in Miami but like
everywhere else is up still okay no it's
not that's totally not I just wrote an
article for cnet on Bill Nyes prediction
of climate change of what's going to
happen in the next like 70 to 100 years
and we could look at all of our coastal
towns being underwater very in that
timeline so if if climate change is
happening the way it's happening whether
or not you believe it we did it or its
mother nature doing it it's happening so
the earth is changing and where there's
a lot of cities that are going to be
underwater and there's a lot of land
that's going to be underwater and
there's a lot of countries that are
gonna be underwater so this is something
that people are definitely looking at
and worried about and instead of putting
a stop to it if we can even put we may
not be able to stop climate change
anyway if that's the case that's why
these types of people like Elon Musk
saying well if the earth is going to you
know implode on itself or we're going to
destroy Earth here's another option and
I think people are actually starting to
look at this seriously and I know I was
kind of macing it in a sci-fi fan kind
of way but I want him to succeed like I
don't not want this guy to succeed like
I don't feel like you know he's insane
enough that it might actually work and
it might actually happen I doubt I'm
going to be around to see it but I hope
it happens because we need to have some
sort of plan because earth isn't going
to be the way we have it now forever and
so we either need to figure out okay how
are we going to survive on this planet
once mother nature takes over and
decides to get rid of us or where can we
go and I like the idea of space cities
like not necessarily being on a planet
but kind of like you know I guess if
we're going to use the sci-fi analogy
like Cloud City on Star Wars just don't
have Lando in charge of it but I mean
really yeah or or the death or something
where I and I thought that's we were
going with international space station's
was okay is it possible to live for many
years on a space station and how big can
we could build these space stations and
can we do like growing crops and all
that stuff and have a city within a
space station so to me that's where I
thought we were going that necessarily
planet colonization but I could be wrong
there's a really a guy
tirana mer his name is john s lewis i
want to say he was at like arizona
arizona state but if you google him he's
had a pretty amazing career and I saw
him give a talk once where you know his
whole thing was we should be spreading
throughout the solar system as far as we
can just because because like we're just
like this infant civilization you know
we're just like these people on this one
rock like imagine a we're capable of
amazing things right now in terms of
things that we've created and things
that we've built in systems that we've
built in the internet and snapchat and
their spectacles now and all that stuff
and so his whole thing was like you know
imagine like what a quadrillion people
spread out through the asteroid though I
mean it's just like the ultimate
manifest destiny vision and you have to
imagine that maybe Elon Musk has a
little bit of that attitude swell yeah
he never does interesting point he never
really talked about like we have to get
off this planet because the you know
because it's getting warm and the
atmosphere is disappearing he was
talking about it like we need to be a
multiplanetary species you know that was
kind of his main pitch so I thought that
was yeah not that was probably the best
way to go once you start doing
fear-mongering then it goes down the
drain so the fact that he's doing a
willy wonka oh he's talking about going
to he's talking about going to Mars and
then heating up that atmosphere is very
present really good at it yeah you know
I did you fast though he's like we're
gonna go there we're gonna do climate
change there and they will do best yeah
if you're good at ruining planets put it
in our own favor maybe we could ruin it
to the benefit of all mankind the way he
mentioned it was actually really funny
he didn't mention like at the very
beginning is like yeah there could be an
apocalypse I'm the word it'll be but no
we should probably worry about that and
then he's and then you don't know ours
he's like yeah Mars is a little cold but
we could warm it up a little yeah yeah
it was so fast exactly how he said it I
mean talking about nuking all I'm
imagining is him being an old man like
the grandpa that created Jurassic Park
and that's all I'm thinking now is just
the billionaire he's like well we could
do this what because you know making
dinosaurs out of amber what that was
just for fun that wasn't anything other
than
but now I I hope that this happens I
really do I just don't know how it's
going to happen and I am interested to
see all the things that go wrong before
we get it right right and hopefully that
won't set us back because as we know
with NASA once there's a major
catastrophe everything stops for a long
time until they can start it up again so
hopefully that won't happen here which
is a point he made you know is that you
can't really rely he says you can't
really rely on agencies like NASA
because they're politically motivated
and we would they were motivated by the
space race and fear of the Soviet Union
to get to Mars and then yeah you know
the challenge the shuttle the shuttle
mission ended the show program ended
then there's kind of we're just on this
trajectory of like yeah maybe we'll go
to Mars in the 2030s but you know maybe
that's a way we can wrap up the show is
you know looking into our crystal balls
and what do you think is realistic in
terms of when we got I saw that's part I
was thinking about something else I had
really balls realistically when do you
think we have a colony on Mars is it
going to be with you on musk in a
hundred years 500 years never I'm
thinking it's gonna be sooner I think
it's gonna be like in the next 20 years
I think God how many people a small crew
like Matt Damon and his crew like you
know I played alone small group how long
does it take to get to Mars it takes
like two years for something you can get
there in nine months nine months yeah so
I think it's totally possible that this
will happen if your pitch Gilligan's
planet isn't it yeah yeah 20 years I'm
same movie star a professor and Mary
yeah I I think it's possible but not
with humans I think they should have
robots figure i already have robots no I
mean real robots not robots like cures
Romeo or was a real rope no I know but I
mean humanoid robots like robots that
are slight human slight robots so we
could test the the living capabilities
like robots that are like mobile VR like
so we can still enjoy it but we don't
actually have to go I know maybe I'm
being an idiot but I kind of feel like
you should have humanoid robots to test
everything before the humans get there
not actual robots that look like tanker
trucks but human asked robots to see
what all the human problems will be
below Osman style yeah like Jude Law
more like a but yeah so they all like
experience all I don't know I have blade
runner on the mind because they're
they're doing the sequel with that and
I'm trying to figure out how they're
gonna put Elon Musk in the sequel blade
runner too so I think I'm just thinking
replicant minded as opposed to more
realistically but yeah I hope that
whoever the sacrificial humans are that
go first there's a list of a man yeah or
sign it up there like they want to go I
kind of what their name on that plan I
kinda picked your lies I kind of think
it'd be okay to just let the stupid
people go first and then save our real
scientists I don't know but okay but you
need like a Matthew McConaughey up there
do you want a planet full of stupid well
we already have that that's what I'm
saying yeah I don't know like I just I
don't want to sacrifice our best
scientists on something that's gonna
explode like I'd rather send some you
know expendable scientists not sure we
would have list with a solid B students
is what you're saying yeah like you know
like The Suicide Squad send them and
then send our brightest and best I don't
know it's hard to determine this because
I just don't think the first the first
like voyage is going to be successful so
I don't want to see all these great
people die uh but I guess you kind of
have to do that for North progress to
happen i don't know i just use jeff i
assume a successful colony will happen
at the earliest one day after i die
because that's just how it go oh well
put your brain in a jar like futurama
and you can go that I would be fine with
that there you go don't let you all know
that's the timetable people are you
watching you like a hawk jab yeah but
that that means that they'll want me to
live longer no what about you can't
clearly didn't think this through
nothing Calvin got nothing she's like
opinion I don't care interested to see
but no I can't
he kept this one I said McConaughey just
send makan a I think we're Drita
McConaughey yeah it's not Michael Cera
it's makan malam McConaughey and like a
robot sexy robot star that was a really
good movie and he was amazing what yeah
well movie monster oh I am totally off
time that Michael sir I mean I would've
put Eisenberg in there but whatever well
is it Michael Cera isn't he like part of
Funny or Die he's kind of like he's he's
up everyone is everyone is anyone who's
been on drugs is very heart of the joke
yeah I guess so it starts again tonight
doesn't yeah I don't know we'll sit
we'll see what happens but yeah I i I'm
hope I'm hopeful I just don't want to be
on that ship but I'm hopeful lyrically I
don't think any of us want to be on the
ship except maybe Sparkman's ashes the
next door yeah makin I myself do you
think yeah Eric what do you think um so
I think well I think he sold me on one
thing today in the past I've written for
cnet that I didn't see him even getting
there before NASA just cuz he always
takes three times as long as he says
he's going to with all of his stuff but
I think he convinced me today that he
might manage to get people to Mars
before NASA does maybe the next 15 years
but I think everything else I don't know
if any I don't know if much more than
that is gonna happen in his lifetime
maybe there is like a small colony or
like a small you no outpost there by the
2050s but I just can't imagine much more
than that but it sounds like he's gonna
through sheer force of will and through
the money he's got a mast of the support
he has now I think he can at least get
people there quicker than anybody else
so that's something yeah um so I guess I
guess we'll have to wait and see how it
goes there's going to be a whole lot
more coverage on CNN over the next hours
and days so be sure to check back with
us and also check back next month for a
brand new show there might be a little
different we'll see that's the crave
cast for now and for eternity
haha we will see you next time for
Stephen Beecham Jeff Sparkman Bonnie
Burton and Kelsey Adams thank you very
much guys this was a fun one and we'll
see you all next
