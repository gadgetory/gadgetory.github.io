Gadget glow I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update google glass could
be on all of our faces by 2014 just
think in two years you could be one step
closer to living like the ton of Geordi
LaForge google co-founder sergey brin
said 2014 could be the year it hits the
market but first only the bleeding edge
techies at the conference gets a
pre-order the augmented reality glasses
for fifteen hundred dollars a pop and
when the prototype ship next year i'm
sure you can score pair early if you
want to pay like three grand on ebay
because you know someone's going to be
Hawking these for a crazy price in fact
some from the conference already put
their Nexus 7 tablet attendee freebie on
ebay but um no one's buying because it's
going to be out in just a few weeks for
two hundred dollars and probably no one
wants to pay more than that right now
but thanks for playing here at cnet
we're putting the Nexus 7 and the new
Nexus Q to the test so do check out our
full reviews and what's so interesting
about the Q aside from the shape is that
it's Google's first jump into home
theater streaming hardware and it's born
in the US of A which is one of the
reasons why it's three hundred dollars
you can get more out of other streaming
products for Less even an xbox isn't
that much but it is pretty I mean it
spins on everything google has also been
unveiling lots of news on the software
and service side the Chrome browser and
the google drive dropbox service are
coming to Apple's iOS devices and you
might want to dust off the cobwebs on
your google+ account and check out the
new google event feature if for no other
reason than to prepare yourself for
possible embarrassment because if you
have an android phone with this new
google+ app you can turn on party mode
to upload photos to the event page in
real time and everyone's photos are
posted in chronological order but when
that party mode is on its every photo so
events can be filled with unflattering
shots of you with your eyes half blinken
or worse maybe it's worth being extra
careful around those snap happy android
users and let's end with some spicy news
that's not Google related the game maker
Zynga has launched a new game you can
play face book called the ville
in the game you build a dream house and
invite your friends to hang out and it's
a whole lot like the sims in fact you
could even make virtual whoopee with
your Facebook friends but you can't
marry you have kids Zynga says this is a
family-friendly wholesome game and the
will be is just you know one piece of
the game Zynga also announced other
games that you can kill your time with
including matching with friends chef
ville and Zynga elite slots that your
