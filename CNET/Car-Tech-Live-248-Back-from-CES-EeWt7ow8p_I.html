show in las vegas and we saw more car
stuff than ever before we've got we're
going to talk about some stuff we saw
from qnx mercedes-benz Audi pioneer and
will even take a drive in the Fisker
Karma this is car tech live for january
19 2012 I'm Wayne Cunningham in the
studio with antuan goodwin and steven
Beecham at the controls Brian Cooley is
off doing something else right now but
he should be back next week I imagine so
let's get into it we saw we're consumer
electronic show last week which is why
we didn't have a car tech live show and
there we saw while Antoine you saw
something really cool that you gave it
you gave the best of CES for car tech
not overall the best of CES her car tech
reward and that was a excuse me qnx is a
car to a mobile applications platform
and basically the reason i picked it is
because it was a lot of small things
that added up to us one really awesome
impression of what QX is kind of working
on in the car I mean for starters well
they basically took their sort of qnx
interface that you've already kind of
seen in the blackberry playbook and they
put that in the dashboard when they put
in intelligent so that you know if
you're you're driving alone you can't
play Angry Birds from the front seat but
then you can do things like stream
pandora radio or access any of those
apps that would run on that that that
sort of platform they also replace the
entire instrument cluster with like a
giant LCD that you know kind of did
interesting things like show a very
grand turismo like live view of the
Nurburgring if you were if you if you're
driving on that track and allowed you to
kind of switch between like a track mode
in a regular driving mode but then I
started getting into the the things that
really impressed me things that were
kind of unique in the QNX booth for
starters they basically showed off a way
to pair your bluetooth phone with the
car without having to go through all the
trouble of like pairing and going into
in use on your phone and then on your in
your car that a you and I way we kind of
pair our phones to at least two cars a
week yeah and it varies from being
extremely easy to extremely maddening Oh
what qnx done has done is they've built
some NFC technology into their car like
so inside of the center console and also
in the little cup you know the little
pocket that fits underneath the the
center stack they've added NFC sensors
that can read an NFC chip in the phone
automate the bluetooth pairing process
nice that would be really really
convenient right so you just get in the
car you sit your car in the cup holder
boom you're paired just like that yeah
ended I mean ever like that would save I
mean me definitely a ton of time so just
for our readers here who probably not
you know filled in on this whole insider
baseball bit of car technology qnx is a
software company that does they do
back-end platform work their software
appears in a lot of car infotainment
systems right but he's but you don't
really see their branding or anything
like that and so covering this we're
seeing what they're doing shows some of
the stuff that may come up in cars in
the immediate future or the near future
so Antoine what features there do you
expect to see in cars coming up sometime
soon well definitely that sort of
internet connection they demoed a rear
seat entertainment system that had
applications audio and video streaming
and I was also even able to do a video
conference with some of the guys who are
hiding in the back of the booth on their
own camera they also showed off that
that NFC that technology is already here
in phones now it's just a smart
application of that technology to
basically use that tag that's already in
the back of your Galaxy Nexus for
example to automate that bluetooth
pairing one thing that I want to see but
I don't know if we're going to see it
anytime soon as they showed off what's
called ultra HD audio straw basically in
bit it's called ultra HD audio and
basically what that allows you to do is
do stereo quality CD quality voice calls
so you know basically you never
into that sort of like muddy voice
duplex issue with talking to people I
don't know why you'd want it in stereo
but they basically stated that will you
know if they ever decided to maybe use
this sort of same protocol for audio
streaming you would need to reinvent the
wheel hmm so if you were doing some sort
of audio telephony or you know concert
broadcast or whatever you can use that
same Ultra HD audio technology that
you're using for the voice calls already
and then you basically would it would be
backwards compatible and phones that
could do that what I'm think it would be
cool is surround sound for your phone
calls so you hear you're the person
you're talking to you from all around
your head ya know it's like that would
be weird because whenever I speakerphone
with people I tend to like walk around
the room and do other things oh I can
just imagine me virtually just kind of
floating around their head all they
drive and you know it's like they're
behind you said Larry they say and then
suddenly cuz whenever you're on
speakerphone the in and you seem a
little distracted the first thing the
person ask you like what are you doing
like oh you know dusting or making a
pizza yeah I me a little off script here
we talked about or you you saw this
Garmin set up at the garmin OEM setup
they wouldn't let you take photos up
they would not let me take photos of it
they have this they showed off three
different levels of their sort of like
well i guess because the pnd market
shrinking you know it's more important
than ever for garmin to kind of
basically i mean they they know this but
they need to let investors and consumers
know that the pnd market is only like a
chunk of what they do they also have
avionics they also do a lot of OEM
integration they've already started with
a Chrysler in their UConnect system and
they want to get more into those sort of
things and so they showed off firstly
like a very simple dashboard that kind
of had some Gracenote stuff built into
it things that we that if you've seen
the Chrysler you connect system you'll
already be pretty familiar with then
they showed off a second tier that kind
of had this really cool haptic feedback
rotary controller with some there's a
very interesting dashboard interface I'm
actually putting a video up on that
today so you check for that on the car
tech blog so you can see that in action
and then they showed off
a top-tier sort of entire garmin
dashboard now this thing had an
instrument cluster that had been
replaced by gigantic LCD a 12 inch LCD
display that's in the center stack so
all of your climate controls all of your
infotainment all of that is just kind of
all brought into this touchscreen
infotainment sort of system that if
you're familiar with the the windows
Metro UI from windows phones you kind of
have an idea of what that looks like
black background white text just really
slick and well-designed and they're
basically bringing in your navigation
they're bringing in the internet they're
bringing in your contacts your calendar
so you get in your car and and you kind
of have this little india thing that
pops up and it goes like hey Wayne um so
here are the things that you're doing
today you've got you know here are your
appointment you can click on any of them
to navigate to it and it's just kind of
that promise of you know your your car
basically being intelligent tied into
your cloud right I can see it's like I
don't really want to go to that meeting
but it's gonna take me to that meeting
anyway yeah but I was just really sad
they wouldn't let me take pictures of it
I could take pictures of it so you could
see what was going on but they would
only let me show blanked out screens
with giant garmin logos and right now
this is something they're going to show
to their potential customers clients yo
companies i guess i was actually back
there with with them and and in their
private their private booths that you
can't get into without an invitation and
they basically had a bunch of investors
who would probably prefer to remain
nameless alright see that that's what
you get from us is special access one
thing i saw which doesn't require any
special access at this is really
interesting in the north well some north
or south north hall north is where the
all the automotive stuff is and this
year there were some really major
displays from companies like
mercedes-benz audi ford and we're
talking like car show quality displays
yeah i think Audi's booth look better
than their regular cars like I'm
thinking they're gonna start carrying
that one around they might you know it
was smaller and they had fewer cars and
had more lights yeah plenty of water
fluorescent lights per square
and anywhere else in the it was a
well-lit booth I can definitely say that
and one thing funny I found about the
automotive booth at CES is that from the
major auto companies as they had
probably more dashboards than cars
around which is perfect for conserve
electronics show floating dashboards
which seats in front of them right and
one thing that they had in the
mercedes-benz booth where they actually
had the new SL roadster which they also
just unveiled to Detroit the same week
this car they had its dashboard in this
car is the first one with their new app
strategy and I'm kind of excited about
this because mercedes-benz was a little
bit slow in the whole app integration
area BMW already sort of has a strategy
audi has already got a strategy but so
waiting to see what mercedes-benz did
and they showed off this really pretty
cool system built in built into their
current command interface race yes if
I'm if we're perfectly honest is
probably the ugliest of the infotainment
systems available is still that weird
yellowy beige yeah it's special one in
green system looks like index cards or
something horrible yeah their cars have
gotten so futuristic looking yeah the
design of that it's you know they had it
forever and fortunately it's well so
that they added that thing and and this
is the fortunate thing I was talking to
their the guy demoing it there for me
and he mentioned that they are going to
upgrade this their idea is to use one of
the concept ones that they've had in a
yeah you one of the concept interfaces
they've shown and the one they'd show it
is all sort of it was crazy violet stuff
going on which may be a little too much
for mercedes-benz buyers but kinda had
this weird like Tron look with that the
one that you saw with the it's like a
black background like violet neon
exactly on everything yeah yeah so they
said you know he said they're gonna go
to something like that need to go they
need to find a happy medium right they
actually just need to look at how t
system that's an idea but the cool oh so
anyway their app strategy and this whole
new interface they have has this element
this is actually going to be deployed in
the new SL which is coming out soon this
year they've got this covered
lo kind of idea so you have these index
let's sort of floating into index cards
on a carousel with the different apps
and you have things like Facebook and
Yelp and Google search and you can kind
of flow through these little index cards
and get to see these different cards and
then you find the one you want you
select it and then you get into
something like oh say you up for example
and you can find close nearby places and
pick a a review you can find a review of
nearby restaurants I think I think it's
just focused on restaurants in this
first iteration of it they'll block out
all the other businesses and stuff you
know you really don't need and basically
see like the star review and you can
navigate to them and whatnot it's really
good for like discovering like a new
place to eat when you're in the new town
yes is any usually the first thing you
do is bust out your phone and just go
like all right what's around and yeah
you know if being able to do this in the
dashboard of your car it's why you're
parked presumably write a lot lot of the
stuff is actually locked out when you're
when you're the cars in motion one of
the things that I really like to see and
I'm seeing this actually a lot more and
it probably just kind of piggybacking on
Facebook opening up there sort of a API
but I'm seeing a lot of Facebook
integration in cars with the event
because this is something that I've
always thought you know a lot of times
you can invite it to something somebody
you know party or a movie opening or
something and then the facebook event
kind of has that really nice big map
built into it and in a dress when you
see it on the website then you've got to
copy that down you know beam it to your
phone or you know re-input it when you
get in the car this is sort of an
interesting you know because I guess
when you start saying like and they have
facebook integration in the car the
first thing people go is like what the
hell would you want to do that well the
mean there's already the sort of rich
community of people inviting people to
things on Facebook and just being able
to take advantage that information get
in your car and go like all right I'm
going to you know Wayne housewarming or
whatever and just being able to go like
to do there's the event OOP now I'm
going
right just have that go to your
navigation system the car knows where it
is you don't have to copy through your
phone and you never have to know your
friend's address that way I don't know
anyone anyway and they also actually
with the Facebook integration in this
new mercedes-benz thing you can't update
your status but if you're driving they
only have these canned responses so it
says one of them is I'm currently out
and about in the car out and about yeah
you can change those okay yeah I was
told that you can kind of go in and
change those uh when you're not driving
and then you know so you would have to
is currently out about the car I'm girly
mucking about in my car yeah i mean i
don't know it's that I don't know that
my brain immediately goes to those weird
many voices and the quirky things that
they said how he was just like I'm
having fun motoring guys like imagine
you would like goggles none of the
driving gloves that sort of thing yeah
they said that this this demo that they
show it at CES of this mercedes-benz app
system it's still a lot they're still
doing a lot of work on it and I know
they said for one thing it says the
first screen said something like
mercedes-benz command online and they
said no go ahead yeah they're going to
change it to mercedes-benz apps I saw
some interesting things that their press
conference though as far as the future
of what they want to do they start they
showed off sort of a minority report
esque sort of like touch oh yeah
anything so they show this video and
there's a guy and he's in a car a
Mercedes vehicle he's driving around on
the embarcadero of San Francisco and
this dude has everything on the screen
he's got wikipedia articles about a
bridge he's like clicking that he's uma
ng into his friends and looking at a
calendar and I'm sitting here at the
press conference going like who the hell
is driving this car then it turns out
that it's autonomous Oh God and they're
sort of you know thinking about building
some of that and then it turns out that
it's just the kiosk that's in their
booth to demonstrate this sort of system
but they showed off some other
interesting things they had this uh this
sort of this sort of car sharing system
that they kind of wanted to build in and
they showed a video of like you know
you're driving along to a concert and
some other person wants to go to the
concert and they can just kind of
ping you and you pick them up in your
mercedes-benz and then you go to the
concert and have a beautiful friendship
after that it was sort of interesting
one of the big comments that we get from
the livestream commenters is just like
they was gonna buy a Mercedes Benz and
then start sharing it with people um
pick it up hitchhikers yeah I mean I
think it's kind of interesting the whole
concept of like the cars a social
network and you know I always thought
that it was kind of cool that they you
know early thinking they will you maybe
you can make friends with picking up
people because I've I've made a friend
out of the casual carpool that we have
here in the Bay Area it wasn't a lasting
friendship but it was a very brief
friendship well the funny thing is you
never know how certain things will take
off and the idea of car is the center of
a social network it might be the wave of
the future maybe mercedes-benz is on to
something you know sometimes things you
know just skyrocket like you know cat
memes on the internet you know there's
there's also do you know kind of the
spin-out outsider mercedes banz it into
another automaker on star showed off
that they open their application
platform basically giving apps selected
ab providers access to their telematics
system so they demonstrated a system
with a car sharing service whose name
escapes me right now um what's that car
sharing service called Oh RelayRides
really they basically announced the
partnership with RelayRides where if you
have an OnStar vehicle and your
RelayRides member then people can when
they rent your car which basically it's
like a private VIP car I have a Chevy
Volt I'm not driving it three days out
of the week somebody come by pick up my
car I Drive it for five dollars an hour
all right so you know basically they
open up their ass platform to basically
allow RelayRides members to show up pop
and lock my doors so you don't have to
leave the keys underneath a rock or
something like that and then also you
know allow you to keep track of your
vehicle through on starz telematics
system so you don't have the issue with
the exotic car sharing company where
people just show up and steal your damn
car yeah it's interesting with the
OnStar integration with that I mean on
star has the perfect platform to enable
that so it makes sense that they would
get into it whether RelayRides will
actually take off I kind of wonder about
it relayrides do what was doing okay
before they announced the partnership
with GM last year and this is just like
another step in that direction but I
mean you can rent any car through them
yeah so you also saw TeleNav as a whole
new thing scout yes just let that
telling have already kind of had a nap
till enough navigator um but it's you
know TeleNav navigator it was good I was
a pretty cool name so they renamed well
they basically repackaged it as Scout
but they did a little bit more than that
they've also kind of opened it up into
into a little bit more so the app the
iphone app it's a visual refresh you get
your navigation turn-by-turn directions
with voice prompts you get I you
destination discovery so you can search
for places you can see Yelp reviews you
can find places that your facebook
friends recommended you can recommend
places to your Facebook friends all
through the app then there's also a
mobile website access Scout ami which
basically is a similar sort of
functionality but it's on your little
your laptop's you're probably going to
be a little bit you know more eager to
click around and do more it's more sort
of focused on discovery at that point
because I'm very seriously doubt
anyone's walking around with their
macbook in one arm you're going from
point to point that's seen it but the
most interesting thing about Scout that
that kind of got my attention is that
they've also you know announced a
partnership with Ford SYNC AppLink and
forwards actually chosen Scout as their
mobile navigation app for future appling
vehicles so like if you have the Fiesta
and you want turn-by-turn directions and
you don't want to pay for Ford's turn my
job can you even get nav on a fiesta you
can uh the theist good question I think
I think they're stuck with the same
thing destination just yet amber that's
whatever destination campus yeah sort of
thing but now you'll be able to like
hook Scout into that and you'll be able
to basically suction cup your phone to
the dashboard
by turn directions there and and access
the controls through the sync system
with voice command now let's go they
also built hooks into Scout that allow
to do video output so even if you don't
have a Ford SYNC vehicle you can like if
the first partner in this is Sony you'll
be able to plug your iPhone in this case
they're also android and blackberry
versions of the app coming up to that
head unit and basically the interface
will reformat it felf and display on the
touch screen of the Sony so basically
you're adding navigation to a non
navigation enabled doubled in unit and
there are potentials for them to have
partnership with OEMs with other
aftermarket developers they had a custom
ford explorer that was kind of running
at the show where they basically taken
over the touchscreen display in the
dashboard and and replaced the whole
Ford you know MyFord Touch system with
Scout conceivably you'll be able to do
that with with other vehicles as more
partners or an out so when does a scout
come out it's out now on iphone you know
in certain play around with it all right
have to update my iphone app I've got
until it have on there it's a separate
download okay you can actually have
telenav inch count running mad by side
and with I know with the current telling
a bap they or you know last year tell
until in that app it was free and get
turn-by-turn directions with it but if
you want you could pay more and you like
traffic and other oh there it's they
haven't really discussed pricing with me
as far as this but I'm pretty sure it'll
be something similar there will be like
premium services but I think the basic
turn-by-turn directions for you know I'm
just trying to get from point A to point
B and I just want someone to say turn
left here turn right here I that that
should be built into the free app cool
cool one what I saw in the audi booth
its consumer electronics show this was
pretty interesting they say and out he's
done a lot with technology in the cars
we actually voted the audi a7 as our
tech car of the year last year just
because it had so much going on is the
first real real connected car and you
know used Google Earth as its navigation
system so you know the a7 is well just
below the a8 which is outies flagship
sedan while their top sedan
and then they also put this technology
in the a6 and you kind of think okay are
they just going to reserve this
technology for the premium cars they six
through eight but no at the Consumer
Electronic Show Audi showed off their
new a3 their cheapest car in the US the
smallest car in the u.s. well I guess
the TT is technically the smallest car
in the US right but the a3 is sort of
the you know the Affordable Audi in the
u.s. they showed off the new
infotainment package for that and it has
everything that the a6 a7 a8 have and a
bit more there you go that's awesome so
what's what's new what's new is ok first
off in the those other cars they had
that cool touch pad thing that let you
scribe letters in or select things on
the map right in this case they they
integrated that touch pad with the
controller knob but it's not like a
separate skwerkel right it's just built
into the top surface of the knobs yeah
it's the top of this knob so you can
actually scribe on that and then it so
the not the dial or knob is a little bit
bigger because of that well space is a
premium in a smaller car exactly and I
think that's why they did this and also
cool is the fact they've got the the LCD
now it rises up out of the top of the
dash and they use this le used an LED
LCD so LED backlighting for this LCD is
it like as thin as the tvs that we
basically also recommended like best to
see yeah they said it's actually just a
little bit thicker than an iphone oh
really yeah so then a nice super narrow
lce slides it from the dash and it shows
you the google earth and all the kind of
stuff that they have in the other cars
not a touchscreen doma guessing I'm
guessing that not know and thatthat's
you know plastic for European cars is
they use an indirect control method I'm
just like waiting on someone to start
jabbing that with a finger snap it off
yeah that would be probably Portuguese
far aways and kind of hard to reach the
but it's just so nice that out he's
actually going to bring this stuff into
a cheaper car right and it's kind of
basically it's interesting because I
think a lot of
of a small car people buy cars because
they're small now not necessarily but
will people buy small cars because
they're small not necessarily because
they're cheap so it's good to sort of
see the top-tier functionality in the
small car so you're not just kind of
like stuck going like a lot of one of a
big boat of a vehicle because I live in
a city but at the same time I don't want
to cheap out on my driving experience
right you can still get that that that
technology in this car now one of our
one of your the runners-up we sought it
for the best of CES was the pioneer
AppRadio a pretty 02 twice tell me about
that well it's so last year they came
out with the app radio just after CES so
it wasn't really even a contender and
last year's show but so basically it's
there I like to call it a dumb display
they don't like me to call it that but
basically what it is is it's a head unit
doesn't have anything in it but a screen
and a connection for a smartphone and
the first gen unit it was just the
iphone the second generation AppRadio to
ads android connectivity to the bag of
tricks it also gets a bigger screen full
seven inches so it's a lot more a little
bit more sort of display space there but
it's interesting to me how they're
connecting to the android phone i
initially assumed that when they added
the functionality to android they'd be
using bluetooth because that's pretty
much how everything works iphone connect
through their dock connector android
connects through bluetooth but what
pioneers done presumably because they
they need to stream live graphic through
this connection is that they've required
that you use a physical connection for
your display so they're basically
requiring this you either have a phone
that has micro HDMI or they believe it's
called a MLT connection hmm and so if
you don't have those connections you
won't be able actually the MHL mobile
high-definition link I don't know what
MLT is that in my head but if you don't
have those connections if you have a
phone that doesn't have a video output
you won't be able to use it with a prey
do so if you're still holding on to your
first gen
droid one you can kind of forget about
it right this raises the question of do
you buy a phone to go with your car or
stereo or vice versa you know this is
kind of a thing that I find myself
talking about all the time on Android
Atlas where it's just well all right now
you said you've got android support but
now you're only supporting a handful
phones you know it's this doesn't really
make anything easier I think for a ton
of Android users but it's interesting to
see that there at least doing something
here another thing that pioneers doing
that I thought was really cool is a
they've taken the whole sort of app
radio interface and divorced it from the
device so now they can add this to their
navigation and DVD receivers nope so if
you were holding out on an appt radio
because you just have a ton of DVDs that
you just want to list like watching your
call or CDs physical media you're stuck
on that their new generation of
navigation receivers and DVD audio video
receivers also have what's called an
advanced app mode so you plug your
iPhone up to those and it basically
becomes an appt radio when you need it
physical media got to get over that you
don't still have that big book of 250
CDs all right underneath their paths
intersect we need to be stolen sorting
through them going like oh one else in
today page five you now there's another
trend that made itself apparent at CES
and this is more in the aftermarket
stereo market is mini amps right and so
a little background on this those sort
of like premium audio systems that you
see in cars the fender system and the
Volkswagen any sort of Bose system or
rockford fosgate branded system in a
Mitsubishi or a Nissan Juke already uses
this technology and it's basically what
happens is om to have different
requirements for what they they want out
of an amp from a third party vendor then
you the person flipping through your
Crutchfield manual does and so they've
already started like building these like
small amps that don't take up a lot of
space that don't draw more power than
than they then the need to you know for
a moderate amount
but usually pretty good sound quality
but what it was started to happen is
that these sort of like small amp sneh
rocker fosgate showed me 300 watt
2-channel subwoofer amp that was about
the size of a paperback book a big
paperback book but a paperback book
that's great and they're starting to
make these available to consumers who
you know want to add a little bit of
extra sound to their car stereo without
basically you know making their trunk
look like the cars from The Fast and the
Furious some people still like the big
high power amp oh yeah the showpieces
with like lights on them yeah what are
the best hub but the advantage to these
smaller ramps is that they don't draw
ton of power they don't do things like
dim your headlights and and and and you
usually don't really require like a ton
of you know fuses and and and whatnot
they're usually kind of designed just
you want to add a little bit of extra
punch to the speakers that are already
in your doors you just want to upgrade
your speakers and your doors or maybe
you want to add a small eight inch sub
or something like that that's what you
would do with these but start to see a
lot more of that sort of in the
aftermarket yeah I'm excited about that
because I've got the small XIII and just
slipping one of those under one of the
seats or something right great I mean
there's not much room in that car for
anything so one thing that I think is
kind of cool is that alpine also has
like their tiny power amp it used to be
specific to alpine units you buy it you
plug it into the backyard i'll find head
unit nelson you have 45 watts rms
instead of 45 watts max rms is average
so what happens is when you buy an amp
and it's 300 watts it's really 150 watts
you get 300 watt and the peak so they've
made their sort of small power pack amp
universal now also you can basically buy
it for any car stereo wire it in line so
it's we're starting to see not even not
just the amp companies but also like
companies like Alpine who do a broader
sort of car stereo and car audio video
stuff getting involved so definitely the
wave of the future there I think this is
going to do four amps what digital
amplification did for subs in the 90s
cool cool one thing that was really cool
for me when I got off that when I
and ended Detroit director Loudon in Las
Vegas is actually in Detroit the first
part of that week Antoine was actually
at consumer electronics show the full
week I showed up a late Wednesday and
first thing getting in hotel look out
there's a fisker karma sitting out in
front of the hotel randomly randomly and
for chai knew the guy who was a the
fisker rep who was with it and arranged
for a drive so got my first drive in the
fisker karma around the the mean streets
of Las Vegas that was a very to drive so
the fisker karma uses it's a serious
hybrid system it's got electric motors
powering the rear wheels then it's got a
gasoline generator under the hood and
it's got batteries it'll give it about
50 miles range then when you for
anything above that you crank the engine
cranks up and provides electricity this
is very similar to the Chevy Volt
although as the fisker rep pointed out
or kind of hinted at there is no time
when the gas engine in the fisker karma
powers there were wheels unlike the
Chevy Volt right which there are certain
circumstances where it will so this was
a really interesting experience driving
this car around because for one thing
it's a really gaudy looking car that's a
very expressive car let's put it that
way at an epic stash hey and it's got
these huge fenders in this sports car
look it's actually sedan it's gone four
doors although only four seats too
because there's the the tunnel down the
center has this big lithium-ion battery
and it felt it's so interesting the
feeling of driving these cars cuz
pushing the accelerator it just popped
forward like really fast I mean you
found that surge behind you and that's
that electric torque which is you know
feels like a locomotive what makes
everyone loved the tesla roadster so
much oh yeah it's not really fast well
the tesla roadster is actually you know
it has a good acceleration like under
you know four seconds to 60 or
thereabouts-- and this one you know the
fisker karma is actually kind of slow in
comparison because it's six point three
seconds under optimum conditions right
260 they like on a slight decline that's
what the batteries are full and when you
have it in its sport mode
the other mode they call it stealth mode
now stealth mode is what I pertained I
do in my and that's when you have it in
self mode which actually saves energy
more more the battery's energy uses a
that's eight seconds to 60 which is very
slow by sports car standards it's not
bad by car standards yeah yeah I mean
there's certainly you'll probably beat a
honda fit we'd be the question is we've
eatable that's a good question this is
it worth the extremely large gap in
their prices yeah 3 getting smoked by
bolts that's that I but it is a really
cool-looking car and it didn't I
definitely like that electric to rest
the way it powers forward with that it
gets I think a maximum of 300 mile range
with this the cabin was really
interesting because so this is a luxury
car eighty ninety thousand dollars get
on the cabin and there's not a hint of
leather yeah I know yeah and this has
been cut what is there it's all this
it's this fabric and then the
representative fisher described it to me
it's some thick kind of luxury
industrial fabric that's supposed to be
nice and enlisting pretty nice like
cotton yeah he had so you need some
story about it and yeah i'm sure
probably made out of recycled PT bottle
probably the last beyond you know
nuclear winter but this is because this
car was and you can get a fisker karma
with leather but this one was the eco
chic trim oh so eco she definitely made
out of recycled bottles right means no
no leather and the wood is actually all
recovered would it's salvaged from like
the bottom of Lake Michigan or some
fires they had in southern california
and was pretty nice looking would
actually you know have that nice i mean
they have got a very nice luxury feel on
that cab and plugs into the smell like
Lake Michigan okay we're good plus an
LCD instrument cluster to which I don't
I mean I think the graphics look good
but there's still a problem with LCD
instrument panels that I've seen so far
where there's just this kind of flat
look to them and obviously they're flat
yeah but I don't know they're just they
got to do something about the glass that
tops them i think or the coding because
right now i think they just look a
little
cheap I kind of think the best the best
LCD instrument clusters are the ones
that kind of like also build in maybe
not necessarily mirror what we're kind
of used to with analog but maybe maybe
sit alongside analog stuff right I've
seen some really hyper the cool ones
where it's like you've got an analog
tech but then you've got like two LCD
and that that little bit of
dimensionality in the actual physical
tachometer makes the fake gauges a
little bit more believable kind of
mentally well the one in the
mercedes-benz the one that can turn into
your night vision view you know it's
usually a speedometer and you cannot
tell that that's not an analog
speedometer of course not in the not to
a jump out of that price class but the
lexus LFA has a really good digital
dashboard no but I think there are
actually some physical components that
none of none of the actual gauges or
instrumentation is yeah I assume those
will all improve i was also we had a
picture of it up a moment ago on our
feet here but we was also impressed by
the fisker karma drive selector which is
this little cluster of buttons you know
forget shifter shift knob anything like
that yeah there it is you know it's the
drive you know dnr p buttons and just
this little tiny cluster on the console
and you don't need anything more you
don't need a big shifter because it's
electric all right elegant conceivably
to only got one in one gear yeah yeah
one reduction gear yeah so it was fun
driving around Las Vegas in this car it
powered along really nicely gotten a
little impromptu you drag race with a
old stingray course correcting it I saw
a couple of drag race is happening on
the street but I saw it was funny
because it was almost like a scene from
The Fast and Furious it was a toyota
supra and a muscled out pontiac firebird
hmm and i'm in the cab from the back of
a what is it a ford transit and i just
see them take off and they're both like
squirreling around and just like looking
at these guys like you guys keep it real
in Vegas they don't see that around most
of these anymore but happens we just
like around like a bunch of flatland
just go out in the desert and take off
oh yeah
concept of speed different we got to do
a car special from Vegas I think that'd
be a good idea what a real cooling to
that and oh and the just one last bit
about the Karma we also got into a
little curvy bit of Road the you know we
had a root sort of that I was directed
to and one Kirby bit where the the
Pisgah rep said oh there's no cops on
the section we haven't seen so far I got
to drive that and this car handled very
nicely yeah it's partly the weight this
it's almost 6,000 pounds right so it's a
heavy car and that keeps it down it's
also got big wide tires I don't know
what the specs on them are but they're
they're wide and thick and and so they
add a lot of grip I kind of got the
impression though and it really it
turned really nicely steered really
nicely seemed to be nicely balanced for
the short stretch I mean haven't driven
it you know how to track or anything but
from this up from this short a little
bit my impression is that it'll hold
grip really well up to a point and once
it loses it I think it would lose it in
a big way oh because that weight you
know once you once you finally lose grip
and I think I'll hold it for a long time
but once you finally lose it I think
it's just gonna be like a 360 s and in
the dirt all sorts of stuff yeah you
don't want that alright so that is kind
of our CES consumer electronics show
wrap-up it was a fascinating show a lot
of car stuff it's just such a growing
area and so let's go take a look at what
is in this way wait before you get into
the car tikka rock yeah I just like to
say that I've been vindicated you hello
before the Detroit Auto Show we got like
a little preview of the acura nsx and we
were told that it was basically going to
use the TL super handling all-wheel
drive system and i was like oh hell no
that's not going to work so i wrote a
blog post basically basically begging
acura not to ruin the nsx and basically
telling them what you need to do to make
this supercar awesome if you're stuck
with your if you just if you're bound
and determined to make it a hybrid and
what I said was put the v6 hybrid engine
in the back on the back axle or it's
just where it's supposed to be it's
designed to be a transaxle and then put
those what is it like to
20 horsepower electric motors on the
front axle where they won't really do
any harm and it turns out that when the
acura nsx was unveiled in Detroit last
week while I was trying to keep an eye
on two shows at the same time because I
really wanted to be in Detroit it turns
out that's exactly what they did yeah I
was actually there and I got to talk to
one of the acura reps and he told me
they were really unclear in their press
materials about how this powertrain was
laid out but I finally got them to tell
me and it's yeah it's like you said they
put these of a 3.5 liter direct
injection v6 mounted transversely behind
the passenger cap compartment they have
an electric motor I think it's a 30
kilowatt mode electric motor integrated
with the transmission right for the rear
wheels that whole thing powers the rear
wheels it brings you to like 340 300 300
60 horsepower on the back axle yeah we
should note pretty good for this small
this is a two seater it's very much like
the original NX in its layout and then
yeah to I think of 20 kilowatt mutters
I'm not sure the horsepower that gets 20
kill I think they only add up to like I
think 20 total on the front axle as far
as horsepower goes it's just kind of
this is just the attitude right they
give you torque steer our uh yeah torque
vectoring dearie yeah yeah yeah the kind
of torque certain yeah controlled torque
steer not like mazdaspeed3 torque yeah
so I think with this lightweight car in
that that configuration sounds like a
little handle really well right the
accurate person I was talking to a crap
i was talking to said it just like the
system in the mdx just reversed right
you know which you know they described
that new i think they call esha w or
something that is there's a term they
use they just call them all SH aw but
they don't actually they don't all do
the same thing yeah you dig through i
think i think actually i may have broken
down the differences of them in an
all-wheel-drive article that i Rove you
can definitely look at the wikipedia
article on sh-awd and it'll the torque
splits different depending on what car
you're getting and how it does that but
this car come up to the your the way
look did that come up to your
expectation alright with it yeah I'm
okay nothing studying here yep I mean
I'm told that they're actually going to
make it they
our and so they they confirm that and
I'm told her I'll get they're gonna
build it in the United States hmm is
that I the other rumors that I heard is
that they're gonna build it here
interesting huh so yeah I'm all for that
I can't wait for show her eyes well I
think it was kind of the star of the
show it was it was really the concept e
star of the Detroit show it which was a
show they had a lot of really good solid
production cars new models that are
going to come out but this was the most
interesting concept even though they
said they'll produce it as well all
right yes that may be why it got its
little well moment in the Sun there or
got its you know production approved by
acura so anyway let's say let's take a
look at what's in the scenic ride by the
way no OTR this week yeah we don't have
one for you but we should in the car
right we should have one next week
anyway this is what is in the cnet
garage now next up we currently have the
Chrysler 300 srt8 and the ford edge
EcoBoost in the garage downstairs we're
reviewing those right now those reviews
should go up early next week expect to
see those and then coming up we have the
volkswagen jetta GLI autobahn edition
which I don't even know what that means
but it sounds it very cool plus the new
nissan versa i'm looking forward to
getting in this new affordable compact
car alright that's it for car tech live
I'm Wayne Cunningham in the studio with
antuan goodwin here Steven Beecham at
the controls you can follow us on
twitter you can actually can read our
site you can look at all they are show
notes here at car tech cnet com and look
at these links we've been talking about
and you'll also follow us on twitter i
am Wayne see underscore SF on Twitter
and Antoine is aunt do a NT g 00 on
twitter and brian coolio should be back
