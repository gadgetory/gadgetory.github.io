take this apart this looks kind of
sexual got a good girth I feel like I
can hold on to it pretty well it feels
good it just reminds me of something
different it definitely feels like I'm
holding balls yeah that's actually quite
comfortable reminds me of a but it's
very suggestive reminds me of a but not
the first thing that popped into my head
but nearly you've obviously put that
notion in there I guess that does look
like a but is it called the bug case
that's the first thing I thought of when
I looked at this could be a mouth or a
but I think it's more like boob or balls
I was thinking two things I was there
but or camel's back and I think but it's
pretty dead-on
Oh is my finger supposed to go in here
ah I feel like I'm holding a rather
squishy tush but the mass pads like the
end of a mousepad no it doesn't feel
like a butt because nobody's butt is
this small I feels like two boobs I
would not put this in my pocket
it looks really strange but I think it
would get a lot of people's attention my
first choice if I saw a butt case I
heard but case I don't know if that
would be like something that I'd
naturally be drawn towards I would feel
really awkward although I guess you
can't see it when you're holding it why
did they make this it's so bizarre I
think people would like a butt case
there's got to be a market for it I
don't feel too bad doing this not at all
the butt to the butt case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
