Sumi das joining me ishara Tipton's
senior writer for cnet sharra thanks for
being with us I'm happy to be here ok so
this afternoon you were on a call with
tim cook and a few other people right
yeah the apple reported earnings and you
listened in tell us what the state of
Apple is what their financial state is
yeah yeah this is kind of an off quarter
for Apple you know their newest products
came out late last year so it's kind of
getting to the end of the cycle for
those everyone's looking for the next
devices to come out this fall but you
know they're reporting iphone sales are
still pretty good you know iPad is kind
of soft which worries people but in
general you know a pretty good quarter
so typically or a common occurrence in
the past is that you know the numbers
have really blown people out of the
water so you're saying that didn't
happen this timer yeah I mean once Tim
Cook took over they kind of changed
change that strategy you know Steve Jobs
used to give forecasts that they would
just like completely obliterate so now
they try to kind of be a little more
accurate so you can really judge a
little better but also there's just a
lot of factors going on you know that
are that are impacting these results and
everybody's looking to next quarter
because we're expecting some major
announcements right yeah yeah you know
towards the end of next quarter which
will end in September we're expecting
you know one if not two new iPhones you
know later on you know new iPads other
new devices people are hoping for an
iWatch you know when that happens is
unclear right but you know everybody is
definitely looking for later this year
you mentioned the iWatch we know that a
patent was filed recently by Apple was
there any information that we could
glean from that filing yeah I mean it's
interesting to see what Apple's doing I
think in this one they're looking at
doing things like putting the putting a
lot more intelligence in the band itself
as opposed to in the display so you
could like take the display off and the
band will still work you know whether
they do any of this is something we
won't know until they actually announce
the product right no companies filed for
patents all the time that they end up
not actually usually not using yeah so
you know we're gonna have to wait and
see what we actually get but you know
it's interesting to see what they're
trying and everybody
eagerly awaiting all of that aren't they
yeah and tell us a little bit about the
call itself I mean most of us haven't
listened in on one of these calls before
how do they flow Tim Cook gets on the
call he answers questions at some point
right yeah I mean they're pretty
standard with what other companies do so
it kind of starts out with tim cook on
the call he gives a sort of introduction
like this is what's happening at Apple
everything's great we're an amazing
company blah blah blah um you know the
CFO gets on and walks through kind of
nitty gritty financials which can get
dry sometimes lots of numbers yeah and
then they open it up to analyst who can
call in and ask questions any notable
questions from the analysts you know
people were interested in the
partnership with IBM you know kind of
what that means you know what's
happening an ipod ipad sorry because
it's been it's been weak for two
quarters now so people are trying to
understand what's actually happening you
know people always ask about new
products and you know what the guidance
means for things coming out later this
year but we never get details about that
kind of stuff just told to hold on and
wait alright sharra thanks for filling
us in on the earnings call it took place
today for inside scoop I'm sumida</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
