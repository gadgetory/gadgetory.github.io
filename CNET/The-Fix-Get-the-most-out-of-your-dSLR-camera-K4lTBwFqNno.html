fix a show about DIY tech and how to i'm
eric franklin I'm Donald Bell and this
week we have some tips and tricks for
all you budding photographers out there
yeah we're good focus on DSLRs we're
gonna start off with some tips on
choosing the right lens fear camera if
you're in DSLR owner the lens that came
with your camera is great for getting
started but eventually you will grow out
of it so if you're ready to purchase a
new lens I have a few recommendations on
exactly how to go about it hands down my
favorite lens is the 50 millimeter 1.8
fixed lens it's great for portraits food
photos and still life it is a prime lens
or fixed lens so it doesn't zoom which
means you'll have to get really close to
your subject in order to frame up but
the trade-off is huge it's a fast lens
with a wide aperture which means super
sharp photos even in low light the best
part is that it's only one hundred
dollars and that's not as cheap as it
gets when you're shopping for a portrait
lens what you want is a lens that won't
distort your subject you want the person
to look like they do to the human eye
you also want that really cool blurry
background effect on a full sized sensor
camera like the canon 5d get a lens with
a focal length of 80 millimeters to 100
millimeters on a crop sensor camera like
this one that translates to about 50
millimeters
if you want to go any shorter than 50
millimeters your subject will start to
look a little too stretched out so stick
with this range for food photography you
don't necessarily need a zoom lens
instead go in the prime lens like the 35
millimeter 1.4 at this focal length the
shots will be just wide enough to get a
crisp photo of an entire plate of food
without distorting it since it's fixed
you will have to move around to get
closer or wider but really that's a part
of the intimacy of food photography when
you're traveling there's a good chance
you'll want to lens it will take great
landscape photos letting you capture
wide sweeping shots of whatever exotic
place you're in if you have to choose
one lens to take with you on a trip the
18 to 35 millimeter 1.8 is the way to go
and it's widest you'll get great
sweeping views of landscape and it's
still great for close-ups of food and
portraits of people all around this is a
great go-to ones
I could seriously geek out on lenses all
day long you are seriously geeking out
right now I know I have to save myself
from the dough I pretty much just shoot
with a 50 millimeter prime for all my
stuff no it sounds like a good waves all
right when we come back we're gonna show
you how to photograph your favorite
four-legged friends during that split
second where they're actually standing
still
welcome back everybody loves cute photos
of cute pets are you sure about this
yeah you sure it's not everyone loves
cute photos a few kids check the
internet nice all right hi but it's not
always that easy to take photos of pets
right no I'm gonna stay here for me I'm
gonna stick around what do you think no
maybe these guys yeah so we've got some
insider tips that I help you do just
that we love our pets like there are
little furry children but I'm like a
real kid pencil emblem want to sit down
and stay put for a while we take their
picture so how do you get a great pet
photo with the DSLR I'm going to show
you some universal tix first off make
sure you dial in all your camera
settings before you take the shot you're
gonna need to act quick to get some good
photos and dogs and cats not gonna want
to sit still for you while you're
feeling around your ISO much less have
time to focus on your shot and this is
the frustration two pet photography
right here this is why it takes a lot of
patience and time how about you sit down
that's cold dirt there you go so here
are some tips for settings you're going
to want to make ahead of time for
example let's say I want to take a nice
close-up portrait of their face I want
the ice being really sharp focus and I
like the background to be nice and soft
to do that I'm going to put my camera
into aperture priority mode
and now I'm gonna open the aperture all
the way up in this case is an f-stop of
a 1.8 I also recommend turning off your
Flash because not only is it going to
possibly spoof your pets but it's also
gonna give them red eye another setting
I recommend changing is your auto focus
setting you should keep auto focus on
for the sake of speed but instead of it
being an intelligent focus or
multi-point focus that might zero in on
their snout you want to have a single
point focus so you can really point out
their eyes and get that tight focus on
the eyes it's key I'm looking at those
eyes really trying to use the auto focus
to get in on the eyes finally I
recommend putting your camera into a
burst mode or a continuous shooting mode
instead of a single shot a great pet
photo is like a needle in a haystack of
a hundred photos you're gonna take so
just go for quantity take a bunch of
shots
well that's a good one the tongue is
hanging out there sloppy tongue i think
i got some great ones here yes yes it's
a tasty ear I shouldn't put that peanut
butter behind my ear this morning all
right the rest really just comes down to
patients and experimentation you try a
few different environments they're
looking sad you can take them out on a
walk or try to engage them in something
they like to do hopefully with any luck
by the end of the day you have a few
different shots worth Frank
dude that was so adorable you're having
the time of your life out there it was a
really hot day but the dogs were being
super cute big thanks to our friends at
wags on polk for letting us photograph
their dogs for something totally
different we're going to show you how to
use a tablet or a smartphone to remotely
control your DSLR yeah you don't even
need to be behind the camera to trigger
it it's also if you have a DSLR camera
you know it can take some pretty amazing
photos but if you're looking for even
more options with the ability to take
remote snapshots we've got a cool device
we think you should check out it's
called trigger trap it's compatible with
both Canon and Nikon cameras it costs
twenty-five dollars for this dango you
connect one end to your iOS or Android
device and the other to your DSLR camera
then you download the free trick or trap
app trigger trap lets you control many
of the functions of your camera on your
mobile device in a simplified unique and
fun way first need to make sure that
your camera settings are appropriate for
the shot you're trying to accomplish
let's say you want to take some cool
action shots you can use a time-lapse
feature to accomplish that it's not
something your camera can't do on its
own but it's a lot easier here open
time-lapse select the amount of time
between each shot click OK and press the
big red button and it starts
photos will be taken until you stop it
one of my favorite features is sound
sensor which uses your mobile device's
microphone to initiate a shot from your
camera basically you turn it on and if
there's a loud enough sound like this
clap you get the shot immediately this
is an excellent way to get yourself in
pictures but I'll have to worry about a
timer you can even customize it to delay
the shot by a few seconds to make sure
you strike the perfect pose these are
just a few of the options available on
trigger trap there plenty more have fun
exploring it it's a really great way to
utilize the power of your smartphone to
get more interesting shots with your
camera that's it for this week's show
