it how to contributor and today I want
to take a look at how to send a gift
card using square wallet this was
recently rolled out by square and an
enabled square merchants to accept gift
cards which is huge for both the small
businesses as well as the consumers who
frequent those small businesses now in
order to send a square gift card you're
gonna have to download it install an app
called square wallet this is available
for either Android or iOS devices and it
allows you to pay using just your name @
square merchants and it also allows you
to send a gift card to a family member
or a loved one this holiday season so
once you get square wallet downloaded
and installed on your device set up your
account enter your payment information
and then find the local merchants that
you want to send a square gift cards for
so what I did is I recently added a
local bookshop to my square wallet so
I'm gonna pull them up and normally if I
was there I could just pay with my name
swipe to pay if I was within the GPS
coordinates of the address but in this
instance I want to send a gift card and
you'll see for this merchant there's the
option to send gift card tapping on that
will reveal predetermined gift card
amounts if you tap on other you can
enter your own amount ten dollars is the
minimum I'll enter the email address a
message and then what's really cool is
you could actually select the day it's
delivered on so if you want to deliver
Christmas Eve Christmas Day or on a
specific birthday or or whatever it may
be you can select that at this point as
well and then once you've selected and
entered all of the information you can
then send the gift card to the
recipients email address now that
recipient doesn't have to have a
smartphone in order to use this they can
print out the gift card it comes
complete with a QR code that the
merchant then uses the iPad or the end
right out to skin and if they do have a
square wallet account they can add it to
their wallet and use it the next time
they're within that business is GPS
coordinates once again this was Jason
Cipriani a sina out to contributor and
that was how to send a square gift card</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
