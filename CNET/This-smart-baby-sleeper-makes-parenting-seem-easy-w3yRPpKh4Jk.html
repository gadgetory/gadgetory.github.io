baby tech the last word I would have
used to describe most of it was
essential app connected chairs or
monitors seemed to me as a new parent
like helpful luxuries then I got my
hands on the fisher-price smart connect
sleeper and I'm having a hard time
imagining going back to life without it
sleepers like this can basically be used
as beds for the first year or so of your
baby's life they're comfortable keep
kids on their backs to avoid SIDS and
include these rockers on the bottom to
let parents suit their children just
from a design standpoint fisher-price is
sleeper is one of the best on the market
and for a hundred bucks it's really
competitive with other co sleepers and
bassinets and that's before you even
factor in all of its smarts here's the
cool part the sleeper includes this
control panel so you can play your baby
music and ambient sounds set the bed to
vibrate in different patterns and
intensities and set the sleeper to rock
at different speeds plus you can control
all of that through the app and set a
timer to stop the movement and music
after your kids fallen asleep I can
think of a few features that I'd like to
see on a product like this such as being
able to play my own music on the
speakers via bluetooth but really
because of the modest price point of the
sleeper those are pretty minor concerns
bottom line the question is how well
does this thing occupy your baby and
keep him or her comfortably asleep in my
case my son has been using the sleeper
at least six hours per day for the last
week and he's been loving it after my
experience with this device not to
mention its solid design and features
I'm excited to tell all of my friends
regardless of whether they're interested
in smart tech or not that this is a must
buy and that's why I've awarded the
fisher-price smart connect sleeper an
editor's choice award
