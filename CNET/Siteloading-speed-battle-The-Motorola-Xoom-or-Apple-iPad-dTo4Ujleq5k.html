the first real competitor to the ipad
we're going to see their labs as you can
see so we're going to check out how each
tablet handles website loading speed via
Wi-Fi they're going to check out how
each tablet handles 3d graphics and
games that's political 3d not glasses 3d
let's get started first up we're going
to cnet.com and we're gonna see how long
each tablet takes to get there and
they're off and the zoom is off to an
early lead it's alright the zoom is done
and we're still waiting for the ipad the
ipad is struggling ok pictures are
coming in the zoom has been done for a
few seconds now and the ipad stud ok
that's seen it done now we're going to
cbsnews.com and i'm going to see how
this race turns out and they're off all
right zoom is off to an early lead it
has most of the page loaded it's still
going we're following the blue line at
the top of the zoom screen a little bee
address bar when that goes away then
we'll know that the page has been
completely loaded same thing with the
ipad it has this new bar as well that
we're following and both are still
hanging looks like i have also page
loaded but they're both just hanging on
that blue ball ok be zoom is done and
the ipad is now done now we're going to
go one of my favorite websites
giantbomb.com we like to fit website a
lot cuz it's very simple doesn't have
any dynamic element and here we go all
right and they're off alright the zoom
is off to an early lead once again it is
done and we're still waiting for the
ipad and the ipad is done now ok
giantbomb.com made it very fast mazoun
as you can see and now for 3d graphics
the ipad has a lot more aliasing then
the zoom the zoom is much smoother this
is a function basically of the zoom
having a higher resolution than the ipad
zoom however is more washed out while
the ipad has deeper richer colors
and there you have it overall the zoom
had better website loading speed over
Wi-Fi compared to the ipad and thanks to
its higher resolution 3d games have the
potential to look better as well stay
tuned for Cena for even more tests
coming down the pike</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
