Android device on to good old-fashioned
paper Google makes it really easy using
a service called Google Cloud Print it
works with almost any Android device and
any printer the setup is really easy and
you only have to do it once to start
printing from all of your Google devices
first head to your computer and launch
Chrome you'll need the browser to make
this work
open the menu and first check to see
that you're signed in with your Google
account
it should be the same one you associate
with your Android device once you're
signed in go to settings and scroll down
to expand the Advanced Settings here
under Google Cloud Print click manage
here's where you'll associate your
printer with your Google account when
it's set up it means that you could send
Doc's to your printer from any Google
device including other computers running
Chrome so click add printers and check
the boxes for the printers you want to
use in this case it's my Epson click add
printers here at the bottom and you're
set at least on the computer now head to
your Android and download Google's cloud
print app which is actually more of a
plug-in that enables you to print from
applications like Chrome and the gallery
once that's installed you're ready to
print so I'll go to Chrome and pull up a
web page that I want to print out tap
the menu button hit print and there's my
Epson in this window you actually have a
few options for things like paper size
color and orientation all that's left to
do is hit print and there it goes
just keep in mind that your computer
does have to be turned on for this to be
able to work if we're whatever reason
it's not the documents will print once
your computer powers up again or if you
have a cloud print ready printer you can
print to it even if your computer is
switched off just go to Google support
page for instructions on setting up your
specific printer with your printer set
up with Google Cloud Print you can print
to it from any Android device and any
computer running Chrome even if you're
halfway across the world if you have any
questions or tips of your own hit me up
on Twitter and check out cnet.com / hi -
