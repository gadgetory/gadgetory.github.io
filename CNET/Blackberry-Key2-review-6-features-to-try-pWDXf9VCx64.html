sim card in I've been using it as my
primary phone for a couple weeks and
I've got a lot to say about it so fire
away my favorite thing by far would be
the shortcuts from the keyboard you can
short press or long press any key to
give you up to 52 shortcuts so I just
press n and my Notes app pops up I press
C and Chrome pops up it's really
convenient I think it's actually more
convenient than shortcuts on pretty much
any other phone pretty much everything
else just kidding there are some kinks
that the company has to work out because
there are some apps that still call up
the virtual keyboard even though you
have the physical keyboard right below
so it shrinks the size of your app and
what you can see on the screen - like
the top quarter or top third and that
kind of defeats the purpose of having a
physical keyboard also from all that
typing my thumbs are pretty sword
the key to completely updates the key
one in really great ways it's got a
classier design and Scott Strait signs
and the keys have moved from the left
side and now all three are on the right
what is brand-new are the dual cameras
on the back this is a first for any
blackberry phone and the keyboard gets a
new button as well that's the speed key
and so this is something that will help
you open up your keyboard shortcuts like
when you need to long press to launch an
app you're going to press that first and
all the internals are upgraded as well
so I do think that the company deserves
kudos for bringing it into the modern
age I think that the key to is keyboard
is definitely an improvement over the
key one the keys are bigger 20% taller
and they're also more separated but I
still find the keyboard pretty cramped
and a lot of that just has to do with
the shape of the phone nobody wants a
wide phone that will give you a really
spacious keyboard so this is kind of
what you're stuck with also I really
hated having to use the alt and the
shift keys to get to capitalization
numbers and punctuation it didn't make a
lot of sense for me to kind of go all
the way over to one side of the phone
every time I wanted to do that it was a
real pain the fingerprint reader inside
the spacebar I really like the placement
of it but it wasn't always accurate for
me so I found myself having to try
multiple times often enough to unlock
the phone other times it worked just
fine and then there's this capacitive
home button on top of the keyboard and
probably at least half the time that I
try to go home I wind up touching the
screen right above it opening up some
like old text message or some app I
don't want to be in yeah I was pretty
happy with photo quality actually you've
got the dual 12 megapixel cameras on the
back 8 megapixel camera on the front of
photos when you had plenty of light
we're actually very good very colourful
crisp and detailed it's when you've got
into low-light scenarios that the camera
really struggled portrait mode photos
were pretty usable as well you're not
going to see all of the effects and
controls that you might on other phones
you're not gonna have extra lighting
options or control the blur effect but
again I was pretty happy with them
selfies were alright there's no Beauty
mode some people really like that I
could really take it or leave it myself
I would use a selfie but definitely not
the quality that you're gonna see on
some of the top tier phones
yeah you know this isn't a cheap device
and it's not for people who are focused
on gaming or multimedia this is for
people who want to type a lot and type
accurately these are for people who are
interested in productivity I think that
it's a really great upgrade for people
who have been using an older BlackBerry
device but if you're switching from an
all screen phone it's going to be
frustrating and unfamiliar especially at
first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
