and wireless earbuds are now a thing so
we're throwing two bad boys into the
ring it's a prize five punch-out between
apples $169 air punch and Bragg YZ 149
the headphones like they're actually
called the headphones so let's get it on
round one is design Apple's design is
hit or miss depending on your taste now
I won't bash on them any more than I
have they aren't that bad but let's just
say they won't win any best design
awards anytime soon
now the biggest miss the air pods are
only one side they either fit or they
don't that instantly eliminates people
with a pre-existing genetic condition
called
large ear holes now the braggy
headphones just look better they bring a
more natural and subtle design and
surprise they look like wireless earbuds
they also come with three different
sizing tips so you'll have options to
get that perfect fit this one's a
no-brainer
Bragi takes round one next round is
bluetooth sync
the braggy headphones synced pretty
easily hold down a button go into your
settings and you're paired turn them on
and they'll sink and I had no problems
at all it's really what you expect from
Bluetooth devices but this is where
Apple shines with syncing that is second
to none with their w1 chip technology no
settings needed just open up the case
and you can pair them then whenever you
open the case in the future it instantly
pairs without you having to press a
single button I'm not gonna lie I'll
back up Apple when they say it's like
magic and we've never seen better
Bluetooth syncing from anyone ever Apple
takes round 2 next up is features
Apple's air pods give it and take it
away with the most stripped-down
headphones you'll find it's syncing is
the best that's no doubt but when you
take out the headphones the music stops
pop it back in and music plays now air
pod controls are severely limited you
have the option to either tap one of
your air pods to prompt Siri or pause
and play music in the settings but it's
one or the other you can't have both
functions at the same time everything
else you do will have to be done on your
phone from adjusting the volume to
changing tracks you'll get used to this
because you have to but it's just not
convenient to have to go to your phone
all the time now the braggy headphones
bring everything you can think of on
their earbuds thanks to physical buttons
on the right ear but you can change the
volume from the earbuds you can change
tracks back and forth your music will
pause and play when you take them in and
out of your ears it can prompt a voice
assistant for multiple phones and it
even has an ambient sound feature called
audio transparency that lets you listen
to the outside world while still hearing
the music in your headphones now it's an
interesting add-on but at the same time
you can also just turn the volume down
I get what they're doing but I just
didn't really use it that much now the
one drawback about all this
functionality is that you have to put so
much pressure on your ear when you're
pushing all the buttons or holding them
down for three seconds I'll tell you
right now it's really uncomfortable and
at times can hurt any wireless earbuds
just need to have touch surface controls
if I even want to consider them but
raggies premium - earbuds do if you're
willing to take the next leap up and
spend 249 dollars ok on to the cases the
air pods case also acts as a
charging case the air pods get roughly
five hours on their own but the charging
case gives you a full 24 hours of juice
Braga's headphones give you about six
hours of life but the case yeah it has
to be plugged into USB to charge them if
you run out there is no backup power at
all when you're on the go both sides
have their pluses and minuses but braggy
takes round three with significantly
more functionality built into the
earbuds even if it hurts the final round
that decides it all is claw
what matters when it comes to comparing
headphones of this sound and I'm here to
tell you that the air pods absolutely
blow the brag ease out of the water with
superior sound quality across the board
the air pods don't sound significantly
better than the wired Apple earbuds but
compared to the Bragg ease it's not even
close
now the braggy sounded more hollow with
higher troubles and for earbuds the
sound quality was average at best air
pause just have a much fuller sound when
I made several calls with different
people they used many words to describe
the braggy sound quality but none of
them were good can you hear me okay how
does it sound
so-so okay it didn't sound nearly as
clear and it was instantly noticeable
for people on the other line now the air
pods were just as good as someone
holding up a phone right up to their
mouth and everyone said they sounded
great
the proof is in the pudding and the air
pause just sound better all around
taking round 4 so let's break this down
the air pods and Bragi both took two
rounds each but when you look at all the
aspects of these ear buds the sound
quality and bluetooth sync you just
can't be ignored and I'm calling it
right now the air pods are your prize
fight winner
I'm Brian song thanks for watching I
will catch you guys next time for
another prize fight
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
