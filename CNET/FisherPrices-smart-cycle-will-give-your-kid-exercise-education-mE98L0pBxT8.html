LearnSmart cycle it's a $150 stationery
big wheel basically for your toddler the
age range is about three to six now this
isn't just an exercise bike for kids
even though parents might kind of hope
that it does tire them out some but it
is something that actually connects
using bluetooth to TVs and tablets to
help kids play some games that let them
learn these games have a couple
different subjects you can do games that
actually help them with spelling games
that help with stem with science with
math all sorts of different things and
the roster of subjects is only going to
grow according to fisher-price
for 150 bucks this is actually a pretty
cool product my kind of Wisla this adult
sized one was actually for sale not just
for demonstration the one thing I would
be a little bit concerned about with
this device is just how effective it
actually is and helping kids learn but
that one thing aside it really does seem
like a fun device and I can't wait to
test it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
