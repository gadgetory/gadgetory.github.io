readers were checking out over the past
month we're in an odd time of the year
companies did their best to get their
products out for the holiday season
then CES just happened so there are all
kinds of new gadgets to look forward to
so what were you looking at in January
let's find out at number five is the
Samsung Galaxy Note 9 the rumors about
the next galaxy s are piling up it only
makes sense that people are checking out
Samsung's last big phone the Galaxy Note
9 in our review we called the note 9
samsung's best everything phone it has a
Bluetooth Pen that acts as a remote a
huge battery and a minimum of 128
gigabytes of space here's the downside
to the note 9 if you had a Note 8 there
was very little reason to upgrade number
four is the Huawei honor View 20 now
this is a pretty big deal since the
honor of you xx has been around for a
relatively short time the view 20 has an
intriguing design the back features a
unique pattern that shimmers as you move
the phone on the front we're looking at
a whole lot of spring the view xx has a
six point four inch display with a hole
punched for a twenty five megapixel
front-facing camera oh I forgot to
mention that this Android phone costs
around 570 euro giving it mid-range
pricing getting your hands on it might
be difficult in certain locations around
the world due to political issues coming
in at number three is the 2019 Toyota
rav4 hybrid this is the only non phone
in the top five
Toyota redesigned the rav4 for a much
boxier look to match other Toyota trucks
I think it looks a lot better than the
2018 model inside the 2019 rav4 you'll
find an 8 inch touchscreen to handle
infotainment the system also has hard
buttons on the sides of the display to
navigate easier in a vehicle since this
is a hybrid model this rav4 offers about
41 miles per gallon in the city and 37
miles per gallon on the highway number
two is the iPhone 10 R it's a really
safe time to pick up an iPhone since
we're not expecting a new one until
Timber the 10r is the value iphone with
a starting price of around 750 dollars
there are some compromises when compared
to the 10 s or s max but the 10r carries
some of the best iPhone features with it
you get a great camera base ID wireless
charging plus a screen size that fits
right between the s and the max the
downsides
there's no optical zoom on the back so
zooming in digitally might yield gritty
results the screen is LCD instead of
OLED so you're not going to get true
black on the earth looks like you guys
are seriously considering the 10r though
and coming in at number 1 is the
Motorola MOTO G 7 I was confused too but
this is not a mistake the Moto G 7 got a
lot of attention in the past month
before the newest G sevens were
announced CNET espanol found all the
info on the g7 the g7 plus the g7 power
and the g7 play on motorola zone
brazilian sights the Moto G series packs
in great specs for the price the g6 cost
a whopping 250 dollars taking a look at
the leaked g7 images you can see a
modern design
you've got slim bezels on the sides with
a notch on the top on the back you even
get dual cameras and they've run the
latest version of Android Android Pi
let's give you a little bonus the sixth
most popular thing this month was the
Amazon echo wall clock that's right a
wall clock that syncs up with echo
devices that shows visuals for timers
yeah but there's a snag
Amazon stopped selling the echo wall
clock because of connectivity issues
maybe that got people interested Amazon
is working on a fix by the way that does
it for us
