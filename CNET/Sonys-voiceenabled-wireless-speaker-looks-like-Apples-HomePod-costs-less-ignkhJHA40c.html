coming home pod speaker you're not this
is actually Sony's new voice controlled
smart speaker the LFS 50 G which costs
two hundred dollars and has Google
assistant built-in not Siri like the
home pod this comes in black and white
works on your Wi-Fi network and has to
be plugged into a power outlet to be
used there's no battery option it also
has bluetooth so you can pair an audio
device directly to it if you want you
simply say okay Google to access the
voice assistant and give it commands to
start playing music turn up the volume
or skip to the next track like Amazon's
Alexa enabled speakers you can link your
Spotify account to it you can also
control smart devices such as lights and
thermostats while the speaker is small
in stature is designed to fill a small
to medium-sized room with sound I
thought it played loud for its size and
delivered a decent amount of bass it
definitely sounds better and delivers
richer sound than the Google home
speaker similar to the home bot it has a
360 degree vertical two-way facing
speaker system with a dedicated
subwoofer that's designed to spread
sound in all directions can also use
gesture controls to begin playing music
skip tracks or adjust the volume malee
the speaker is splash proof and its
grille is removable and washable the LFS
50 G with Google assistant is set to be
released in October and we'll have a
full review when it hits stores</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
