I'm checking out something I'm positive
you've never ever seen before because
I'm debuting it to the world right now
allow me to introduce the a/v a direct
Avalanche say hello it's a super
high-end PC gaming machine that is
completely top-to-bottom water-cooled
and as you can see it's kind of a work
of art water cooling instead of air or
fan cooling is growing in popularity
because when you do that you let chips
run a faster and cooler which is very
important for a long-lasting computer
when you introduce water cooling to the
GPUs and that's the graphic cards
graphics cards inside the machine you
can get a system that runs very quietly
and most importantly very cool so the
way this works water coolant is stored
in a reservoir tank that's mounted on
the top front of the machine where water
is pumped through the system and it
touches the CPU the graphics cards and
then back around again the loop keeps
water moving and allows heat to
dissipate quickly and efficiently the
end result is not only what's clearly a
gorgeous looking machine but one that
allows for impressive overclocking not
just with the processor but with the
dual graphics cards as well it gives us
high benchmarking scores that are
beating every other system with
comparable components that we have in
our labs it's pretty impressive so let's
say you don't like the white design well
how do you fix that you can use this
included remote control that actually
changes the color of the LED RGB lights
that are included with the machine
now the Avalanche maxed out nearly every
single game I threw at it in 1440p and
it even handled 4k games with ease okay
so what are we talking about in terms of
price right this thing can't be cheap
well it's not the configuration we have
here now that's the 4790k the - 980 s
it's got 16 gigs of ram a terabyte SSD
the three terabytes of storage drives
the custom tubing the overclocking the
water calling all of that will run you
59
dollars yes you are paying a premium for
the custom loop installation but you are
getting some of the best components
around that are available on the market
now I've got a much deeper dive on the
Avalanche in the review below so be sure
to read that and if you have any
specific questions be it about the
Avalanche or water cooling in general be
sure to follow me on twitter and reach
out there this has been a look at the
brand new avalanche from av a direct if
you want to check one of these out in
price one yourself head over to AV a
direct comm I'm Jeff Bakalar for
