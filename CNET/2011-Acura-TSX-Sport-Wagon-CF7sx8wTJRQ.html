Honda Accord wagon so when the acura tsx
wagon hit our garage I was delighted
which may be the problem
this isn't supposed to be a Honda let's
drive the 2011 Acura TSX wagon with all
the toys and check the tech let's defect
a TSX wagon from here at the schnozz all
the way to the b-pillar is just a TSX no
difference then from here to the back is
where it becomes a TSX Wagon this is all
the different sheet metal to the rear
you taper two ways back here you can see
you've got a pretty racy little fastback
on the hatch and the body tapers this
way and rounds off as a result the cargo
space inside is it's more of an urban
city wagon than a true capacity station
wagon I imagine the advertising will
show somebody in this on Fifth Avenue
loading up there she's new at the
groomer not someone going to Ikea and
buying for bookcases and part of the
problem is you've got big intrusion at
the wheel wells here in the cargo bay
now our TSX is very familiar inside if
you're used to the most recent Honda's
and that's good news because that is the
new interface the new head unit not
dramatically rethought but a whole lot
more finished as you can see right away
if I go to the map that's actually
decent resolution I can read everything
it's not hard on my eyes it's a nice
looking screen the obvious choice is
entering a dress and you've got the same
four buckets you've had before but again
everything moves faster looks better
under destination menu - you've also got
some interesting stuff you can do this
is a god thing which only Honda Acura
offers you can also look up a place by
phone number to decide to drive there
now I've got a CD in here now this will
also play DVD audio but not DVD video
good looking richly displayed you see
the record icon there this has got a
hard drive in it here my hard drive
specs you can see I've got 15 gigabytes
total space available on this dude your
sound options are pretty good your usual
balance treble fader and such then you
get your center channel not a lot of
cars give you center channel level
subwoofer you've got your speed volume
control Dolby PL 2 can be on or off too
synthetically create surround sound and
it tends to do a pretty good job live
traffic and live weather in this guy
through Acura link traffic shown on the
map but you can also get it in a list
here and again notice how readable all
this stuff is there's my forecast from
the current position on that screen also
is where you get your backup camera
fairly basic by today's standards notice
there's no trajectory
I've got no different views for whether
I'm parking or whatever I'm doing I just
have my basic distance markers even
those are all in yellow not the usual
yellow red green that some other cars do
and if you want rear backup sensors also
those are optional ala carte about the
only ala carte Tech option on this guy
and their dealer installed on top of
that and that by the way is the extent
of your driver assistance tech in this
guy no blind spot warning or
intervention technology no lane
departure warning or
intervention is available no
forward-collision stuff I mean this is
you know pretty lowdown on the Acura
range there replaces the old Integra
sort of kind of so they don't offer all
the bells and whistles on this guy
one thing that they still do on this car
that's a carryover is lots and lots of
buttons here here and then I've got this
information screen deal here where I can
change the monochrome LCD two different
displays there you've got two connectors
in here USB and analog aux and this USB
can be a USB thumb drive or in my case
I've got our iPod Touch in there and of
course the aux is your backup no matter
what you got will play through the air
with a pigtail okay then we come to our
part of the show called the agony and
the ecstasy you see ya could get a v6
and a TSX you just can't get a v6 and a
TSX Wagon that bothers me you get this
2.4 liter 4 it's a nice 4 but it's a 4
lugging around a fairly good-sized car
you've got 201 horsepower and a fairly
anemic hundred and seventy foot-pounds
of torque
it'll get this guy up to sixty and eight
point eight seconds mpg is not bad it's
a four after all twenty to thirty but if
you get the v6 in this guy at least give
us the choice and/or the six-speed
manual available elsewhere in the line
I'd like that a lot more accurate as a
tough time shedding stale transmissions
and this car is an example of that it
has a 5-speed automatic which even the
unloved RL recently escaped but here
it's soldiers on adequately if not
thrillingly it works tightly enough but
compared to today's six seven and eight
speeds you start to notice the big
ungainly hops between gears paddles on
the wheel no shifting gate on the
console
on the road I must admit the sum of this
car does much to overcome the lackluster
appearance of its four-cylinder and
5-speed on paper it is snappy and ready
to run in real-world driving maneuvers
with little if any of the thinking delay
that plagued so many modern cars with
automatics and too many computers that
said the engine does run out of breath
rather early and the lack of a couple of
extra cogs doesn't help it catch it the
engine notes a little rough not what you
normally associate with Honda Motors but
overall this wagon drives light tight
and alright have you noticed how many
times I've used the word Honda in this
video about an Acura that's telling
Infiniti Lexus even scion are more
differentiated from their parent brands
than this Acura I like Honda's I just
expect an Acura to be a lot more than
one this one Falls a little too close to
the tree
okay let's price a TSX wagon you're in
at about 31 7 31 8 with destination but
you've got to add a chunky package the
technology package for 36 50 to go CNET
style that includes a lot of stuff
including the navigation system which
looks really good now that's knob
controlled as we saw the Acura
controller you get the built-in traffic
and the weather information
you also get everything hard drive based
15 gig vailable for your media the 10
speaker Elliot shiner sound who didn't
blow me away the Bluetooth gets upgraded
to have phonebook ability you get the
rear camera GPS alteration of the
climate settings and a power liftgate a
lot of things in there pretty good value
for what you get
unfortunately nothing's gonna get you a
v6 that's the big omission</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
