thanks to google google announced a
couple of changes that will affect
mobile search results the one that we
all care about even you over there mr.
grumpy is Google demoting sites in its
search results that show intrusive
interstitials that block the actual
content you want to read even if you've
never heard of the term interstitial I'm
sure you've seen one you go to a site
you see the content for a second and
then it's grayed out and covered up with
an annoying ad or something they have to
close that out to read what you want
that annoyance is thanks to an
interstitial Google's changes to its
mobile search results will start on
January 10th 2017 if sites want to rank
highly on Google which pretty much every
site wants to do their mobile sites
should shy away from these intrusive
measures however Google will not
penalize every site that uses an
interstitial sites that show a notice
for something like attracting policy or
age verification are a-ok google says
banners that use a reasonable amount of
screen space and are easily dismissible
will not be affected who's ready to find
out the limits of reasonability I am
Google's mobile search results will also
get a little bit more streamlined two
years ago Google started putting a
mobile-friendly label on sites that
works well on mobile devices the company
found that eighty-five percent of pages
in mobile search results now receive
that label google says whether a site is
mobile-friendly or not still matters to
its results but the tag itself will be
dropped to remove clutter that's it for
this tech news update am i as akhtar and
you can stay on top of the biggest
stories at cnet com / update</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
