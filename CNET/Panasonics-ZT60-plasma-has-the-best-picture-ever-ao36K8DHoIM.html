C net and next to me is the Panasonic
TCP zt6 T this is a 60-inch Plasma TV
this series also comes in a 65 and this
is hands-down the best TV that panasonic
has ever made it's also one of the best
TVs we've ever tested the picture
quality on this thing is phenomenal but
of course all wait till the end to talk
about that starting off this TV has
really slick design around the front you
can see it's all glass one big sheet of
glass across the front there's also a
really nice metal edge here the stand is
not swivel and it's really kind of ugly
looking below the belt it's got sort of
v-shape all chrome plate and everything
but of course unifor this TV you're
probably going to wall mount it anyway
seen from the side like most mounted
plasmas also really thin so it's really
not that much thicker than an LED TV
this is high-end set so Panasonic did
throw in an extra remote it's got a
little touchpad on it so it's great for
navigating the web this TV does have a
built-in browser or just flipping around
the menus a lot faster than a standard
remote of course the downside is there's
not too many buttons on here and it's
not really going to replace the standard
remote that the TV does come with one
nice touch remote extra though is the
voice control you can speak into it and
do a couple commands on to the TV just
by activating your voice you can also
perform a couple of searches and
activate some apps with voice the remote
is also bluetooth so you don't have to
have line-of-sight to control the
television Panasonic's smart TV suite
has some of the best content out there
but it doesn't have HBO go that's a
Samsung exclusive this year it does have
Netflix Amazon Instant Video and pretty
much every other app you want however
including a healthy selection of audio
apps the app store is pretty nice
there's even some physical merchandise
you can buy with this thing and as we
mentioned there's a web browser if you
want heavy use you can want to want to
plug in a USB keyboard of course this TV
does work with standard third-party
keyboards that's a nice touch if you're
heavy into the web browser
unlike some high-end TVs this does not
include a built-in camera that's
actually reserved for the step-down VT
series the set also doesn't have the
beefy speakers included on the VT so
it's sound quality isn't quite as good
another feature Panasonic throws in is
two pairs of active 3d glasses so you
don't need to buy separate glasses with
retail for about 80 bucks you get two in
the box for free
connectivity isn't quite as good as some
of the other high-end TVs out there
there's only three HDMI ports instead of
two there's also a few us
B ports as well as an SD card slot and a
component video input picture settings
on the ZT 60 are extensive this TV does
have the ability to adjust 10 points of
grayscale and gamma there's also a full
color management system as well as a
couple thx modes you can zap this TV
right into excellent picture quality
with a push of a button so again the
picture quality adjustments pretty much
as good as we've seen on any TV that
brings the picture quality which is the
main reason you'd want to pay extra for
this television the real benefit of this
TV over the step-down VT 60 is not in a
dark room they actually have pretty much
identical darkened picture quality
including those super inky black levels
that are good enough to challenge the
courage long reigned at the black level
champion this TVs advantage is in bright
rooms so when you turn up the lights a
little bit you'll notice that it
preserves black levels just a little bit
better than the VT and better than
pretty much any other plasm we've seen
of course in a bright room it's not
going to produce as good of a picture as
some of the better LED TVs which can get
a lot brighter and won't get as bright
as the excellent Samsung f-85 hundred so
if you do have a very bright room there
are a couple better options out there
then again for all-around picture
quality ZT 60 is the best we've seen
including those super deep black levels
it also has excellent color accuracy
superb video processing and the
excellent off angle and uniformity
characteristics we expect from any
plasma TV in addition to all that great
2d picture quality TV is also an
excellent performer in 3d although not
quite as good as some of the brighter
TVs out there so of course the ZT 60 is
not cheap in fact it's one of the most
expensive plasma TVs we've ever seen but
for that you do get superb picture
quality again the best we've ever tested
that's a quick look at Panasonic's ZT 60
