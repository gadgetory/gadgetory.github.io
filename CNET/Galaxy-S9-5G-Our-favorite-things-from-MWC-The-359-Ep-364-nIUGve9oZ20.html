episode 367 of the 359 podcast on BVG
and your host today are Ben Fox Ruben
and Roger Chang all the way back from
Barcelona hello glad to be back
are we already on 367 yeah okay I mean
you're the keeper of numbers so you
would know a week and a half ago is a
three nor 59th wait that was a week and
a half ago Wow do you like forever
either way we also have an extended
edition podcast from the weekend the
Bryan put together
yeah our conversation with Mark lesser
yeah blesser mark lesser from Mouse org
so check it out and we've also got Roger
back here today to talk about all things
Mobile World Congress we're gonna try to
run through a bunch of stuff one let's
talk about jamon we'll talk about of
course which isn't kosher but no it's
not but fine it's delicious and we'll
talk about 5g the s9 a car a car that's
operated by a phone from Huawei the vivo
selfie camera iPhone clones with the
knotch well we'll try to get you all
through as many as we can get to them in
the podcast but we will definitely talk
about them after the podcast yeah and
Roger is also our resident expert when
it comes to 5g so please pepper in with
as many ways you can I love to take
questions on 5g specifically on that one
but also I got one over what size G okay
it's one more G than 4G got it okay yeah
okay so send in your questions and
comments BVG we'll get to as many as you
can at the end of the show let's get to
the podcast hang out folks we'll be back
in three minutes and 59 seconds to see
in the chat from three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
Roger Chang so Roger you are back from
Mobile World Congress the world's
biggest mobile show what did you what
did you see there what was the most
exciting thing for you oh look the the
headline of the show was undoubtedly
galaxy s 9 was the biggest phone
dominated pretty much all the headlines
its next big flagship phone it's not
hugely different from the GSA but pretty
incremental I will say that the camera
is amazing they did they focused a lot
on you know redefining the camera and if
you just take out all the hype it's
actually a really solid camera that does
decently well in low-light settings
which is impressive to me look the
galaxy s 8 is a good phone so I have
that phone so in many regards why would
you want to revolutionize that phone
within a year I don't really think so so
like don't throw out the design
completely it makes sense to do some
refinements with the s9 you had some
opportunities to actually have some
hands-on time with the s9 right yeah
yeah so I mean I got to test it in low
light settings of various dark bars in
Barcelona and I compared them with my
iPhone 10 and the pictures were a lot
better I have to give to Samsung this
they have this thing called a dual
aperture setting so it has a specific
aperture for nighttime setting versus
daytime setting and it's it works
wonders I have to say that the photos
the photo quality it's pretty strong
detail wise it may not have been as good
as the iPhone 10 but in terms of
brightness it definitely it beat the
iPhone 10 by a wide margin yeah it's
really interesting to see how much the
camera technology has been going and
leaps and bounds and there's also been
like a pretty strong fist fight going on
between the pixel the iPhone and Samsung
so expect to see a lot more of that
through this year I also wanted to ask
you of course about 5g I feel like you
were writing about 5g like every day or
every hour at the show is it mostly hype
at this point when should we expect to
see 5g stuff tell us a little bit more
about yeah so 5g is definitely quick
it's going from hype to reality and I
think this year you will start to see
sort of the early May
a 5g as something that you'll actually
be able to use in very very limited
areas and limited towns with limited
devices remember the first phones don't
come out until next year so the service
the wider launch service won't be until
2019 that said you know like those early
days the 5gt are not gonna be what I
think everyone's gonna hyped or promised
you know it's not gonna be as fast or if
the coverage won't be as comprehensive
they're gonna be a lot of dead spot the
devices may not be as they may not last
long battery life is gonna be a real
issue if you'll remember from 4G those
early days of 4G LTE phones they were
tough those phones did not last long
that got kicked off with a 4G network
really fast I expect at least in the
early days there's gonna be a lot of
headaches a lot of difficulties with
that transition so I think the promise
of 5g is this like super fast super
concert comprehensive network is still
there but it's still a few years away
yeah we will get be patient exactly we
will get to see a taste of it later this
year early next year but it's not gonna
be great okay so how soon until we got
questions about this on the podcast more
than once how soon until a major
flagship phone is gonna have 5g we might
see it next year I got some very
conflicting answers I talked to the
various US carriers
I think t-mobile has said that you know
they kind of expect it to be a premium
phone but I don't know if he meant
premium or microphone you know 18t said
that it might be that you'll see more 5g
specific phones like we did with with 4G
like a Samsung Galaxy 5g you know as
opposed to like the flagship s phone all
right we've got a little bit of time
left so I wanted to get to one more
thing iPhone clones we're all over the
show we were making fun of the notch and
now the notches everywhere I know so we
I mean we saw with the sousaphone
last week on Friday there were leaks
from from Evan blast
evey leaks basically pointed out that
the LG G 7 or whatever they're gonna
call it as well as the next one plus
phone will have their own notches so the
rumored to have notches so you're
starting to see this this trend that
iPhones kicked off and it may not be
it's not a trend that I don't know
everyone really wants to see happen but
here goes yeah all right anyway if you
want to read more
about these stories check us out on CNN
I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Roger Tsien thanks
for listening alright everybody thanks
for joining us that was a conclusion of
the recording of the audio podcast we
can go ahead and start digging through
you're always brilliant questions and
comments in the chat but since we're
where they are brilliant already on the
platform for 5g Roger you need me to
define what 5g is no not really because
it seems like the audience is far more
educated than I am and they know plenty
about what five jasser really mobile
right so here's the thing that keeps
kind of popping up why is it relevant to
the regular consumer most people are
actually fairly satisfied with 4G on
their personal mobile devices why where
does 5g come into play when does it
actually become a powerful relevant
force so this is and this isn't gonna
happen for another few years as 5g
matures but it's not 5g isn't really
just about speed it's also about
responsiveness something called latency
and 5g has low latency so with 4G you
know when you you know we click on a
link on your phone there's still a bit
of a delay for when your phone talks to
the tower you know gets all the
information it comes back so there's a
bit of delay you'll see that a lot if
you're doing mobile gaming especially if
you're like playing with those real-time
shooters there's a bit of that lag when
you fire a gun when someone else
actually sees you get hit or sees that
she's the attack with 5g that low
latency means that basically you have
for almost real-time communication it's
it's basically a millisecond less than a
millisecond of delay and that enables
things like self-driving cars because
self-driving cars need to talk to each
other and current networks are not fast
enough to handle that communication time
a telemedicine the idea that a doctor
can control a robot that robotic arms in
like a doctor in Switzerland control
robotic arms in New York and basically
perform surgery with those arms couldn't
do that LTE because the lag time but
with 5g at least theoretically the delay
is so minimal that you can actually he
could actually perform that surgery with
those robotic arms and it would be
precise right the other thing that we
bring up a lot on the
Podcast is the potential of 5g being
available as your broadband replacement
in home yep I think that's what we're
gonna see first Verizon has really
talked a lot about using 5g as that
broadband replacement service something
called fixed mobile broadband that's
such a lovely name I know I know it's so
sexy I mean but the idea that they no
longer have to like rip up the streets
to put in internet lines or fiber cables
instead they're just using a wireless
connection shot right into your house
basically powering all the broadband in
your home and Verizon I believe at least
they said publicly Sacramento is the
first town to get it this year there's
gonna be a there's gonna be more but
again this goes back to my original
point with five g's we're not gonna see
a lot of it even going into like early
2019 because I think the deployments are
pretty minimal
t-mobile talked about 30 cities 18 T 12
cities spent six cities Verizon hasn't
talked about any cities with mobile
broadband yet so that chances are you
probably don't live in some of those
towns although to t-mobile's credit some
of the larger cities t-mobile Sprint
some of the larger cities like LA
Chicago New York will get some form of
5g next year and we also have pretty
international audience here on the
podcast Yap and you share a little bit
maybe that you heard about in Europe
when you were in Barcelona or maybe some
other parts of the world that will also
see some 5g networks no that's a great
question India well India is not gonna
get fired you for a while
I'm sorry Korea Japan and China look to
be the other big leaders here we saw in
Korea in Pyongyang the Olympic Village
actually had 5g up and running a kind of
early version of it well wait I think
you mean Pyongyang Pyeongchang I said
young yang is a North Korean all right I
met Pyeongchang it's fine I play a lot
of trivia level game thanks for that
correction that's a pretty pretty
critical distinction there yes in the
Olympic Village they did have a small 5g
network running is kind of a test run
but yeah you'll see Korea you'll see
Japan have it Europe's a little bit
behind I think they're all kind of still
dealing with the money that they put
into the 4G networks and there are a
little bit more reluctant to get going
on 5g because it is expense
is basically you're running through a
whole new big capital lesson plan to
redo your network so they're you know
they're better and faster stronger but
that takes a lot of money so the
customers that are best positioned to
see 5g sooner rather than later it
sounds like are the folks in the US yeah
I think in the US and I think parts of
Asia will be pretty well suited to get
5g some taste of 5g earlier rather than
later mmm good coming from the chat Mike
Shaw the burning question what phones
currently support 5g will we all have
time to upgrade in a year or two that's
a really easy question answer no phone
none or 5g not at all none in fact first
phones won't show up and tell next year
the the chipsets that actually enable 5g
connection aren't even available yet I
think they'll be available probably end
of this year going into phones that come
out next year I think they'll be fairly
limited and I want to warn again those
early phones are there gonna be battery
hogs they're gonna be there maybe
inconsistencies in terms of like
connection and coverage and even in
towns where they say they have 5g
they're gonna be like kind of pockets of
5g like this is really helpful to get
the to understand a little bit more
around the hype because I feel like 5g
has been hyped for four years right tech
world and people might be really let
down by those early days of 5g and those
early days could last six months sounds
kinda lame here yeah
4k yeah I mean like a more 4G I mean
even 4k became eventually became
ubiquitous though so that's eventual
evangelize the key word I've got a 4k TV
how many people are producing 4k content
the exact handful Ram yeah and you bring
up a good point with 5g how much stuff
on your phone is really gonna gonna use
that yes you you made you you reference
a bunch of different uses but I like
surgery yeah but like it's self-driving
cars in surgery isn't really something
that are quite there yet or something
that people are going to use in their
daily lives all right I mean I think
early on it'll be about speed right like
you'll be able to download and stream
things super fast but I mean for a lot
folks the LTE network is good enough and
I think
one of the other conversations I had a
lot of conversations I had at the show
was about making LTE better there not
just because we're going to 5g doesn't
mean they're stopping with the
investment in for Jean ideas get 4G good
enough so if you're on 5g and you
somehow drop down to 4G it's not such a
bad mmm fall down ball fall back because
if you were around with LTE when you
fell off LT and got back to 3G that was
like horrible it was a terrible oh yeah
but before it was happening all the time
everywhere even if you theoretically
were in a 4G area you would drop down a
3G and the experience the transition was
not good yeah yeah back into the chat
from no vent is how is galaxy s 9
compatible with 5g same question nope no
sorry
no phones coming up this year will have
5 g and i would i would probably bet
that a handful of phones coming out next
year have 5 um almost CERN the iPhone
will not be one of them
correct all right from imagine soggy
what device is utilized 5g at the
Olympic Village that you saw uh well I
didn't see it personally from what I
think they were like there might even
like 5g tablets and I believe the 5g
call was made but I don't think it was
like it's very it was super limited it
was sort of like they want to kind of
test out some of the connections and how
it would work in a real-world situation
but I don't think there were any like
commercial devices it wouldn't be a
device that you'd be able to buy and one
of the first things that people will be
able to buy a correct me if I'm wrong
here is that puck Vox yeah yeah and
Verizon is basically confirmed that they
will have some form of mobile mobile
broadband 5g this year like just like 18
t and so presumably they'll also have
pucks these are wireless hotspots and
and they're basically they do that
because it's easier to get that product
through testing it's just you know
there's no complicated display there's
just or like it's a box that taps into
the five gene and then broadcast a Wi-Fi
network for you hmm
from syringe oi will 5g get a similar
reality check like our poor buddy 4G
once the deployments begin on a wide
scale I think so I think you're that's
what I've tried to do with that story
on Friday was basically kind of dispel
some of the myths some of the hype you
know it's it's I think the long-run
promise of 5g is still fantastic and and
potentially world-changing but it's
gonna take several years and if you look
at LG now right we're about eight years
into about seven half years into the 4G
LTE deployment it's not perfect now it's
it's much better than it was but it's
taken years for it to get better so I
would expect 5g to just come on and
change ones lives right away so when do
we celebrate if they come out with three
five nine G couple hundred years yeah
probably if you if you're looking at
like 10 years per G that's a lot of
years I hope we live long enough to see
it guys eat your Wheaties yeah we'll be
we'll be like the the heads right oh
that was a full come around on Olympic
jokes by the way that you completely
missed oh I did say eat your Wheaties oh
sorry
oh I was too busy talking all right
let's take a sidebar real quick Anthony
nuñez is in a crisis and it's not quite
related but it's not not related either
you guys have got his question a tons of
times but I'm in the middle of
purchasing a phone and need help between
the last three you've narrowed it down
to from the three he's looking at
apparently price is not a concern nine
iPhone 10 pixel to XL the three big boys
right now who's really gonna lead in the
charge I wish we had some more
information from you Anthony about your
simulations whether it's about money
whether it's about boys cameras and
money's no object I'm guessing because
he picked those three doesn't pick the
10 I would say okay are you an Android
user are you an iOS user already how
much how many photos you take is the
camera an important factor do you have
any previous loyalties yeah yeah yeah do
you care about the headphone jack
because the s9 is the only one with the
headphone jack the other one is is that
it's very important to note that if
you're gonna shell out $1000 on an
iPhone 10 you might as well shell out an
extra 200 or so dollars to get the
additional storage so yeah yeah yeah and
also the s9 do you want just the s9 or
the s9 plus you just said nine just nine
all right well I mean well if money's no
object
you have you have the 10 I have the aid
I like the s8 and I would probably say
that you'd be happy with the s9 I like
that it still has the headphone jack I
like the design of those phones I'm I'm
a little hesitant to make a call I think
if you are a it depends a lot on what
you are now are you an iOS user own
Android users I think that will depend a
lot more on but for me at least but if
the toss-up between the iPhone 10 and
the the s9 I think the pixel to excel
has had some issues or originally I mean
I know the camera is pretty strong on it
but it's yeah I think it's really
between Samsung or Apple as it usually
is yeah yeah all right let's move on to
the more about the s9 sir enjoy Roger is
the s9 superior brightness and vibrancy
minute majorly influenced by its great
screen well yeah I mean look it uses an
OLED display now our focus on the
display this year in terms of like
improvement I mean it's last year's
phone was a fantastic phone the display
was fantastic and they really played up
the display display is good it's already
it was already a great display so it's
just not a huge step up from the GS a go
figure from Josh Boyd oh when will the
Nokia smartphones arrive in the US haha
Wow
Oh Kia actually a Katy had a story and I
believe only the the Nokia the new Nokia
six new Kia six is coming to the US and
with no carrier partners though I think
they haven't yet they haven't yet signed
up I don't think they will be signing up
any US carrier partners there was a big
question about that last year when they
relaunched this is the startup hmd
global which is making these Nokia
phones there was a lot of questions
about whether or not they would partner
with the US carrier that has had that
hadn't happened I don't think it's gonna
happen with this one you might get it
like at a Best Buy or an Amazon or one
of those other random retailers but yeah
it's it's not gonna it's gonna be a
little bit harder to find that which one
of which will limit the sales absolutely
that usually tends to be the case and
it's a small phone I think it's it's an
okay budget phone
I was pretty excited with their uh their
flagship phones at the Nokia eight so
I'm gonna butcher it Scirocco Scirocco I
keep that part of the name keep wanting
to say sriracha but it's not sriracha
that would be a great name for it was I
had saw it that was a nice really nice
looking phone stock Android pretty much
but that unfortunately is not coming to
us since we are talking about the like
that not the top tier phones anymore did
you have a chance to check out the vivo
concept phone yeah that was probably one
of the crazier phones I saw the show now
this is the one where it's basically
they removed everything around remove
the bezel almost entirely even to the
point where there's no notch or anything
for that face it looks really future as
of that it is a concept phone it's a
little bit if you know it's a little bit
on the thicker side but on the top there
is a pop-up selfie cam and they say it
comes out in less than a second but I'm
not really sure that's not fast enough
first selfie unfortunately you know
there's still the rear camera for you if
you need to take a spontaneous photos
and then there is the fingerprint sensor
to fingerprint sensors in the glass so
all kinds of crazy cool design concepts
I don't know I remember correctly this
one also doesn't have speakers it like
the oh yeah I'm vibrant yeah as like
almost like a bone conduction type yeah
yeah yeah so this is a concept phone for
one thing we don't even vivo doesn't
sell phones in the US or do them and
this phone in particular is just a
concept device but it's definitely one
of the more interesting ones the show
and kind of points to what we might see
down the line yeah and it's nice to see
that they didn't bother with a knotch
yeah this time because everybody else is
like well Apple did it so now we'll do
it now we can do notches cool Apple made
not just cool I didn't know they didn't
they just popularly they they just made
they made it acceptable I guess I think
the thing with the notches is that
there's there's a specific reason to
have the notch because of face ID yeah
in the iPhone 10 what's coming up
afterwards those other phones need to
justify their notch for
I mean you I imagine you see things like
like with LG they have it they already
have a dual cam on the front so a notch
would makes that kind of not would make
sense right yeah all right I have an
idea about a mod for this vivo phone
already so if somebody makes a case it
turns a hand crank like on a
jack-in-the-box and then when the camera
like you reach the end of the pop goes
the weasel' and the camera snaps up and
that's your selfie you don't have a
choice you don't actually hit the flash
it's just whenever it surprises you and
that's your takeaway selfie that would
be yeah yeah that would definitely make
it look a lot less you try extra for
that permanently on there right you can
just Roger I have to go home I left the
hand cream for your front-facing camera
still have the back one it's killer it's
all good let's say you charge the phone
to hey we only got a few minutes left
and you're talking about
the notch gate yeah we call it notch
gate no no I don't know it's not a gate
yet it's not a controversy it's a trend
now it's become is it funny how it goes
from one to the other so quickly yeah
this is the way of the world anyway so
Michael Brown is a longtime reporters at
scene at what do you think about the
Apple effect and how something that you
don't think should catch on from Apple
actually does good question I mean we've
talked about this with notches we've
talked about this with the removal the
headphone jack Apple definitely has like
they've shown a a willingness to kind of
stand out for something to take a
controversial stand whether it's
removing the headphone jack or adding a
notch and they they're known as a major
major design house and so their design
decisions whether good or bad in in our
immediate sense end up having
significant influence we spent a lot of
time initially making fun of the look of
ear pods and now they they look very
typical and I wouldn't be surprised I
haven't been on the market for Bluetooth
headphones but I wouldn't be surprised
if some knockoffs already exist that
looks very similar to that yeah we got a
follow-up from Anthony nuñez I'm scared
of getting married to this entire Apple
or Android ecosystem I get one for work
and it's time for me to get a new one
for myself I've got the
phone success I want to know which I'm
gonna looks great - oh so when it came
down to the s9 with an iPhone 10 you've
already got experience with the Apple oh
I see I see I would in that case I would
go with Android that way you're gonna
have your foot in both worlds I do that
I have an iPhone 8 that's my work phone
and there is there is a little bit of
lag time trying to like work the iPhone
after spending yeah the only issue with
that is because I mean I do the same
thing yeah your brain like it's trained
to use a phone in scale you have any
muscle memory and then yeah exactly I've
been having to like reprogram it to
handle two different phones sometimes
it's a little bit annoying but it's good
to have you know a foot in each
different like OS you're not beholden to
the other so yeah I would say if you've
already got an iPhone and you're looking
to diversify a gs-9
is a it's not a bad way to get into the
Android ecosystem mm-hmm okay
at the last couple of minutes we have in
the show a couple of takeaway quick
impressions or predictions uh first from
lucky never he wants to know about that
foldable Samsung smartphone oh great
question yeah great question actually I
chance to talk with the Samsung the CEO
of the Samsung's mobile business and he
did confirm that they were still doing
work on it
he wasn't quite 100% commit to the phone
coming out this year but it seemed like
they were doing a lot of work there was
a lot of progress being made on that
phone so we might see it this year
probably in the fall maybe if if it
comes out this year but he did stressed
that they were still working out like
whether or not the experience of it is
actually taking advantage of the
foldable phone and just not and they're
just not building affordable phone for
the sake of doing it so at least they've
got the right approach and attitude
about it because it can't be a gimmick
for this to work actually you know the
foldable phone there needs to be
applications that take advantage of that
new designs I don't think that come out
immediately out of the gate you know no
I know but I mean you can imagine well
Samsung definitely has an issue with
software but you could you could see
them building their own programs or apps
to take advantage of the foldable phone
in ways that inspire hopefully inspire
other developers to create and that
could have a huge influence we were
talking about from Michael's question
earlier Apple's influence yeah if
Samsung creates a foldable phone that
actually does take off and do well
expect to see a lot more of those types
of things
yeah and last but not least coming in
from mr. Tech a blackberry key one Oh
after Rogers own hard asking a
blackberry questions you're so kind
yes the blackberry q10 key to that's a
sequel firm we're expecting it later
this year they had already talked about
teasing us a fall to the key one there
was some talk about the key one early in
the show I believe the the head of the
blackberry business under TCL and sort
of told me that he's hoping to get like
three to five percent of the premium
market share that for him would be
success I think that would equate to I
was doing the math based off of
estimates for how well the phone is done
so far that's like it's more than like a
10x increase in sales for them they hit
even three even three percent of the
premium phone market not the toefl
market just phones there are four
hundred dollars or more and it's that's
a pretty taller it's usually is for
blackberry yeah I mean look I wouldn't
say it's come it's coming back I would
say it's alive like faint faint faint
pulse but I mean they are selling phones
and they are from what I understand I
believe they're making money off of it
and so so catch me up okay so first of
all TCL is the yes new owner blackberry
line of phones TCL basically pays
blackberry Limited which is still around
blackberry makes software now but they
pay for the rights to use the BlackBerry
brand in its phones so to make
Blackberry phones okay and the key one
which is the question was about does it
have a physical keyboard and does it run
on Android the key one's been out for a
few months now so it's on the market it
does have a fiscal keyboard there was a
second phone they created called the
BlackBerry motion which was all full
screen full touchscreen the second one
is believed to be a keyboard phone but
we saw okay and that's we're gonna leave
it for today thanks for joining us
