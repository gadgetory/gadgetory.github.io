worry about printer ink for years you're
already living in it Maya's Akhtar
filling in for Bridget Carey this is
your scene that update exciting news in
the world of printers from Epson I know
that sentence sounds absurd but stay
with me here
Epson introduced the Epson eco tank a
printer line that says goodbye to ink
cartridges these printers ship with the
equivalent of 20 cartridges already in
the machine
Epson says you can print up to 4,000
black at 6500 color pages before you'll
need more ink okay but you'll still need
a refill sometime in the future and
they'll cost somewhere between 50 and 60
dollars total but that's gonna last you
another 4,000 black and 6500 color pages
Epson figures you'll need new ink every
two years what's the downside the Epson
eco tank printers start at three hundred
and seventy nine dollars so either you
pay upfront or you pay overtime however
if you pay upfront you get thousands and
thousands of printouts before you start
screaming at your printer for being out
of ink Intel's newest line of processors
made their debut at the gamescom
videogame tradeshow in Germany these
processors are known under the codename
skylake and you'll find them in high-end
desktop PCs for vendors like Origin PC
velocity of micro and digital storm we
got to benchmark the two processors
Intel unveiled at the show and found
performance to be excellent does that
mean you should rush out and try to get
your hands on a skylit processor now
first you need a new motherboard so hold
off right now
Intel plans to release more mainstream
versions of the chip in the next few
months if you've ever wanted to buy
something on your TV Samsung's trying to
make it easier it's introducing Samsung
pay for certain Smart TVs now this isn't
like Samsung pay on a phone with using
magnetic secure transmission to send a
signal to a point-of-sale machine the
version for TVs will support PayPal
credit cards and debit cards after the
initial setup you could buy something on
your TV by putting in a pin samsung says
that if you've got a samsung phone you
could transfer payment info from your
phone to the TV and less steps the first
things you'll be able to buy our games
that run on the Samsung Smart TV system
Samsung pay on TV will be available on
some 2015 and 2014 Smart TVs and be
available in over 30 countries and in
more sense on TV news Forbes reports
that if you're thinking about picking up
a new Samsung 4k TV hold off until this
16th of August at that time Samsung will
partner up with Western Digital to give
away two free 4k movies the deal applies
to js9 thousand Jay s 90 100 and Jay s
95 hundred lines of samsung s UHD TVs

and Exodus gods and monsters that's it
