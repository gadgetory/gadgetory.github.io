out the Nokia Lumia 625 they colourful
budget Nokia with a huge screen so of
4.7 inches Lumia 625 is the biggest
phone in the Lumia range the top-end 920
is only 4.5 inches and the 620 that just
sits just below this is only 3.8 so I'd
leave the screen resolution itself
hasn't been increased its only 800 x 480
pixels which is very low especially for
a phone of this size it does mean that a
small text and the lines around some of
the big windows 8 tiles don't look
particularly sharp it's reasonably
bright but it definitely doesn't have
the same bold rich colors and deep black
levels of some of the higher-end lumias
ly breast of a Lumia range it's
extremely colorful this plastic back
panel is available in yellow in white
green black or a ready orange color and
you can swap the cases too meaning you
can pop on a fresh one when your
existing case starts to look a bit dirty
you will be able to buy these separately
but Nokia hasn't yet said exactly how
much they'll cost it's running Windows
Phone 8 software with the sames of
colourful big tiles that you'll see on
any other Windows Phone device it has
got the new amber update meaning it has
these smart cam software that lets you
take multiple photos at once to create
an action shot it's powered by a 1.2
gigahertz dual-core processor which
isn't obviously going to be anything
like as powerful as some of the cord
cord chips you'll find in higher end
phones but it still seemed quite nippy
in my hands on and there isn't a whole
lot you can really get for windows phone
devices that's really going to tax that
you'll find a load of the bundled nokia
software on board to like here maps or
the here drive gps satellite navigation
and the nokia music streaming program
around the back you'll see a 5 megapixel
camera with an LED flash and a phone
itself is powered by a 2,000 milliamp
battery which should give plenty of
juice
networks and sharps haven't yet
announced exactly how much they're going
to be stuck into 6254 but it is expected
to be sin free for around 200 pounds
making it a very affordable option I'm
Andrew Hoyle cnet and this is a Nokia
Lumia 625</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
