out the all-time record for biggest
cyber security attack after revealing
that 1 billion of its user accounts were
compromised the mammoth breach beats out
the previous record of 500 million
accounts hacked from a single company
that record was also set by Yahoo only
three months ago I can't believe we're
saying this again but if you're a yahoo
user you need to change your password
now while the passwords were encrypted
the trove of data also included
unencrypted security questions so if
your childhood pass all your mother's
maiden name is the key to unlocking all
your accounts it's time to change that
info to in October the company came
under fire after reports surfaced that
it had built tools to surveil customers
emails for us intelligence and while
it's been staring down massive cyber
security threats requests from national
security officials and uncomfortable
questions from its own users yahoo has
also been trying to square away a
massive acquisition deal with verizon
the US carrier agreed to by yahoo for
4.8 billion dollars in july but now it
says it will review the impact of this
new development before reaching any
final conclusions you can find out more
on cnet com and from Sydney I'm Clare
