we're winding down this season but you
guys know that we deliver the goods and
today in the studio joining us via Skype
funny man Aziz and sorry all the way
from the NYC Aziz what's up how are you
I'm doing good we're doing great so
welcome to the show thanks so much for
coming out in obviously there's been a
lot of news surrounding you not only in
what you're doing in the comedy world
but also on the online world we kind of
wanted to talk to you about you know
what have you been doing you're starting
your tour pretty soon and also how is
dangerously delicious doing uh it's
doing well I'm not gonna release any
numbers come on that's it okay so how
about this can we play little that's
like asking me like how much money do
you make year I mean you know how much
money do you make a year zzzz you can do
the math exactly man of a private thing
yeah but how's the response to
dangerously delicious you're doing this
podcast no seriously I know that
response has been tremendous uh the
overwhelming thing I've gotten back is
people are so glad that someone else has
done the same thing Louie CK did they're
like I hope more comedians do this um
this is so simple it's easy to get it
it's a fair price and that's kind of
been the overwhelming feedback I've kind
of taken from all this maybe we should
give some background to on what this is
this is your comedy special dangerously
delicious at your offering from your
website that's like a five dollar
download right yeah just get it directly
for me aw jeez I'm sorry calm it's five
bucks any and you get the special
there's no like it's drm-free and you
know I'm someone that you know downloads
media and uh you know it can just be
frustrating sometimes cuz you're like oh
I want to watch Game of Thrones is it on
netflix is it on hyphens is it on HBO on
demand where do I watch it I know I paid
for it somehow I found this where do I
get it from and and then eventually like
you know I'm just gonna steal it cuz I
can't find it so so so have you um this
is a drm-free thing so you're definitely
in touch with what people want have in
the past have you experimented using
some of the benefits that the internet
has sometimes offered for content that
you may not pay for
well the whole impetus for this was I
recorded the special like in June of
last year and I saw how many people
would watch clips of my last stand of
special on YouTube versus how many DVDs
I'd sold and it was clear when more
people were discovering the stuff online
so I was just trying to embrace that and
while i was having different meetings
with people about ways we could do some
sort of unique digital release I was
actually hanging out with Louis CK while
he was editing his special he told me
what he was going to do and I thought it
was really interesting and I was curious
to see whether it would work and it and
it clearly did it was a resounding
success and immediately after he did it
people were asking me hey would you ever
release a special this way I think that
would be cool so it just seemed like why
try to fix something that isn't broken
it seemed like something people like and
so far it's been going well for me and
it's been a fun experience cool and now
I under that saying like Louis CK model
I know he he had a huge expense up front
to like book the production company book
the theater did do everything his own
way was that still the same case for you
you had to get involved a production
company and make this at the actual
special kind of feel and produced
yourself yeah I mean I did this back in
June was when I did it so even before
lewiston came out I paid for everything
myself you know you paid for running the
venue and all that stuff and it ends up
being about roughly 250 thousand dollars
for everything yeah and for that causes
as offset by people buying tickets for
the shows that you filmed but you know
it's definitely a big expense and you're
gambling on yourself to kind of make
things work but you know you also know
like all right well if this online thing
doesn't work I'll you know I I own this
content so I can do whatever I want with
it you know are you Aziz are you happy
enough with the response that you will
potentially do this for your new tour
that's coming out buried alive I know
you still have to tour it starts I think
April 10th is that when you're starting
to jump on board and just fly around the
country to do this tour yeah I have a
brand new tour I'm doing it's all
different material and I'll probably sad
as a special in a couple of years but
you know who knows how much the
landscape will change by that time I
mean I'm still not sure what to do with
the one I have you know this five-dollar
thing the main thing i like about this
is you can buy for five dollars as
opposed to a DVD is cheaper than it
would be on itunes and it's directly for
me
um you know I don't know if maybe down
the road I'll also want to put it on you
know video on demand or whether i should
put it on TV like I think it's like such
uncharted territory that no one really
has any answers but for right now for
the immediate release I like being able
to release it directly to people for
five dollars and just because it's way
cheaper than a DVD I just think
ultimately this is better than releasing
a DVD right a deep gift is more
expensive and people just want the video
anyway so I've got a question from the
chat room here that want to ask you dr.
Karl wants to know if you've got any
flack from more the corporate channels
more than the distribution channels that
you might have previously put your
content on it there's been in any
backlash from you know people you would
have worked with before for the method
that you're using or is it pretty much a
win all around um no like backlash
haven't like gotten mean emails from
anybody yeah like a comedy central or
like uh what you know is he Aziz is
doing it Louie CK is doing it or they is
it there's a sense that this is kind of
the trend going forward I mean I think
they understand if you're comedian that
has a big following there's been some
power that shifted back to the artist
and and you know they were super cool
with me the last special I did with them
they still air that special all the time
so I have no no palms with them I think
they understand like as far as releasing
it visually that this is what I wanted
to do and what I've done but you know I
don't think I've ruined any kind of
relationship with everything yeah that's
awesome stuff now if you guys haven't
just joined us make sure you guys can
check out Aziz Ansari calm his special
that we're talking about here dangerous
still dangerously delicious is available
for five dollar download really funny
stuff but Aziz also you know embracing
the whole internet technology generation
you're really active on Twitter and I
just kind of want to know maybe what
your thoughts are good or bad or some of
your unique experiences that you've had
using Twitter um you know I what I like
about twitter is it's directly it's a
direct connection with people that
follow my work so I can you know not
only just make jokes about random stuff
but do things like releases special
um I've also done like random things
like so whatever people by the special
it says like oh if you want to tweet and
say that you liked it you know you can
do that and so I'll see you when people
tweet and say hey i just bought the
special really enjoyed it so i'll find
like random people like that and there
was a couple people last week when we
first started selling it i like sent
them like flowers and cookies and like
couldn't do that before like I don't
know who I don't have anyones info
bought the DVD I released last a couple
years ago you know like we did the thing
where I tweeted like oh if you're in New
York you bought the special and you
don't have lunch plans the first ten
people that email this address like
we'll go to we'll get you lunch and so
10 people even I mean a hundreds of
people emailed right away and we found
like 10 people that we could do it with
and I went like bottom lunch and not
with them and talked to him for a while
about their whole experience behind the
special and everything and we just
started a new contest today where if you
go to aziz ansari calm and you hit the
facebook like button the city that has
the most number of likes i'm gonna do a
free show they're like a small free show
thanks for you know supporting the
special everything but yeah it's just
cool that you have like such a direct
connection to people that enjoy your
work it's really you there's never been
anything like it I don't think in our
times now in your routine sometimes
you've talked about some of the
interactions you've actually had based
on feedback that someone might have
given you is that all really real or you
know some of it is a little too story I
mean you have those fun raw
conversations with you know let's say a
fan who may agree or disagree with your
stuff yeah in the in the new special I
do this bit towards the end about
arguing with the guy online and you know
now I I just never engage with anyone
that's a negative because it's
ultimately a dumb thing to do because
the way you got a thing about it is like
take your favorite thing in the world
like you know whatever movie or you know
for me like if i type in Chris Rock
bring the pain like that's one of my
favorite things ever I think it's one of
the best an especial ever hands down I
could type that into Google and find 50
people that say it sucks it's horrible
Chris Rock's terrible that jokes not
funny and then you realize it's like why
am I even playing this game you'll never
win no matter what you do there's going
to be people that don't like it and
there's going to be people that say it's
bad or whatever so don't care it's like
you know
if you're putting something out and so
many people enjoy it just you know you
should be happy with that there's one
person this is empty Lee just kind of
criticizing it and so but in that bit
when I talking about it one guy said
something to me and I just started
engaging with him like and bugging with
him and I just kept going back and forth
and it was really fun of me so I talked
about it on stage and it's all true
multi that's good stuff also there's one
thing that you and I have in common
believe or not a love for our Kelly
where did that start for you you know
I've been a fan of his since you know
the 90s with the hits a bump and grind
and everything and then my fandom grew
with trapped in the closet and
everything and then I went to this
concert that was really insane I talked
about that my first special and then
when I was touring dangerously delicious
whenever I would come out for encore
whatever you know people will check out
our Kelly and want me to talk about him
so I came up with a new bit about him
which actually things better than the
first and I do it in the new
special Oh to update people on our oh
cool oh I had a one question just with
the how involved did you get getting
back to the special and this whole like
direct distribution model how involved
did you get with the actual like the
back end of it I've actually figuring
out how you're going to be able to
deliver the video file the people and
that'll the complicated mess that would
scare people like me off from doing
anything in that realm have a friend
that uh luckily is like very good with
all the web stuff and I kind of just had
him kind of take charge of everything
but I was really hands-on with
everything I wanted to use all the site
and like see all the pages and all the
stuff you read like when you get an
email from buying a special that's like
I wrote that email and like made sure
all the wording sounded in my voice and
you know I it's kind of cool you get to
like make it really sound like you so
like when you buy the special you know
it's not like on Amazon where you get
like thank you for purchasing the swing
like evil for me that's like oh snap on
that five dollars is mine I got that
email check out that email is awesome
yeah people really like that stuff and
you know whenever you buy a special
there's like a digital bonus pack of
just um
you know photos from the tour different
tour posters we did and it's like a set
to like make your own DVD cover like the
Photoshop files and stuff you would need
to like make your own DVD cover using
all the photos and materials and assets
we give and people have been sending me
those on Twitter and it's really cool
you can do stuff like that that you
normally couldn't do with the
traditional physical release awesome
well as easy no we just want to say
thank you so much for your time believe
it or not we actually have an earthquake
drill coming up in two minutes I I
