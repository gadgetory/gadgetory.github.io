it is that playing scientifically
designed games overtime can enhance your
memory improve your attention span and
basically just make you smarter do you
want to give this one a try no what what
words start with J I that's bleep
hilarious pick them up oh boy these are
hard we visited two San francisco-based
companies on the leading edge of this
research Lumosity and posit science to
get a closer look so right now we're
looking at your your brain profile at
Lumosity neuro scientists have developed
games that exploit the brain's
plasticity or in other words its ability
to learn new things so every time you're
seeing something or having a
conversation learning something new
there's a physical change in your brain
that takes place that's how a memory is
captured that's how you learn and get
better at things a lot of us have been
told that five five years old or a
certain age we've done all the learning
we can or a brain is sort of done
developing yeah I really don't think
that's the case yeah it's not I mean
that was the basic understanding among
psychologists and neuroscientists for a
long time the more recent science over
the past couple decades shows that
brains actually change pretty
fundamentally throughout your entire
life so by playing these games the
research suggests you're working out
your brain kind of like going to the gym
but does it actually work
I put Lumosity system to the test first
there's a baseline assessment test so I
can measure where I am cognitively in
areas like memory speed and attention it
did not go well
oh no answer as many math problems as
you can in 45 seconds one plus seven and
then it's Abe who can do that seven
times nine oh I don't
correct 20 incorrect one actually for me
that's pretty freakin good as far as
math goes because you know what they say
journalists plus this number it equals
misstatements next actually so shake his
head out of the corner by the way I'm
camera guy anyways no dammit
I like say one thing and there my
favorite is a different thing generating
my brain performance report I'm a code
cracker
as a code cracker you are sharp
analytical and cunning like they say
that the average brainpower score for my
age range is 100 and mine is 96 and this
is hurtful my 96 it's all got a little
share with friends button I don't think
so the brain training trend it isn't
just about solving math problems or
unscrambling puzzles really fast that
posit science they're working on
software that will help you develop
better people skills like facial
recognition good for those parties where
you kinda know the names of your guests
or and I like this one
identifying emotions where we'll just
click one I kind of get it going I'm
gonna do what I really want to do is
just take the core parts of the brain
that are involved in this kind of task
and work them out and strengthen them
and make them sharper just say like look
that's right all right let's try it here
that's our about so easy ones good
neutral is an option also some people
aren't making any except I was wondering
if neutral is an option I was happy that
one's pretty easy yeah smiles are pretty
easy today you're a good at this awesome
so I've been brain training for about a
week I have a nice little streak going
I've probably put in about five hours of
training since I first started and now
I'm going to take the brain performance
test over again to see if I've improved
the folks that Lumosity did say that I
might not see an improvement in my score
I might just see improvement in my
overall behavior in my life
but I can't lie I'm hoping to see
improvement in my score that's why I'm
going to start the test now and this
time I'm not talking to you guys
concentrate
so the moment of truth has arrived
am i any smarter oh I got the same score
and it says my score is 96 guess it
hasn't changed I haven't gotten any
smarter now to be fair the researchers
say I did need to brain train for at
least 10 hours and I probably did about
half that however I have noticed that
the brain training used to make me
really tired when I would start playing
the games I felt totally exhausted and
then one night I had this hour-long epic
brain training session and I felt
totally energized afterward and I
actually cleaned up my whole house so if
that's the improvement that I get I will
take it the house is clean there are
skeptics of brain training including me
I mean if you do anything long enough
you will get better at it it's kind of
like the outliers argument from Malcolm
Gladwell's book if you practice anything
for 10,000 hours you'll be an expert so
for me the verdict is still out on
whether this brain training thing
actually works or if I just practice
hard enough I'll get better at games 386
I guess that's a victory all on its own
that sounds good to me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
