Morris and it's time to get loaded
Mozilla is considering building a Do Not
Track feature into the Firefox browser
this would be a code built into the
browser that broadcasts a message to
advertising companies and tracking
companies telling them that it is not
okay to follow you around the web in
order to learn your habits the Federal
Trade Commission is also expected to
promote an industry-wide standard to do
the very same thing News Corp is open to
the possibility of selling off myspace
it's no secret that the social
networking site has been a
disappointment to News Corp chief Rupert
Murdoch it was recently relaunched as an
entertainment site but that has not
seemed to be any saving grace News Corp
is looking to either sell it off or
explore a partnership Panasonic is still
working on its portable gaming system
the company is said to be in testing
stages for the portable device that they
call the jungle the system would compete
with the likes of the PlayStation
Portable and the Nintendo DS we don't
have any indication of price or release
date yet AT&amp;amp;T u-verse customers can now
access HBO and cinemax online if they
subscribe to those channels that means
if you have a cable subscription that
includes those channels you could watch
the content from those channels online
with your AT&amp;amp;T u-verse log in HBO and
cinemax hope that this streaming service
will compete with the netflix watch
instantly service speaking of competing
with Netflix Microsoft is keen on that
idea to the company is reportedly
interested in offering a paid TV
subscription service through Xbox Live
reuters has reported that Microsoft is
in licensing discussions with certain TV
networks maybe the licensing people at
Google TV should pay attention and
finally if you see a facebook
application that offers to track who is
viewing your profile do not get excited
it is a scam research firm sophos has
confirmed that this application is not
founded so if you see an email that says
something like this OMG i can't believe
this actually works now you really can
see who viewed your profile ! do not
click this application it leads to
malware those are your headlines for
today
see you tomorrow I'm Natali Morris for
cnet.com and you've just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
