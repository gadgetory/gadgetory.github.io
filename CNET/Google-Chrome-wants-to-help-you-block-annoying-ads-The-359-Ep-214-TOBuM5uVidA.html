for podcast with is and then it's 359
episode 214 good morning everybody hello
hello yes thanks for coming back on no
problem thanks for composing this song
been oh of course we know you did this
in your spare time on your iOS device
this is actually piping in from my brain
right now look at that new interface did
you write the new interface from
facebook so that's one of the stories
that we're going to talk about today
facebook's building eight which is their
hardware moonshots lab our own rich
Nieva wrote about it and during the
facebook developer conference that's
going on this week we're also talking
about a new google chrome browser this
is or at least this is a rumor that's
coming out this is a story from The Wall
Street Journal about a google chrome
browser that's going to be able to block
ads and if we have time we'll also get
to verizon's earnings which came out
this morning which is way more
interesting than you think it is again
again made money lots and lots of money
but they lost subscribers right yeah so
as always sending your questions and
comments bvg we'll get to them at the
end of the show and let's get to the 359
stuff recording of the podcast and we'll
be back in the chat in three two welcome
to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Rubin I'm I as a
wolf akhtar ah woo Google may introduce
new ad blocking software baked right
into the google chrome browser according
to a report from The Wall Street Journal
the software would block annoying ads
like pop-ups auto plays with sound and
ads that come up before you even reach
the homepage I as is this a good idea or
is this at least somewhat ironic that
Google which makes all of its money on
advertising is doing this well I mean I
think it's a good idea for pretty much
any company like Google because they
spent a lot of money on advertising so
they want people to look at their ads so
with this definition of what an annoying
ad is will lose those things that really
bother you and then maybe you'll
actually look at the ad that you want to
see but I think for Google it's probably
a really good bet especially with this
report saying that this would be on by
default and it would be on mobile and
devices it would be everywhere yeah but
I don't really trust this this is this
is assuming that Google is going to be
able to tell us what are the good ads
and what are the bad ads what makes them
the right ones to make that
determination they don't want to pay ad
blocker plus or any of that stuff I
think that's really what the thing is
right here because there's other
companies that whitelist certain ads
based on payment and so with google and
its what is it called the Coalition for
better ads were part of that so to be
fair those are the standards that
they're going to be basing off of you're
not losing all ads you're going to be
losing some of those ads it really take
away from the experience and I think
that actually makes a difference
especially when you're browsing on on
mobile web yeah definitely next amid
Facebook's f8 developer conference this
week our own rich nieva wrote about
building eight which is Facebook's new
hardware lab for moonshot projects to
early efforts include a brain to
computer interface whatever that is that
would allow us to send our thoughts
straight to a computer and technology to
quote unquote here or absorb language
through vibrations in our skin I'm so
confused by these I love the idea of
brain to computer interface the idea
that you can have these thoughts
directly in the machine I know I think
way faster than I type and I type pretty
quickly so speak even quicker so my
brain is at a rate that's ridiculous so
I can't wait for this if it ever comes
to being although there's no internal
implants necessary yes that's what
they're claiming it's gonna be a
non-invasive concept it's gonna be like
a wearable or something like that which
obviously gets me more on board however
facebook already knows so much
information about me already do i really
want them reading my thoughts well maybe
you can take off the wearable me like
it's it now it's now it's been time so
it's bedtime first of all i'd just like
to throw out there like how did we get
to the point where we've been talking
about brain to computer interfaces by
the way Elon Musk also has a project I
mean like what exactly is going on here
that like one of the newest trends is
we're gonna have a brain and a computer
connected together I don't know it just
seems so sci-fi well I mean if when you
get a scream at you know Alexa do
whatever it be easy to forget to think
it you know and if you didn't have to
know yell all the time or if you're a
noisy party environment and those
mics aren't picking you up these mics
are essentially in your head yes yes
it's all in your head last up Verizon
averted a total disaster by finally
giving in to the unlimited data trend as
part of its earnings report Thursday the
company lost a bunch of subscribers but
it wasn't as bad as it could have been
thanks to them jumping on board with
unlimited there's something like 90,000
different there they had lost 318 398
thousand customers before they announced
the unlimited plan then they lost a
total of two nite 289 so they still lost
yeah but it was even worse could be much
worse I mean like look people really
want unlimited and verizon finally gave
in and decided they wanted to give it to
the monstrously strong Network yes art
argue with that right exactly so I think
we're done okay if you want to read more
about these stories check us out on cnet
i'm ben fox rubin I as a wolf akhtar
thanks for listening all right jumping
right back into the chat a pre-party hey
I apologize if I mispronounced that name
do we know when this version of chrome
is going to release the claim was in the
next few weeks potentially this is it to
be clear this is a Wall Street Journal
report we haven't confirmed it
independently but it is the journal so
they do get a lot of stuff right and
yeah next few weeks Matthew is asking if
there is maybe a moral obligation to
consider here is it right to block ads
considering that's how sites function
and we can sympathize with that yeah I I
would I would agree with that notion one
of the reasons that Google is wanting to
do this is because people are turning on
ad blockers a lot more so in many ways
they just they have to respond to a
certain extent that's what the journal
story mentions so they're in a difficult
place where they make a lot of money off
of their ads and if they don't do
anything about it then people are just
going to keep flocking to ad blockers
and then they won't have any control of
the situation and the moral side if the
if the idea of advertising was truly
sell your products and not just generate
revenue for the site because the idea so
really these ads are supposed to be
selling you something but they're just
done in these sneaky annoying ways
you're not noticing your
trying to read the content and you can't
ever get to it you're eventually that
sites going to lose traffic anyway right
because you're like I cannot handle your
practices when it comes to advertising
it's it's it's in a law of diminishing
returns where you have these invasive
ads which turn off customers and then
you have to make them even more invasive
to get to the customers and get really
in your face a lot more and that's why
people turn to ad blockers you know full
disclosure see you know it has to deal
with the same type of situation that
every other publisher does when it comes
to this kind of stuff so it's it's an
interesting conversation to have but at
the same time as a reader on the
internet this is this is something that
i would appreciate to a certain extent
to get rid of some of the most annoying
ads that you would see and have it be
default I just I just hate how
irrelevant some of the ads can be like
I'm here you know my history you know
everything about me you sell me
something I want I don't care if the ad
is good if it's video or not I do hate
autoplay audio regardless but it's fine
million or if I'm poking around the
internet try to sell me something good
something you know that I want it's not
hard to tell but they keep trying to
send me like depends undergarments and
just like not yet not yet yeah maybe
they know something with your browsing
history seems to fill with this pattern
coming soon maybe you just don't know
yet that's true maybe they do know more
about me than I can even realize and so
going going back to what that comments
are mentioned by the way there was
something that mentioned mentioned in
that story that I thought was really
interesting which is one consideration
that Google is at least playing with
right now is blocking all the ads on
some of these sites if they aren't up to
standards with all of their ads so if
some of the ads are not up to snuff
we're just going to block all the ads
which kind of seems like a nuclear
option to me but at the same time like
this that's that's certainly a way to
get people to fall online yeah I mean
it's kind of like a Walmart says we're
not carrying your stuff it just you can
always switch by the way you don't have
to stick to chrome if for some reason
like look I really love that
publications it has these ads that don't
comply with this standard you really
love site X which is amazing whatever it
may be and you want them to get ad
revenue you can always switch but then
again I don't really see you people a
lot of people complaining on the
consumer side going well this site loads
faster and it's cleaner
and I care versus this is taking forever
I can't click on the thing I'm trying to
click what is this more my hearing right
now right now right I just think that
there is a very strong potential for
Google to get even more control or more
power in this type of situation because
it is by default then they already have
so i don't know like hopefully they do
it right and we'll have to see Brian in
the chat a says I'm sure they would
integrate a pass for their own ads that
would make the most well to be no
kidding their ads comply with that
coalition already yeah so they would get
a pass it's not blocking every ad it's
those that don't adhere tzd
specifications when it comes to write
what isn't it obtrusive or intrusive at
but at the same time it would seem
extremely unlikely that google chrome
would ever block a YouTube ad or a
google search ad that would probably
never ever happen I don't have to comply
though yeah point well it makes them
actually have to reconsider maybe their
ad platform if they don't want to end up
hypocrites hmm that's a very very good
point branching off that Chad TV asks
does Google plan to address the YouTube
monetization as they are the same
company and revenue maybe you want to
jump in on that one I'm not sure they
got to be related right in the sense it
like yeah google does a parent company
alphabet parent above all youtube maybe
they're add structure might have to
change you know i think that you've seen
them increase the mid-roll ads as of
late on both mobile and third party
platforms is that going to have to kind
of like backpedal I'm skeptical if it's
google chrome that's doing it then
google is the one that's in the driver's
seat so if anybody's going to get any
leeway in this situation it's going to
be somebody like youtube because it's
all within the family like I don't think
all the Google executives are going to
get in a room and yell at each other and
say well we're pushing all these other
sites into a corner but you know we're
gonna we're gonna we're gonna get our
only way if those YouTube ads don't have
a problem with the standards though
essentially right you're not getting
like pop ups when you're watching
YouTube it's not any of that stuff you
get a version of pop up sometimes like
while you're watching a video I mean on
the video itself I mean like granted
that that probably does comply with the
standards but you understand what I'm
trying to say here is that
there is a potential of Google to become
a hypocrite of themselves well expanding
beyond that though there's been so much
of the conspiracy concern over what's
going on with the regulation of content
on youtube Nikki monetization practices
and how so many like concurrent
youtubers are there they just claim that
the revenue is just starting to tank and
what the hell's going on with that how
is this all tied together I don't think
they are honestly because I mean YouTube
is allowed to essentially operate
independently even those within Google's
when the strangers things that it didn't
get spun out considering how different
the culture is in YouTube versus Google
from what I've heard I've actually don't
people work there so it's not exactly
this hey we're all one big family is
like no you're this totally different
branch even though Google still owns you
when it comes to this whole issue of
youtubers getting less money what I
understood was a bunch of companies were
afraid of their ads being placed before
really controversial content so
advertisers pull back in general that
led to the amount of money being paid
out to the youtubers to be less right
and that's going to require google or
youtube to somehow figure out how are
these your house your company going to
make sure that how is your ad not going
to be in front of some horrifying piece
of content right if you don't want like
hey it's Kellogg's cornflakes and then
and then we're showing like a monster
truck exploding or something that's
that's pretty tame compared to what they
were I'm trying we're I'm like I think
we all know what we're referring to
without actually going down that and
sure sure but yeah you're describing
that they're two totally different
situations I there is a possibility that
it becomes harder for youtubers to make
money on YouTube with the new chrome
standards but at the same time they do
seem a little bit they'd seem like
separate topics yep yeah hey Bob before
we move on Jr Garcia in the chat he's a
McDonald's you guys want anything yeah
yes what do you take fish fillet I'll
come on I love fish fillet I'm kidding
I'm gonna stand by that forget 20 piece
chicken nuggets double that for me
barbecue sauce yep is this was that nad
yeah wow that was enough to know that's
the way you get the atom there's a
native that I one underwriting I i want
that Jonathan I 359 I want that check
McDonald's Big Mac big back back back I
want that Grand Mac Tessa I'm not
kidding about that I'm like one day I'm
gonna get drunk enough ago that's a good
idea and
happened yet I as you got a shout out in
the chat from Brian Kerrigan Karen Karen
gani says hey I as hello I'm you got fam
thank you nobody loves that for me hey
Ben I'm a fan imagine soggy asks how
long till Facebook does a google and
makes a parent company like alphabet
they are a auditing just a social
network with the f8 initiatives it's a
good question however watchin however
like what really changed when alphabet
was created I mean it was a different
parent structure and I kind of allowed
the like the CEOs have alphabet to be a
little bit more hands-off with Google's
day-to-day you know like they installed
a like a CEO for Google proper but at
the same time Facebook essentially
operates in the same way already they
just haven't renamed it I don't know
something goofy that that's like the
parent company above facebook I think
it's really about the the leaders like
how hands-on they want to be and when it
came to Google they're like well we want
to save the planet and eradicate disease
and be a search engine and then we also
want to have self-driving cars and like
we really are all over the map that
facebook i still think they have some
kind of singular vision as to sell you
add to know everything about you and
it's through VR AR and through but they
would connect people well yeah that's
still a singular vision compared to what
is driving self-driving car have to do
with search ads I'm not really sure just
yet other than it's picking up where you
went it could track you as well I think
it's more likely the facebook which is
kind of quietly itself become a larger
entity without actually rebranding
itself repositioning itself it's a
mission statement is stayed fairly clear
that's the thing i think zuckerberg
really believes in the idea of
connecting people but also make sure
facebook is the way people are being
connected yeah vs how else can we catch
what other things we want to do i could
see them if it's Zuckerberg and he wants
another company he will start another
company got like musk does were just
like I'm just gonna come up with a third
company fourth company yeah the musk
yeah the musca model the musk model is
definitely a different one where he
starts siloed separate companies I would
argue that Facebook Amazon and alphabet
are all very similar and their business
models where they're essentially tech
conglomerates that they include a
bundles of different tech companies
within the companies themselves it's
just alphabet was the most a present or
it's the most node
ssible one because they created the
superstructure of alphabet I things ups
like Bezos that kind of thing if you
want you can want to have an Amazon go
ahead you won't have the Washington Post
go ahead you want to have this but it's
not like they're really connected mmhmm
yeah Matthew gives been a shout out I'll
be chased by Assad giving I as a second
shout out thank you sorry I as is
currently in the lead in the league this
isn't as much a question but i like this
comment is phrasing don says lots of
malware gets spread on legit websites
through their ad company the site
doesn't know and the ad company says
another company responsible we've seen
this recently everyone just points
fingers and the problem is never solved
do I think that possibly this chrome
initiative could start to kind of
whittle that down the point of this was
not related to malware at least that's
what the journal story mentioned it does
not mention malware however I think
Google is in a very good position is in
a better position than a lot of other
tech companies to try to pull some of
those nasty ads out so that would be
great if something like that were to
happen I think there's maybe a
likelihood that it's an inevitability
that would start to just kind of filter
out the riffraff mm-hmm I think the
problem two is is that like what if a
site completely innocent of what was
going on Google ends up like dropping
the hammer on them because they had
malware in one of their ads and then all
of a sudden they lose alt here that'll
wake them up you can't detain you can't
be an absentee site owner that's what's
going on with YouTube right now though
there's lots of innocent casualties
going on after all of this mm-hmm mmhmm
yeah well it's the Internet is very big
and very complicated and it's all based
in algorithms yeah and being able to
push through any of these efforts ends
up resulting in those types of
situations those innocent casualties
because it's just really complicated and
it takes a long time to get it right
youtube always has a lot of growing
pains from the very beginning before the
google days so i think this is just
another thing they got to figure out at
they're going along when they first did
the DMCA takedowns that was being abused
like crazy they figured a way around
this they'll figure a way around this
latest problem i'm pretty sure dmca
takedowns fill me in on that the DMCA
takedown dmca Digital Millennium
Copyright Act oh oh right thank you
thank you
guys come on I just forgot the acronym
as you pull into the lead dhruv Assad
and Yahoo all shout out Ben oh let's
yahoo after my heart let's throw in one
more single question before we close it
out and this is semi related but not
totally related gaming papaya asks why
is Google not supporting Mac OS 10.7
point five anymore I don't know how old
is that what are they up to now TenPoint
12 or something now is it 12 I don't
know I on keep track I'd say it's a guy
know where it's that company go ahead
and call us out in the jab we don't keep
it's uh I don't I don't know the answer
to that specific question so I mean
that's online somewhere I mean remember
when Microsoft had internet explorer for
Mac that was a thing was a big deal and
they're like he never mind doing that
anymore you got drawn line somewhere
maybe the there's some kind of issues
with Mac os10 back then also you can get
a free upgrade anyway not the ones like
work around guys like why are you
bothering to have the old OS unless you
have this mission critical machine you
must run the OS that's really old
there's yeah yeah no reason for a 10.7
machine right now don't sorry about that
except maybe some somewhere around this
office since some of CBS's also where
one's a little dinosaur II entirely
possible I keep one on 10.9 just for
that hmm but that's besides that and
probably information that I don't need
to disclose to the public you heard
nothing yeah pay no attention to the man
behind the curtain alright that's
probably good place to wrap it up let's
call the week let's call it a week hey
before we go we want to mention that
we're gonna try something a little
different this week we've had requests
for extra stuff to listen to I guess you
guys just really love the sound of our
voices yeah so we're going to go ahead
and try to start putting out an extended
edition for the weekend you can opt-in
opt-out of it it's just going to pop up
after the regular four-day week you know
353 minute 59 second podcast feed on
Fridays you'll get the option to

going to pick one of the episodes during
the week that either seem to have the
most interesting content best engagement
most commentary but you'll get the whole
post show that we do here on YouTube in
the audio podcast on stitch
itunes etc etc etc right um I guess
we'll start tomorrow are gonna start
tomorrow okay so we'll see how it goes
