this is a review of the sony hx5v if it
wasn't for tvs like the sony HX 8 50 I
would say that 2012 is shaping up as a
pretty dire year for quality televisions
while we have standouts like the amazing
Panasonic ST 50 the quality level has
been really low this year with Sony's
own HX 750 another missed opportunity
but the company has redeemed itself with
the HX 850 here is a TV that manages to
do LCD really well and for a lot less
than its competitors the HX 850 is an
edge lip TV with local dimming which is
almost as good as the HX 9 to 9 one of
our favourite TVs from last year
styling is identifiably Sony though it
dispenses with the eye-catching lay back
stand and instead goes through this
strange upside-down egg cup that also
looks like one of our trash bins the TV
is again coated with Gorilla Glass which
will interest people out there who still
play the way somehow web services are
fairly standard than the XMB interface
is the same as the last few years the
only change is that Sony has introduced
its own web store called the Sony
Entertainment Network which collects
apps and media downloads together
picture quality on this TV is why you
buy it and the HX 850 is very impressive
black levels are deep and shadow detail
is very subtly rendered colors are a
little blue as is the sony signature but
the picture is bright and involving 3d
replay isn't to the level of the LG
passive TVs but pretty good for an LCD
2500 for the 55 inch this Sony doesn't
come cheap but if you want better
picture quality out of an LCD you're
going to have to pay at least $1,000
more with this TV and the HX 929 which
stays in the 2012 lineup Sony has shown
that it's still a major player in
television
