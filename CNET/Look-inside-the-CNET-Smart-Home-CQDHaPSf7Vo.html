future get ready to find out our new
home has four bedrooms four baths a
walkout basement a three-car garage and
even a backyard with a swimming pool
we're going to use this home as a living
lab to test smart home products under
the conditions they were designed for
we're going to start right here at the
front door and up this deadbolts IQ with
a smart lock no keys needed windows and
blinds that you can program to block out
the Sun when it's warm and open to let
the Sun in when it's cold
our appliance is smart enough to learn
your favorite recipes and even suggest a
few of their own we'll find out when we
replace these with brainy er versions
will put our web-connected washer and
dryer right here does it make sense to
get a text when your clothes are dry
I'll find out
we're going to replace all of these
bulbs and switches with smart lights
that includes motion activated lighting
that syncs up with your home security
system and even color changing bulbs
that sync up with a video game that
you're playing we'll also use our
kitchen to test connected sous-vide
machines wireless charging countertops
and other smart devices designed to
bring the best in technology into your
kitchen and of course we'll be testing
out connected thermostats and other
climate control devices they offer a ton
of potential to save money time and
energy
the smart house comes with an expansive
lawn and an actual garden so I want to
see if those connected garden products
can transform me from a hopeless plant
killer into an actual green thumb
gardener that means taking plant sensors
that connect to my Wi-Fi network and
putting them right here that means
taking automated sprinklers and putting
them right over there maybe we'll even
track down a robot lawn mower there's so
much we plan to do in this house but we
want to hear from you what smart home
tech are you excited to see what future
products do you want to see us try out
here tweet us at seen at smart home and
let us know and be sure to check in
throughout the coming weeks and months
as we turn this house into a smart home
