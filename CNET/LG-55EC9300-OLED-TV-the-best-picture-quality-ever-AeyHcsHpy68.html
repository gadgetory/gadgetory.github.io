and next to me is the very first OLED TV
we've ever reviewed at CNET this is a 55
inch LG 5 v ec 90 300 it's the first
OLED TV to cost less than 5 grand a
specifically it's about three thousand
dollars right now so that's really a
huge deal for this new TV technology
totally different from LCD and Plasma
technology OLED uses organic
light-emitting diodes to create a
picture that really is spectacular we'll
get to that in a little bit but first
let me talk about the style of this set
OLED allows the TV to be extremely thin
when you look at it from the side it
just kind of disappears it's only about
a quarter of an inch thick throughout
most of its body there's a slightly
thicker part in the back that houses
it's off like inputs and the power
supply and the power cable of course you
can't fit that into a quarter inch slice
but all told it's one of the sleekest
looking TVs another futuristic aspect
with this TV is the curve it's a curved
screen not a flat screen you can kind of
see from looking at it from the front
although it really is subtle look at it
from the top or the sides the curve
becomes a lot more obvious it doesn't
have a huge impact on picture quality oh
it does tend to reduce reflections a
little bit so that's a good thing but
there are some geometric distortions as
a trade-off the set also has a really
nice stand it kind of lets the TV float
above it and provides a more curvy
organic shape you can also remove the
stand and wall mount the TV if you want
so all told this is one of the nicest
looking TVs I've ever tested I also
really like the remote control it's a
little bit like a Nintendo Wii mode and
that you hold it and wave it around at
the screen to move the cursor the menu
system has been completely redesigned
this year it's LG's new webOS system
which actually has these large icons
along the bottom here and a really nice
design that overlays what you're
watching it allows you to customize the
screen and also find apps relatively
quickly we actually found it one of the
nicer looking and performing displays
out there for Smart TV it's plenty of
apps included on the Smart TV suite of
course you also get a web browser and
the whole thing is integrated really
nicely with the motion remote like you'd
expect from any high-end TV LG includes
plenty of picture controls you can
adjust the grayscale as well as color
management and there's a full ability to
play around with the smoothing and each
other on this television design of
features are one thing but what really
sets OLED apart is its spectacular
picture quality this OLED set has a
better picture than any plasma or LCD TV
I've ever reviewed this set is capable
of producing perfect black levels which
means that the black is actually
completely black it's as if the screen
is off when it's really on
that can produce insane contrast so when
you're looking at the screen you can see
a really bright area the picture next to
a really dark area of the picture and it
lends more realism and more pop to the
picture than any TV I've ever tested
LG's pictures also characterized by a
good color and solid video processing
although both those aren't quite as good
as some of the best TVs I've tested it
also has excellent viewing angles much
like a plasma so it doesn't wash out
when you see it from either side like a
lot of LCD 50 TVs out there it's also
very good screen uniformity so you're
not gonna see those blocks as you can
see on some LCD TVs so all told again
the best picture quality I've ever
tested anyway that's a quick look at
LG's 55 EC 9300 the first OLED TV we've
ever tested and the very best picture
quality we've ever seen it's CNET I'm
