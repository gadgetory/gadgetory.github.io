hand out candy first of all you're a
horrible human being but the least you
can do is keep a bowl of candy out for
the local monsters as an extra Flair I'm
going to show you how to make it
inexpensive interactive Halloween
decoration that will light up your candy
bowl as people approach your house so
here's what you're going to need you're
going to need a motion-activated flood
light some colored bulbs to put in it
they socket adapter this is just like 23
bucks a box to mount it all on this is a
deluxe $14 craft tissue box it works
perfect for this project but you could
probably go a lot cheaper you can eat a
whole big candy bowl to put the whole
thing in an extension cord couple screws
hopefully just have these around the
house and of course lots of candy so the
first thing we're going to want to do is
to wire up our flood lights so that we
can plug it into our extension cord
right now we're just dealing with bare
wires so we're gonna use the socket
adapter we're going to pop out the
little blades and then wire up each
blade to the bare wire and have this all
ready to plug right in so I'm going to
thread the wire to the back of the
adapter pull it through clamp it down do
the same thing with the other wire
good enough not to get electrocuted
place the blades back in the adapter
finally use this little wedge here to
keep the wire separated no one gets hurt
alright so now this $8 floodlight is a
motion-activated lamp test it out we're
gonna have to plug in our light bulbs I
use these color-changing LED bulbs
because one they don't get hot like
incandescent bulbs will and also they
came with a little handy color-changing
remote control so I can dial in exactly
what spooky color I want to use all
right now it's time to mount the flood
light onto the box we're going to do
this for two reasons one we want the
extra stability the box is going to give
a little platform to raise it up above
the candy we're also going to do this to
conceal all the cables that are inside
the box that we don't exactly want
prying fingers to find
alright so there we go got our nice
light fixture here got the cables inside
concealed now we're really doing this
properly we'd probably paint the box up
a nice black or orange color to make it
thematically appropriate but for the
sake of this demo this is what you're
getting so here we go i got my bowl i
got my light fixture in here first step
is I'm going to plug it in to the
extension cord set it up get it nice and
centered all right now for the fun part
horn in the candy all right come and get
it kids get the name-brand candy got the
good stuff all right and then for the
last part let's adjust these lights down
so that they give the candy a good
spooky glow we're all set
okay let's give this thing a shot see if
it works it works all right so there you
go that's how to make your own monster
detecting candy illuminator a fun simple
project and one that's affordable enough
you're not going to mind if it gets
stolen by vampires</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
