look at the msi ge60 this is one of a
new batch of gaming laptops that we're
seeing that has invidious new generation
of 800 series graphics cards in them
most of those are going to be big 17
inch desktop replacement laptops this
one is a little bit of a nice change
from that it is a I wouldn't say
portable but more normal size 15 inch
laptop and here you don't have the top
top top end of that new nvidia line
that's the eight ATM you've got the 86
cm two steps down that's about as
powerful you can go and kind of a
smaller chance to like this you know
there are their heat concerns power
concerns here you get a good mix of sort
of power and semi portability the reason
why I think the MSI system comes off a
little bit better than some of the other
big gaming laptops that we've seen is
that the design is a little bit cleaner
a little bit nicer it's really got an
excellent keyboard that's actually made
by steelseries which is a maker of
gaming keyboards and they actually have
one of their keyboards on here slightly
scalloped Keys really good touchpad is
big but most of time just going to plug
a mouse in any way so in this particular
guy right here you've got an intel core
i7 cpu you've actually got a DVD Drive
get eight gigs of ram you've got a big
one terabyte non solid-state just a
regular old hard drive and that Nvidia
860 em that new graphics card the nice
thing is you get all that stuff packed
in here for about 1350 you've actually
seen this on sale online for 1299 to me
that's a really good deal for something
that's pretty powerful not super super
top end of the line but you can
certainly play any new or current or
upcoming game it you know medium to
medium high settings at the 15 inch
screens full 1080p resolution i'm dan
akron and that's the msi ge60</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
