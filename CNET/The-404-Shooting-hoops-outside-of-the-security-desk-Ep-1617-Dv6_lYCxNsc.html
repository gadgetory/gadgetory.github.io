Bakalar is not here he's in texas no I'm
not making that up he's away on a
bachelor party so I had to figure out
what to do with this empty studio I'm
you can't see it right now but this
entire studio is empty minus mean a
microphone and a computer and i asked
the end line because I wanted to call up
my best friend in San Francisco lease
work friend kaitlin for track of its hi
how's it going hi how are you I'm good
it's lunch time here yeah I should have
gotten something to eat didn't get
anything to eat I mean I didn't I it's
bagel friday i had a bagel that's that's
good but it's national donut day I know
and last donut day I did a really great
thing I didn't think I could top it this
year so well before we get to that it's
a it's friday june fifth and the first
friday of june apparently is national
donut day it wasn't aware of that until
this morning but last year yeah you did
do something odd with donuts what
exactly was that uh well our editor kent
dared me to eat a what did we end up
calling it a bagel nut I guess and it's
essentially whatever bagel I choose with
cream cheese on both halves with a
glazed donut sandwiched in between it
was delicious it was quite a sight to
see and and it definitely I think it
stopped all of the office work on friday
in san francisco city all came over i
believe NATO's across the way Nate Ralph
who does a lot of reviews if you looked
at all its cnet's Windows 10 coverage
you've seen Nate's work everywhere and
he took a bunch of photos testing out
his sonne and X camera and it became an
animated gif Caitlin eaten the what you
call again the bagel nut big on that
bagel nut yeah yeah i think everyone
feared for my health that day both
mentally and physically um someone else
was nice enough to be like hey I have my
insulin shot available just in case you
like going to die
coma you didn't actually take up that
offer which I thought no I finished the
whole thing because it was delicious so
I'm kind of gross I have totally failed
to introduce who you are and what you do
other than your name so hey so if it
wasn't this far you got a little idea of
how Caitlyn is but Caitlyn who are you
what do you do and why are you here I am
a copy editor for seen it who
occasionally rights random things for
our crave blog which is like pop culture
saitek all kinds of fun stuff okay
that's what you do let's see ya why do I
know you uh mostly because I pestered
and bothered you until we became friends
yeah I still work in the San Francisco
office and here's a boring story so
everyone turned down the volume now and
then pick it back up in by five minutes
so i used to go in at three o'clock in
the afternoon pacific time i would
decide to either get my second cup of
coffee or get a cup of tea a second cup
of coffee if i was like just completely
dragging or cup of tea if i was worked
up and angry and a lot of times i would
be getting tea so the thing about this
is that in the break room in San
Francisco we've got a barista and or
they have a briefs time in New York now
so we was not we did they do I don't
have one anymore I don't have a personal
one that stays over in the first floor
all the time but I get my tea and it
would be scalding hot as it should be
but the thing is I didn't like getting
burned and so I needed a way and he did
a way to kind of kill time so I started
playing a basketball game because
there's a little basketball game behind
the security desk in the San Francisco
office I'm not making any of this up
you're like this is cnet yeah cnet's got
a basketball game right behind security
and at first I was kind of fearful of
doing that because I thought it'd be
annoying you're throwing a basketball
behind their heads right but whatever
they've seen pretty cool so I play a
game of basketball every day while my
tea was cooling and eventually this
person started pestering me but hey
where you going like I'm getting a
coffee like do you want to come so you
showed up and you basically taught me to
play shuffleboard
because it's a shuffleboard table at the
break room near the barista right right
near all the all the milk and the sugar
and stuff on one side of it so basically
i noticed that we'd probably get so
caught up in trash-talking that we would
kind of like turn very quickly and
somebody's trying to get milk into their
coffee and we would probably hurt them
if we weren't paying full attention yeah
I mean there were only a couple spills
it wasn't that bad we never got sued
which is nice and yeah also great also
great yeah we never try to say to the
lake I never really played basketball
and granted it's just like arcade
basketball but I do credit you with my
second place win in the CBS interactive
Olympics for basketball yeah so this was
the I'm am just saying the CBS
interactive Olympics oh yeah while you
guys were all like goofing off on the
west coast we're like doing some serious
serious work we got the writers like
just locked in cages here look like veal
they can barely move and they're right
right and you guys like well nothing's
getting copy edited his Caitlin's
playing basketball that's what's
happened it's very important it was
competitive camaraderie yep that sounds
like a terrible reality show competitive
commodity it's like they're buddies but
they hate each other when they play
sports competitive camaraderie coming to
ABC family I definitely think that show
would be on like TLC or or there'd be
like a I don't know some sort of
relationship twist and it'd be on Bravo
by the way if you do play a basketball
game the basketball game at the San
Francisco office just stay to the left
because the one the right doesn't keep
score there two hoops the right one well
it did max out a lot much room it got
better no no it got better it got better
and they got new basketballs so they're
not all flat which really threw off my
game for a long time but I've almost
broken 100 I got 92 like a couple weeks
ago so yeah my ice cream I'm improving
my high score was 108 and that's at the
flat balls back then because you could
just like breaking everything right and
then in my last
so much easier on my last day I'm like
I'm gonna be my score I got a hundred
and seven and I was like son of them
were probably pissed I was like well on
a seven there 107 is not bad for my last
day in San Francisco's not 108 I didn't
get to break it I'm pretty sure it
should have counted another basket but
whatever you know basketball game behind
the security desk I got no grudge
against you septum wow monstrous grudge
against an inanimate object yeah good
job well you know it subscribe to this
podcast right I believe it yeah I hook
that up I made it happen I should play
back before I was it tweet about it
every time that somebody like beats your
high score not yet I don't know if my
high score was the high score because
after he goes to 100 it just rolls over
yeah and apparently they reset it or
something so I don't know the high
school was like 47 and even if you
scored over that which I did regularly
it's like nope I scores 4763 nope 47 so
maybe it's 247 147 I have no idea maybe
does have an ability to do that so what
we're saying is we're going to do when I
go to san francisco in September I'm
going to make that thing tweet gonna
happen awkward um you just didn't phrase
right I think that story was more than
five minutes sorry Sophie make you tune
back in I apologize for the long long
story because I ended up yammering too
much about basketball anyway we do have
stories today not a lot of text stories
so if you want to tech um sorry go but
there there are some new stuff and I'm
sure this first thing we'll get you
riled up because there's a variety story
saying that James Bond's rights are up
for grabs the license right now is at
Sony it's done pretty damn well out
there but the November sixth Spectre is
going to be the end of the multi-picture
pact between MGM and Sony that's sad you
know gah casino royale quantum solace
and Skyfall so the rights are being
auctioned off do you think Sony should
do everything to keep James Bond or is
there like another studio that you're
like you know would do really well with
this I think why what's going to say
columbia pictures but that's so
I think that Disney should get it what
do you think oh my god could you imagine
a Disney bond that be terrifying
terrifying bad terrifying good yes no
terrifyingly upsetting why do you say
would batting why would that be a good
thing that would be are they own miramax
and didn't miramax do born stuff um I
that's my point i don't know i born
assured ushered in this like serious
wave of shaky cam ok didn't usher it in
but it certainly didn't help it and it
just never SAT well with me I don't like
it it doesn't I don't know um I'm
totally yeah there's some of that in
there's some of that in the Bond movies
but not as much as like the car chases
inborn well I'm totally wrong at
Universal isn't borne identity so forget
that idea don't give them it either so
you she's getting I mean Universal could
use them Universal doesn't yeah i was
doing anyway I mean they've got like the
wolf man does universal also have
transporter right now i will look that
up universal the transport like a thing
they'd have um yeah cuz they're making
this series of films not just the TV
series it's 20 Century Fox oh the
transporter we saw actually came excited
to see that movie well maybe Fox should
get it they just lost they got rid of
Star Wars by selling a look Lucasfilm
sold off everything so sep Star Wars for
episode 4 that is to 20 Century Fox
thanks well they make like two films and
leave it hanging on a I don't know IQ
yeah I don't know I think Sony did
spectacular things with it I think that
um 10 Oh Craigs one of the best bonds we
should you lofty statement you can still
have him there's nothing wrong I mean
own to recast it is if the rights just
move over somewhere else they would be
like well we're gonna reboot this again
they don't have to with Craig being so
successful it sittin like spider-man or
anything yes yeah no no
I'm very close to bond I grew up
watching all the movies with my mom and
dad I have supremely ridiculous thoughts
about who's the best and what types of
things were the I don't know what the
best movies were with the best gadgets
and the villains and all that and I
don't know I'd rather not get too
wrapped up in oh it's gonna go it sold
to universal or disney or yadda yadda
yadda because I just want to enjoy bond
basically don't screw it up I'll be okay
with whoever owns the rights that's why
I find this shocking absolutely shocking
didn't you pick apart like every movie
ever and every decision on every but
James Bond has some kind of like I think
I think it's because it's yeah it's like
my childhood bubble it's I don't know I
like thinking of it in lovely lofty
terms and dissecting it kind of ruins
some of the magic it's like Disneyland
okay you don't go to Disneyland and try
and peek behind the curtain every
instance you get you just enjoy it for
what it is so you're okay with James
Bond just as long as it just has the
regular spy opening that's awesome and a
cool theme song you couldn't care less
what these that's not what I said you
just don't want to know I just said
don't screw it up yeah I don't want to
get involved in the politics of who owns
what where when yes was last time there
was a bad Bond movie the Christmas me
one what wasn't with that Denise watch
what Denise Richards great the one with
the East Richards which took their
Christmas Jones oh come on what what was
it called band line of that movie is
probably one of the best are you
stalling kudamon that long history
Denise Richards Pierce Brosnan hmm
Denise Richards come on I don't remember
the name oh the world is not enough
thank you that didn't really good song
though my garbage remember that at least
oh you don't like that song all right
it's fine it's feel like i'm not gonna
insult you right now i'll do it with
it's fine whatever look at the IMDb
thing I'm noticing that there's these
ads from minions July tenth did you see
that the minions packaging is all over
amazon boxes right now oh really yeah
it's the first time amazon has sold
rights to the boxes and apparently like
kids around the US are kind of like
pissed because they see this minion box
and they're like there's no minions in
here where's my minion yeah it's an
awesome yellow box and it's got minions
all over Zach July tenth the movies
coming they shoulda like included like a
build-your-own minion inside just like a
Twinkie like potato okay yeah or build
like a cardboard minion or I don't know
if they're paying that much for the
rights the box which I can only imagine
is staggering amounts then they should
have like included a minion Wow or if
you buy a kid's toy or you buy something
age-appropriate include a minion no I
change her mind I like the minions to
included in every box I could to see
that for large enough boxes it's totally
done like a minion so that you can put
it on as a costume oh my god I be
adorable how many can that be so so
Amazon me minion cats are there what the
kit all cats inside the boxes oh my gosh
I haven't ever heard of that yes it's
gonna be a thing because another thing
the tumblr Yeah right like just leave
your phone yeah it should be a tumblr it
probably is cat minions just you have
minions and their cats constantly but
that's the first time Amazon's done that
I could see that doing really well
because when you see this yellow box
you're like oh look oh yeah that movie's
coming up but then again I amazon
sometimes do some really weird stuff I
know with the kindle of fire or the
kindle readers they actually had special
kindle boxes which basically just said
steal me if you see me what sitting down
because it actually had the labeling up
it's a kindle on it it wasn't like a
regular plain box it's a special box
this is a long time ago this is back
like when the kindle was just not ugly
oh sorry is it the second gen 1 you know
was like 350 bucks and had a keyboard
exactly it elicited that reaction to by
the masses all right but what it's at
kindle
and you across 350 bucks it might as
well say steal me back then I mean still
a kindle this was a long time ago this
is like this is like the days of 3g okay
3g was like that the new hotness back
then oh my goodness 3g yeah and you were
it was it was before retina display was
even like a twinkle in his eye okay was
a long time ago just a little after the
dinosaurs roamed the earth and just like
before ultrabook OC well yeah I
obviously wouldn't remember that far
back yeah Caitlin at the San Francisco
office is the resident um young person
actually no no there are quite a few who
are younger than me they brought in more
they brought it but they just like have
you had a bus well I mean I guess I
don't know you getting a lot of inner
workings of cnet by the way so anybody
is super like enthrall the cnet you're
like a super fan boy dan graziano you
should really listen to the episode
every ball we were doing we can't call
him out like that we've had Dan Graziano
on this show he sits next to me in the
office he's off today and if he's
listening to this stop listen to this go
do something fun go do something else
didn't he have time off or something
isn't he that's in a way it took pto and
he never takes pto that's insane yeah I
know he was ordered to take with you
that's the thing well that's fair yeah
from home it wasn't from the office or
anything we were like we were like
sticking him yet and Dan if you don't
know Dan Graziano he is one of the folks
that is a lot of the wearable reviews
and he does a lot how to stuff and we do
mock him sometimes for his arm hair and
his pictures of things he does a good
job hiding that yeah that's we had a
long discussion with Scott Stein about
arm hair in photos and man it's real
rough real rough it's not just the hair
but photos of the hair and the wearables
like you guys need a cute girl to start
modeling those wearables over there
because it is
man I don't know why we don't have a
mannequin or something I don't know like
just there's a little weird oh you can
get a real enough looking hand right and
that's awkward now we're going somewhere
awkward and speaking of awkward listen
let's take a break real quick because we
got to pay the bills we got a sponsor
today let's take a second and talk a
little bit about cars now did you know

about any more awkward real arms in the
office those inner arms race joke about
that done yet that there should be mmm I
don't think there is we'll work on it I
think I'm just gonna leave that the hell
alone that's that's enough of that I'm
gonna tell me that's enough of that me
so I saw some news about the Aquaman
movie which I'm sure you accept yeah
that James Wan is attached to direct the
movie and I I know him from saw I didn't
know that he did furious bass inferior 7
and a whole bunch of that was why I yeah
that's why I recognized the name he did
the conjuring which I saw which was
alright conjuring 2 I haven't seen
insidious I thought was alright so he
does a lot of like kind of wait he did
the original insidious Sidious in the
city is chapter 2 yeah it was directly
original was the only one I saw yeah and
so it stops pretty dark you know and
it's kind of disturbing so he's the guy
attached to but I guess when we saw the
Aquaman pictures those two were also
very dark didn't we see that Jason Momoa
or whatever you're absolutely right I'm
just realizing it's pretty pretty de
bursac Schneider you know like yeah
remove all the color do you saturate huh
is that great I'm you're like away from
the microphones hidden hey you want
strong you want strong feelings about
something I have some strong feelings
about Schneider look look at this night
or just a second I'm just realizing that
Jason Juan might fit in in the style of
Snyder because it's got like okay you
got this darkness about it and look at
the batman/superman trailers got you
know Superman Batman trailer looks so
fun no doesn't look fun at all it looks
like you're gonna watch something really
disturbing what's the word for this how
would you describe those trailers you've
seen them already devoid of color and
where what are you going for here um I
don't say there were dark grim and
gritty but that's kind of what it is it
just seems that is basically the board
of humor that's what it seems like it's
without any like okay with there's a
there's a Batman and there's a alien we
know it's silly its ok but it doesn't
seem to be any it seems like it takes
stuff really seriously and I don't know
I mean yeah you have growling Ben
Affleck tell me do you bleed like what
well that let in all fairness to Ben
Affleck he asks everybody that it's a
very hard question
it's his new tagline remember when he
said that in Good Will Hunting I thought
that was a weird line but he did say it
uh it just it does seem like it takes
itself very seriously it birds on parody
yeah it's so serious but yeah Jason one
who I think can do a decent job with
Aquaman although that's a phrase I don't
think I'll ever say again can I do a
decent job with alchemy nice to read the
books and I mean you can try to make him
cool as anything you got a-you got this
person who can control or at least talk
to see life and there's some monstrous
things in the sea and you think that'd
be a really cool power to have but he's
constantly made fun of because he's got
a call to Aquaman mean was aqua like
okay what why are we gonna call him
water man see man no don't like what are
you gonna call it well Marvel guys have
one they call them to calm the
Submariner that's not better it's not
worse it's about this it's a worse
mouthful that's what if I said the
Submariner is gonna have a movie would
you be like really that guy if I said to
you the Aquaman is gonna have a movie
more likely to say really Aquaman um
okay are you bi you think that James Wan
could do a good job with this I think
that his dark pedigree I guess could
lend itself very well to like you said
the Snyder style I think it'll be just
as grimy as that photo we saw of Khal
Drogo I actually got which I will always
call him not Jason Momoa didn't you do
like a two-minute recap on Game of
Thrones yeah i did call is dead spoiler
alert if you haven't finished the first
season you're behind um which is so sad
because he was spectacular I did I did a
two minute like recap super quick top
like seven characters in the game of
thrones you
verse and where they were at the
beginning of this current season is I've
watched the first three episodes of Game
of Thrones and I was like years ago and
then I didn't wanna learn contra Khal
Drogo days I didn't watch anything until
the 2-minute recap you did and then I've
watched like the last man you were so
lost oh no I like I really enjoy not
knowing what the hell is going on
because it makes oh that's how those of
us who keep up with the show also feel
it just makes me pay attention a lot
because normally like you know if I've
watching a movie or a TV show at my home
I always have no the screen up I'm like
reading other things I'm kind of paying
attention a half paying attention and it
can follow your stories but since all
these events are happening I'm like wait
do they not have they never met before
if their seeming like the number may be
more than is it reveal I wonder what's
happening so I don't ask any of these
questions out loud I never look up the
answers I'm just like hoping that like
in two years i'll figure out what that
yeah yeah because it'll discover what
happened oh I finally was you know
previously in Game of Thrones I think oh
that's what that was okay i only get it
do you also do watch them with the
closed captioning on yes you watch the
episode that it's so important yeah it's
it's not not just because of their
accents and weirdness but like the
captions you got it I don't know I think
it really helps with comprehension
because it also when they list character
names you're like oh that's okay now i
remember who that is cuz you haven't
seen them in five episodes you're like
oh estes what's going on yep i are you
talking to them the captions don't work
in the recap in the beginning on HBO now
right Joe so no they don't there's no
damn chickens in there I've watching
this I'm like glued to the screen I'm
like wait what are they saying that here
what wait what was that that was no
really imply somebody put the captions
on this part so HBO ppv never heard a
better argument for marathoning Game of
Thrones just to get through the preview
don't forget you know yeah so you don't
forget what's happening um I I will
admit i am quite a few episodes behind
right now and i'm not sure if I want a
marathon this weekend or just marathon
into the finale
next next weekend that's about the 14th
I would know that that was a subtle
subtle plug which I'm making very
obvious now for net picks go to cnet.com
/ epics that is not a sponsor I'm being
a shell about my own work here and I
mean if you can't hear where can you if
you can't what if you can't show your
own stuff here where can I just do it
outside with a sandwich board most the
time I mean I have loved working out Hey
look the ratings are good numbers are
good so I have any way to track how many
visitors come from your sandwich board
which I'd be really interested it has a
special URL it's slashing that pic /
sandwich you know oh but don't go there
it doesn't actually go anywhere not yet
anyway course if you're listening fix
that please um getting very integrated
today on the show what do I have is
number three on today's lineup 24
without Kiefer Sutherland what TVLine
confirms a spin-off of 24 is coming and
that's crap and the idea is this would
star a younger protagonist not Jack
Bauer is not to be a young Jack Bauer
Jack might actually appear on this show
it's gonna start at the series terrible
it's a limited series when it starts 02
miniseries if this is a horrible idea
okay why why is 24 tied to Jack Bauer
have you heard gave her the Sutherlands
voice before yes oh my god no one can do
that no it's so iconic ok Iyaz was
actually the one who got me into
watching 24 I had friend in high school
who loved ate watched every episode I
just could never really get into it so
you actually got me into watching it all
I'm still currently in the middle of
season four or five I don't know
something like that and oh my god I
can't picture anyone trying to do what
Jack Bauer does well the American bond
how you gonna spin off that really
really well what if it's done like like
the kings
like that good you got a good spy young
he watched easement that's completely
different I was a completely different
did you just compare 24 to the Kingsmen
not every day imma seems to have a
successful youth like spy character if
you're gonna have a American bond or
close to it you want a younger person
you have to pull this off really well
and that did it actually surprisingly
well so watch like twice now and it's I
love that movie a movie is great it's
way better than has any right to be okay
that movie could be bad I went into and
not expecting it to be that good at all
it was spectacular I saw no trailers the
only thing I saw was a lady with the
with the sharp feet or legs I said she
has like night like she has swords for I
guess the lower extremities below the
knee and all I saw it was like her
flying through the air on bus ads that's
the only thing I knew about this movie
and I was like I I mean I had seen the
trailers and samuel l jackson acting
ridiculous and you kind of go into it
being like oh yeah haha is gonna be a
ridiculous pre-summer crazy movie and
you come out of it you're like holy cow
that was mind-blowingly awesome let's
get back to devour 24 right after
another break that's right we got
another sponsor we'll be right back so

can't stand and that's going to the post

that anymore because there's stamps.com

me that a spin-off would fail couldn't
they find an actor or can they not write
a story good enough that you would be
happy thing it'll fail I'm just saying
that it's really upsetting they would
even consider getting rid of Kieffer
isn't again a little old he can't dude
he's gonna be like Donald Sutherland
running good listen Kiefer Sutherland is
ageless he's like Sean Connery it does
not matter how old he is he will always
be a badass no Sean Connery like he Sean
Connery's like canna reeves they both
like maxed out there done aging excuse
me kena Reeves does not eight okay I was
like Sunderland and Sutherland does AG
parties a lot and it's visible silence
mmm-hmm he ages a little bit more than
the regular ageless people then but yeah
he might be I like he's stopped yeah I
feel like he stopped aging and he's
timeless and if some voice doesn't age
so who cares this is dad stopped aging
Donald saw the moon's look like is it
been a thousand for what 30 years now
he's
the same forever yeah so so obviously
he's got good genes it'll be fine just
let him keep going you ever see that
video of Sutherland Kiefer Sutherland at
Cross bodying a Christmas tree what
there's a video of Kiefer Sutherland who
is dis blasted out of his mind and
somebody just like says some offhanded
comments to him and he decides to do a
flying crossbody block on a tree a
Christmas tree that's like in a lobby of
a hotel it's one of the best videos ever
on the internet to see keep ourselves
I'm like all right and in this boom just
seem flying I'm gonna have to find a
link oh now I'm totally stoked yeah yeah
so yeah I guess as long as you share
that I'm totally excited to watch that
later I mean I can't remember exactly
what it does do it's insane but i hope
i've watched 24 for a bunch of season
that's a about five or six seasons and
then I got a little bit bored with the
format because I mean after episode 12
spoiler they find the bad guy least you
think is the bad guy and then like oh no
no wait he's the second level bad guy
he's just the front guy he's only the
second level bad guy but he'd be the bad
guy if we didn't get renewed for the
other half of the season but we wanted
to make sure that you had a satisfying
ending uh that's like every season
though so like I wish they'd which box
is like yeah we'll give you twenty two
episodes 24 episodes as I said this I
don't know to tell you I'm a really big
fan of formulaic television and that
sounds tear my say but I don't anymore I
love it I love shows that follow that
predictable pattern I love crime shows
you have no idea how depressed I was
four days that CSI is over days was I'm
still upset about hundred an eighty
episodes of that on hulu did you finish
them all there's all of the episodes on
hulu okay and no I've not finished them
all so you got that to watch I look
forward to yeah but I mean I've seen all
of them over the course of my lifetime
it doesn't make me any sadder that it's
ending by the way if you want to know
more procedural shows almost anything on
USA every show follows the same pattern
i'm not saying as each other but they
are pretty similar Royal Pains is
exactly every episode I just started I
am it's exactly
like suits is good I haven't seen suit
see it says really good dialogue formula
though in the beginning I guess I
haven't really watched it lately does it
follow the point um uh yeah more or less
I best thing about USA shows they got
really good dialogue I won't like I mean
it's not just us a like it's us a
special common things like the glades on
A&amp;amp;E was great psych was one of the best
comedies ever on television um what else
burn notice I enjoyed I enjoyed it until
i saw one image on the internet at every
episode of Burn Notice ever and then I
read it through and I like damn it
that's right yeah that's every episode
dang I have no reason to watch this
other than the last episode which I know
is on netflix somewhere so I'll watch it
and go oh it's just so nice to watch
formulae television like it just it just
completes itself so nice if the office
today I've been marathoning numbers love
numbers the CBS show yeah disclaimer CBS
owns seen it oh yeah but they didn't
like this is just my own personal
opinion like I like numbers I've tried
watching mostly well and it was just it
was it got so bad cuz just the leaps the
logical leap that it would make was akin
to Batman in 1966 it was just like
you're kidding me with this it was like
really bad Riddler stuff I just was so
so easy to watch though you know yes
it's easy to watch that's why I love
watch lifetime movies they're really
easy to watch oh my god can we talk
about the will ferrell Kristen Wiig
project coming out oh it's funny I said
you the Lincoln I don't know anything
about it so tell us about that movie oh
I thought you knew about it that's what
you sent it to me um they had kind of
joked about making and creating and
starring in a lifetime to movie together
and then a billboard suddenly appeared
in LA saying that it'll air what June
twentieth or something like that June
twentieth again reduction it's called
yeah and I mean it I think
kind of still thinks it's a joke like
this can't really be happening right um
I think it was a wasn't it an April
Fool's Day joke or something like that I
don't know I found news of the Lifetime
movie made the rounds in April Farrell
was upset the top secret project was
revealed and released a statement saying
it had been cancelled it said we are
deeply disappointed that our plan top
secret project was made public Kristin
and I have decided it is then the best
interest for everyone to forgo the
project entirely and we thank lifetime
and all the people who were ready to
help us make this film but now there's a
billboard what is happening there's the
plot here from e w in April wigan
Farrell stars a married couple who house
a pregnant woman 90210 is jessica lon
des in an attempt to adopt her child in
the process the scituate situation
spirals dangerously out of control I
mean oh who doesn't want to high stakes
dramatic thriller I really hope it's
real it says saturday jun 20th is
supposed to be the day sunday the birth
sunday sunday sunday sunday come on mmm
guy era lifetime movies on a sunday well
the birth of a plan gone wrong is the
tagline oh god it's gonna be so good
that's gotta be amazing i know that the
lifetime did a Saved by the Bell
unauthorized movie which was horrible
like it was I mean horrible like as in
not so bad you enjoyed it it was just
that not quite horrible enough to be
enjoyed all right yeah i mean that's
that's the real pole of Lifetime movies
is that they're just laughable and my
favorite thing is always seeing actors
in roles who are trying to break
typecasting that was always my favorite
I mean I think that's why even if
especially if this actually airs it's
going to be spectacular because you know
the two of them are gonna be so
seriously dedicated to their roles
they're not going to be making jokes or
anything it's going to be spectacular
satire as long as it's in like sharknado
if this is straight on done like I spawn
drama and they just think it's I think
it's going to be full-on drama done and
that I think to these guys the big joke
and that would be hilarious that there's
a 90 minute I'll be so good piece of art
out there
and I can't wait for that I hope this is
real it's only we'll find out a couple
weeks but yeah this is that it's a
Saturday jun 24 the poster says sunday
we supposed oh is that way it's not
gonna be real cuz the posters is sunday
june 20th but sunday is the 21st it's
Father's Day in case anyone wants to
remember to get a card now you should do
that um oh that's why it's not gonna be
real isn't it it will find out we'll
find out soon enough it'll be sunday
june 20th next year damn it we'll never
know ever until two weeks from now yeah
yeah okay ever ever until 15 ever for
two weeks yeah I mean that's a long time
two weeks I mean we're gonna forget all
about this project and you will forget
and it will hopefully find it on some
kind of on demand service somewhere so
we can watch live ever yet have you seen
the whole Marvel phase 2 thing on
Netflix what do you mean like all the
shows that are coming yeah horo
Hollywood had this insider piece about
what's coming and phase tube Netflix
shows plans to 23 netflix series a year
phase two supposed to have defenders in
2017 de Deauville season 2 in 2016 they
said that electra is really happening as
a spin-off of daredevil but then there's
a whole bunch of maybes coming they
Marvel's 20 good I just have a lot of
questions I mean there have there's been
talks of okay well i made a timeline
right of how you could watch all the TV
shows and all the movies in a correct
ish order of not necessarily air date
but to just get the whole stories and
there's a lot there is a lot of netflix
properties the question for me is is
that as long as netflix TV and film are
run separately how much crossover can we
really expect to continue well there are
certain actors who have deals where they
can be in multiple shows not a silly
movies another rosario dawson is the
one they were calling her like the Nick
the netflix Marvel Universe has found
its Nick Fury and I was like oh there's
a nick fury character and that headline
meant they had this character that can
move from one story to the next and was
Dawson's character in daredevil so
there's a lot of these contracts that
are being written for the Marvel stuff
on netflix in particular are supposed to
be open to allow people to have this
movement within the universe and these
stories are supposed to tie together so
you're not gonna have a hell a lot of
movie tie-ins but apparently there's a
big push to get dr. strange all the
defenders as a cameo real short Benedict
Cumberbatch I think they could get it as
long as they just bring the defenders
like on the set of the movie is like
just mere right to say hi what do you
stand there stand the background did you
just stay there you can't talk you're
getting a coffee just not you better you
have Cumberbatch in your show you're
gonna want him to do something he
doesn't have to do much I mean he's such
a big draw though they're a crowd that
wouldn't normally watch such a thing
that'd be that'd be really fun to see
that I think is the right casting for
dr. strange if I haven't said that
because that character can be really
great yeah there is not I mean is is
eccentric and odd and it's about magic
and it's it I mean it's a stretch just a
character itself is a stretch its dr.
strange but the the name is just I mean
DC's got dr. fate let's not talk about
that yet he's got an awesome helmet uh
anyways wow it does if you can you can
if you watch this show would you look at
the waveforms you'll see that at 40
seconds in that there's actually the
form of dr. fates helmet in the waveform
don't don't actually do that i'm lying i
have no idea that's the case if it's
that way I'd be freaking awesome though
innit moving on so Marvel's also the
story from her Hollywood also had that
Marvel's toying around with having the
punisher blade and ghost writer either
on these shows within like cameos with
the defenders or their own series at
this point you think those guys would
work on TV I'm sorry you said Punisher
and I got really distracted thinking
about Thomas Jane yes and where he is
now so you think so
where is you know I was like to the
punisher he was the what is he doing now
it was the second Punisher the first one
was Dolph Lundgren which nobody doesn't
know that happened that so happened and
then there was Thomas Jane and then
there was the third one with war zone
whose name I have no idea what it is but
that movie was just amazing it was like
80 s violent did you watch it no oh you
gotta watch it is that the body counts
like through the roof it's but that's as
far as you can go you can only kill like
so many bad guys because the show's get
a little bit you know blame after a
while you can't have 12 hours of
shootings can you I mean probably good I
don't think ghost rider would work I
think the CG would look unless they're
printing a lot of money in it ghost
writer is a hard one if you don't know
anything about ghost writer he is a guy
whose face melts and he's like a flaming
skull riding a motorcycle that has
flames four wheels wait you talked about
the Nicolas Cage ghostwriter I don't
that Ghost Rider the characters in
general what his look is this character
the flaming skull in the flaming bike of
the flaming wheel Italy will always
associate him with Nic Cage don't does
the movies don't don't do that to go
struck a bit that's not me to movies I
zanotti that they did that is not fair
to ghost rider at all I mean ghost rider
on film will always be in a cage just
like blade will always be Wesley Snipes
I'm sure they could get wesley snipes
hes not doing anything is he probably
not i'd probably be really good then I'd
watch that that would be a decent thing
but I don't know so I guess Marvel has
the rights back from new line cinema's
that would happens that's who did blade
to new line even exist I don't know I
guess they bought back a bunch of the
rights to everybody else but Punisher I
don't think would work other than one
offs Ghost Rider do the penance penance
stare with people that's a little bit I
think blade I yeah I mean out of those
three I think blade would be the best I
definitely watch that I mean I don't
know a vampire slaying show with the
character's name is because of the B
could never work you know just saying I
think it'd be great
as long as they don't bring specially if
it was like a jade wesley snipes be
awesome as long as they don't bring back
Stephen Dorff who was like the least
intimidating he was a least intimidating
bad guy in the history of film okay you
like aren't you one of those like a
little fox over there right I'll you
were your bad guy yeah you're supposed
to be intimidating to blade you're gonna
you're gonna kill blade Wesley Snipes
that's what you're gonna do ok good luck
taking on the demolition man you got ok
you know that Stephen Dorff no don't
please don't ever come back she put
Stephen Dorff and Nic Cage put him away
just keep him out of the moral universe
poor Nick Cage it was pretty good and
kick ass though yeah I think yeah he got
to do what he's always wanted to do
which is be Adam West but yes and you
know his name is based on luke cage
right oh that makes sense ding such a
comic book fan he didn't want to get
known by his he didn't want to be
associated with his family yes well
that's the first thing he didn't want to
get roles based on his famous man family
 he's a Coppola and yet on the cage
because he's a comic book fan Luke Cage
was the inspiration for his name which
is even weirder because maybe he should
show up in one of these Marvel shows
it's just like a guy may be over I mean
I'm sure he's like trying yeah I don't
know if he's that big a fan I'm sure
he's tried he did try it was called
ghost writer that's why he was there is
he obviously wanted to badly be in a
marvel comic movie this is gonna be
great and he's like let's roll it was
like no that movie was so bad i fell
asleep during it and i was drinking
heavily while watching it why i've drank
haunted i drank heavily through a lot of
movies and ghost rider could not keep my
attention cuz it just was so bad but I
that was that was a long time ago in a
different Marvel Cinematic Universe so
maybe it'll be better and hopefully Nick
Cage and stephen dorff if you are
listening to this we have an email
address so let us know the 404 cnet com
and you could say that we suck
well I do you didn't Caitlin you didn't
trash him did you know I enjoy his
movies on a certain level I enjoy his
movies too Ghost Rider just wasn't it's
on the continuum of enjoyment it's
unlike far on the left and the left
meaning the bad side Wow anyway I just
they made a blade TV series who did it
existed okay blade TV series American
live-action TV show existed okay it
premiered on spike TV in 2006 and you
remember this well I thought I was crazy
for remembering it so I looked it up and
I'm not as crazy as I thought I was cuz
it did exist questionable it was
actually written hey it was written by
David s Goyer I'm pretty sure he wrote
he wrote the blade trilogy obviously but
he also did he worked on a dark knight
batman trilogy i want to say i just saw
a terrible movie with his name attached
to it i'm gonna find it because it was
just a miserable piece of garbage and it
was like on netflix oh you know what it
is kickboxer to David s Goyer the guy
that did blade the series Batman Begins
the screenplays also he worked on Batman
vs Superman too I believe Dark Knight
Rises man of steel you did man of steel
oh man no not good um okay Constantine
the latest series ghostwriters beard of
vengeance yeah so gory you got your hits
and you got your missus uh yeah yeah but
I did see kickboxer too i try to watch
it um I was only trying to pick a movie
to watch I'll try kickboxer too because
it has the guy from step by step in it
the guy used to live in the van and nope
never seen it nope if you're old enough
to know tgif it was step by step was
basically a modern day well at the time
Brady Bunch kind of show mixed family
and there was a oh no yeah no yes okay
yes and there was like cousin Cody's
here my brain was thinking cousin Cody's
hehe lives in a van outside and that fun
he's fun Cody
so Cody was like a martial artist but
the guy the actual actor was martial
artist who did kickboxer to when I don't
know if he did three but he was in the
movie and I tried to watch it and it I
said David s Goyer like oh boy I got to
really try to watch this four minutes
later I turned it off so it it's not a
very good four minutes hmm at all who's
the mom and step by step Suzanne Somers
okay thank you why oh i just--that's
well my brain got stuck on Suzanne
Somers Patrick Duffy oh yeah yeah yeah
one of the kids oh yeah I used to see a
lot of reruns of that I saw when I was
in college back when I was young I
thought her gonna read the first time on
ABC and that was many many years ago
anyway have you seen the bloomberg
article saying that finishing your
emails with best is just wrong oh I do
not like when people do that that's too
bad because I do it all the time so it
just sounds very sassy you think it's
sassy best well if you if you say you
read it like that how do you read it
best if you say it how do you how do you
read it best why are you saying best
it's more like my best to you but you're
not saying that you're just saying best
that's like saying I told you so I mean
the word so replaces a hell of a lot of
words you know if I yell happy birthday
to you and I'm not actually saying I
hope you have a happy birthday saying
happy birthday it's a shorthand no no
those are terrible examples if I say so
I'm not saying I told you so no no I'm
saying the phrase I'm changing the
subject I'm saying I'm saying that the
phrase I told you so the word so
replaces a ton of stuff right there good
what I mean so what you're saying is
you're using best as a placeholder
because you don't want to write out what
you're saying apparently you wrote this
article of Bloomberg because what they
have they did if you're right if you're
writing best you you're ending emails
were wrong they had an business
etiquette coach barbara pachter and she
said that's terrible it's a hierarchy of
closings you can't use warmest regards
too effusive banks is fine but it's
often used when there's no gratitude
necessary sincerely is just fake how
sincere do you really feel about sending
along those attached files Cheers they
say is it leadest unless you're British
because it makes you look like you're
citing the best is benign they say
others have called a charmless palette
palette and personal or abrupt so what
do you use then as a closing um it
depends who I'm talking to usually I use
thanks if if if and only if I've asked
for something or they've given me
information that I needed so i use it
when it's appropriate i'll be like
thanks but more often than not when i'm
sending like interoffice emails i don't
sign anything at the end because you can
see that the email came from me and I've
written what I need want have to say and
you can pretty much figure out the rest
from there yeah what I'm sending like a
cold email to find out more contacts
about certain sites or whatever i'll use
best at the end just because it is
benign it is tame and there's no way on
earth i guess only for Caitlyn though
there's somebody takes it badly best
would you just don't get it I guess it's
it's the fact that it cannot be misread
is if you if you're right thanks I guess
I only miss read it there's like thanks
in advance I used to write but I thought
that's too presumptuous like it video is
this you'll do it for sure I mean let's
just a friend of mine then like I really
do mean nothing here's a thanks Anna
baby ya know you'll do it but like when
it comes to like hey I need to find out
some information about this product let
me know about it but the first email has
to have some kind of ending like its
formal and that's when I use thanks if
I'm asking for information or materials
i'll say thank you CP like that's I
don't know that's how you read it thank
you that's like thanks well I just right
thanks there's no ! or anything thanks
period will be like thanks comma CP yeah
just an easy number to agree Z through
the signup should be nothing
have no sign so much easier because
that's not the way conversations happen
on email like I continued I can see that
like anytime I see a text that has like
somebody's name at the end of it they're
like here's a message the car is parked
over here you know love dad it's like
you you don't need to do that you know I
can see it's coming from your phone yeah
and it's conversate there's nothing that
says this conversation has oh yeah my
grandma definitely does that but it's my
grandma it's adorable like that's
different okay well yeah they fall into
different formalities so this idea of
sending without a closing I always
thought was that was somewhat rude to
not have that or to have that terrible
signature we like here's my name here's
my title here my 18 phone numbers email
addresses websites and Twitter handles
and like that looks pretentious without
just having hey something before it say
like I get it if you're making late if
you're writing like a cold email to a
contact or making a request then yeah
having all of your information at the
bottom makes a lot of sense cuz then
they can choose how they want to reach
out to you in response that's fine i
guess i was like what if you're sending
an inner office email I don't need to
see your website twitter handle office
number cell phone number and office
address I know where you work it's three
cubicles down somebody in particular
apparently at the office that the
cubicle Stan would be nobody cuz there's
only two cubicles down unless you're
going one and over so it's you Nate no
sorry oh yeah I was like the Simpsons
Kang and kodos they will say end
communication like I just thought that's
the way to end it you can't put that in
any way oh well you can it just it won't
go over well I mean you thought best was
bad i think end communication would be
worse or like that end or go to hell and
go to hell might be worse than best
fiend over and they gonna that's a good
one start going with that I'll allow it
sure my next email out to everyone they
were like okay and seen the end there
actually they're made and made a gift
there I saw a really even better why
don't why
I don't people and their emails with
animated gifts that would be my favorite
that's what you do oh that's why I like
it that's the way you look that's how I
like my own emails that's yeah that
makes a lot of sense that's why you suck
at emails maybe because you're looking
at the septa stepping on the line here
that you did your own it's gonna be
insulting I'm going to continue to step
on your mind that's ridiculous that
you're spending all your time in the
sent email section of gmail that's what
you're doing you're just seeing your own
emails you look a look are there any
other sections the inbox Getty what well
send me emails I guess not yeah bye sir
remember that if you want to get up
Caitlin's attention animated gifts yes
gifts gifts gifts gifts not gifts gifts
gifts preferably ones from like happy
ending that's a great there's those
provide I was a television show that
that is she's not referring to the
Messiah so be aware that there was a
television show and ABC's short-lived
program with my sorry bed I did mean the
TV show just look at all sorry cats
anything that has a cat in it it's also
winning mm-hmm oh you still use winning
don't you how i met your mother this
great great choice but nothing from step
by step hmm I mean you can but you're
just like what is this what does this
mean oh there's Academy okay good yeah
perfect all right let's talk about this
real quick I saw something on the
huffington post and it was the story
about the headline read are selfies
influencing where we choose to go on
vacation and right there I'm like okay
fine you know what you got a good
headline I'm gonna take a look at this
story and it's talking about how certain
hotels there's one in particular in
Paris that'll send you around in a
chauffeured luxury car that has Wi-Fi
and it'll take you to the most popular
tourist attractions so you can take your
pictures and you can have an awesome
social media feed Wow
have you ever thought about taking a
vacation solely based on the idea of
this this is going to get me a couple
more followers I I think I'm in the
wrong generation um a lot of my friends
are always always on Instagram and
Facebook and liking sharing critiquing
always judging other people selfies and
photos and I take very few and when I do
take pictures and put them on Instagram
they're usually like a beer so I don't
know if I'd be influenced by how many
likes I'm getting more than what good
beer they have it said destination so
this is a really weird concept for me to
think about yeah I know social media
blah blah blah but I couldn't see but I
for doing this is gonna be the best I
can't wait to get a picture of me in
front of this stuff that's another thing
I usually never am in my own photos like
okay I'll take pictures of stuff or
other things or other people but hardly
ever I'm like hey look it's me in front
of something like well I mean there's
something to be said for putting
yourself in the photo if you want to
remember you being there with a certain
person or at a certain place but not
selfie style like if I take a picture of
me in front of the Eiffel Tower I'm
gonna ask my friend or travel companion
to take it so that you can get me with
the tower and probably my cute outfit
like I'm not gonna just not going to
just shoulders up and get the tip of the
tower that that would just be ridiculous
yeah so I I don't see the point in
taking pictures of landmarks by itself
either by the way as far as I'm
concerned every picture of everything
has been done so i don't need pictures
up like oh if there's a leaning tower or
like here here's somebody pushing the
leaning tower up like i don't need to be
the guy doing that oh I I dream of
someday taking a leaning tower picture I
definitely want one of those do you have
your
special pose in mind um I i I'm not
going anytime soon like I'll think about
it but I totally want one you know
there's a leading one are you maybe
whatever it's called the Leaning Tower
of Pisa yeah well lame really lame
speaking of lame I was totally lame I
totally necessary it in tourism I went
to Chicago a while ago when to the
Willis Tower we just me known as a Sears
Tower and mm-hmm you take this picture
like on the ground floor with this green
screen and then they let you go up to
the to the observer of survey shun deck
so then you could have you take all the
pictures you want but you don't get to
have any professional photos up there
because for some reason they don't want
to get I guess either flashes are like
bad weather behind you or whatever so
every like photo you see of people at
Willis Tower unless it's like from their
own iphone that beautiful image is
usually a green screen image what I
think is so I hate that so weird it's
like I was at like I'm in the building
Kate we just could you not so can you
like take a selfie when you're up at the
top yeah you can take pictures over
there but I mean it's it's very hard to
get a nice clear image if you've ever
tried to take pictures where you're lit
well and there's a city behind you with
a piece of glass it's a nightmare so
it's generally very difficult to put
together so I could see why they would
do that in one respect but I just
thought it was so lame because I have
this picture max my mom has it's on the
fridge of me and my brother and I'm like
we were on the first floor that's before
we end up the elevator that's it she's
like it looks like you're there but is a
lie I think that whole thing and I'm
really glad it would make sure he's a
lie I'm glad it wasn't wearing green
that day cuz my son it's a great that's
a great tourist tip my son wore a shirt
that had green lettering on it and we
went to the Avengers then we went to the
Avengers station thing in Times Square
so he goes to this picture and then I
said look at the picture back and I'm
like wait a second he doesn't have blue
letters it's it's actually it's
see-through it just looks blue
thankfully there wasn't anything
terribly behind him so it would look
like movie bizarre but if you want to be
a floating head where took like all
green at Willis Tower or vendor station
whatever because it's gonna be that kind
of fake tourism I don't like we should
just get a picture of the view and dress
like the community human but in all
green I would rather get like a really
good picture of the view from the tower
that community the TV show like yeah the
community human is that like is that
like a thing now Alaska like the village
idiot cuz if that's what it sounded like
nothing oh the show right that thing
they'll done y ie yeah yeah have you
watching yahoo stuff I haven't seen it
no the joel mchale show yes that the
joel mchale show the man who's on
x-files coming oh my goodness he got
cast on x-files and he supposed to be
some kind of television host a
right-winger really you didn't you sent
me the link i read my tenant doesn't
mean it looked past the headline that's
like I thought you'd be interested yes I
looked at it and he is gonna be some
kind of like right-wing political
talking head on on television and he's
gonna somehow become spoiler alert an
ally of Mulder's somehow so so I wonder
how that's gonna work David I'm excited
