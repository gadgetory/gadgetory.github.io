of its shade that we've seen around CES
there's also this new gold alcatel one
touch idol alpha I'm Jessica belcourt
from cnet here at CES 2014 in Las Vegas
and this is your first look so the slate
gray color of the idol alpha was first
introduced in Aoife September 2013 but
this is the first time that we're
getting our eyes and our hands on this
really pretty shade just like the iphone
5s the gold is sort of a champagne color
it's pretty subtle and subdued it's not
in your face gold and I really like it I
think it's very pretty it also helps
this is an all aluminum unibody design
so that gives it some premium look and
feel here in the hand another thing
that's interesting about the phone
design is that you've got these
translucent strips at the bottom and at
the top there are LED lights that show
up for the home button back and the menu
button but the actual navigation area is
right above it here on this black strip
the screen is a 4.7 inch 720p HD display
it's running Android 4.2 you've got an
eight megapixel camera on the back with
LED flash a 1.3 megapixel camera on the
front and inside you've got a 1.2
gigahertz quad-core processor it's
brought to you by media tech because
this is a unibody design you can't
remove the battery and there is no
microSD card however there are 16
gigabytes of on-board storage overall I
think that the idol alpha is pretty and
fairly high end so it's going to be a
phone that satisfies on basic levels of
course I would be much happier if I
thought with Android 4.3 and especially
in road 4.4 kitkat now the gold version
is new to CES so this isn't on the
market yet keep your eye out for it I'm
jessica's all apart with the cnet you
