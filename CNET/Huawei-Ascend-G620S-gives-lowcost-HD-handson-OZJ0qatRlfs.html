taking a look at the quietest end g6 20s
now this is a 5 inch android kitkat
phone with a 720p resolution that Huawei
says it's going to come with a very
affordable price tag now over the 5-inch
display is not the smallest phone around
but it is fairly easy to hold in one
hand you can see it's got a fairly slim
bezel around the screen and it's not
particularly thick either now it has an
all plastic body and the back has been
given an almost leather effect look the
back panel is removable and underneath
you will to find a micro SD card slot
allowing you to expand the 8 gigabytes
of storage it's running on a 1.2
gigahertz quad-core processor it isn't
the most powerful protesser around but
it seems to make everything fairly nippy
in my hands on time the 5-inch screen
has a 720p resolution so it won't be a
sharp are some of the 1080p phones like
the Samsung Galaxy s5 or the HTC One m8
but it does seem perfectly crisp in my
time it's also fairly bright and has
decent colors too so we'll probably be
absolutely fine for a bit of Netflix
it's running on Android 4.4 KitKat at
its heart but Huawei has put its emotion
user interface over the top now that
does make it look a little different
from regular Android most notably in
fact that there's no app tray so instead
what you'll find is all your apps and
your widgets are just scattered across
the home screens on the back of the
phone is an 8 megapixel camera which
while weighs says should be decent in
low-light and there's a 2 megapixel
camera on the front for your selfies or
for video calling using Skype so we
don't know exactly how much the phone is
going to cost yet but Huawei has
suggested that it should cost somewhere
between 150 to 200 euros mark when it
goes on sale towards the end of the year
we definitely know that it will be
coming to Europe although wider
availability including the US isn't yet
known but we will find out more in the
coming weeks
