well frankly it's a bit of a copycat the
exterior design to me kind of looks like
last generations mazda3 the interior
design well what's it reminding me of
that's right the Ford Focus it looks
almost exactly like what chords doing
right now it's a bit of a remix of all
of these sort of best hits of its class
everything about this car is very
derivative but it still has its own
charms and it's pretty likable under the
hood two liter gasoline direct injected
engine that puts out 174 horsepower at
about a hundred fifty-four pound-feet of
torque the EPA reckons you're gonna get
about 27 miles per gallon combined with
that engine whether it's mated with the
automatic or manual transmission both of
those are six speeds the elantra GT does
make a lot of really good sort of first
impressions when you get into it dual
zone automatic climate control the front
seats are heated and cooled we've got
this optional really large panoramic
moon roof above us we've also gotten a
really nice sort of blue link navigation
system it's really snappy everything's
really well organised and it's just a
really nice system to use voice command
is a little bit wonky in a little bit
slow but at least it lets you chuck the
whole address in in one go and then get
back to the business of driving I do
like that and when i first got behind
the wheel of this car the first thing I
thought is that well it just feels
really tight the steering system that
we've got here that has a cool feature
called driver selectable steering that
lets you sort of change the steering
effort from sport to comfort or normal a
touch of a button even it feels very
well-composed and very well controlled
despite all that it does right it does
kind of still miss the mark on a lot of
features for example that really good
dashboard interface its position in the
way that will it always getting hit by
the Sun and just sort of straight up
hang out you can barely see this thing
half of the day and despite the fact
that it's got more power and better
performance on papers and a lot of its
competitors on the road it just doesn't
feel as snappy or a zippy you say a
Volkswagen GTI or a Ford Focus it's not
that fun of a car to drive despite the
fact that we've got our optional sport
suspension here Hyundai is basically
remix the greatest hits of this genre
and created a new song now you're
probably thinking two things right now
yes the music metaphor is a better match
for the hyundai sonata and you're
probably also thinking that well at
least Hyundai's got that value for the
dollar thing going for itself well let's
take a look the 2016 hyundai elantra GT
gets off the line at eighteen thousand
eight hundred bucks when equipped with
the manual transmission this automatic
example is a thousand bucks more we've
also got the style package which is
going to add bigger wheels and a sport
suspension and a tech package we're just
going to add that big moonroof and all
of the dashboard tech we've also got 125
bucks in floor mat yes you got to pay
extra for that and eight hundred and
twenty-five dollars in destination
charges that brings you to our ads
tested price of twenty-six thousand six
hundred and seventy-five bucks now about
now you're probably thinking that for
that sort of money you get a fully
loaded Ford Focus titanium 5-door
arguably a better car for the money when
it comes to performance and technology
and it'll automatically parallel park
itself plus you don't have to pay extra
for the floor mat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
