together I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update social networks change
all the time they get new layouts update
features but lately with every update
these networks are starting to all look
and act alike take LinkedIn for example
the career focused network is adding big
background pictures to profiles well
Facebook Google+ and Twitter all have
these similar cover photos to convey
personality now linkedin says
backgrounds will help you stand out just
like every other network right now it's
only for paid members but in a few
months everyone will be able to add a
background photo the copycats are
everywhere the app tinder is acting like
snapchat it has the option to send a
photo that vanishes but instead of a few
seconds Tinder's flirty photos expire in
24 hours Instagram updated its app you
can edit a photo in more ways and adjust
filter intensity with a sliding bar it's
nice for Instagram fans but Adobe may
feel like it's stealing the spotlight
from Photoshop Express and Facebook is
getting heat for a change that adds
features that are similar to Shazam on
facebook's app when you're writing a
status update it will listen to the
noise in the background to identify any
music or TV shows that are playing in
the background and you'll have the
option to share what you're listening to
in your status update that means there's
a computer server somewhere that's
tapped into your microphone one YouTube
video is going viral calling for people
to delete their Facebook accounts over
this and other unnecessary data
collection obviously not everyone's
going to delete facebook but a call to
action cook at Facebook's attention to
survive Facebook may need to care more
about consumer privacy and less about
promoting music and TV shows now as for
updates that won't creep you out the
google chromecast streaming stick is
getting sporty it added access to the
apps watch ESPN and Major League Soccer
so if you have the $35 hdmi TV stick
and you have the account information for
a cable subscriber that gets ESPN well
you'll be able to watch all the world
cup games live through the ESPN app you
could use this as a way to stream the
game on a TV that doesn't have its own
cable box or you can mooch coverage from
a friend who does pay chromecast also
added the ability to stream your photos
and videos from Google+ to the TV and it
added the Aereo app so if you're in a
participating area Aereo is a
subscription service for accessing live
local broadcast stations that's your
tech news update you can always head to
cnet com for the latest news and stay
updated by following me on Twitter from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
