reality on iOS devices with a arcade
this year they are kit 2 is coming out
with iOS 12 what's the big difference
multiplayer now you can have all sorts
of shared experiences between devices
that can either be local or in the cloud
Google did something like this with
something called cloud anchors at Google
i/o and that can work between Android
and iOS
that's cloud based here you don't have
to make a cloud base this AR cat two can
work on anywhere from two iPads or two
iPhones to maybe a thousand and this
particular software that we tried on
these tables was a slingshot game called
Swift shot
that's test code and allowed us to play
some sort of crazy slingshot game on
these tables which are empty but if you
hold the iPad up hey it's a whole bunch
of blocks that were able to use and
Vanessa and I were able to launch balls
back and forth and we both saw the exact
same game board from different
perspectives now that could be used for
things like Lego maybe in the future
could be used for the things Pokemon it
could be used for things like shared
worlds and art projects multiplayer AR
is the beginning of that sort of
consensual augmented reality
hallucination or just a fun way to play
in your living room in a board game like
this I'm here at WWDC Scott Stein taking
out AR kit to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
