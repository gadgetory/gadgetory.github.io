great day I'm rich demuro with cnet TV
in New York City and this is the Q and
unlike your fascination with celebrity
gossip this is one habit you don't have
to hide let's get you started with your
must see moment the world's largest
cruise ship making its maiden voyage
Royal Caribbean's Liberty of the Seas is
three and a half football fields long
with room for fifty seven hundred people
liberty is taller than the eiffel tower
onboard amenities include a rock
climbing wall surf Park ice rink and
whirlpools that extend over the side of
the ship now I thought Queen Mary 2 was
the biggest apparently she is as ocean
liner but not as cruise ship moving
through the q american airlines in an
effort to expand in-flight entertainment
options without a lot of work is turning
to portable media players sort of like
an ipod you'd borrow from a friend but
with a bigger screen the device comes
preloaded with several movies TV shows
CDs and music playlists first-class
cross-country flights will also get bose
quietcomfort 3 noise cancelling
headphones but unlike those two buck
cheapies you can't take them with you
the players on a trial run but could get
frequent flyer status if successful
digital downloads legal or otherwise
continue to cut into physical CD sales
but those of us who do by the real thing
often shop for them on the internet
which brings us to your quick quiz what
percentage of Americans have purchased a
CD in the past six months is it thirty
percent fifty percent seventy percent or
eighty percent if you said fifty percent
you're right according to research from
it suits that number is down fifteen
percent since 2002 still for new
releases from a favorite artist physical
CDs remain the top choice now as you
might expect teams own the fewest CDs an
average of thirty two wall us 18 to 50 4
year olds have upwards of 100 in our
collections just as web video starts to
snuggle up to the growing flash standard
Microsoft thinks it's time for an HD
like upgrade now Silverlight is
available as a download so you can see
for yourself several showcase sites lets
you try out the new beta technology
Silverlight is a cross-browser
cross-platform plug-in that scales from
mobile to
steve video downloading the plugin is
quick and painless and the video quality
not bad finally go scratch yourself and
possibly win some cash and prizes a
scratch-off making website lets you
create the ticket upload a picture tweak
the design then share your scratcher by
embedding it on your blog or profile
page friends and visitors can scratch to
win if they do you get the same prize at
least that's the idea so far the second
part of the equation not exactly live
until sponsors sign on but there is a
chance to win some cash and no messy
scratch off residue either just don't
let me see you using a quarter on your
computer screen now let's you're in the
queue why not get your friends into
don't keep us a secret I'm rich the
mural with seen a TV in New York City
don't say I didn't tell you so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
