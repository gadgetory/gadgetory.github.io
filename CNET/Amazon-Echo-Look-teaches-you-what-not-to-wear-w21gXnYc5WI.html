case in point the $200 Amazon echo look
I didn't want to like this product even
saying what it does out loud sound silly
a smart speaker that takes your picture
and gives you fashion advice but what
sets the echo look apart from the other
Amazon echoes is this camera you tell it
to take your picture or six seconds ago
and it will take a lotta shot of what
you're nailing this does a couple of
things you can create an inventory of
all your ensembles within the echo look
app so you can keep track of what you
look good in but the biggest draw of the
echo look is the style check feature you
can pick two photos of yourself in
different outfits and the style check
gives a second opinion on which outfit
looks best Amazon uses artificial
intelligence and advice from stylus to
pick the best choice for you you can
then start coming to some conclusions
about what you look good in and this is
where I saw the value of the echo look I
noticed patterns and what the echo look
said I look best in dresses over pants
and a top slacks in a cardigan over
t-shirt and jeans fitted clothes over
looser options it's helpful to get a
full body shot of your outfit too
without having to hold a selfie stick
and you can finally answer the age-old
question how does my ass look in these
jeans the echo look does need some
improvements personally I'd like to get
more proactive suggestions like hey you
look great in jewel tones or you should
really wear more dresses rather than
having to deduce that information from
the choices that the style check makes
and I want to see a feature that would
let you put your outfits in categories
so you can quickly scan through all of
your casual ensembles or dressy outfits
and there's the whole question of what
Amazon is learning about you your
clothes and even your bedroom the echo
look is designed to appeal to a
set of folks who care about their
outward appearance or who want an
inventory of their wardrobe or need a
second opinion about what not to wear or
just want to get a good look at their
behind in a new dress if you want a
smart speaker without a side of fashion
advice you're better off with one of
Amazon's other ecosystems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
