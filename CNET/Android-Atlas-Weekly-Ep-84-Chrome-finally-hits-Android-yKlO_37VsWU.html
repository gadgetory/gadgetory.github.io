for apple and a tablet for the tub all
that more on this week's edition of
welcome it is februari eighth twenty
twelve i'm justin a cow so long sorry
jean-marc VV hello hello and special
guest Jessica toll car hello welcome
back yes awesome well I'm excited that
you are all here today and you to chat
room and on-demand viewers watching us
hours and hours later we're listening I
love being demanded demanded i do man
Jessica told rate I hear that all the
time Wow let's talk about the big news
this week which is this is actually
interesting because we got an email last
week saying what's the deal when is
chrome going to come to Android and I
did a little research last week during
the show and I was like I think it's
going to come soon because we see this
open bug and you know the chromium bug
system right and here we are mm-hmm less
than seven days later well in seven days
later but this happened yesterday chrome
was released for android the one big
caveat though is ice cream sandwich only
I thought you're gonna say the caveat
was its beta all right other big and the
other big caveat is its beta sure but I
I think the bigger problem for most
people besides me is that it is only
asked from sandwich because there's not
that many ice cream sandwich phones out
there one right now is that right
everyone in the US um one in the u.s.
right now and the sprint version of the
galaxy nexus is coming soon mmm so not
many people can take a look at it but
yet yet yet well do I don't think
they're gonna back port it to non Ice
Cream Sandwich phones do you um like
it's gonna run on honeycomb or no what I
mean is that they're gonna be a ton
phones that are going to get upgraded to
Ice Cream Sandwich really soon true that
is what ever really seen means we have
to buy new phones we're just not going
to get it though now you don't have to
buy new phones you just have your
current phone and then when it gets the
Android Ice Cream Sandwich update then
you should be able to download chrome I
think that good let everybody else work
out the bugs while you wait that's how
you can console yourself let me help you
there yeah so let's talk about the
actual browser itself so assuming you
have a Galaxy Nexus which I do it which
I just happened to have right here in my
pocket it is nice I mean I think it
looks nice i'll hold it up here and try
to talk at the same time which is hard
all right but so it looks nice it's fast
it has this kind of cool way between
switching between tabs but it is
definitely buggy like why did it reload
that page when I just switch between
tabs I don't know and then notice that
Google does that all the time it just
reloads and it's also hard like I can't
always switch between tabs it takes good
so there's weird things up and then it
reloaded again and then I also noticed
that double tapping it worked there but
wallah page is loading it didn't really
work very well so anyway I that's sort
of all I have to show but it does have
some cool features right like the
sinking which I haven't used it yet but
huge thank you yeah do you want to how
does that work oh well I from what I've
read it's only 11 way syncing which
which I think kind of sucks because I
mean how can how can you talk about a
seamless experience across browsers if
it's only one way your your tabs on your
computer you can open up on your phone
but not vice versa so the reading that
you've done on your phone and closing of
tabs won't really be tracked back to
your computer yeah what's up with that
that is dumb yes that is I mean firefox
has figured that out a long time ago
right so I mean Google will obviously
get there just a beta feature so this
means that google is actually using the
true definition of beta right they're
releasing intentionally unfinished
software in order to get user feedback
we hope I mean maybe this is the way
they plan to implement
but yeah I mean I think we hope that the
other differences between the stock
browser and this one this one is faster
in its using the faster javascript
engine but they have also are I think
not allowing plugins or it's at least
not shipping with flash in this browser
I don't think you can get it in the
browser which I guess probably makes it
faster as well it's probably better for
developers because stuff that you
developed for and test for Chrome on the
desktop will probably just almost
naturally just work on this device and
the DUI I don't I like the UI it has a
very easy incognito mode if you want to
do that kind of thing I like the idea of
the bookmark and the tab sink when it
becomes perfected I'm sure it'll be
awesome so is this going to be the
browser of the future so for example you
know in whatever comes next 4.1 or
whatever or is this going to be what is
next jelly bean right or is this going
to be always an alternative I think
we're all kind of assuming that chrome
is just going to take over as the
standard browser the chips with Android
I mean when that happens who knows we're
still in beta right now so yeah I mean
that is a good question how to really
know what the answer is better I suspect
that's your uh you're right I was just
testing supposedly there's some tilt to
go through shuffle through tabs option
but I don't really know how you make it
work I keep tilting in its not doing
that maybe if I just shake it we shall
share your phone figures come on come on
all right now I broke it well anyway
chrome it's cool hopefully you all get
to see it sometime soon if not stopped
by my desk and I'll show you that
applies to everyone out there just tell
security it's okay i needa gesture at me
yeah well let's keep talking about the
Galaxy Nexus there was quite an uproar
missoula last week this came out yeah 14
last week that Verizon
Galaxy Nexus lost Google support oh my
god just freaked out gamble oh man this
was kind of pissing me off because I
felt like everyone was missing the point
here right like they I don't know what
did they think okay so the assumption
was that it was pulled from developed
from a developer site and there was this
supposition it's like very hazy
correlation between a you know Google
Wallet not being on the verizon version
of the galaxy nexus and then this kind
of support which just to me seems a
little bit like a knee-jerk reaction i
mean google and verizon knew for a long
time that verizon wasn't going to let
Google Wallet on or at least they knew
enough you know that they didn't they
didn't stop the launch they work
together for a long time to give rise in
the Galaxy Nexus so why would they be
playing these kind of petty little games
now yeah but what turns out to be true
is that this really only affects
developers so it's sort of no longer
considered a developer phone because
they don't have access to the radio
support that am I reading this rate and
also this wasn't the only phone or the
only device I should say that was
removed from the developer site it was
all said the motorola xoom in the sprint
nexus s 4g and the new supposition is
that this is like a cdma issue I mean
there's actually a pretty technical
explanation I think if you're interested
maybe you'll want to read Eric max piece
about it and Google's response but it
almost seems like they're pointing to
the cdma carriers which are verizon and
sprint right yeah it's definitely very
technical and for all end-users doesn't
matter at all you still should get your
updates from google / verizon i mean all
the updates have to go through verizon
no matter what and if you're a developer
maybe it's a bummer if your developer
let us know what you think so it's just
not listed as an official developer
device anymore right and you
users good to go shouldn't make any
difference if I'm right you're fun
stocking a break and you will still get
updates hopefully in a timely matter so
the Galaxy Nexus updates don't stop
there right this is I guess not a
specific Galaxy Nexus update this is an
android update with the Galaxy Nexus are
more specifically Ice Cream Sandwich
feel right allegedly this is your story
jammer want to walk us through this this
is update to google voice right right
yeah so um yesterday it was it was a
pretty quiet update but it was
significant the the entire UI was
refreshed to kind of look like ice cream
sandwich and even the icon has that nice
cyan tone to it there I've got the icon
right over here got the icon hit handy
it's on the desktop it's like it'll
focus after second it they're gonna show
us all your voicemail now yeah okay yeah
so I mean as far as features you know
tablets got a pretty good one too the
click the call which is just a exactly
what it suggests that's one click to
make a phone call other than that the
phone also got the user interface update
obviously so I'm confused about this
user interface update because I've got
eating her on the phone and I can't show
you because it's got my personal
messages and phone numbers and things
like that in it but it looks to me like
the old one and i just downloaded it and
it's got the new icon has the new icon
at the top is one thing that I so way I
know that it's different is because when
i send a message instead of seeing the
circling donut I see a red you know
upload or message sending like arrow
that's going skyward but to me it just
looks like the same it's this long list
yeah I think the only thing I see is the
icon at the very top once you enter it
is is different but maybe there's some
subtle changes that we're not aware of
because we don't stare at it 10 hours a
day forgive me or rants but what the
heck is google doing what are they doing
with google voice do they not have
enough people using it that they care
this is a really bad application it's a
good service well so what do you want to
see done with google
okay for example you know don't boo me
out of the room but I also have google
voice on an iphone being a phone
reviewer I review many different plaster
like all of them so on the iphone like
you know there are problems with that
app too it's just sort of like I feel
like Google just like dropped google
voice and ran off into other projects
but they cared about more and just blows
way everybody right so they have one
really cool feature that's basically
like a quick dial so you can save
certain contacts as favorites and then
there's like a page separate page for it
and you can see your list of most recent
contacts people who you contacted people
who contacted you and then you've got
your quick favorites and you can just
like press it to call to send a message
etc so they've got different windows and
I think that that's a much better user
experience the functionality there is
better any like this is an android phone
like android should have the way yes it
should have absolutely the best
experience it should have the quick dial
it should have everything else and
should have a really snazzy interface
this interface doesn't look like ice
cream sandwich right it looks like
Eclair doughnut yeah so I'm not
impressed yeah i mean i don't disagree
with you i mean i don't know that they
this again could just be the media
blowing this out of proportion sorry
Jane we're sorry chairman Jim our house
i read it oh yeah i mean i think you do
but they're not necessarily saying this
is a massive update their de Sam like a
we have an update as new icons I mean it
is written up zero point four point two
point four four right so minor update
from I don't know what the previous
version it was but zero point four point
two point four three baby possibly um I
think my point is that this should be a
major update and hearing about it just
makes me angry that Google is doing more
in that they're not doing better by
people who use this service yeah you
know what I want to see it in fact
google voice is tied in with sprint so
it's in Sprint's best interests it's in
Google's best interest to offer
compelling service for Android Sprint
customers that's what henchley google
nexus
come out from sprint yet so maybe
they'll release an update when they
release that all right what I think we
can all agree on though is that the icon
is a little bit more beautiful than it
was it is I can't agree yesterday who
can argue with that so what I was gonna
say earlier just to quickly wrap this up
I want to see the ability in google
voice to make phone calls over Wi-Fi so
i want to enable you know like my old
phone and should be able to use that as
the phone around the house i am
skeptical that that will happen any time
soon just because that poses conflicts
with you know that phone providers but
that'd be awesome wouldn't it i'm
nodding join on all points yes uh uh
what should we talk about next oh i
don't know how about a little scrappy
scrap a little patent dispute t so are
we so fun scrap scrap yeah that we kind
of talked about the reverse of his last
week i think it wasn't mode a role
involved with apple it was samsung in
also in germany this week there is a
story again out of Germany with apple
and a patent dispute with motorola so
motorola basically were forced through
court proceedings a permanent injunction
of apple selling any of their devices
that had 3g so the iphone 3g 3gs iphone
4 and all 3g enabled ipads had to be
removed from the site in germany and
from stores as well which is a pretty
big deal in but how long did it last it
didn't last very long I mean so the
injunction is permanent but then Apple
sort of went to Motorola and said hey
that's not cool can we license the
patent you have so that we can start
selling this stuff again and it's not
clear whether they actually sort of
signed a license agreement or just
signed an intent to sign one but we're
able to very quickly get all this stuff
back on the store because presumably
they are in talks anyway with Apple but
what is interesting is Apple is asking
for 2.25 percent or sorry motor oil is
asking Apple for 2.25
sent in royalties for all these products
which could be a lot of money given how
much of this Apple is selling right and
that's not going to Motorola that's
going to Google assuming that Google
finishes up the buyout right once it's
approved which is pretty interesting
because you already have it's such a
weird ecosystem so Microsoft makes like
five bucks per android phones sold on
their patents and then suddenly we're
going to have google making five bucks
per phone at Apple sells yeah who's
gonna make money off Microsoft phones
that's what I want to know so what the
story has taught me oh well nokia no
kids maybe Microsoft Microsoft that be
what the story has taught me is that if
you want a job with excellent security
become a patent lawyer and get hired by
a mobile firm I know it's crazy so other
details about this even Apple sort of
saying like whoa two point two five
percent is kind of crazy here so
motorola we would like to know how much
you know manufacturers like nokia HTC LG
ericsson are paying for their licenses
of these patents to see if you just hate
us because you're about to be owned by
Google and we're Apple so we'll stay
tuned for that because i don't i don't
have any site information as to what
those deals are but it would be
interesting to find out damn as a quiz
it illegal for google or sorry motorola
to screw apple can they just do that
because they feel like it I feel like
they can they can dictate whatever price
they want yeah I mean maybe German law
is different or maybe I don't know us
fair trade law at all so I'm just
totally speculating but there was a
suggestion from the chat room that the
injunction was removed on appeal oh
really that I know the one from last
week was maybe that's the one yeah so
we'll do a little research but for right
now we're going to take a break and
we'll be back talking about some secret
google products so stick around
boy dad was
welcome back all right so our quick
research has revealed that potentially
there Apple has ass has I don't know got
the court to sort of repeal this but it
I'll say at best it looks like rumors at
this point the story is from a site that
is not in our normal stable of sources
but we will continue to research that
story and you can go to Android Atlas
cnet.com plus android atlas for
continuous updates on this evolving
story but in the meantime let's talk
about these devices that Google is
secretly testing I guess they have asked
the FCC to test undisclosed mystery
entertainment device across four major
cities over the next six months but it
is very unclear what this is but this is
the part where we get to wildly
speculate everybody's favorite game the
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabled ring the
devices right Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
enabled and I guess this wasn't
originally discovered by gig ohm and a
FCC filing from December so there's a
couple guesses you know one gasps is
that these devices are like a media hub
to go in your house so that it will
download all the video and music or
whatever and then distribute it to other
devices in your house which could be
interesting and kind of reminds me of
this digital hub strategy that Steve
Jobs spoke about you know whatever four
or five years ago which kind of evolved
on the apple site to be a cloud-based
hub and not sort of a house base hub
which is interesting that Apple we're
sorry google would pursue this hub
strategy what else what do you guys
think about this do you think
I mean does that does this hub strategy
make sense is that something that you
think consumers would use yeah I mean I
think I think if it's sort of a cable
box type of deal with built-in slingbox
and tivo capabilities and things like
that then that would allow you to you
know DVR content that you've received
from your cable provider and then you
know stream it out to your other devices
which is kind of a workaround so so that
Google wouldn't have to sort of license
that content from cable providers right
because you would already own it right
right right yeah I mean because Google
is run into a lot of licensing issues
when they and just push back when they
release google TV initially everyone you
know including our own network CBS
started blocking google TV from
streaming content directly from their
sites because there's a lot of money
tied up in this and a lot of different
licensing arrangements and and stuff
from sort of historical historically the
way broadcast has worked and so maybe
this as you're saying is a way around
those licensing restrictions because
it's you an individual using content
that you paid for rather than you know
Google trying to license this content
you know in mass for a new way of
distributing it which you know I think
there's a lot of resistance to I think
it's part of the smart android
refrigerator series that we're about to
say oh yeah no but um you know what
cable box would be nice but it would
also be good for people who already have
google TV if this were an internal
component as part of a TV I mean you're
already going to be paying for your DVR
it would be annoying to have to buy an
extra box even if it's only a hundred
bucks you know you're gonna pay a
hundred bucks to stream stuff you
already own plus google music plus other
things you know onto your phone right
another possibility is that this could
be a gaming device of some kind so
there's the onlive is like the gaming
service that you can to stream the games
to your devices that maybe Google is
getting into that game so to speak and
this will be some kind of device that
can stream games to your
TV or something like that so frigerator
games to your refrigerator yeah get the
milk in the class I don't know yeah I
don't know and you know further
speculation that whatever this ends up
being that maybe it could be me
manufactured by motorola because maybe
there's a good relationship between
Google and Motorola well depends on the
outcome of that a patent dispute a
patent dispute and whether that deal
actually finally gets approved anyway if
you know about this we would love to
hear about it android Alice at cnet com
what else do we got going here oh so
last week we talked about how Android
users more than any other phone user use
their phones wall in the bathroom this
week we have a tablet that you can use
in the tub this is the was this the
pantech element element actually got a
look at it at CES yeah what you think uh
you know I just it it looks pretty good
i like the design um it's kind of like
Raggedy and angular and were you in the
tub I mean if you don't mind me asking
that's where I take all of my CEOs
meetings actually come in come in come
in oh my god yeah pantech element so
it's a 4G LTE device hdmi output dual
core but it's you know the one thing
Donald Bell doesn't like who wrote the
review and I think we can all in this
room agree as well it's 299 on contract
tablet shouldn't be purchased on Kandra
boom correct 299 off contract may be
right so this is 449 I think was the
price off contract generally I think
that the bottom line on this tablet is
it's kind of cool that you can bring it
in water or spill coffee on it or
whatever he'd it's a not actually
operable underwater so you can't like a
you know scuba diving or snorkeling with
it so you can't changes my opinion of it
oh yeah taba completely worries how are
you gonna use it before you're going to
take it snorkeling and be like oh yes
that is the fish play with it in the
pool some
you know have your kids take photos outs
with it exactly nope it just it just you
know mainly if you drop it in and it's
also not rugged I thought Donald was
going to take a picture of the element
and his kid in the bathtub that's what I
was expecting nope it wimped out there
come on Donald get on it so if you want
a lot of proof tablet get this one but
for any other reason your only option
right I don't know don't they have there
was some other rugged tablet I thought
we saw at TS but I can't recall the name
and there was that case did you see that
case is that the 404 guys stuck their
iPad and drop a bowling ball on it yeah
oh really yeah was it made out of
Gorilla Glass so I don't know if the
case was made out of Kevlar yeah I look
like it was made out of Kevlar was like
this weird padded or text yellow weird
like pad stuff this kind of interest
recycled black suits yeah i think it was
actually wilson's ipad 2 they dropped
yeah he was made an even cooler and
everything was totally cool yeah Wilson
in the meantime was having a hard to
talk backstage all right Newt more new
hardware and this is a from a sorority
this is my territory talk about this
back in the fone zone so there have been
a lot of rumors about the samsung galaxy
s3 which is the successor to the
incredibly maniacally popular samsung
galaxy s2 phone so that was the s2 was
originally announced at Mobile World
Congress last year that takes place
februari 27 through march first this
year and I'm going um so it's a hard job
to go to Barcelona for case has to do it
might as well be me so check out the
coverage but there there have been like
all of these leaks and speculations are
they going to announce it here yes they
are no they're not it's quad-core it's
got an 8 megapixel camera it's got a 12
megapixel camera no it doesn't have you
know of course it's going to have a
camera so latest is that it's very very
slim 7 millimeters or about 0.2 8 inches
I think it's like 0.2 76 and I rounded
up and that is for reference the same
slimness at least the 0.28
part as the motorola droid razr which i
found a little too thin in the hand i
think not the droid razr maxx i think
the razr maxx which is like 0.33 forgive
me for not remembering precisely it's
still very very slim I thought that the
razr maxx is actually a little more
comfortable because it's a little bit
more rounded and it depends how they
contour the phone but the galaxy s2 is
very slimming box-like so if it's if
it's very thin I mean people like
they're thin phones yeah I'm pretty
excited about this phone i mean the
galaxy 2 s2 was a solid phone and it
very very good the biggest thing I
didn't like about it is the whole
samsung touchwiz I that exactly but
beyond that that's my eloquent way of
saying I'm not that into TouchWiz they
know exactly it it's a solid phone and
the camera was really great compared to
other Android cameras that were out when
it came out and you know it was it's
light it had it it has that when you
first pick it up like you think is this
a toy phones this real or is it actually
this light so that asked to or start of
the s3 yeah I think will be a great
competitor it'll make me potentially
regret my galaxy nexus i I mean it I
think it's basically going to be more or
less the same phone hopefully Samsung
will give us something other than
TouchWiz or a new and improved TouchWiz
ice cream sandwich for sure but if the
body looks similar than I think it's
gonna have wide mass appeal do they take
the same strategy they did with s2 where
it's basically that phone is on every
carrier almost identical you know it's
been working for them they've had some
good quarters so i think absolutely
alright well look for that alright let's
finish up here by someone who's not
having quite as good a year as samsung
our friends over at HTC I've been a fan
of HTC I've HTC incredible for a long
time and I actually have all the scans
and I've said this over and over again
since is my favorite you know if I can't
have stock that is but HTC i think is
not doing been doing quite as well as
samsung
for sure you know there's various
reasons that people cite they have too
many different phones out blah blah blah
but they have created a new sort of
innovation group within HTC called HTC
studio that is hoping they can
revitalize the brand and it sounds like
we should start seeing devices from them
this year the group is going to port
it's a group of designers and engineers
that is going to report directly to the
CEO do you think this is a good idea do
you think I mean is it I I'm assuming
that it's going to be everything from
devices to also taking a look at their
software strategy with sense to any
other kind of service that they can
provide so it sounds like it's just
across the board innovation yeah exactly
so it's probably a bunch of designers
and marketers and other people you know
cross-section sitting in a room going
like okay let's think of some really
cool interface let's let's find a
problem and let's try to create a
solution I mean HTC isn't the only one
who's ever had this I know t-mobile has
had it rim it sounds like as having this
now with a former co CEO heading up that
part of the division I love that HTC is
publicly saying that they're going to
continue to put resources into
innovation right yeah I mean I think
this can either go brilliantly well or
horribly wrong it really depends how
much freedom HTC gives them so if
they're just like forget all the rules
we typically impose on you go out there
and just figure out the best thing for
the consumer that could be great
especially if you have the resources but
if they're like be innovative but still
work within our daily rules then they're
going to run into all the same problems
potentially that they've always had so I
guess the proof will be in the pudding
phones that is our news for today but
wait there's more we now it's time for
the app of the week and you feel like
there should be like separate intro
music for that we used to have now it's
time for
the wig app of the week with Jay mark
obv so this week I checked out an app
called transparent screen which is
supposed to make walking and texting or
otherwise playing with your phone a
little bit safer it makes the background
of whatever you're doing actually
whatever is behind your phone so it
makes your phone see-through basically
from what I've seen I mean it works
pretty well I can I can fire it up here
on my OG HTC evo while you are so out of
date oh so I'm vintage vintage there you
go classic so there you go you can see
me behind my phone even though I'm
behind my phone so it's using the camera
right right yeah I mean it's a real time
tracking technology I mean from what
I've seen if I walk at any kind of more
than a leisurely pace then it can't
quite track as fast as I walk but I mean
it's a fun idea the perfect app for slow
walkers of the world yeah especially if
you walk like this phone directly in
front of you see probably it could be
good for spine to definitely right I'm
just working on my phone I've that I've
I've done maybe something like that
before with my camera yeah it's more
what I want to take a picture of someone
should you be telling us this huh it's
okay I saw this couple at a restaurant
who while I was waiting for my food food
SAT there for 10 minutes not talking
with their phones just up the whole time
and I was like I'm gonna take a picture
of that and I'm like oh I'm just working
on my phone don't mind me just catching
the light exactly so transparent screen
be cut it sounds pretty cool but because
I guess it's a slow probably not a good
thing to use while driving definitely
not a good thing to you guys you never
should use your phone will drive right
but especially if you think this is
gonna help it it's not so definitely
cool to play with you know I don't know
if it's necessarily going to make your
life that much safer but worth a look
and it's free free yes
and very easy to to turn on and off all
right cool we'll check it out all right
so we have some email and I will read it
now first I want to read it will take
turn our first email is from Kevin he
wrote in we were talking about the
android browser as we referred to at the
end of last show and he said hey here's
the HTTP user agent for the android
browser and for those of you who don't
know user agent is sort of how the
browser identifies itself to web servers
and he points out that the android
browser basically what is based on k
HTML rendering engine which is first
seen in KDE which is sort of a front-end
for linux or unix and that Apple
basically forked that and created WebKit
and anyway the bottom line is that the
Android browser was based on web quit
which is true but it is not chrome which
i think is the point we were making but
I don't know we're wrong all the time so
who knows what we actually said we don't
listen to ourselves and he also says
it's sad to see the sea Antoine go but
at least now he won't be flailing his
phone at the agency and on he said aunt
yeah that's true which is very genius of
Antoine the ants one did does he play it
flailing his phone at the camera for
dates I I never noticed him Oh was that
what I think he actually gave his phone
number way that's what happened oops on
there and then he was telling us about
how we got a call from someone area
Chris oh yes oh wait this sweet um all
right once you read us the next email
Jessica well okay since you asked so
nicely hey guys I just caught your
podcast this week where you talk about
bigger screens I must be in a minority
as I want my phone screen as large as
possible given that i just given that
the screen is exponentially more than
making calls also playing games web
surfing videos etc and if he could have
gotten the galaxy nexus at the size of
the samsung galaxy note or the dell
streak and
would have had it in a heartbeat great
show and that was from Ryan and um
that's fine the samsung galaxy note is
coming out it's got a big screen it is
and it has a little stylist stylist yes
that's the word I'm looking for a kind I
mean I'm actually going to be reviewing
that phone when it comes out release
date is februari 19th so why you back
definitely have a sentence about the
stylus and the phone alright that's
great i would definitely want have a
discussion about this i think that this
is okay i think you're crazy for wanting
larger screens but what if you have
massive jason howell hands well you
better have bigs like here's what I'm
gonna show six I think you're crazy if
you wanted but this is the great thing
about the Android ecosystem you can have
the phone you want because there's
options versus in some other ecosystems
or they're like nope this is the right
size and this is the only size you get
what other ecosystems are you may be
referring to all of them there's only
one I can think of actually well I'm an
appt only has one but even blackberries
like you know see tons of screen sizes
you see you kind of do small and you see
kind of a little bigger uh what about
the touchscreen torch torch is it as it
is is it like the Galaxy Nexus another
torch to but how big are they I don't
remember this bigger this at least 3.5
inches yeah me know like I know like
four inch ones is what I'm saying
correct um anyway mainly our five point
right it's mainly Apple but certainly
there's no sighs they're all right we
have a voicemail from someone about
Facebook hey you guys love this show you
know finishing listening to last week's
park has run out today on Monday morning
I have a political sir you are they
having a lot of trouble with a facebook
that but love it if anybody noticed that
also I got a HTC Amaze my wife has a
sensation 4g you know we both been
having the same problems you know
pictures are unloading contacts on
sinking a lot of trouble trouble logging
in stuff like that a couple of my
friends have it too I'm just wondering
you know what this with a is it going on
with a new updates or anything like that
have you got to experience any of these
I just want to I want to know if we're
alone I love the show keep it up thanks
again looking for for next week's show
who'd you guys say to this any problems
facebook um you know I only had the
Amaze 4g on my desk for a short while I
didn't notice any problems with facebook
I didn't hear anything from other people
but it is integrated into HTC sense if
that's what he's talking about yeah I
found it to work really well my
incredible actually the integration was
great but there is an email so we talked
about Facebook and syncing last week
because there was questions about that
and there was a new story that
apparently we all missed and josh and a
couple others wrote in to tell us about
it that Facebook sinking was actually
blocked i guess in newer versions of
android because it violated the way they
did at the Google Terms of Service and
this is a story from what sometime last
like februari I think and we'll put that
in the show notes but I guess if you
have a newer phone and you're looking
for this sort of HTC level of syncing
with facebook that you probably won't
get that unless you install a custom rom
or something well wait I'm confused
because um here it also says that other
android phones can do it because
whatever skin they're running is
actually doing the sinking and not
android so the HTC Sense would be
sinking if he signed up through sense
for facebook and isn't using the
facebook app on its own yeah it's a good
question because I think that is
definitely how HTC was getting around it
but could they have changed it between
versions or something like that not
really all right maybe so we'll look to
the audience for help with this one or
maybe we'll do research and come back to
next or maybe just the facebook app just
sucks because it sucks on my phone too
and i have a iphone sorry to admit that
on the android atlas show yeah it could
be facebook is pretty much the best on
iphone too it's terrible on mine i don't
never works for me ever it may not work
but it's like the best layout and user
experience android is pretty good too
all right one more email here
before we wrap up this is a pretty
interesting one hey guys love the show
up and listening for a few months now as
a truck driver really helps the miles
fly by I bought a droid or sorry I
Motorola Bionic and September and saw
the data connectivity issues almost
immediately heard there was going to be
an OTA update would fix the problem well
got the update but airplane mode is
still my most used app on the phone in
order to reset my data connection I
randomly and frequently lose my data
connection out of nowhere is there
actually a working fix out thanks for
all the hard work and great
entertainment matt from colorado springs
so he is referring to an issue with
verizon LTE phones basically when
verizon sort of implemented their LTE
network they added sort of a new kind of
authentication which i guess is
different than the way 3g data
indication is done it's it's pretty
technical put a story about it in the
show notes from december i believe but
apparently the this is a fact inor has
been affecting all of the verizon 4g
phones will they will try to
authenticate and fail lose data
connectivity and some phones retry more
often so you don't really necessarily
know that this is happening and some
phones like I guess the Bionic with
Thunderbolt retry less so they looks
like they are losing connectivity so as
far as we know there has been so fix
released but it looks like they haven't
necessarily solve the problem for all
people and the airplane fix he's
referring to is one workaround was to
turn off your data connection and turn
it back on and don't force it to
re-authenticate and it would work so
it'd be great to sort of have an
official word from verizon on the status
of this fix across all devices but as of
now I have not heard one and it's kind
of a bummer that is it for today so if
