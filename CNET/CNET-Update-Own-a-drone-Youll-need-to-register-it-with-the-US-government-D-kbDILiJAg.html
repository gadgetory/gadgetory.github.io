government is trying to hack into your
account I'm Bridget Carey this is your
cnet update facebook will now notify you
if it thinks your account is being
targeted by government hackers and if
you get that message facebook also warns
you that you might as well just buy a
new computer because chances are if a
government agency is paying a hacker to
get into your account you're also likely
infected with malware it may sound wild
that facebook is now warning against
this but actually google has been
sending out the same types of warnings
since 2012 facebook isn't explaining how
it can tell the difference between a
common hacker and one attacking on
behalf of a government agency there are
some pieces of malware that are
suspected to have been created by
government sponsored hackers like
Stuxnet the social networks chief
security officer wrote on facebook that
you'll only get this message when
there's a strong suspicion that the
attack is from the government the
warning encourages users to turn on
two-factor authentication which is
something everyone should do any time
it's offered you'll find it listed on
facebook under security as login
approvals think of it as two passwords
if you or someone else is trying to
login from a new machine or browser
facebook will send you a text message
with a string of numbers to enter in as
a second password to prove it's really
you trying to login and in other news
that makes you feel paranoid about the
government if you own a drone you will
have to register it with the US
Department of Transportation the
Transportation Department is creating a
task force with the Federal Aviation
Administration to figure out how exactly
this registration system is going to
work but the goal is to have the rules
set before the end of the year it will
mean even if you're buying drones for
fun or as a hobbyist you'll need to
agree to the rules to fly them safely
and if you don't the government will be
able to identify your craft FAA
guidelines say you're not supposed to
fly aircraft above 400 feet or within
five miles of an airport meanwhile
amazon is dealing with its own drama
when it comes to keeping track of real
user reviews amazon is now suing more
than a thousand people who posted fake
product reviews if you ever thought a
review was too positive to be true
there's a
chance it may have been paid for the
retail giant filed a lawsuit Friday
asking a Washington state court for
damages relating to schemes on the
website fiverr.com it's a marketplace
where people pay five dollars or more
for small gigs and odd jobs in this case
the gigs were for writing fake five-star
reviews with fake names and IP addresses
some companies even try to fake records
that the reviewer bought the product so
it would look like a verified purchaser
Amazon hasn't yet named the companies or
people involved in the fake reviews
amazon argues that it is a breach of
customer terms of service to be
deceptive that's it for this tech news
update and there's more at cnet com from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
