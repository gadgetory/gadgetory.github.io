I'm cnet's cara de Savoie joined by
senior writer Shara Tipton and char
Apple sent out their invitation today an
event next Thursday October sixteenth
tell us about the invitation itself
apple in its typical coy fashion didn't
really give a lot of details in the
invite it said it's been way too long
and then there was a logo of kind of the
top of an apple which is very similar to
what they did with the iphone 6 invite
in that one it was silver and this one
it's rainbow colors which make people
think that maybe it has something to do
with Max okay and what about the way too
long part way too long I mean who knows
it could be there are some max that they
haven't updated in a couple years you
know I think the mac mini hasn't been
updated since 2012 which in the world of
technology is an eternity you know it's
very old processors you know it's really
in need of a refresh so besides the
Macintoshes themselves everyone's
expecting an iPad announcement or update
tell us more about that yeah we're
definitely going to see iPads here there
are thoughts that there will be a gold
ipad version which could attract you
know a different range of buyers it's
also what they did with the iphone with
the iphone 5s as well sure we also could
see potentially a bigger screen ipad but
it's looking more likely like that will
be next year as opposed to this year
okay and these ipads could also have the
fingerprint sensor yeah for sure yeah
they definitely need to be updated with
with the new processor so apple's new a8
processor the fingerprint sensor will
probably see some Apple pay capabilities
integrated in these it's more likely
that people are going to use their phone
when you're going to pay for something
but if you're someone who doesn't
necessarily have a phone upgrade you may
want to you know try it out with your
iPad there's also a lot of people who
carry iPads around and are taking
pictures and doing other things with
that true so we first heard about Apple
pay last month in September at the
iphone event we do you expect more
details like a release date at this
event the the Apple pay is launching
this month so we're going to hear
something about when that's coming out
they'll probably talk about it at the
vet at the event a little bit and
potentially even show it off some more
it's really unclear exactly when that's
happening but it's this month
okay and going back to the Macintoshes
earlier in the summer WWDC we learned
about Yosemite the operating system do
you expect more details to come out next
week you somebody is a definite at this
event we're probably going to hear about
the release which could either be that
day or shortly thereafter we're going to
see a lot more of the features see how
it works with the iphone and the new
iPads and you somebody is definitely
something we're going to see and finally
where is this event being held the
events being held on Apple's campus so
that's down in Cupertino it's a much
smaller venue than what they did for the
iphone 6 that that kind of signals how
big of an event it is for Apple so by
not having you know 3,000 people in an
auditorium it's you know it's a much
more low key event for them probably no
rock stars either probably no rock stars
thanks so much hardship can we'll be
following closely i'm cara de su boy
