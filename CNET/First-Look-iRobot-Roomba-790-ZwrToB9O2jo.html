for cnet.com and in front of me is the
irobot roomba 790 this is the latest
model of robot vacuums from iRobot one
of the first things you'll notice when
you take this robot vacuum out of the
box is that it's a very aesthetically
pleasing piece of machinery it's got
really smooth edges and it's shiny and
this bright blue colors it's very
nice-looking not that its appearance
matters in terms of performance but if
you're gonna watch it track back and
forth across your room a thousand times
you definitely want something that's
nice to look at the Roomba features a
rotating brush wheel and then a creeping
wheel that kind of pushes debris in
towards the suction area it also
features two heavy-duty wheels with
rubber grips on the bottom that make it
easy for the room but to navigate over
rugs and onto different flooring
surfaces the Roomba is fully
programmable either through the
touchscreen on the device itself or
through this fully digital remote you
can program the Roomba to turn on at
different times of the day seven days a
week ahead of time and it will leave its
docking station automatically at the
time you've set it and return back when
it's cleaned your room the roomba 790
also features a spot clean mode where it
will circle in a spiral fashion around
the spot which you would like for it to
clean effectively picking up all of the
debris the roomba 790 is a really
meticulous machine so if you're looking
for something that will clean your room
in a really short amount of time this is
probably not the machine for you when we
set the robot vacuums loose in our
living room set here with rice scattered
all over to see what they would pick up
and what they wouldn't the Roomba picked
up considerably more than any of the
other robot vacuums however it also took
twice as long so while the Roomba may
not be efficient it's definitely
effective as a robot vacuum while it
wasn't the top performer in our pet hair
tests it was a close second so if you
have pets and want something that can
move around daily at a scheduled time
and kind of do that routine maintenance
for the pet hair that sheds and falls
this is definitely a good option for you
the Roomba features a large dustbin that
is easy to remove empty and reinstall
once this is done this is an excellent
feature because it means that you will
have to empty the dustbin far less often
than with certain other models the
remote won't replace a traditional
stand-up vacuum however it does do an
excellent job of keeping your floors
clean and helping with that day-to-day
maintenance at $699 this is definitely
not a casual purchase but if you like
the idea of a robot vacuum this is one
that we would definitely recommend
because of its high performance in both
our debris and our agility tests with
the irobot roomba 790 I'm Katy
