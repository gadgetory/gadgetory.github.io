senior editor Seth Rosenblatt who just
got back from to computer security
conferences in Las Vegas like her hi
black at first and then def con let's
start with black hat give us a highlight
sure black head is the more professional
enterprise level security side of of the
week and one of the most interesting
things that happened there this year was
an iOS app hacking session this is not
hacking iOS itself which is still fairly
secure but for hacking the apps this
researcher discovered several ways to
hack them one of the most interesting
was that the phones and iPads are
actually a hackable by downloading the
entire database to your computer okay
you only need a few minutes to connect
the phone grab all the information give
the phone back to whomever you stole it
from and then you can work on the
encryption at your own pace now the
second half of your week was at DEFCON I
know that's a pretty fun show to attend
def cons a lot of fun this year was very
interesting because the ninja hacker
group put together a phone that you can
use to get on their private cell phone
network that they built at the show this
has only been done once before in the
world and it was very interesting as a
proof of concept for what people can do
to get around the verizons and AT&amp;amp;T is
in the world and you were lucky enough
to come home with a phone as a souvenir
I did get a phone the interface is quite
interesting it's a custom version of
Android and it's built on an HTC One V
nice and this is a really cool detail
about def con is that even the badges
are hackable yes the fun the battles are
great yeah absolutely thank you so much
seth rosenblatt anyone thank you for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
