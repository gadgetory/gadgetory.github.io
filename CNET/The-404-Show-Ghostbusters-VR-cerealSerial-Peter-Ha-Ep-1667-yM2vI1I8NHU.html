time it's been way too long I've never
been on the show with Peter on the show

across so since you started hosting
right huh and that was I bet peter st
you're gonna just found that out right
now that Russ I know what's going on ooh
okay yeah not to take anything away from
I know how to read Twitter bios you've
you've been around the block speaking of
uh what you've been up to uh dude it's
been so long and I just want to
congratulate you because this is like
the longest I've ever known you to hold
a job so you must like it your dick is
it is it true have you not is this the
longest you've ever held the single job
it's gotta be it's got to be true in
recent years yeah I'd say earlier when I
was writing for crunch gear TechCrunch I
mean that was quite a while yeah how
long ago was that I've been in New York
ten years now so that was probably 8-9
years ago if you don't know Peter ha
peter has a legacy member of the 404
alumni he that's nice I make you you
must be this must be well beyond double
digits for you being on the program
maybe we're just about to hit 10 maybe
are always a good time like we like I
joked you move around a lot you but you
do have a pretty steady situation right
now tell us a little bit about what
you're up to right now you were you're a
legend in the in the tech journalism
world people stories of your trousers
travel far and wide do they not I mean I
know Jaime Lannister yeah you're the
Kingslayer through the text layer
oh man yeah that's that's a comment that
might be the nicest thing anyone's ever
said to and I say and giving you a
compliment breaking through that hard
porcelain exterior that's tough to do
well you know here's the thing i think
when we all started doing this sort of
thing years and years and years ago it
wasn't there weren't a lot of us right
yeah i just came to the realization at
some point a few years back I was like I
don't want to do this anymore so you got
out a variety of reasons actually don't
get me wrong I wish I was still doing
this Oh believe me well yeah I just sort
of left a couple years ago because at
least for me I was covering consumer
tech uh which hasn't really changed
since 2007 let's be honest since the
iphone came out it's always just been
iphone iphone iphone ones yet when's the
next Ice are coming out it's right on
that kind of trajectory yeah there's VRS
new the fitness stuff is new there's no
products different different products I
mean different but categories you mean
different different categories yeah yeah
but then how fun in cool is VR I'll tell
you I'll tell you about my really the
best VR I've ever done and I did that
Wednesday um but we'll see but what else
so so now you're in you're in
advertising so I work in advertising I
work for some big brands that you've
probably heard of but I will not talk
about so like IKEA no I wish no you know
like like in madman did you write the
song i like to keep make the world what
is it I'd like make the world get the
world to sing I'd like to give the world
diabetes any advertisement any
advertisement you've ever liked in the
last year yeah I did that you did this
oh I remember last time you were here
you're talking about your whole DeadMau
Nissan thing that was cool yeah so that
was fun yeah hang out with him that uh
interesting character yeah I bet because
he never takes off that that helmet
right like a cpe hardly ever puts that
thing on he doesn't wear it in the
bathroom not that I know of huh I'll bet
it's not even him performing yeah I'll
bet he has like a bunch of interns yeah
like okay Jerry it's a beaut the helmet
on you theorem you I'm sorry go ahead no
you think the two daft punk
eyes are the same guy now now come on as
love this dude is no it's whatever doing
some guys just hit their dams around
turns Super Chicken 20 grand a year get
him out there watch the discs right it's
over how do i guess i Ken how do we get
that guy's eons early creo thing that we
could take over to get famous yeah but
you have to wear a mask the whole time
like yeah no one knows what else she is
she's amazing yeah sure mate or no nose
right general actually they do know well
yeah yeah they she only started not
showing her face when she saw my recent
homage kid yeah actual she came to there
was eight years I was watching her uh
car karaoke thing she did with James
Corden oh yeah I'm sorry CBS's James
Corden and uh is very good and they were
kind of like playing around with the
idea that she's uh she's an anonymous
quote unquote she's talking about like
oh I don't want my I don't want to be
famous like I don't want my likeness to
be associated with some sort of like
visuality of my face yeah cuz she
doesn't want to be able to walk down the
street and not be bothered or you could
go on youtube and search for SIA 2012
and right see right so that's my whole
thing in ilion videos of her and that's
the point it's like we'll see you like
people have the internet and I can just
like figure it out so I don't know I
mean I get it yeah I get it sure it's
like Banksy yeah I don't know about that
one you're gonna rep Banksy Banksy can't
if banksy's people came to you how did
you even know if it's really banks right
well you would find out he would I find
out I don't know how does that how would
you confirm that how does Banksy get
verified right oh how does he hire
people yeah well not how do you know
that it's like maybe angel is a painting
in front of you and it's me they did
that gig at Central Park where he was
like selling original bang see pictures
of barriers for 25 bucks but like what
was was he selling them no it wasn't him
out someone but someone was selling how
do we know that was part of the
installation you did right right which I
thought I guess you know if you have the
money to like pull off that like
Disneyland thing you're probably pang
see ya oh yeah right i guess so i guess
uh anyway it's good to have you back I'm
glad you're gonna share some tales of uh
yeah we'll talk about some stuff yeah
point okay all right and if not it's ok
to I have a tale to share ok so this
week I had a pretty cool wednesday i
went to uh so this parts not cool but I
went to madame tussaud's never been
there in non square new york I've been I
think the london one there the weirdest
places on the goddamn er yeah have you
there so there's it's a wax museum yeah
right so all these famous political
figures celebrities whoever there's just
like life-size uh wax sculptures of
these of these people yeah right it's
the strangest and people take photos
with my people go to these understand I
may be no idea you have to admit like it
is a very impressive technical artistic
skill that like Ray is staggering how
accurate some super dated though it's
dated like Robin Williams is they and he
looks 30 well what I was posted to bury
him the second he died oh my god that's
not what i was implying Oh Russ thats
dark sorry darkies Wow my point is like
it was Mork you know and I know and they
should have had like I don't know
gressive uh mrs. Guiler that would have
been okay into that um but I agree like
is it a thing that people even still go
to write the islands out the door really
when we often many numbers for the
Ghostbusters thing right now this was
close to the press this is a press event
I was at UH the line for regular access
to madame tussaud's was like outdoor
people love it it's so Times Square
what's over there because I guess so
we're there for this Ghostbusters
experience of the PR PR people take us
up to the ninth floor and we get out and
you're like amongst the the people there
right like you're you have to walk
through this area to get to the
Ghostbusters thing and like Mark and I
my producer we like get out and we're
like looking or like what the hell is
this place yeah wait there grainy floors
oh my god there might be more there
might be more im mean although i think i
must skip levels Carl's floors probably
like something else I really tall yeah
gotcha
and you're and you get out and you're
seeing people with their arm around
Scarlett Johansson like thinking that
this is it is a the closest you're ever
since that's probably you you're gonna
pull one over on people and be like I
actually took a photo with Scarlett
Johansson I don't know who are you gonna
fool like not much oaken dude selfies
selfies with with jayla I'll bet is
he'll tease with with John head he took
like a 640 by 480 kind of photo you
could probably pass you're not wrong
yeah there's a couple filters the window
for for faking it was I was like 2010
well anyway we make our way through and
then like the presidential room which is
so funny because the presidential room
is dead silent is like one cares no all
hustle and bustle in like the celebrity
part but then the second you get to like
the presidential area everyone's like
only gonna be quiet oh my god that's why
I really I don't know hang over Skype
residents I should not is it an oval
office it fell Oval Office II but is it
designed like the Oval Office like
sections of it where do they start
singing now and telling those are Secret
Service nope but guess what Ronald
Reagan and way taller than I thought he
was how do you know that's based on the
wax guy no they build him to scale 0061
I don't know any tall I thought he was
like 58 I thought it's like a small dude
no I got that's how I he's an actor yeah
well then Todd chrisley 55 yeah well you
think of the wax sculpture of Tom
Cruise's just like a little box yeah
he's low man man little peek in there
you buddy so I'm there to see this
Ghostbusters VR experience the void have
you heard of the void you know that a
yes so the void is this company out of
Utah that designs proprietary VR
experiences they build sets around VR so
they like you know we're used to VR
right now we're just in like an
eight-by-eight area with something like
the vibe and you're walking through with
the controllers and you have this you
know VR experience at home well they
take it a step further and they
introduce like a funhouse element to it
right where it's like oh the floor
shakes oh we're blowing fans at you up
according to what you're seeing in the
drawing it was amazing but but it's not
augmented reality right know your
so you so so let me start you out right
so you sit down I'll you get in there
and it's like this loading area and and
you go three people at a time all you go
in and everyone like puts on this
hanging vest right yeah cheap strap on
the vest you pull the straps tight and
on the back again like they want you to
feel like you're Ghostbuster so like it
feels like you're wearing like a proton
pack but you're probably just where I'm
like jazz battery and computer uh and
then they strap you into that they throw
on this headset the headset is super
heavy okay amazingly have like way
heavier like way heavier than an oculus
or vive but kind of brilliant because
the I the goggles flip up so you can
like while you're wearing the helmet you
can flip off a get nauseous or sick or
whatever it is which I thought that
clear like five those things could use
that yes if your aunt like tied in
something you'd freak out like you have
like a meltdown you like take me out of
this I guess so they're like if you get
nauseous just reach out and touch the
wall like okay arm yeah really wacky so
uh they put you in they set you up and
then they hand you like this blaster
this gun and that is your proton pack
that's your that's your blaster okay so
they start the simulation and then
you're like looking around you're like
oh I see my guys I seem like the people
i'm with their Ghostbusters world oh
wait I'm a Ghostbuster wait wait first
time you did a VR thing or now you heard
of the other thing where you're doing
with multiple people know their I well
like there was a Star Trek thing that
they recently talked about their
multiple people okay there's been a few
of them but I'm confused like you're
seeing the mic mark yeah you seeing and
you're seeing an avatar he's represented
by an avatar i like but like all his
movements are perfect is here a no he
was they were all like Janeiro name a
Ghostbuster pH shirts yeah sure I'll in
the in the garb in the whole getup yeah
ah so like head motion was 121 perfect
the blaster know of yeah but yeah right
well no because like I'm like is that
you Mark and Mark went head up and down
yeah oh yeah it was crazy so you can
talk and there's microphones in the
and speakers in the ears are they can
hear I the avatars wearing helmets no so
yeah we're wearing like the the race
erotic attica you know sort of uh by
knock you Lars that kind of thing so
it's pretty red I'm looking down am I
put my my blaster and I'm moving it and
it's following my mirror my movies like
riya five you don't see your own hands
but you see the last love really all
that matters now you don't see gloves or
anything oh so so on the helmets and on
the black eyes they'd have to animate
like you holding the blaster and like
different portions of you holding the
blaster that the ads it's like an organ
somewhere they all you really need is
that one to one with the blast the blast
is riddled with those like little
ping-pong ball see that's how that how
it all works so uh you start the
simulation they're like okay as soon as
that light flickers put on your helmets
and go on in your like uh what that's it
like we're just free roaming in like
some apartment again but you're so wired
right no wires so what was the thing
where you was wired you said you were
wired like hang of something hanging
yeah that was the best so you can put it
on oh that you detach Wow okay so well
that I I would imagine like as they're
putting the helmet on you they're
attaching the backpack to the hell jerk
like that I probably part of it right
that makes sense yeah um so you you go
in the light flickers and you like open
a door and you feel the door you see the
door and they are but you feel a real
door and you push the door open and you
see the door open and it's all one to
one and you're like there's no door in
real life no there is how you ooo gotcha
or walking and you're in like a an
eight-by-eight room yeah and you start
hearing like the the radio controller or
like whoever's leading the mission your
Ghostbuster friend in your ear yeah and
she's like oh there's been some
paranormal activity in here look out the
window and you look out the window and
it's like this you start to see like
ghosts on the other side of the street
and they're coming they're coming and
then like pass through and they're like
all right your proton packs are active
start shooting them and we just unload
all over this room with all your and you
just tear in this how many people are
with you so it's three total okay so we
need to other pm's me marking some
random okay
and we're just blessed in the things
ever and it feels great and it it has
that great yellow shame like I'm used to
with the with the proton pack and like
you would you know you would like shoot
the sink in the sink would blow are
right everything felt like it was
responding to what you were doing things
fell on the floor I shot it on the floor
again they moved again like it was stuff
we're like it wasn't can right right um
and then you've you know you make our
way through and then like okay keep
going and then another door opens and
you push that dorm you keep walking
forward so they build all these set
fairy structures so obviously they let
the next group is coming in right as
your I know I think they they make you
wait because you can like blow through
it oh I mean like there's certain
checkpoint yeah that trigger the next
secret got it but yeah it's only one at
a time were you getting any like
feedback like haptic feedback so here's
where it's cool little did I know but
the vest I was putting on was outlined
with hat locationally aware haptic
feedback sensors yeah so like the ghost
would like touch your left shoulder and
you feel your left shoulder there's a
scene in the original cool the original
Ghostbusters when the ghosts are kind of
invading the city and raised taking a
nappy sleeping and belt gets on book
right his is that sort of recreated in
the middle I didn't get I didn't have a
sexual experience with a paranormal in
sure that's not what you're not blocking
about maybe we're just giving a
centering say we go back yeah right
nobody go to this it's Tara ah I think
I'd remember okay having a thing sure
okay with a phantasm Omega anyway cool
is part of the whole thing that you you
so the next sequence you get to an
elevator and like door closes and the
floor is shaking you're like oh dan this
feels just like an elevator I believe
everything I'm saying I look to my left
it's like a metal grate I touch it if
they have a metal grate there feels like
that that's great and then the elevator
stops and this like little girl okay
start like a ghost girl yeah starts like
walking towards you she's like I'm cold
and you're like what the what is
happening did you shoot her she
is through the great yeah like in and
she's like in the elevator with you and
we're always like Oh what like you can
see mark and I just like bending on our
knees to like see her face and like
everything or just like this is creepy
she disappears then we look down the
hallway in the hall it goes on for like
you know hundreds of feet and you see
slimer coming at you as fast as he can
he passes through the great passes
through us yeah you feel the vibration
yeah as he's passing through you they
missed you oh that's great and you're
like what the hell is happiness really
amazing it was awesome was that built
the Miss thing built into the helmet or
you think is great question you don't
know and tragically i did not lift the
goggles during any of them did most of
it was like shitty like there's just an
intern with a spray bottle follow you
guys around really curious like what how
much of it is like i like how ugly it is
verse all I'm sure it's hideous and I'm
sure it's super bright too oh really
it's gotta be there's all the censoring
like you need light for that I'm sure
it's gotta be that makes sense right
yeah I guess so I was talking to some
folks at the verge and they were
pointing on do they just put out like
this big video feature on that
specifically in about 20 minutes at Cena
com okay great so everyone the same
future yeah but they would not let them
shoot on my page know which makes sense
I get it cuz it's also like if you're
talking about how you make one of these
things it's kind of a drag to like not
have that footage that's a feature for a
different time I guess like this is
something and I get it and I'm not
trying to defend these people yeah it
sucked that we couldn't shoot inside
there but i'm pretty sure it's ugly as
hell like like why no I attention to
detail just you're just trying to create
the illusion right it's probably really
funny looking because you're a
journalist Jeff yeah supposed to tell
the truth so then I'm gonna go out to
Utah yeah and and I actually and talk
they did yeah well there you go so the
next scene you get out of the elevator
and you're on this like scaffolding
outside oh no and like it fiat you're
like what meanwhile you're going through
madame tussaud's right yes hole closed
off thing they've devoted to the
Ghostbusters thing this is not like but
yeah you're how many rooms are you going
through though
felt like I'm sure they reused room yeah
because you enter the other and you go
back out uh okay I really felt like we
were maybe only in like a 800 square
foot place yeah you know if they be
funny if it weren't you have to like
walk through accounts payable and
they're like oh no the tour is coming
yeah so you get out you looks like
you're on the 40th floor of a building
on the outside on the scaffolding oh man
I would you harf you touch you see your
railing yeah go out you hold that
railing you feel it it's there they put
it there and then what do they do they
shake the whole goddamn thing and you're
like okay and then you have a whole Stay
Puft Marshmallow fighter yeah great it's
great all things great someone throw
marshmallows at you yeah like you finish
it and there's like goop everywhere and
you're like this is awesome yeah as you
can tell I loved it sure it would
because it was the best VR experience
I've ever had wow yeah it was better
than anything I've done by or anything
about is you have the physical right
achill you add another dealt out exactly
and to me like that's when VR becomes
otherworldly yeah like right now you
have this eight-hundred-dollar thing in
your apartment you can only it's clearly
do so much right and I think like this
is what VR makes sense for from you like
make it a theme park make it a fun right
like build it into places and that's
where people should experience it you
should pay the fifty dollars wherever it
is to go to the museum do the VR thing
like to me that 50 bucks is worth it
opposed to like buying right you know
hundreds of dollars and you know it's
funny is it it's the next generation of
that dumb like Captain EO ride from
Disney right exactly it's essentially
then yet where it's just like you know
finally we can have a ride that has like
fantastical visuals but the only way
they could do it before is a screen in
front of like a moving car right and now
it's like Wayne I compassion doing a
Star Wars oh my god amazing like you
could lose lightsaber stuff I'm sure
Disney's retest and like that's the best
part about it right it's like the void I
don't know how big of a company they are
the thing they're big right now but I
think they're gonna make a ton they're
gonna make a shitload of money because
the thing they have and they just have
to like move quickly I guess
the thing they've done is really great
the only thing that I would criticize
was like graphically it wasn't the moat
it was on par with like a mid-range VR
thing like it didn't look as good it
wasn't as bad as like a PlayStation beer
uh or was it comparable I think it was
maybe a little above a pea why yes via
graphical generation would you like what
console like s3 maybe like in between
two and three okay so it wasn't but
that's kind of what PS feels like like
that's where it says I'm saying it yeah
it wasn't remarkable legal you know
wasn't remarkable-looking but it wasn't
 because I guess all of the software
or the hardware has to be in the helmet
that's where i'm guessing or in the
backpack because the kids straight right
in the back right restroom yeah so to me
like all these backpacks or hat they
have computers they're running on
batteries that get charged every time a
group goes in and out because they have
two sets of equipment yeah so that's the
only concern for them as a business is
what sort of like hardware turnover they
have is they have to replace these
things every two years exactly like I'm
an offense a huge hit but when they get
to the point where there's like I don't
know like think about it like you all
they need to do is like pop in like a
1080 in there you know and then you're
like oh I'm doing amazing stuff that's
got to require a lot of processing power
though yes yes that's why a 1080 like
would do that a 1080 could give you but
any particular solution and of course
it's not easy I get it uh but they're
well on their way how long was it and
start to finish I want to see like seven
to ten minutes okay so that's relevant
because correct me if I'm wrong fifty
dollars right so so talk two dollars
gives you access to Madame Tussauds I'm
the beer guy Eric and that's if you
preorder it online it starts today in
Manhattan if you're in or a Manhattan
can you just do this go this is open to
the public and I also do public today
and that's cool yeah so I think wait in
line for Hamilton or do this and this
will be a lot cheaper yeah and you'll
probably get in same day yeah uh so yeah
that was really cool and then I mean I'm
kind of like burying the lead I got to
interview Ivan Reitman very cool which
was amazing yeah I talked to him for
like 10 minutes he was amazingly
gracious and super nice yeah and you
know we only took one little slice of
the interview for the for the video we
did on seen it but he is really and
obviously he's got to be optimistic
because he's producing the new Ghost
film and he's working together with the
void and all that but like he kind of
made me believe that he believed that VR
had some sort of future and storytelling
and that was kind of like the question i
put on my cool like is what is we are
gonna be like the way we watch movies
like is this what do you think this has
legs and he kind of convinced me is like
yeah you know it only like it's tough to
imagine the future like when people just
tell ghost stories by campfires like
that you know like that's what we had
that was our entertainment he's like you
can't tell those people like oh in 300
years you're not gonna believe what
you're gonna see in a room on screen
right of course that kind of thing and I
guess that's like maybe a kind of gross
example but um he just thinks like well
VR just makes sense because it only is
logical to eventually immerse yourself
in that story like why will we just
continue to tell a two-dimensional story
and I guess I guess I think I just think
there's gonna be room for both I mean
can I just mention one thing okay you
might not know this but if I was
interviewing Ivan Reitman I talked to
him about the fact that he's the voice
of slimer I did know that you did yeah
you know it didn't come up it didn't
occur to me to be like uh here's my
chance let's find out just the backs of
like the mental state yeah like how do
we prepare yourself to talk like Slimer
have someone else's like we asked him
about draft day I was like no man asked
about craft day I'll be was super super
kind I said like what what what is it
about ghosts likewise Ghostbusters one
of like the gems that like f has lasted
so long and withstood the test of time
and he said he thinks it's because um it
really is a comedy in in the Edit score
uh and you know he's like yeah ghosts
are scary dying is scary and like when
you have Bill Murray like laughing about
it it just makes you feel okay yeah like
just makes you think everything's gonna
be alright I'm like yeah that's that
makes a Davis a man totally right
like very downer subject but Bill Murray
Bill Maher she's gonna bring you out of
the out of the ether there so that was
uh that was it I just want to talk real
quick about the new Ghostbusters movie I
don't have any sort of expectations for
it whatsoever I want to see it I just
really want it to be good just to shut
everyone up of course and he did mention
the whole gender thing I'm like dude you
not to tell me that i'm not i'm not an
ass what did he say about it where he
kind of like highlight well he was
actually talking about the third
Ghostbusters movie that they were
planning oh yeah he said that before
harold ramis died they had planned a
sequel ghostbusters 3 where it was like
men women end creatures all being ghost
bus oh that sounds terrible we don't on
paper sure like my dreams you know the
whatever so here's my only like
reservation and I like the reason i love
the original ghostbusters it's for a lot
of reasons but like there's certain
things those movies did that I don't
know you know I don't know if they're
gonna do that sure now like stuff we're
like they go into like there's lore
about like vigo the carpathian wanted to
go into that stuff I'm just saying like
it was fun for me when Ray and Egon
would like talk about the deep fiction
history of these people yeah sure what
are like those are super nerdy and like
gozer the gozerian like they just talk
about Gozer for 10 minutes and they're
like 10 minutes you know what I'm saying
it's they like go Barry look they go
back but they tell you more okay I'm
curious if they'll have that kind of
stuff I just like that for me that's not
a male-female thing that is just like oh
I like that element to it they haven't
really established whether there is like
a big bad and based on the trailers it
looks like it's just a bunch of ghosts
running around I hope there's a big bit
i like big men yeah uh and then another
thing is like again nothing to do with
the other controversies that
have been going on with this movie but I
hope they trap ghosts man like like
there were traps and like I saw what the
new trap looks like now that but like I
have a feeling that some
the ghosts they're just gonna like blow
up and I just hope they don't do that I
think they'll trap some goes I just
don't play don't like shooter goes and
the ghost is like blows up than like
ghosts disintegrates I just don't want
to see ghosts dust I just want geez app
is that too much to ask what do you
think I know it's nitpicky it is
significant ceiling although I mean I
want to see him get trapped it i want to
see like i actually want to see where
they go right when they go to the Inca
machine right but like what happened
George I don't remember that all the
card addressed but it's like this
cavernous like weird and like the
negatives or like the what is it that
the neutron zone or whatever it is from
comic books it's like cloudy I'm just
like yeah it's like a reverse alternate
dimension and everyone's just fooling
around I see you're talking about like
you don't like beetlejuice dead feel
dead well that's what it looks like I
remember there was a real ghostbusters
cartoon yeah where I could have sworn
inside the containment unit was like
this cavernous like weird it looked at
urban area I know you're talking about
it it had likes to like they would be
like I just thought I'd floating in
space and then clouds and I'm like and
like Einstein's equation yeah fair to
you know like total nothing I would like
to see that in you know that seems like
a plot point where they have to over you
have to go in bright light level yeah
like that eatery with the ghost let's go
inside the containment unit yes oh
that's what I want all right enough of
ghostbusters you spent a lot of time on
that but that was my experience because
enjoyed here nuts yes arm so we're gonna
shift gears a little bit and talk about
uh Tesla okay so this is crazy so we you
and I have always talked about um you
know the notion of driverless cars and
how like look you know bring something
we really can't avoid like it just makes
sense it'll happen there's news
yesterday unfortunately tragically a
driver who is using Tesla's autopilot
feature Dinah Carrick it's really sad
obviously this is uh this is you know a
big first one but if that's the thing
like it's the first one so there's a
conversation around that so I don't know
um it's it's weird to you know and I
know this is like very soon after and
you know we obviously have to
yeah be mindful of the situation but at
the same time like this is something
that will affect a lot of the world very
soon yeah so let's talk about exactly
what happened with a car accident so as
I understand it he's using the autopilot
feature on the highway I guess yeah and
a truck essentially like cut him off or
pulled in front of him and the car
didn't know to slow down and just ran
into the back and he didn't see it
either apparently he didn't see the
truck I'm saying the report says that
like the driver nor the car saw the
incoming truck it was something about uh
both being back lit as well if you look
at Tesla's a press release about it
there's something about how neither the
car nor the driver could see the trailer
or the truck because they were basically
being blinded by a son the son yeah so
that's an issue I mean that's an issue
for humanizing I'm purifiers I mean one
thing to note about this this particular
individual is that he was like a really
big like Tesla fanboy autopilot advocate
I think he'd posted something like 40 or
50 videos like autopilot demos from his
own car to youtube so do you think he
was like pushing the limits of what auto
pilot can do or got you comfortable with
it maybe maybe got too comfortable I
don't want her to say the conversation
yeah right now well his last video that
he posted back in April was he was
merging or a truck was merging uh and
the driver of the truck didn't see the
car so he was like trying to merge the
autopilot kicked in noticed like oh my
getting it hit so he jerks over and then
he takes control and that was sort of
the whole and you guys see this video I
did not see that I think the verge
posted it yesterday or they found it and
noted that so I don't know it it's a
like what do you say like wow it's a
hoot alt is it we don't really know you
can't I don't I don't know that you can
say that it auto pilot small or the
driver's fault probably a combination of
both yes honest yeah there's no way auto
pilot like counteracts actions that the
driver wants to take right so if you
wanted to swerve out of ways truck the
autopilot was not like nope you can't do
that right as far
there's not a situation all our pilots
like no we're not doing we're not going
left right right now so i think all it
says at least for right now is obviously
the tech is still getting better don't
trust your life to the autopilot right
and I and I think like and again I I do
feel terrible using this this person's
death as an example and you know again
like no one's having fun with this
conversation but I think like you you
know we are going to very slowly
understand a world where like maybe
there's this transitional period where
there's like manual drivers and auto
drivers and like that's a potentially
complicated existence yeah Tesla offered
up the interesting stat point that 130
million miles have been covered using
autopilot and on average there's a
fatality every 94 million miles on
American roads for like normal cars so I
mean it's I also like don't want to hear
that you know I mean like it's
interesting we get your cars are safe
you know yeah I know there that you know
doth protest too much but it is
interesting that like even in this early
state of it's already been it's already
better yeah so you know unfortunately
like this is just something that was
going to happen um and you know it's
it's a really sort of difficult
situation yeah you're gonna say Peter
well I was just wondering if you click
into that because it the first thing I
read about this was the oh I think this
is the Tesla Tesla's press release about
it does it tells you exactly what
happens so when i read that initially I
was like well that seemed to me
logically it made sense I was like okay
it was a combination of driver and right
that's yeah you're right that's what
that press release reads like and
obviously they're going to position it
that way but but this was there talking
about here the the issue that happened
last month where this guy was trying to
auto park his car and it ran into a
trailer hmm so that's not that's a
separate story so he was out of the car
and like hit the button to auto park and
it's just it's just like didn't see the
back
the trailer and and so that's what that
 yeah it's weird and if we could
just like pivot away from dealing with
this specific accident it's for me it's
like men are we just doing too much too
fast like I get like look drivers are
terrible human drivers yuck human error
yeah so bad I can't like it's and it's
getting worse every time I get in the
way you are totally and and I think this
is still the way things are going but
this is essentially like the early days
of like laser eye surgery where we
accidentally gonna blind a few people as
le well and also like the technology is
not perfect so like oh you can't see at
night stuff like that right right so
it's like you know if you want to write
Billy on that cutting edge that's the
risk but here it's like oh but if we
screw up someone dies or gets blow mean
getting blinded is pretty damn sure it's
bad it's real bad yeah it's a difficult
thing to talk about I mean look it's
obviously it's up to the manufacturers
discretion before they release the sort
of thing to the public right there well
absolutely government to allow it yeah
yeah there's like that's thing like
we're just in uncharted territory in the
automotive industry with autopilot with
autonomous drive stuff it's just I hate
to say it and this isn't exactly how I
feel but my gut reaction is to say like
well like this is just gonna happen
or unfortunately work and people need to
understand and I think you know the
manufacturers also understand this I
think this is why Tesla says every time
autopilot is engaged you get this
warning that says this is beta etc etc
etc yeah it's not an excuse but they're
making it abundantly clear like don't
rely on this to thing to save your life
right so like wat so like what are they
trying to do with it then yeah is my
question right I get it it's an open
beta yeah but like it Laura right it's
your car it's like a baby won't have to
use it right exactly so the people that
want to use this crazy technology need
to know that it's dangerous and they're
presenting that is an act I feel like
whistle you might not know a few other
things but it's like the way you're
explaining it to me it's like this is a
beta yeah how is it okay for like the
person who's in a regular car on
highway like they're not erecting into
the beta right yeah that's true you know
like they're no but the problem is you
could never release something that's
fully fully tested um because you just
don't have a wide enough testing base so
like when you're in a closed beta
internally whatever let's say there's
300 people driving these things around
Tesla's factory whatever however they do
it you could you could pull that off
sure but it doesn't match the amount of
data that you collect from having new
year people sure yeah it's uh it's yes I
also want to know like how autonomous
autopilot is like yeah this is the thing
we're like you don't you can drive from
here right could you enter in and not
enter it or something like I don't know
the details of that I don't think it oh
I don't think so like could I put could
I pop in like Los Angeles and be like
sit back and relax we'll be there in
seven days I mean I think when you're on
the highway it's a different story i
think those do exist like the google
definitely has cars that can like do
that right but i don't know that the
Tesla's as they exist right now you can
just type in an address and and have it
go just go cuz that seems like a bad
idea huh I don't think we're there yet
no not there yet yeah all right there
you have it cuz you like knock out a
buddy of yours and just stick them in
the car and like he wakes up in Ohio
like all right you're going you're going
to Nebraska buddy live it up ah bring
back some corn oh man it's insane all
right oh let's bad black good prank yeah
don't be so screwed up to do that to
someone it's like in that episode of
silicon valley right he gets locked in
the you guys watching that show
I've missed the last few episodes uh I
just finished Ross seems to have this
unending lighting it's just so honest
and also hilarious at the same time that
I can't help but up like appreciate what
i thought was a good for now the first
season it's pretty good oh I I just
thought about a lot of that I'm steers
are you years of being in tech
journalism was like this is exactly what
it's like I looked at my girlfriend I
was like this is exactly what startup
life is like in that in that town yeah
they uh they do a pretty good job with
the references and so I've got there
micra mazing yeah yeah and he's got he's
got people working on staff that like
have yet
their RV Caesar worked in the industry
and stuff and no it's and he in these
jobs fakes we just ate one of his name
as I forget oh he's on he's a writer
he's like a consultant or something or a
writer and don't forget Steve Jobs uh
Mike judge himself had that not the
startup job but had like the data entry
you know boring oh he has a super
interesting backstory amazing yeah well
that's where office space yes i am from
yeah he was like a tech guy he was a
sort of engineer an inert road uh listen
to the interview that Marc Maron never
know that one yeah I was good really
good stuff and his voice like Mike
judges from these gotta be from the
south right like he's got that 20 from
yeah cuz his normal axis right cuz
that's what King the hills based on is
yeah oh yeah he talked about Austin I
think like that his normal voice is a
mix between a tank hill it's poor Hank
Hill and like a teacher from beavis and
butt-head ya like ya baba same kind of
thing like yeah totally I'm it Bobby
follow your hamper yeah it's pretty good
um alright what do you want to get into
next you were gonna talk about Lucky
Charms I've eletrical reason so there is
a newspaper for this but i wanted to
mention this because i was thinking
about today in the shower and you're
thinking about how I'm really an eight
year old at heart and I eat brick or
breakfast about Lucky Charms know I've
been eating puffins lately which require
those are good um but every once in a
while I'll I'll get lucky charms cuz i
am a child way real quick with you still
eat cereal i haven't had a bowl of
cereal and I couldn't tell you how long
all right I kind of still do cuz i have
to get all I'm so that gets around me I
also only do yesterday guys are just
like not bill for right for the real
world what was it oddly that's quite the
ops I know I know I know great lecture
me on like this but seriously what was
your breakfast of choice grown up and
we'll go a serial wise yeah I loved
cinnamon toast crunch like in middle
school high school yeah we growing up it
was probably like it was a mix fruit
loops max lucky charm yeah like
everything see I never did the fly never
dig it up that like I feel like fruity
pebbles yes yes cocoa puffs what about
you Russ uh I grew up and there was like
a lot of health-food like forced upon me
and like multivitamins that clearly it
worked out cuz im so hard he now and
then so i think i probably
overcompensated when i went to school
and had a bunch of junk food and now
I've said yes puffins is like the most
sweet breakfast I'll have okay cinnamon
life oh yeah that's very good Oh have
you had cinnamon life I ever know and
then we'll buy a box then just be like
yeah oh honey honey nut cheerio great
yeah uh I was marshmallow alphabets I
remember that interesting this was like
the cut that the Lucky Charms competitor
yeah okay like oh you got shapes and
scrap we're gonna do the letters we saw
whatever you want spell stuff freedom of
speech and then like frosted frosted
mini-wheats man yeah give me some that
all day all right I mentioned Lucky
Charms because i was thinkin bout today
in the shower and how everyone knows the
shapes right you got clovers overs
moving horseshoes rainbow red balloon
mark Oh young added like 20 years ago
recently the chin star apparently was
added yeah what there's too many but you
just by the way you can buy just packs
of just the marshmallows on amazon yeah
that's this gonna go is it or is it yeah
I know I need them now disgusting so but
I want to talk about the shapes of the
oat things which get no attention
whatsoever because no one gives a
about what the the non marshmallow
pieces in Lucky Charms like the exes in
the yeah right so like exes I'm looking
at pictures now there's like a tree what
here look there's like a totally cut
there like like on the right a minute
they're like weird religious symbols
yeah there's like a Jesus fish here
across that a bell was like a bell maybe
but like what does that have to do with
Lucky Charms that is
you're right so like what is the
backstory with those shapes I hope you
have an answer I don't is that a cat and
that one that orange and white thing
where this looks real no that's the
shooting star oh it's kind of messed up
it's like the more you know they were
really ambitious with that one I mean it
is pretty impressive cuz like these are
multicolored what did they do with them
the clover why is it that a hat now here
no like oh the clover yeah I don't know
it has a clover on it yet it's a it's a
leprechaun cap it didn't used to be that
way did it I don't know maybe it is
pretty impressive how detail they are
considering how small and like cheap
they are that's we're so weird that's
what American innovation that's what
that these weird shapes what are they I
don't know I somebody somebody's got to
find out yeah please I mean I'll do a
little research maybe next episode and
we'll hold right no we should do this
what Oh cereal oh god why'd you even
have to do you want the serial link up
just just to bring that up well if that
joke happened miraculously by itself
okay wanted to pivot into the cereal
thing did you hear what happen hold on
hold on yeah going back to Syria really
quickly how long is Syria food kellogg's
gonna have a pop-up in times square
because why not a pop-up is it's a
limited availability sort of store that
just happens to pop up for a day or we
marketing done I know voxpop this helps
to well you know people at home that may
not know it's not everyone lives in
merrick city and gets a pop-up right I
guess you're right i damaged point is
kellogg's is going to be selling bowls
of whatever branded cereal that you want
they just give stuff away right guess
how much a bowl of cereal is gonna be
frosted flakes at this Papa a change I'm
school should be too down to be free
it's an advertising right pop-ups are
usually associated with free seven
dollars and fifty six shoved off
understand why is this who's gonna pay
is more to it than that right you get
something else yeah I've been a hand get
the bowl maybe you get the better be a
maybe better tickle you still I'm gonna
I don't want to pay that much for Bulls
here
in a plastic bowl what am I gonna do
that plastic bowl for the rest of the
day it's a souvenir well do New York
here it's got the I Love New York on it
welcome that's all right on ebay theory
or two dollars so apparently Pixar has a
serial cafe where in in pixar you get
there's like a space in their offices
where you just walk up and there's like
every serial on the planet and just so
they're a bar and eat cereal well there
is a local a serial only place shoe
retailer called kith and he opened a the
guy who runs it and opened a store in
Brooklyn that has cereal and sneakers
mm-hm what century is it they still
skateboards to know he's missing
skateboard strictly oh ok so I'm sorry
I'm reading about this pop-up so
apparently I'm not saying this excusas
it but the idea is it so it's cereal
it's not a normal bowl of cereal though
you order like a special so there's
called life in color which is froot
loops with as lime zest marshmallows and
passion fruit jam Jesus and it's all
designs by chef Christina Tosi founder
and owner of Momofuku Milk Bar so
they're like fancy desserts Hey look now
now we know why are a low I'm not saying
so much you say but yeah that much ah
going to the other cereal news of the
week this is unprecedented the I mean
it's not but its energy rare or the
exact formation of how this happened I
agree it's pretty rare the path to this
yes the path to this is unprecedented ah
this is amazing so 2014 NPR debut was at
NPR that didn't yeah part of it yep
debuted podcast called cereal it was
about this man and add an on-site as I
eat yeah it was one case for the one
case season whole season podcast yeah he
was convicted and sentenced to life for
the murder of his at the time girlfriend
and now all these years later 16 years
later he is getting a retrial yeah now
they've talked to the lawyers is that
this is pretty much a direct result of
the bucket
% oh yeah no question she's unbelievable
it is that it isn't so if you think
about the law like the legal system
right now it is so overloaded and so
like time constrained and so rushed so
the idea that like you would have 12 or
however many people work on serial
full-time staffers researching a case
versus one in this case very overworked
defense attorney I'm not saying he's
innocent or guilty but the reason he's
getting a new case is because they
determine that his defense attorney did
not do a proper confident was
essentially incompetent yum now is the
up now is a big theme in that podcast
yeah yeah totally so so I mean this all
this goes the show is like if someone's
willing to take the time L you know a
lot of documentaries strive to do this
as well which is we're gonna focus on
something that no one else has the time
limit and Jay King a murder like that
for sure you know it's a interesting you
mention that because a lot of people
feel like it was not an accurate
portrayal of what happened to make a
murder but or like the sea world thing
which is obviously very accurate not
obviously yielded a lot of change and
probably will sink sea world as a brand
eventually right yeah that's that I
think we're all okay with that these but
I mean that's what it goes like it's if
you look at it on the surface it's kind
of ridiculous that podcast did this but
it's also like hey someone took the time
to like dig so deep and national yeah
was not only that it was fine
investigative that was great amazing she
really did a great job trying to keep it
um even-handed and I think so yeah I
mean if she's constantly guessing
herself she's constantly questioning
yourself ashley says every week like I
don't know then I think about this and
like a the I think the lack of evidence
is staggering in this case the Baltimore
judge has cook it says from the story in
The Guardian has said categorically that
the original guilty verdict 16 years ago
lacked foundation right like some on it
was all based on this cell phone data
that was determined to be not exactly
accurate accurate right now again like
there are a few things in the story that
like kind of do make sense for the
conviction although sure I think it the
door swings both ways right idea so yeah
this is really good if you also remember
during that first season
the reporter forget her name she goes to
was it a college right and she was
getting the help of interest sir and
like and her yeah and litigation to rape
but it was a group that innocent
Edmonton yeah yeah like and they didn't
they come to the conclusion that I was
there there wasn't enough evidence or
that he just wasn't guilty I believe the
earth did with the language was
something around like unanimously they
all thought this was this need to go to
retrial they're so yet something didn't
shake out right yeah it's you're right
it's amazing it really is amazing uh
there you have it I don't know why
really hope you don't do it yeah after
all he hasn't liked not a hope that he's
innocent hope that he did not murder her
right i wreck I don't want to cheer for
the zone no it's amazing how much time
we've all like spent listening to this
story and hit him specifically like his
interviews I find the most interesting
because like you're hearing directly
from any sounds honest but then there's
all this crazy of his buddy Jay like
knowing the location of the body but
like he could there's like all sorts of
love it's really interesting it's a it
really is unfortunately it's real like I
wish this was like a crime drama yeah I
don't like then that's and unfortunately
like the podcast glamorized this entire
thing like that which I kind of have a
little bit of an issue but otherwise it
wouldn't happen you're right exactly um
this whole thing kind of reminds me of
this new show coming on HBO called the
night of yeah that girl's a lot like
started yeah uh with John Tudor oh yeah
I don't watched yet it's like a true
crime it's like a mini series series
yeah so looks interest it feels like
it's like oh true detective the bed
and this is how we replace it I guess so
it's am only a minute I need to watch
true detective season were season one is
really good just our shoot some second
our second season scarf season one for
me some of the best television I've ever
seen yeah it's a bold statement I mean
look I saw the best VR so this ever the
and true detectives all the superlatives
check in the box look here's what it is
um alright we only have a few more
minutes um on our program we have been
tackling the great social issues of our
day and Peter ha
we really gonna talk about this do you
not want to I don't know if I can just
touch it's not applicable to anyone
really outside of i think it is actually
well specifically they like what about
the airport airport waiting to talk
about so a snowman we planned a dog
about the subway who are you going to
last every everyone's but most people
have been to the airport i'd say
everyone's been on a subway especially
in New York yeah I'd say the majority of
our listeners have been on an airplane
okay at least once so so what what is it
any here what drives you nuts what
grinds your gears and hand relate this
to like the social sort it's either the
security line or it's the onboarding
process okay either of you have a
preference oh so my I have some
interesting things about the onboarding
process that I'd like to talk about but
but so let's do that I'm boarding yeah
let's do it why don't they just let
everyone on from the back to the front
right soso Mythbusters did us an episode
on this okay interesting i didn't know
that I know timing wise it doesn't make
a difference but to me I'm just myth
Mythbusters did a thing and I believe
and they like added all the variables
that come with that right so like all
right so you do the back first you're
like people don't get to the terminal
when they should so yeah at the majority
of the people let's say are there I'd
say half are really yeah just have like
I don't know man these days I show I
want to be the last person on the plane
like I don't go and they call me out
razy cuz I don't want to check my bag so
I'm what should I agree I agree if I
don't have to chip I don't have a bag to
bring on no I wouldn't let prefer to be
the last proto a hundred percent all
right he i've been i've been flying two
to three times a year for like a decade
now right I've found that if i have a
carry-on thing I wait to the end so that
I could check it for free um then we'll
tuck then it's always the first bag off
right because it's the last bag on so
when you get to the terminal you gotta
go out through the baggage claim area
anyway a half hour I've never waited for
that situation and it is specific I've
only waited 15 minutes tops sometimes
you will get lucky if you get check
because when
you arrived and they bring it actually
up to you yes on the walkway water
better yeah right so I've been traveling
quite a bit the last month I'd say how
often I've gone to Korea have gone to
chicago I've gone to Denver Portland
whoa and back Wow all the last like four
weeks that's also quite a bit so I it's
we ask this guy whatever way that's very
really yeah but here's the problem to
your point no one's ever at the gate on
top actually that I can't verify that
but what I will say is that everyone
just somehow doesn't understand what
their ticket says okay so it's like zone
one is boarding and then some asshole
who's supposed to be in zone four or a
group of them come up right just like
what are you doing what are you don't
act stupid so using illegal that
literally get to the gate agent they're
like no you have to go around but you
have to go back just the weight browse
lightly why I was telling this to Vinnie
on our flight out to LA yeah whatever
without fail every flight I'm on there's
a gaggle of people hoarding around the
gay just waiting just waiting and I'm
like what sit the hell down your
boarding Group G okay hold on so this
this is where I have to jump in and had
on the telly cuz he's this is my process
he's that guy he's admitting I give me
my process I almost never checked bags
like really strive I never checked bags
you guys it's not that never so no but
no and it's important because it's like
I don't want to don't you go to Syria
not check a bag I didn't check about
your absence not there if you're if I'm
traveling for four days there's no words
to check a bit yeah it's fine so it's a
very important for me to get on the
plane as quickly as possible because I
want to make sure I've overhead space
yep yeah I get it I do i do not jump to
like if I'm Group C let's say I'm not
gonna start boarding when it's group a
but as B is petering out i will get in
line right into prov the promo you're
part of the problem too no no no no no
me is petering out so it's like the end
of beer do you see the end of the the
group in front of you and like they're
gonna call my group anyway and they
never stop you if it's allright so
you're complaining about the people from
group five standing up when that one
anything crazy it's stupid but like even
before they even call a group there's
people
they're like group for guy the religious
emails about everyone else and i will i
will start getting towards the entry
point to the land God before my you know
so it's that and then I angle it's that
mentality yeah that leads to the the
situation and a half not everyone is
actually smart enough to think about it
that way people just assume like I don't
know what my ticket says I clearly can't
read so I think this is my group on yeah
that's not what I'm doing I'm just
unboxing everyone else yeah out so I can
go when it's fine you're not giving to
look it's a level of strategic and and I
adhere to I understand what you guys are
saying I also think you should really
rethink the whole checking bag thing no
no that is not as last time I checked a
bag they lost dance what I'm saying that
happens and then ever ended early did it
even happens one person doesn't matter
it's too much one more cent is not bad
it's too much for me my bag father when
I was flying to germany for some press
junket whatever years in your cell no no
okay right it never actually left JFK
and they couldn't find the bag for six
months and I'm like smarter terrible
it's not to mention like what they do
your stuff the stuff in your bag when
it's behind closed doors you've seen all
those videos like people well whatever
they're just like breaking Japanese and
a deal again that's why luggage is
durable man well but they have to open
and check everything they see why 20
buttock it did they don't know first of
all god you're mean to these people I've
seen a lot of videos so doesn't it
happens of course it happens but like
they're not all criminals oh and you're
one hundred percent right but why bother
taking the risk why not just keep my
stuff with me because bother me I was in
LA for six days I gotta bring like ten
nice shirts to wear what I because I
wear to shirt today that sounds like a
personal problem yeah cuz you can't wear
learn how to pack you can't wear a dress
shirt during the day do your whole thing
and then go out at night in the same
shirts I paratus oh and even it so fine
and also you're disgusting and sweaty so
like we've already a step ahead
specifically how sweaty and gross you
get in the summer months III is
particularly that case so although your
diff I get really sweaty yes
no what I've done last year I all my
switch to merino wool what yeah Myrtle
my arena wool in the summer yeah this is
a merino wool shirt I wanna know why
yeah I do anti back it has like anti
microbial antibacterial properties
whatever see you actually wear it other
than once even if you sweat its cool
sweating it oh it's like something it's
like I'm a crowded stuff so I can't wrap
it like sure like cotton yeah I like the
Jeff typed in marina like it's a boat
place that's what it sounded sorry also
going back to the the flying thing I've
got into the habit now of just paying
the 15 or 20 extra bucks if it's
available to me to board first and oh
cut through security yeah and to me I'm
like the Pens totally working to version
does that you do plus right or ever it's
called check pre-check pre-checked uh
not yet I have an interview for that
okay in a couple weeks I have your wagon
amazed if you if you travel as much no
it's not worthless now everyone has
everyone has it I really do you say
pre-check like they're the times an
article about age now it can be here
it's just a text online take your shoes
off or take your laptop editor back sure
that alone is worth it fine but again
it's like what's the stop I just I don't
know I don't I don't see the illusion
like it's an illusion of safety what do
you mean like they're Tomatoes illusion
of safety it's just about convenience
right now I understand lady I say we're
not terrorists right like we're gonna do
a background check on you like if this
the first time you decided to look I'm
terrible weather you're going through
the TSA PreCheck line or the regular
check line it doesn't it's it boils down
the TSA for sure and they suck no matter
what sure yeah it's a problem where you
know what information they gather from
you beyond just like a basic background
check before I think a fingerprint you
uh you have to give me your basic like
Social Security I think your history of
your address is basically like 57 years
back I work history etc yeah uh mark has
it he it depends on the airport to write
like not every air bubbles abortus
errant arm some gates like I know in
Newark the the term excuse me terminal a
doesn't do it sure like only the other
ones do and he looks a huge
airport here's what I'm curious about so
a friend of mine remy is Mel who's an
independent developer he's from each I
know him hes from egypt he keeps a
website a tumblr i guess it is whatever
of how many times he gets stopped at the
airport yeah which is extremely
frequented sixty percent of the time
right i won why because if what do you
want like that's who they're stopping
unfortunately I know um so I'm curious
whether if he signed up I don't nobody
could because he's not a US citizen but
if you signed up or someone of Egyptian
descent with an Egyptian name signed up
for that and pre check whether that
would cut down on the number of times
you're getting stopped yeah I don't know
kind of interesting it's an interesting
question he's a very funny dude he is
yeah and very driven yeah I'm very
impressed by his drive yeah he makes
some good games um yeah let's I'm glad
you brought that up you just got the
three of us mad is what you did but
they're not friday yeah well done yeah
nothing to get mad at because this is a
great show yeah a lot of fun always you
have to be back soon once again Sam well

the last one was here is probably tears
