here and today I have with me an LG
optimus g pro from AT&amp;amp;T now we already
took a look at this handset back in
March when it debuted at mwc in Spain
but that was an unlocked version aside
from a few design changes in the absence
of a TV antenna however the u.s. model
is pretty much identical to its global
counterpart around its edges you'll get
a nice faux metallic trimming and on the
left side here is a shortcut key to
launch the note-taking app quick memo 18
PSG pro still has the gorgeous 5.5 inch
full HD IPS display with a 1920 x 1080
pixel resolution 400 PPI and a 16 by 9
aspect ratio as for camera options it
has a 13 megapixel camera that can shoot
1080p full HD video and a front-facing
2.1 megapixel camera some features
include dual recording mode which lets
you record with both cameras
simultaneously HDR shooting and time
catch which lets you take photos before
you press the shutter now the 4g LTE
device is powered by a 1.7 gigahertz
quad-core cpu along with the HTC One and
the samsung galaxy s4 the g pro is one
of the first u.s. phones to feature the
superfast Qualcomm Snapdragon 600
processor once you open the battery door
you'll be able to access the handsets
removable 3.14 ampere hour battery now
we haven't conducted a battery drain
test yet on this model but the unlocked
version yielded about seven hours
straight of video playback and a
whopping 22 hours of talk time lastly
the device runs on Android 4.1 point2
jelly bean so you'll get a bunch of your
standard Google features like chrome
messenger and a search based digital
assistant Google now additional features
include 2 gigs of ram 32 gigs of
on-board storage and 64 gigs of
expandable storage via a microSD card
and NFC
if you're interested the phone will be
available on May tenth for 1 99 99 with
a two-year contract and if you're really
eager pre-orders begin on May third
again I'm Lynn and you've been checking
out ATT's LG optimus g pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
