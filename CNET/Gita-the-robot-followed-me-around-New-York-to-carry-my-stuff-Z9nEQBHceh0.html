of thing you want to be carrying
groceries but I can keep my hands in my
pockets because I got this little buddy
to help me
this is cheetah a robot designed to
follow you around and carry your stuff
40 pounds of stuff to be exact
I took a prototype bot out for a spin on
the streets of New York City to see what
it was like to have my own robot helper
buddy Gina was created by Italian
company piaggio you know them as the
makers of the Vespa scooter but this two
foot tall cargo bot was born from a
research team based in Boston the only
thing is to get it to follow you you
have to wear this belt they're working
on getting that technology to be a
little smaller this not so sexy spaceman
fanny pack is loaded with cameras that
are mapping out the area around me
there are also cameras on all sides of
the jito the system blends the data
together so it knows where I am going
while also not crashing into people
walking between us the team is working
on shrinking this belt down is just
something you just have to clip on a
pocket my demo cheetah behaved only when
I walked slowly but it has the potential
to follow its owner on a run or a bike
ride traveling up to 22 miles per hour
if you keep it at walking speed the
battery's gonna last eight hours now
this being a prototype my trip was a bit
of a bumpy ride sometimes it had trouble
syncing with my belt and someone from
the team would have to jump in to steer
it with a remote control one of the
wheels wouldn't light up and it also got
a bit banged up following you through
doors is still a work in progress that
said you better be going somewhere that
has an elevator it weighs around 50
pounds so you do not want to lunge this
upstairs when you're ready to unload
there is a fingerprint scanner to keep
your stuff secure and alarms are gonna
sound off if someone tries to mess with
your bot with its zero turning radius
the nimble cheetah has potential to be
helpful in businesses like hospitals or
hotels
it can also be pre-programmed with a map
of a facility so it can travel a sec
it's being tested in enterprise
situations over the next year and after
that we could see a version for the
consumer side so you may want one to
carry groceries home or schlep those
heavy textbooks to class so are you
ready to live in a future with robot
pets that follow you around because it's
not a fantasy anymore for Sina I'm
