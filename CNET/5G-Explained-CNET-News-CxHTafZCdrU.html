about every eight or ten years the
mobile network technology that connects
your phone to the network changes and
this is the next big step up it should
be faster and it should be more reliable
the industry is excited about 5g because
it gives them a lot more capacity in the
network which means that when you're in
a crowded area like a stadium or a
crowded city your phone is actually
going to work instead of just having
that spinner spinning says you're not
getting your data 5g also lets the
network operators talk to a lot of
different types of devices Internet of
Things that's going to be farm silos
drones cars factory robots there gonna
be a lot of new things that can attach
to the network that don't use the
network today part of the reason they're
excited about that is because 5g is
going to have very low communication
delays so for example one self-driving
car can talk to another and get an
answer fast enough that it can be useful
another reason is because it's going to
use less power so something like a
networked temperature sensor is
economically viable it's something you
can use to run your business
we should see 5g arriving in 2019 for
the networks and the phones we have
tests going on right now in lots of
different parts of the world in fact
there are a lot of people bragging about
how they already have 5g running now but
those are preliminary versions of the
technology so well first see it in 2019
and broader availability showing up in
2020 and beyond</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
