paste and it's attracting a lot of
attention here on the floor at the 2015
frankfurt auto show because it is
Jaguars first crossover SUV you see this
dialing it resembles the sea x 17
concept that we saw a couple of shows
ago and under the hood this particular
model is powered by a 3-liter v6 engine
with a supercharger the little s badge
on the front lift you know that it has
380 horsepower there's also a lower
output version that has 340 horsepower
now what's interesting about this
vehicle and what surprises me the most
is that we will be getting a 2 litre
diesel option later on after launch the
dish was going to put out 180 horsepower
but almost 320 pound feet of torque
which is going is going to have a lot of
grunt in addition to be pretty efficient
on the road every f pace is going to
have an 8-speed automatic transmission
and jaguars on demand all-wheel drive
system as well as the new in control
suite of infotainment connectivity apps
the FA is going to hit American roads in
early 2016 and v6 trim for about forty
three thousand dollars that diesel
option is going to follow for about
forty one later on that year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
