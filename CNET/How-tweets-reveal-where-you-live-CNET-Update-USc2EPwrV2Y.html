coming from inside your house I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update just when you think it's safe to
tweet comes another website to shake you
up about security the site we know your
house calm shows how your location data
can be used against you without you
being aware it pulls in tweets that have
location turned on and when someone uses
the word home so if you tweet about
being bored sitting at home and you
forget that locations turned on voila
it's easy to deduce where you live and
you're on the website with a photo we've
seen this before with sites that show
who is talking about being on vacation
with please Rob me calm it's all to
bring awareness to over sharing of
course not every tweet it pulls is
actually someone's home but it still
shows how easy it is to reveal more than
you like by not being aware of your
location settings so to shake off that
creepy feeling cheer yourself up with
discounted nooks and iPhones Barnes &amp;amp;
Noble has draw prices on the nook tablet
and no color making it competitive with
Google's Nexus 7 tablet and those price
drops are also because a new line of
Amazon Kindles will be coming out soon
we're also seeing retailers cut iphone
4s prices to prepare for a new iPhone
model expected to be announced in
mid-september tis the season for deals
that is if you don't mind having an
older model in other stories were
watching google has acquired the Travel
Guide provider frommer's google also
acquired Zagat last year so this is just
another push into the travel and reading
space Facebook's life events section now
that you announce when you're having a
baby just don't yourself a favor and
actually call your family before posting
to Facebook yeah thanks things aren't so
great at groupon the wall street journal
reports that hundreds of employees are
trying to jump ship and find a new job
the journal says sales people are upset
with their pay and how they're being
treated and GameMaker Electronic Arts
believes that in the next two or three
years there will be more digital games
sold than boxed games an executive at EA
told Reuters that it's seen an increase
of downloaded mobile and free-to-play
games they share alone there are more
than 40 such games available from EA
and on the note of video games the Neo
Geo is back for those that love classic
games the neogeo x gold package comes
out December 6th for two hundred dollars
it's a handheld with 20 pre-loaded games
like fatal fury and the king of fighters
and it also come with a joystick and
donking station so you can output it to
your television if two hundred bucks
sounds like a lot well then just think
