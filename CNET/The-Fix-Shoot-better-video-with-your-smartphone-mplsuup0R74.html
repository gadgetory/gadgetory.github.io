really good looking video from your
smartphone I'll show you how to make
better use of the built-in tools you
already have Plus how to upgrade with
some affordable accessories lighting is
everything but even if the lighting
looks right your phone might end up
exposing the wrong area so use your
camera's exposure and focus lock feature
to set the lighting and keep it that way
throughout the recording
if audio is important and the video
isn't terribly long there's a simple
trick for getting clearer audio just cup
your hand around the microphone tour the
direction of the audio that way noise
you don't want gets filtered out finally
don't forget about composition just like
with still photography use the rule of
thirds to place your subject away from
the center to make a more interesting
shot with those tips you're already
leagues ahead of everyone else but if
you really want to step up your game get
some add-ons even a little bit of jitter
can ruin a great video so if keeping
your elbows firmly to your side won't
cut it
use a stabilizing accessory these range
in price and style but the point is that
they give you one-handed control that
cuts out a lot of the shake that can
often ruin smartphone videos this one
from Photojojo is great because it also
flips out into a mini tripod or you can
screw off the top and mount it on a
standard tripod if you want clearer
louder sound out of mic there are plenty
of cheap options but this one's from
Dayton and it's only 20 bucks on Amazon
and finally the default app on your
phone is fine for basic recording but
apps open up a whole world of features
and if you're too lazy to edit there are
even apps like Magisto which
automatically splice together your
footage for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
