and the next generation for video games
is here to stay it's a Throwdown
showdown for game console supremacy
between Sony's PlayStation 4 and
Microsoft's Xbox one now we're bringing
out the a-team for this one our judges
for this fight are CNET senior editor
Scott the bottom line Stein senior
editor Dan the man Ackerman
senior associate editor Jeff the
Backstreet Boy Bakalar and you know who
really a big tome will take all four
judges scores in ABS amount to the
nearest tenth the final prize fight
score will be an average of all rounds
using the same decimal system this is
just the first battle of many so let's
get it on
round 1 is designed both consoles get a
completely new be design for the next
gen with piano black and matte black
finishes but that's where the
similarities end
Sony's ps4 brings a sleek and edgy
design that can lay flat or stand
vertically with a slick LED on the side
it's almost half the size of the Xbox
one and there is no power supply now
Microsoft's Xbox one takes a step back
with the design that's too big and too
square it's just bulky and let's not
forget you also have its massive power
supply the good thing is probably one of
the quietest consoles ever but add in an
even bigger Kinect sensor and this
system is anything but sleep Sony brings
one of the best console controllers
we've ever felt with a tight design that
just feels right and we can't wait to
see how the clickable touchpad will be
taken advantage of in the future
Microsoft's Xbox one controller is still
bulkier it's analog sticks do feel
tighter it's a solid controller and the
most noticeable improvement is the
vibration feedback in the triggers that
really does enhance gameplay Sony
strikes first with a 4.5 and Microsoft
gets a three
to his navigation and interface the ps4
recalls the single bar interface for the
ps3 it's simple and clean to use but it
feels even more stripped-down than ever
before now the Xbox one's interface
takes a cue with the Windows 8 look and
feel it's pretty straightforward on the
surface but you'll have to go an extra
layer deep to pin favorite apps and
there are redundant links to the
different storefronts with too much
promotional material right now it also
brings voice control with the Kinect to
navigate through the interface and even
real multitasking with its Snap feature
ex-boss snap but talking to your Xbox
can be hit or miss there's times where
it's definitely better looking than the
ps4 s but you'll have to dig a lot
deeper to find some of the settings
you're used to the ps4 takes another
round with the three point eight and the
Xbox one gets a three chapter abs in two
rounds sony has a pretty chunky lead
round three is hardware this round is
all about the hardware features that set
these two consoles apart and if you've
heard about the GPU and memory
architecture benchmarks devs have hinted
that the ps4 has more power but we
haven't seen any of those advantages
right now and it always comes down to
how developers take advantage of the
platform's now the Xbox one comes with a
Kinect that helps you navigate the
interface it takes Skype calls and it's
really a key part of the experience that
feels like you're in the future when it
works now the ps4 s camera is optional
it has some basic commands it does come
in real handy if you're into twitch
streaming but let's be real it's
optional for a reason the Xbox one also
brings HDMI pass-through which is a
first on a gaming console and makes this
more than just a gaming machine to
switch between TV viewing and gaming
both bring blu-ray players but the ps4
supports 3d blu-rays out of the box and
the Xbox one doesn't just yet the ps4 is
a console that stays true to its gaming
roots but doesn't really bring any
significantly groundbreaking hardware
features so the Xbox one
takes this round with a 4.3 and the ps4
gets a three next round is game library
when new consoles launch it tends to be
pretty slim pickings and this is no
different
you have the same third-party titles on
both consoles like Call of Duty ghosts
an assassin's creed black flag for all
you fans of pirates and the open water
but you're not going to see any major
differences between the two even from
the current gen consoles at times now
Sony brings really two first party
titles with Killzone Shadowfall that
looks gorgeous but doesn't really do
anything more than that and a quirky
game called neck plus a few downloadable
in details like resogun but there's
really nothing that stands out here and
says by me now Microsoft brings better
launch titles overall like Dead Rising 3
for zombie fans Forza Motorsport 5 which
for the record is really hard to say to
the Kinect Ryse son of Rome looks and
sounds great and there's downloadable
titles like killer instinct that at
least gives you a chance to show off
your system but again there are no
killer titles here in fact if you want
to show people the potential of next gen
consoles just take a look at NBA 2k14 on
both of them and that's what's up now
neither system pulls away here but
Microsoft brings a slightly better batch
of titles and we know this is going to
change in the next 6 months and years to
come but on launch microsoft takes this
round with a 3 and sony gets a 2.3 so
after averaging 4 rounds the Xbox one
only trails by one tenth of a point
round 5 the software features and online
services each console has their own
yearly membership service to access
online gaming Sony has a PlayStation
Plus that also gives you access to free
games for $50 a year and Microsoft's
Xbox Live Gold service cost $60 for a
year now one difference is that there
are a variety of video streaming apps
like Netflix Amazon Prime and Vudu on
both consoles but you'll need that
yearly online service on the Xbox one to
use them on the ps4 you can just use
them without a PlayStation Plus
membership now both consoles have so
many software features and services so
we'll talk about some of the key ones on
the ps4 twitch streaming is really the
killer app here it'll
other people to watch you game online
with commentary and all I can say is
don't knock it unless you tried it the
Xbox one has the twitch app to view
content but you can't stream from it
just yet
the ps4 has better social integration
with deep hooks to Facebook and what
type of stuff you want to share if
you're into sharing your gaming trophies
and don't want to attract girls and the
ps4 also brings remote play that finally
makes the PS Vita useful and allows you
to play your game from a different room
on the same network with your Vita now
the centerpiece software feature on the
Xbox one is the ability to connect your
cable TV signal through it and interact
with it directly through the Xbox
interface it will sync up with most
cable guides and you can use your
controller or voice commands to navigate
through it it's really special when it
works but there were many times where it
couldn't understand some TV stations and
commands by voice it's really an Xbox
layer on top of your cable box because
you'll have no DVR access right now so
you're back to using your same cable
remote in those situations this could be
a killer feature but it still needs a
lot more polish
now you can Skype and the camera tracks
you during a video conversation which is
really cool a Microsoft smart glass app
on iOS and Android allows you to
interact and deliver additional second
screen content while watching certain
videos and playing games and yes the ps4
has its own app but it's not nearly on
the same level both consoles can record
and edit clips that you can share with
friends but the Xbox one just isn't as
hooked into social networks compared to
the ps4 right now overall we're giving
the ps4 the edge here with a 3.5 and the
Xbox one gets a 3 the final round that
decides it all is value Sony's ps4
system is 399 and Microsoft's Xbox one
is $4.99 and for your information both
include the HDMI cables now the reality
is that if you care about online gaming
you're also going to shell out an extra
50 to 60 bucks with the Xbox one it's
more expensive but you're paying for the
potential of the new Kinect camera and
the HDMI pass-through and investing in
them for the
with a ps4 you're getting the system
that's dedicated to gaming isn't worried
about taking over your living room now
it really depends on what's more
valuable to you and it's probably even
too early in the game to tell our judges
are calling this a tie at 3.5 points a
piece so let's average out all six
rounds and after a back-and-forth battle
where the ps4 jumped ahead early but the
Xbox one fought right back
it's the ps4 that holds on to take this
first matchup of many just edging out
the Xbox one three point four to three
point three and is your prize fight
winner the next generation for gaming is
here but if you ask any of our judges
we'd probably say that neither console
is a must-buy right at this moment now
if you had to push me I'd probably lean
towards the Xbox one because it has more
promise to be more than a gaming console
but then the hardcore gamer in me says
ps4 this isn't an easy decision it won't
be the last time we face these consoles
against each other and it's really a
battle that will be decided in the next
three to five years but the ultimate
decision always comes down to you
I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching it
will catch you guys next time for
another prize fight
