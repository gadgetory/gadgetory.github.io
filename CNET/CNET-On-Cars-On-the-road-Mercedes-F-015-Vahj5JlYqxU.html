$6,000 audio upgrades are basically a
way to make your time in prison more
pleasant you're still suffering under
the tyranny of driving you have to sit
there and babysit a machine the wheel on
the pedals over a repeated route of
driving that is not very interesting
day-to-day this is what Mercedes is
solving for not self-driving map we've
already figured out this is more about
what happens after you achieve
self-driving how do you get real luxury
out of that and the answer is twofold
you get real space space is always equal
to luxury and you get your time back the
greatest luxury of all because mobility
is to be honest it's mostly stressful to
give the people the opportunity to relax
to have a private place while moving
they are the people will be more
friendly very simple better mood and the
changes in pursuit of that mission are
clear even before you enter the f o 15
notice the shape of the vehicle is very
different than let's say a current
s-class this is not about having several
volumes boxes as they call it the three
box design of most sedans today but
instead having what's called a mono
volume pushing the wheels way out to the
ends and creating big spacious doors
that open up to almost an entire open
side of the car here's one of the
various first sketches they did of it
and notice how similar it looks to a
very old diagram above it there is an
ancient carriage from what a couple
hundred years ago and notice how it's
got some similarities to it get rid of
incursions from wheel wells drive shaft
tunnels nearby firewalls and protrusions
where gas tanks or batteries live and
let's give the passengers the prime
space all to themselves
like a bird's nest oh it's like a like a
cocoon actually that creates this
atmosphere of privacy that that we
consider is is the next level of modern
luxury the self-driving technology
enabled us to come up with a radical
design concept so this is a proof that
technology and design stimulates each
other to have such great results that we
have now in the car now here's an
example of what it's like to sit in the
Mercedes fo 15 as you can see now the
seats are facing each other is what they
call lounge mode as opposed to everyone
looking forward and some of them looking
at someone else's head and that kind of
communicates that everyone's view is
about the drive and where they're going
but again we're trying to break that
tyranny the lower half of each door in
this concept below the glass is a large
screen that can do a lot of different
modes one of the most important is that
they call the guided path mode and you
have several menus under that one which
shows your point on the route when
you're going to arrive there's also a
social screen to show you who's around
you and who is at your destination
there's a places area which is kind of a
rich Pio eye presentation that is again
geographically sensitive great when
you're visiting a new city right this is
interesting beam cam this will allow you
with another drivers permission to
actually log into the surround cameras
on their fo 15 and watch their drive and
this is the most interesting psychology
of all here's the drive mode menu but I
have real questions about what the
nature of a cars drive mode means when
you're not driving when you want
connected to shifter wheel and pedals
what do sport and dynamic modes deliver
anymore aren't sporty dynamics from a
car that's driving itself actually
disruptive and distracting from the
peaceful environment you're trying to
establish in the cabin in the first
place the face and rump of the fo 15 are
part of a new relationship with others
along with sensors and lighting they
also include an array of LED indicators
that can express what the car nose sees
and expects from others around it the
cities to be moving calmed Enza and ends
up now there will be competition about
public space so we its will be
impossible that we maintain in the
cities lanes for everybody yeah free
lane for everybody at separation zone
that will become shared so the machine
the mobile robot so to say the car has
to give science what he's doing so you
have to build up the relationship
between the people and
Machinery well here we are this is the
FO 15 let's go for a ride and see what
it's like under its own control and
power
now the autonomous driving in the
Mercedes fo 15 is not a new concept what
they're doing here along with having the
car figure out how to drive itself is
also to allow it to be smart enough to
work with new infrastructure to create
dynamic shared spaces they're talking
about smart pylons that could
inexpensively and easily be adopted in
your front yard to make sure no carver
backs it over the curve into your lawn
where you're having a picnic with your
kids
powertrain tech isn't the main point of
this car but for what it's worth it's
envisioned as an electric electric
hybrid that means it's a hydrogen fuel
cell car that generates most electricity
on demand from stored hydrogen but it
also has a battery storage system
charged by that same fuel cell power
train or by being plugged in it all goes
out to twin electric motors one on each
rear wheel with a total predicted range
of 680 miles 560 of those from the
hydrogen fuel cell and 125 from the
batteries store in charge even more than
what the f o 15 tells us about itself is
what it tells us about the future of
automotive design reorienting interiors
from the driving task taking back time
from the tyranny of the commute
redefining the concept of performance
and rethinking how personal cars utilize
road space
