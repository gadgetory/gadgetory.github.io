to the growing list of totally wireless
headphones this is the SOL Republic amps
air and it looks similar to other
totally wireless earphones out there
such as the braggy dash and Samsung I
got X and cost a hundred and eighty
dollars like those models you get two
independent Wireless buds that are then
joined together wirelessly to create a
stereo pair
design-wise what distinguishes the amp
ser is that it's wrapped in a silicone
sleeve with tapered grooves that soul
Republic says grips the ear like treads
on a tire for a comfortable yet secure
fit it also allows air flow to reduce
sweat build-up during workouts so yes
the amps air is being built as a
wireless sports headphone and they are
sweat resistant they fit my ears well
and also managed to hold a city
connection both between my phone and the
two buds themselves there's a little bit
of a lag in the Bluetooth transmission
so these aren't going to be good for
watching video but they're just fine
with music and sound decent if you can
maintain a tight seal if you don't get a
tight seal you'll lose a lot of bass and
the sound comes across as thin and
recessed I also thought they had some
trouble push that can give certain
tracks a harsh edge like competing
models battery life isn't great at three
hours but you do get a portable charging
case with a 2200 milliamp battery that
recharges the buds more than 15 times
according to Seoul Republic the charging
case also doubles as a portable charger
for your phone each earpiece has a
button on its exterior that allows you
to pause and play your music answer
calls and access Siri and Google Voice
Search the buds automatically turn off
when you put them in their charging case
and turn on when you take them out you
could also just use one bud as a mono
headset for your phone I like the design
the amp ser and I've found that it
worked reliably with minimal hiccups
which is an achievement for this type of
headphone I'm not sure it really
distinguishes itself that much from the
competition but perhaps its price will
come down with time giving it an edge
