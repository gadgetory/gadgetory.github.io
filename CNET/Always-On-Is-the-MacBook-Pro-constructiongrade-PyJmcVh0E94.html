MacBook Pro 13-inch with Retina display
we went looking for a location with a
lot of different options and we landed
here at American soil in stone where
we're going to scratch drop and dunk our
poor little macbook let's get to it
now one thing I actually consider a
weakness of the MacBook Pro is its
aluminum body it's already a little
scuffed up just from sitting on the rock
earlier so we decided to take the
scratch test concept and kick it up a
notch
all right just come on in
within there
now we're gonna shake it up that was
awesome so I'm betting that it's a
little bit scratched up
certainly dusty yeah we have some
scratching we have a lot of dirt I gotta
say this is not nearly as bad as I
thought it was gonna be turns out a
little bit tougher than I thought at
least in the scratch Department
oh I'll be careful I don't want to smush
him well so now the thing about our
MacBook Pro is that it's really dirty so
I think it's time for it to get a little
shower while it's open
oh that's terrible that's just awful
it's like you're on a photo shoot and
like a rogue wave comes and it just gets
splashed not for much longer than that
though let's rescue here all right our
screen definitely turned off I just
wanted to watch the dirt off all right
let's see I mean it's off so I think
what we're gonna do here I did the worst
thing imaginable which was press the
power button
OOP oh oh it restarted the thing that
usually goes first is the trackpad that
seems to be the case here
oh no the trackpad is on I'm logged in I
think it's turning out to be a lot
tougher than I thought it's totally
functioning after its little shower to
keep going
so arguably right now we still have a
perfectly functional MacBook Pro and I
am as surprised as you but it's time for
the drop test all right three two one
walk in oh I guess it doesn't skid at
all sounded really Doyle we have dented
I definitely have one good dent right
here let's see if I can't get it just a
little bit three two one
okay we have some scratching a couple
more dense nothing too serious but I
think we should find out how our Retina
display can handle a drop if it's you
know open three two one oh the hinge
feels a little tight but the screen is
okay really see much more dense the
hinge is just a little bit of got a
little bit of a hiccup but you know
that's no big deal
alright other than our little scratches
and it kind of looks like a bear got it
but other than that it's Supes fine now
most the time we try to keep these tests
within the realm of possibility it's
time to veer from that just a tiny bit
although I think this could happen our
buddy Big John here is gonna pick up
this pallet of bricks with his forklift
and then accidentally set it on top of
this one
come on in
there we go oh I'm not really I heard
some really terrible noises come out of
that just now cuz I think the forklift
also got the computer okay let's take it
away I changed my mind I don't want
those bricks after all
god I'm almost afraid to look I am not
seeing any obvious signs of damage right
off the bat the screen is not damaged
any more than it was the case is not
damaged any more than it was I mean
granted it was only like a palliative
half full of bricks or whatever
considering that even that couldn't do
it pink we gotta go Boulder
okay Big John
I need a boulder help me out
actually
this is not okay
let's just let that sit for me oh dear
oh dear
Oh God well now that can't be good oh
I'm gonna rock that okay go get it oh my
god
this isn't like her - it is odd you
don't know Oh God
here we've definitely messed up the
pallet alright let's see I have some
decent dentists here for sure
that was not nice okay you can
definitely see denting the screen does
not lay flush like it used to at all
let's see if the screen still attack
though oh oh the hands doesn't want to
open at all
oh we have cracked the retina display so
you have a little bit of spider web
pattern here this is kind of where the
impact zone was but I gotta say nowhere
near the shattering that I might expect
if this thing still comes on after
drying out I'm gonna call that usable
stuff
so we're back in the office and we've
had our MacBook Pro and a bag of rice
for 24 hours a lot of rice it's been
laying flat so we're gonna take it out
see if it comes on shake out some of the
race
just to give it the best chance of
survival plug it in let's see I'm just
gonna keep holding this power button cuz
I'm keeping hope alive I don't have any
green light on my power cord and I don't
have any activity on the screen I don't
know if it was the water or the boulder
but I'm sorry to say I think our MacBook
Pro is dead oh wait just when we thought
it was dead it came back on not like on
on but I just needed a little while on
the juice to get a little bit of battery
life back in it it's not okay
the screen is definitely in a lot of
trouble so now you saw us do a lot of
bad things to this MacBook Pro and
honestly I bet you could replace this
display and you would have a functioning
laptop this guy is unquestionably
construction-grade
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
