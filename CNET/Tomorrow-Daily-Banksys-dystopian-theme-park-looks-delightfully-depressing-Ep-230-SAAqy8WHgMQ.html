3d print glass a literally cool paint
job and a brand new amusement park to
take on Disneyland yay and it's terrible
Oh tomorrow daily
three days listen to the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show in the universe I'm Ashley
scalar that's killing honest it's monday
hopefully you baby we made it through
the weekend guys cuz let me tell you
monday's our monies are tough for that
it's a clich√© for a reason any any
weekend where I don't wake up and notice
that I have a brand new tattoo on me
like another dolphin tattoo as a winner
chalk that up into the win column
alright guys well let's not waste any
more time let's hit the headlines so
let's talk about this terrible amusement
park I can't and terrible in a in a good
way I guess I like it I like this
amusement park baby like this is a lot
of ups and downs right up front oh
you'll feel these ups and downs because
it's an amusement park and there's rides
anyway so Banksy has made an amusement
park it's called dismaland it is it is
basically a crappy version of Disneyland
but with the intense of highlighting how
like what his opinion of what Disneyland
is just like just terrible like medium
park bad bad morals yeah just just
terrible so basically what this is is it
Banksy teamed up with a bunch of artists
to create dismal and which is a bunch of
art installations that highlight
different social commentary aspects what
you see on the screen is a sad dismal
and employee yet again this came out
like a few days ago but we have videos
now like there's a lot better pictures
it wasn't open for the press for a while
so they were like all like janky
pictures but now we have great video by
artistic people a lot of press has
gotten a chance to go in there but
there's a lot of great exhibits and just
a lot it's really really interesting
which is why we want to talk about it
there's the Grim Reaper on a bumper car
ride that's amazing yeah I be my
favorite that my favorite my favorite is
the Cinderella's flipped over her
flipped over carriage unless and then
there's a whole bunch of like press
taking pictures of her all of Princess
Diana so yeah very strong commentary all
the strong commentary um now you can
actually visit this if you are in the UK
yeah it's a west
super mayor yeah weston-super-mare in
the UK you can go and visit this it is
three pounds for adults to get it cheap
and a kids under free kids under five
get admitted for free great but
apparently the website has been crashing
because so many people are trying to go
to Disneyland that doesn't surprise me
at all yeah I mean I I want to go I was
in the UK I would have one hundred
percent go to this this is awesome i
love my i think my favorite sculpture my
favorite piece of artwork is the is the
little mermaid that's glitched out in
the in the lake like in front of the
castle i want a 3d printed a 3d
printable version of that that i can buy
on like Shapeways yeah that'd be amazed
i think they even here yeah here's a
really depressing boat right there
there's a glitch aerial love that glitch
area it's not it's really cool there's a
lot of cool stuff in here apparel I
think there's also like a gift store
here's a gift shop you win all out if
you have any if you have a chance like
go look it up there's there's millions
of images pictures of different angles
all different stuff I want to read the
quote I cuz i love this this cool oh
there's there's my favorite ok i'm so
that's amazing at night oh my god so in
the in the brochure because there's even
a brochure it says a theme park whose
big theme is theme parks should have
bigger themes something to think about
theme parks it's so pretentious name for
it really is these things some of these
are like super pretentious but that
ain't good like I get it it's a very
clear messages of traditional Banksy
themes which is like anti-consumerism
Western like like the selfish sort of
Western culture that we've kind of
created for ourselves like a lot of that
stuff uh so I find this very fascinating
I love them I love that eat something
like this could even exist so amazing
very cool Banksy let's hang out let's
yeah call us what's gonna McDonald jail
and and then you know hang out so dismal
and so there you go that is pretty cool
um we we don't have a hashtag of the day
today I just wanna lay no cuz we're
gonna continue our TD on responses to do
tomorrow because we got so many so we're
gonna do all of our VR James Cameron
stuff into tomorrow so no no hashtag
today but you can tell us what you think
about dismal and if you want alright I
gotta tell you about this
amazing paint that is being worked on
this comes from a team at John Hopkins
University in the applied physics lab
this guide leading this team his name is
Jason a Ben kowski he is leading a team
to create a very interesting form of
paint that actually doesn't absorb heat
and it doesn't fade or crack over time
invincible pain pretty much invincible
paint which is kind of amazing normal
paint is made from polymers and UV rays
break put that down break that
composition down over time so you see
like faded paint on cars for example
oxidization stuff like that breaks it
down ok so this paint that they have
created is fade resistant it doesn't
absorb heat and it's made by mixing
silica which is one of the main
ingredients in glass and potassium
silicate and after you spray or paint it
onto an object when it cures when it
dries it dries hard as a rock like this
thing this stuff is tough so you can't
remove it then really really tough uh
the team says the paint will not crack
or fade over time and if it did it would
take centuries for decoration we get
happening so this is like something
incredible this is the guy who invented
or your help geez there's six eyes over
here yeah na Mele he's wearing two pairs
of tumors buzzing so they said they want
to start actually field testing this on
Navy battleships because it gets really
hot uh there's always the for me like
remember when that Hotel in Las Vegas
have those heat-resistant like
reflective windows that ended up melting
parts of the pool like deer it you don't
remember that there's like a hotel that
the curve of the glass like perfectly
reflected down to the pool and basically
made it's so hot down there like it was
unusable so they had to like fix it and
I the thing is this the heat has to go
somewhere yeah so with this like where
does that heat go cuz it's obviously not
being absorbed by the paint or that
surface so it's got to go somewhere else
the last thing is planet need your heap
I agree but I mean it's the same heat
it's just being displayed guys come on
man it's just being displaced somewhere
it's not generating additional heat at
least so um he made a good point though
they talked about the Navy battleships
and everything went right there
he said there they asked him in this
video they're like what's the like
number one place you want to put this
like a playa if you you know if it goes
mainstream and he's like children's
playground slides and I'm like yes
everybody's been burned on a kids
playground slide I agree it's a good
point really smart so and I it looks
like it goes on clear so you could put
it over hypothetically any color paint
you want his I actually think that's
good marketing if he puts on a
battleship because he's like it can
survival battles I know yeah totally
exercises like double smart because of
the six eyes I know it's a he so he said
it'll be a couple years before they
actually get it out in field testing
because they want to improve some of the
formula Garrett get it all perfected but
pretty awesome stuff really interesting
nice job success so great work and that
Logan already has super science like it
you can see all the science this guy is
so much smarter than us that I feel like
it's okay we can go up success alright
so MIT is also doing some stuff that is
interesting that has to do with silica
but it's with glass they have created a
3d printer that can use glasses of
material which is kind of amazing
considering oh you guys blowing a big
bang get your glitch aerial glass glitch
area love you incredible there mediated
matter group developed a 3d printer that
they're calling a g3 DP and it uses
glass as a printing material you're
going to see some of the vases the
bosses bosses that they printed with
their 3d printer it's kind of amazing
that's the process right there this is
the 3d printer doing it's doing its work
now you can see obviously there's a lot
of heat involved because you gotta heat
up glass to shape it to blow it to
figure out exactly like what you want to
do with it and this printer has to be
able to precisely very very very
precisely control the temperature of the
glass as it prints and then and then
cool it at a pro at the proper rate so
that it doesn't get too cold too fast or
it doesn't like when into a big pile of
goop but but pile of goop so that it
doesn't crack so they use to heated
chambers to melt and cool the glass so
the heated chamber is a lot cooler than
the chamber for printing and then they
they do this
like feed everything in there and they
print out their designs and then the
second chamber very slowly cools the
finished product but some of the stuff
that they made is just amazing I mean
these these bosses are gorgeous and
really architectural looking they said
they want to improve it by adding
software updates so an operator can
directly control the temperature in each
chamber like if there needed to be an
adjustment made on the fly this is all
these are all the different things they
made these are all the different designs
and then they also want to update the
feed mechanism so right now it uses
gravity as a feed mechanism which
results in some uneven pressure and then
that in turn results in uneven glass so
there's little if they're not it's not
perfect so yeah there it is there
dropping that's they're dropping in like
molten glass basically this seems so
taxing and like so much danger it so
expensive is super cool but it looks so
cool and I just think it's neat that
they're that they're finding new
materials and figuring out new ways to
3d print things with materials bless you
that we can print these things with 3d
materials that we you know previously
just we're just not within reach yeah
pretty impressive and they do like all
those different like little designs and
sufferings unreal so you can go over to
the the MIT mediated matter group to
check out all the pictures of the
different products that they've made
within everything but that's our
headlines yeah that kicks class thank
you waited a temper oh yeah no waited
that whole story Cal take take your
dictate easy wait wait wait you're just
dying that's uh that's that's it for our
headlines we're gonna do with me another
thing that she's gonna say yeah we're
gonna watch Mad Max with go-karts it's
an ad for the game but it's still pretty
cool so don't click away it's tamar
daily
welcome back to the show we've returned
we were not writing go cards in Mad Max
in the wasteland during the break it
would have been more kawaii if they had
done it you know that term yes okay kilt
would be more cute kill kill okay um so
it's Monday which means we have to talk
about some crowdfunding stuff and this
is actually story you and I are very
familiar with so it's time for back
racket alright these guys I don't know
we got really excited about the robot
fight right the big mega robot fight
yeah alright well now these guys at mega
BOTS Inc are saying we need some money
kayla rolls it lies alright so we are
getting a giant robot battle between
megawatts mark 2 which is back there in
the video that you're seeing and kuratas
which is the japanese robot from soo
dobashi industries but now mega bot says
they need our money how much they want
half a million dollars they actually say
that the full upgrade would cost a
million and a half dollars oh and you
know I don't know about this they say
this is what they say they say because
kuratas set the terms and said we gotta
have hand-to-hand combat they're like we
got to upgrade this robot it's not ready
okay so they said we need to add heavy
duty armor plating we got to add
firepower we got to add upgrade the
hydraulics to support those additions
and then we got to increase the top
speed of the robot and upgrade the power
to support everything that we just said
we needed to do so they have a lot to do
they say again that a fully upgraded
mark to this is the paint job they
wanted a like we got to have a sick
paint job because that's part of it it's
gotta look cool it's got a rep America
um you know so they but they say fully
upgraded one's gonna cost a million and
a half dollar so yes of course they have
stretch goals ah nice b-roll I know
they've some great be rolled it i gotta
say they make great videos they make
great videos um they said a million or
half dollars stretch goals include like
the crazy paint job from like
professional filmmakers who do
like you know paint jobs like r2d2 and
stuff like that um they also talk about
they have to make the cockpit really
safe for anybody who's going to be
driving the robot like all this stuff so
they want our money yeah half a million
dollars they got 24 days left they have
just under three hundred and forty grand
so they're over halfway to their goal so
the probably make it ah there it is at
338,000 uh if we make it to fiber this
isn't gonna be that cool if they don't
get their full and then I'm gonna
million and a half and I'm telling you
they're gonna need more than a millinery
I have a feeling though that like this
is sort of like crowdfunding those big
games like blood stain and Shenmue where
it's like we're just asking you for
money and then we also have these
sponsors who if they see that we hit
500,000 and we reach our Kickstarter
gold they'll also invest any upgrade so
I have a feeling there might be
something like that going on I have a
feeling there might be some some deals
that might help me to play says I'm
gonna feel this way I've always my issue
with Kickstarter has always been where's
the limit of like hey I need that like I
want to create this incredible idea that
like I can only do with your support
versus hey I've got this I got this idea
to pay me for you got some money dude
did you I know it's I know it's crazy
and it's good it's expensive and it's
gonna be like a few moments of cool
robot fight give us your mom but it's my
idea I think you know like there's
always that code that weird should
shouldn't you kind of get online so i
think that they helped by making the
lowest donation you can give five books
so it's like okay I'm gonna get five
bucks fine but the highest donation that
they're getting and they have backers at
this level is ten thousand dollars and
you get to be a part of the pit crew for
the robot and you get to literally be
there it like as a part of the official
robot pit crew on the day of the fight
and like watch the fight in person and
stuff Wow which is intense but only six
people have already paid for that so
they've great those brainless honestly
things I know like I wanted it but now I
feel like I'm having to work too hard
we're taking advantage of my excitement
about a giant robot fight Logan are you
are you down for it like the idea of it
being a Kickstarter thing no I think
it's
this little bite yeah it's not going to
be originally released the video with
the intention of launching that
Kickstarter like oh man people are going
to go nuts for this and if kuratas
accepts we can launch this Kickstarter
and we get a bunch of money to upgrade
the robot we've seen they had a reality
TV show where people have fighting
robots yeah and it was terrible isn't
great and battle bots I don't think was
BattleBots the first time around great I
feel like in the second time study was
fixable but the sec I've the second
season was much better so I'm saying
it's like Miranda gate this is again
we're I feel like we're just I'm on the
event taking too long give us our robot
battle already give us a robot out to be
a year it's gonna be a year so I say
back in at the lower levels if you if
you really like this project and you
want to do it just kick in like five
bucks don't buy it don't buy Starbucks
this week just kicking kicking a couple
bucks and then call it a day get your
get your little mega bot sticker and
call it a day oh you get a sticker you
get a sticker at five bucks I think it's
like are no 5 is I think just like your
maybe maybe the maybe as a stick around
I'm gonna be the guy that that I'm not
gonna back in I wouldn't back it and
tell you you go back it so I can see
this thing yeah scales gonna be selfish
and tell you to back it so he can see it
yeah we've seen an option we've seen
like farmers in like third world
countries create robot horses now to
plow fields just out of scraps and
that's what I wanted I want I don't want
consumerist give us money we feel like
good yeah we're getting some way we're
getting too much into their sector to
Banksy about it ranch I consumed by way
to bang see um okay so that being said
we have got to talk about the literal
mountain of feedback you gave us about
James Cameron saying vr was a yawn so it
let's say your user feedback
you know who wouldn't be begging for
money to get their thing done sick size
6 size would be like I got this I'll
figure it out I got it I got all the
brains I can shoot lasers I got so sick
size would would take care of this he
would be listen he would have no problem
hail him he wouldn't need Kickstarter
yeah same look at him genius he's
already thinking about oh it's such an
unfortunate and like mouth safety
goggles arts yeah all right I love you
six eyes I'm gonna wear safety goggles
on Wednesday show okay so TD on which
asked do you agree with James Cameron
his assessment that virtual reality
right now is oh very exhausting boring
uh Scott Rudin said James Cameron isn't
interested because he still thinks
everyone wants a 3d TV in their house
viren vr is competition so he's going to
hate it boom Scott dropping the mic mic
drop he's like you don't know what you
neural you talking about old man you're
in the old times where 3d is a fad and
everybody supposedly supposed to like it
alright Neo Tokyo Rodin said VRA yawn
James Cameron is right because he always
sees the human soul that is beyond just
the tech says he's right huh he believes
in James Cameron's vision says James
Karen understands people more than the
technology thinks that understands me he
didn't make Terminator 2 and Terminator
series hmm okay what's next all right so
pin wrote in and said current VR tech is
still missing a good navigational
paradigm current solutions our clutches
at best we'll get there yeah I'm not yet
that says not are you agrees for now but
opinion could change what did did James
even say come on first-name basis was
done did he ever even say that it's got
potential or did you say like me you
said it was interesting I like I think
he said that it was fine like I that was
the word to use fine he's like oculus is
fine or its they're fine or something
like that so it was very flippant I
think that's probably the best way to
describe his feelings toward it and then
Frank wrote in and said seems hat James
Cameron online literally tweeted out
seems like you've tried the inferior VR
headset with the HTC vive you can
actually walk around give it a try
please so he
Frank literally just came at James
Cameron was like you're you need to try
good VR headsets I actually that made me
think I wonder if he would change his
mind if he used oculus touch or the
controllers with the vibe yeah I don't
think he cares I the next the next the
next tweet that we have is from James
Cameron where he says hey shut up I
can't hear you over my billions of
diatom too busy swimming in my money pit
that looks just like Scrooge McDuck's to
hear your dumb criticisms everybody in
the universe sign James Cameron so we'll
do more yonder bar we got a couple of
emails so we'll read those tomorrow but
yeah I just want to say maybe the most
responded to hashtag of the day that
we've ever had and also uh I read I've
read all of them on Twitter and an email
so I can't we will not get to all of
them but they were all really good like
people brought up some really good
points like I thought those four sort of
encapsulated the general like overview
some people agreed with James Cameron
some people said he's totally wrong some
people said wait like there's a lot of
that so kind of one opinion from each
camp I thought was appropriate okay guys
it's time for our very last piece user
feedback which is not about James
Cameron and his opinions about VR it's
about photos and it's time for our
photog refer the day
Gabe rodin I'm gonna assume this is gabe
newell right Mike cuz his name is Gabe
and there's really there's like one
right only there's only one uh said hey
guys these are wonderful pictures i took
my iphone 5s i took these photos while
hiking a 20-mile stretch of the
beautiful Pacific Crest Trail my family
the first two pictures which I picked my
favorite on the right here uh is from
our camp at two lakes and then he said
the second is the sunrise as we start
our journey and then this last picture
is a photo of the clouded Mount Rainier
we hacked by love the show keep up the
great work cool ah those are some really
great shots dude so the people that
watch this show they watch this show and
then they go out hiking day I feel like
that is actually the case somebody why
don't we cover more hiking story we
should cover more nature stories uh it's
tomorrow's nature um nature daily we're
gonna change the name of the show we're
just gonna pivot uh yeah no super good
picture love it Gabe keep up the great
work cute thanks for thanks for all the
cool valve stuff life right um but if
you want to send in your phone tog raphy
you can email us tomorrow at cnet com
tell us a little story give us
permission to use it and also tell us
what device you took it on I get emails
all the time when people like here's my
picture and they send it and then I
literally there's no information about
what you use to take it with and I don't
want to do mystery devices like tell us
I'll give us the details that's kind of
the point of point font agra for right
very true and then you can also send us
story ideas and you can find tomorrow
daily all over the internet on social
media we're probably on your favorite
social media site can it was a snapchat
probably if it's Twitter we're
definitely there but if you want to find
us which were way more entertaining than
our official twitter you can find me at
ashleys gala
you can find kale I kill anonymous yeah
it's pretty pretty pretty
straightforward don't park if you want
to share the show with anybody which we
highly encourage you to do and we would
appreciate very much send them to
tomorrow daily com alright guys that's
it for the show for today we'll be back
tomorrow the brand new docket of weird
wonderful science facts science fiction
geek pop-culture game being all rolled
up into a nice little out of the wall
for you but I told that vegan humans
will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
