like a doughnut I'm Bridget Carey this
is your CNET update well I don't
normally have emoji icons stuck to me
what you saw in the intro was a video I
created in snapchat it's a new effect
getting lots of buzz and it's called a
3d sticker you pick an emoji and stick
it to anything in your video and it will
follow that object no matter how you
move once you pick the emoji and size it
you just press and hold the spot you
want it to stick in the video of course
this isn't life changing technology but
it is something we have not yet seen in
today's assortment of social media
tricks and it's only a matter of time
before Facebook or another social app
will copy the concept snapchat tends to
be on the edge of trying new things but
one special effect did get the app in
hot water for being shall we say
half-baked on Wednesday the app created
a special effect filter that puts
Jamaican musician Bob Marley's face on
your face and people are speaking out
against it online calling it insensitive
some are saying it's a digital form of
blackface snapchat added the effect on
4/20 it's a day that's an unofficial
holiday of sorts for marijuana smokers
and supporters but critics said it
reduces the psychotic artist to just
being a pothead but there's more
important news beyond what snapchat is
doing of course if you prefer your chat
apps to be more on the secure side the
messaging app viber is adding end-to-end
encryption to all chats that means that
no one can listen in to spy on your
conversation not even the team at viber
now if there is something fishy with the
connection a lock icon on the screen
will turn from green to red to alert you
and that could mean the other person is
using a new phone or the security is
breached this is rolling out over the
next two weeks you just have to update
the app last month the Facebook owned
whatsapp also made end-to-end encryption
the default for its 1 billion users by
comparison viber has about 700 million
users but here's a unique twist to viber
it's not a US company if the government
orders viber to unencrypted software it
doesn't have to comply and speaking of
encryption several major tech companies
have joined together
in an open letter to express deep
concerns over a draft encryption bill
that may soon be heard in Congress the
bill aims to give law enforcement the
power to order a tech company to decrypt
data on demand Apple Microsoft Google
and Facebook are just among the many
saying that this type of requirement
would be harmful to consumers that's all
for this tecnique is round up and you
can head to cnet.com for the latest from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
