the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple the Apple
watch is out it's here and there is
plenty of follow-up to talk about so
let's get to the show and you know Apple
was going to eventually show itself for
the control freaks that they are after
the coop town kids added a new ruling
guideline that says they will reject any
Apple watch apps whose primary function
is just telling time now many developers
complain to find their app have been
rejected for just this reason and right
now Apple only offers 10 watch faces and
one of them is Mickey Mouse and I have
no idea who would use that so let's just
hope Apple changes their policy and
opens it up to the devs eventually come
on Apple being open hey it could happen
now probably not now the big a is also
poopoo een fart apps on the Apple watch
the developer of fart watch that acted
as a glorified whoopee cushion from your
wrist got the news from Apple with the
following reasons like we notice that
your Apple watch app is primarily a fart
app we do not accept fart apps on the
Apple watch what the fart and I never
thought I'd read something like that in
my lifetime except digest all right
other issues around the Apple watch are
surfacing and let's be honest it was
only a matter of time get it yeah all
right well some early adopters with
lower arm tattoos are complaining that
the Apple watch isn't working properly
because it might fool some of the
sensors by flashing infrared or green
LED lights against the skin the watch
can detect your blood flow but dark
colored skin could affect the accuracy
of it and I'm not even sure if a tan
brian from hawaii will as well now I'm
still waiting to get one yes the one I
actually paid for but I will test it out
on my tramp stamp as soon as I can for
you now users are also discovering that
the stainless steel Apple watch is
actually scratching pretty easily think
about the back of the early iPods and
imagine that surface on your wrist now
and this thing
getting banged around all the time or
hit by your keys or whatever so it's not
a surprise but it also sucks when you
paid at least five hundred and forty
nine dollars for this guy now you can
remove most of the scratches with an
inexpensive metal polish but I don't
want to hear people say and scratch Kate
let's not start that just yet okay but
other than looks the Apple square watch
looks like it might be the better of the
two
after display mate technologies tested
out both screens they found that the
scratch resistant sapphire significantly
affected the optical performance of the
Apple watch oh LED screen because it
reflects twice as much ambient light
compared to the Apple watch sports ionic
strength and glass that's the same as
the iPhone 6 and 6-plus the sapphire
cover also doesn't have as good of a
viewing angle due to its higher optical
depth compared to glass see that's just
great to hear you know I might as well
buy an Apple watch sport and just
spray-paint a gold already hey Brian
somebody actually already did that it's
on the website called YouTube okay you
know what I am getting a little annoyed
right now I'm not gonna lie but nothing
makes me more mad than the fact that the
Apple watch sport ban can also be
accessorized based the people I watch
popped who are making their own Crocs
like accessorizing gibbets for the Apple
watch and don't ask me how I know
they're called Jib it's now I know you
thought you'd see a bad apple earlier in
the show but I was saving it for
something horrible and this this right
here deserves a bad apple Munn we're
freakin putting charms on the Apple
watch now alright right after this thing
came out people were torture testing it
in every way possible and what a
surprise dropping a heavy frying pan
crushes the screen I can also assure you
that it works in the shower
but real talk right here I can't help
but point out how the pre-launch hype
hasn't really even come close to
matching the post-launch buzz are you
really hearing people say I love my
Apple watch oMG this is the greatest
thing ever because I'm not now I still
don't have my personal want to use
frequently and try just picking up this
thing and playing with it it's easily
apple's most confusing interface out of
the box and it takes a lot more than
just a few hours to get used to but it
also reinforces my point that this is
anything close to a gotta have and they
still have a long ways to go to figure
it out now one thing Apple definitely
knows is making that money Apple
announced their recent earnings for the
first quarter of 2015 the second fiscal
quarter with 58 billion dollars in
revenue and a net quarterly profit of
thirteen point six billion it was apples
second best quarter ever thanks to them
selling 61 million iPhones and 4.5 six
million max but iPad sales were down
again for the third quarter in a row at
twelve point six million almost four
million down from the previous year's
quarter now there's always some nuggets
from these earnings and Apple CEO Tim
Cook still stood by the iPad saying that
it has a great future and that its
long-term prospects are more important
than individual 90-day clicks now I'm
still one of the many people who are
still on board with the iPad and all
that talk that is dead is just talk
because the reality is that people just
don't need to upgrade it nearly as much
and looking down the road Tim Cook also
hid it at the earnings call that Apple
could be part of a change in the media
landscape HBO now subscription service
on the Apple TV has been a success after
two counted for almost one percent of
all Internet traffic on a Sunday night
recently only one week after its launch
now during the earnings call Cook said
he sees major major changes in media
coming on the horizon and he admitted to
Wall Street analysts that Apple could
play a part in those changes so I
shouldn't have to spell out this one but
he's talking about the upcoming new
Apple TV it's spelled a PP le
T
