having pictures of animals you've never
seen and places you've never been to
scroll past you on your TV set and also
watching TV and movies but it's also a
neat way of controlling your smart home
gear using apple's homekit protocols
from outside of your own home here in
the CNET smart home we'll show you how
what apple homekit really does is to
taxonomy is the smart home and give
devices a common vocabulary so
everything can speak to each other and
speak to siri of course if you're going
to get started with home kit you're
gonna need a home kit compatible gadget
like this Schlage cents bluetooth
deadbolt now there's a growing list of
items that work with home kit you can
find them on apple's website but the
easy way to check if a product is
compatible at home kit is to look for
this little label on the packaging that
label tells you that the product is
engineered to work specifically with
apple's homekit standards and with other
products that are engineered in the same
way it's kind of the whole gist of
pumpkin everything just works together
under apple's umbrella now installing
some home kit devices is as simple as
switching out a light bulb or plugging
in a smart switch this deadbolt took a
little more of a hands-on installation
obviously but once we got it in there
we synched it up with our home kit setup
by entering this code into the products
app and we actually didn't even have to
enter it home kit has a cool feature
that uses your phone's camera to just
look at that code and put it in
automatically kind of neat once the
device is paired up you'll give it a
specific Siri name so that she can
recognize it when you ask her to unlock
the backdoor that's all well and good if
you're controlling this lock at home
it's a Bluetooth device and your in
Bluetooth range your phone can talk to
it but what if you go to work and you
forget to lock your door and you want to
ask Siri to take care of that how is she
going to talk to that lock from outside
of this bluetooth range all you need to
do is go into your settings and log into
your iCloud account on Apple TV so for
me that's my personal email I login I
put my itunes password in there and
voila Apple TV is connected and it's
automatically synced up with my home
kick gear I try and turn off a light or
lock a door from outside of the home
Apple TV will let that signal in and do
the work for me pretty simple as far as
how to's go but it's a little confusing
knowing exactly what home kit is and how
it operates hopefully this helps clear
it up for CNET here in the CNET smart
home I'm right Chris
