expert there is a serious learning curve
with Windows 8 there's a lot of dragging
and swiping and mousing around to
navigate the interface and if you don't
have a touchscreen computer it gets a
little annoying
the best way to navigate is with
shortcuts and there's an entirely new
set of them in Windows 8 they'll help
you move around much faster and more
efficiently let me show you the best
keyboard shortcuts for Windows 8 all
right no matter where you are Windows CE
brings up the charms bar where you can
access the Start screen settings and
other key options use the arrows and
then return to make your selection the
less time you spend with the mouse the
better windows takes you to the Start
screen and windows D takes you to the
desktop and if you ever hit the Windows
key by mistake just tap escape to go
back now I'll go to maps every app has
its own menu with features and options
plus its own settings to access options
and features hit Windows Z and to access
the settings hit Windows I you'll see
settings on the right plus key system
options like brightness and wireless
just below it and to close an app you
can still use alt f4 and think goodness
because dragging an app to the bottom of
the screen is just overkill one of the
better features in Windows 8 is the new
app snapping you can stick any app to
one side of the screen and do something
else on the other so look if you're in
an app hit Windows period and it will
snap to the right hit it again and it
will snap to the left one more time and
it's back to normal when you snap it to
one side you can open another app in the
larger area do that by selecting the app
with Windows tab or opening it from the
Start screen
here's another power user shortcut
Windows X this brings up a menu that
lets you get to things like the task
manager and control panel run programs
anything that involves system management
it's especially useful for tinkerers but
good to know either
finally the best of them all is the new
screenshot shortcut Microsoft was way
late on this one so I'm glad to finally
see it here hit Windows print screen and
not only will you take a screenshot but
that file will automatically be saved to
the pictures folder Amen alright if you
have any useful shortcuts share them
with me on Twitter and check out how to
see Netcom for the full written list of
shortcuts for a CNET I'm Sharon Backman</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
