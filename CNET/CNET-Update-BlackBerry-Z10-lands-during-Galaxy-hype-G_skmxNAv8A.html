phone madness I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update AT&amp;amp;T has confirmed
that the blackberry z10 touchscreen
smartphone is going on sale March 22nd
for two hundred dollars with the usual
two-year contract pre-orders begin
Tuesday the z10 will also be sold by
verizon and t-mobile but neither carrier
has yet to say if they will also sell it
on march twenty second and that's a
tough blow for blackberry because it's
always better to have one unified launch
day across carriers to get more buzz in
the public and speaking of smart phone
buzz the samsung galaxy s4 will be
unveiled on Thursday but there are
photos posted on a samsung form of what
is said to be the new s4 if these leaked
photos are accurate then the s4 is going
to look a lot like the Galaxy Note 2 but
this could be a dummy case phone
companies use fake casing used to
disguise the look of their unreleased
devices some analysts suggest that the
s4 would actually have more of a square
look but come back to cnet to see the
real thing unveiled live on thursday at
4pm pacific 7 p.m. eastern last update I
reported the SimCity game launched with
server problems and it was unplayable
for days but to make peace with players
Electronic Arts is giving a free game to
simcity owners the problem stemmed from
EA requiring an internet connection to
play some city because it wants to
prevent software piracy but EA servers
couldn't handle the number of people
trying to log on a play and users were
getting disconnected it'll be a while
before consumers can buy Google glass
headpieces but there's already one bar
in Seattle that has banned google glass
the five point bar posted this image to
its Facebook page of course it's kind of
a joke but the owner of the bar says
that there was some seriousness to it
for privacy's sake the South by
Southwest Interactive Festival is a
yearly gathering of people to network
and talk tech and some developers use
the gathering to launch their apps for
example Foursquare was an app that
launched at South by and it became a
success story others like highlight
still haven't gained much ground but
here are a few being pitched at this
year's festival
Prague's to me let you discover people
nearby and send them files with a few
taps and you can mass message a group of
people near you assuming they all have
the app it's for iOS and Android yapim
lets you share your feelings and
experiences with the brand and brands
would reward you with gift cards it's
only available right now for Apple
devices and takes is an iOS camera app
that captures short video clips while
you take photos and it turns them into a
montage of clips set to music that's
your tech news update and you can find
more details at cnet com / update from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
