welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
on this thanksgiving break plus the
winners of our speck case giveaway and
let's get to the show and it's now
official Apple has acquired primeSense
the company behind Microsoft's Kinect
motion sensor for reportedly around 345
million dollars now Apple reps confirm
the deal to cnet and this is exciting
because we all know how this could play
out with the Apple TV but it goes beyond
that primesense's newest 3d sensor is
called the Capri not those capris and
it's a system-on-a-chip that's small
enough to be incorporated into mobile
devices like phones tablets laptops and
more and I don't anticipate us to be
playing something like dance central on
an iPad anytime soon even if I want to
now their technology can also be used in
3d scanners like this one called sense
by 3d systems to create accurate 360
degrees scans of real-world objects that
can then be printed apple acquired
authentic and their fingerprint sensor
back in July of 2012 and touch ID on the
iPhone 5s was the first implementation
of it primesense's tech will also take
time to incorporate but I'm pretty
excited to see how Apple will bring some
new innovation from this to their new
product lines and we've also talked
about how touch ID could potentially
open the floodgates for mobile payments
in the past we're still far behind in
the US but a job posting shows Apple is
looking for a payment software engineer
that will help build a next-generation
payment platform that will push the
boundaries in new markets for Apple
Retail big words I know but NFC payments
are still clunky here and there have
been recent reports about Apple
installing ibeacons into their stores so
that you will get information delivered
to your phone based on your location in
the store since it will know what's on
the shelf you're looking at because
that's not creepy at all ibeacons could
be part of this next-generation payment
system Apple is hiring for I want my
phone to be a true easy to use digital
wallet but we'll see how it all comes
together now let's check out some apple
pads and a new revelation from website
unwired view shows apples plans to give
the
touch ID button trackpad capabilities
for example you could pan over a map
that's displayed on a screen by swiping
in any direction over the touch ID
sensor it can even detect revolving your
fingertip around the touch ID bun versus
twisting it and yes I'm still talking
about touch ID but just think of it as
taking the home button to the next level
to be used for navigation or different
functions based on gestures with its 500
DPI resolution for detection and that's
some real cool stuff now a recent patent
was also awarded to the big a for a
refocus abul camera with light field
technology that can be used in a device
like an iPhone now if light field
technology sounds familiar the lightshow
camera might ring a bell that allows you
to refocus an image taken after it's
been shot Apple mentions the Lytro is
prior art in the patent but also states
its own micro lens array can produce
higher quality images because of a
higher spatial resolution the patent
also allows Apple to pursue this either
with a standalone product or within a
mobile device and I know I could use
this on my phone because it seems like
every stranger that takes a picture for
me takes horrible pictures all right
let's hit some quick bites and follow up
we talked about the large screen 12
point nine inch iPad that's rumored to
already be in production last week didja
x is now reporting that quanta computer
has landed its own contract with apple
to mass-produce the tablet for the
second half of 2014 and quanta is also
competing for iwatch production orders
that's being targeted for a second
quarter 2014 launch according to the
report also the recent introduction of
new 27 inch and 32 inch 4k displays from
AU Optronics have sparked speculation
that these could be the displays used
for apple's next Thunderbolt Display
with the new Mac Pro coming in December
now on lookers have been waiting for any
technology that would even allow the big
a to offer a 4k display alongside the
mac pro but again we'll keep following
this and finally a great story
benefiting product red we've talked
about how Apple's own Johnny ive and
designer marc newson work together to
create several one-of-a-kind products to
benefit product red they're all red Mac
Pro sold for 977 thousand dollars with
the desktop originally estimated to sell
at 60,000 in
it looks really cool if you slap a
coca-cola logo on it then the all-gold
Apple earpods so for 461 thousand
dollars and I just missed the winning
bid by four hundred sixty thousand nine
hundred ninety nine dollars and their
special edition like a camera we
showcased so for 1 million eight hundred
five thousand dollars and that's why
they call it one of a kind all right
let's get to the winners of our speck
case give away last week I asked to tell
me what time is way past my bedtime and
the correct answer was 1201 am I'm

accident so congrats go to our twitter

parks Randy Chang and Eduardo Lopez who
asked how do you manage to stick the
