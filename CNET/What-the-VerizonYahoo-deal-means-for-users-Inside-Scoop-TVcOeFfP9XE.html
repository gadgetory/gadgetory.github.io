four point eight three billion dollars
insurer executive editor of C net news
is here to give us the inside scoop on
this deal now in Verizon buying Yahoo is
a big deal now what are they buying and
why does Verizon want Yahoo well what
they're buying is pretty much everything
we know Yahoo to be so their email
photos Yahoo Sports fantasy football all
the stuff you know Yahoo to be they're
taking it the reason why is actually
more complex they're trying to become a
media company they bought a o L last
year for a little less than they're
buying Yahoo now and they're basically
turning themselves into this big
competitor to people like Facebook and
Google and even Comcast on some level
right they're a internet connector and
they are buying people like NBC so
they're trying to become a media company
too it's really fascinating to be
watching for users that are using Yahoo
products like all of those products you
mentioned mentioned fantasy football
email all of that what is going to
happen so it's all up in the air still
odds are that they're not going to just
shut it down because Yahoo is one of the
biggest places on the Internet and
taking that away would basically throw
away all the value they just put into
paying for it so they'll probably hold
on to it whether or not that we brand it
is another question that might turn it
in to Verizon a well or whatever they'll
call it and so that could happen but
otherwise people who use Yahoo email
will probably continue to use Yahoo
email for a very long time and what
about other Yahoo products like search
say for example that has the Bing
integration in partnership what will
happen there it's gonna be interesting
because that is really built around a
partnership and an agreement and that
agreement might get renegotiated now
that Verizon is in charge well it'll be
interesting to see how this all kind of
shakes out finally Marissa Mayer CEO has
decided that she wants to stay on now
why is that it's interesting I think
that she wants to prove herself right
she certainly made enough money she
worked at Google she's been the CEO of
Yahoo she's made millions of dollars
it's really about you know she was
brought in to save this company and
ultimately it got sold and so maybe
under Verizon she could finally prove
that she can fix this company but it's
really ultimately up to Verizon whether
they want her
