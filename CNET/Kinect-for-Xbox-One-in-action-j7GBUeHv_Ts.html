looking at the actual depth view so what
you can see is the 3d rendering of where
you use in 3d space if you come a little
bit closer you can see like some
incredible fine detail you can see is
tight I think that's your belt buckle
that we're looking at there zip it up
you're good to go
have you been down a little bit we'll be
able to see the detail in your face we
can open your mouth your tongue out
three times the fidelity of what we have
in the first sensor is really kind of a
ground one of the groundbreaking berries
a tech that allows us to this really
light things up so the other thing I'd
love to point out this incredible field
of view that we have like you all notice
how close he actually is to the sensor
which is a dramatic step for from
connect v1 and you can actually see the
sofa all the way far back so you know
living rooms of all sizes no matter
where the furniture is we're gonna be
able to you know bring this experience
to you is a huge leap forward over where
we were in the first generation the
other thing I'll point out is the
incredible horizontal field of view if
you would mind kind of walking from side
to side put your arms out show us your
wingspan and like this actually facing a
sense though so you want to the side
side yes I decide just just to give
people like you know an overall view of
how big of an area you can see so
everyone in the living room no matter
how how where you are how your living
room is oriented where yourself it is
pretty phenomenal so now this is a great
view for all the technology that we run
but it's not quite so human consumable
before that 1080 1080 p HD color so this
is you know six times the resolution of
what we have in connected e1 we can see
the incredible crystal-clear high
quality color feed that we have this
will be the premiere experience
perspective in the living
everybody's involved you can see
everyone no matter where they are the
sofa next to the sofa far back on the
wall we're really going to be able to
light up fantastic experiences both for
Skype living room delivery room
communication and in game play scenarios
so this is a new feed available the next
generation of Kinect that we call active
IR and what it's doing is it's using
infrared technology to see everything
that's happening in the room actually
you can see the gentleman in the front
we can see all of you in the back so no
longer do we have any kind of lighting
dependence whatsoever pretty fantastic
stuff I'm gonna back up once more to the
color feed and I'm gonna use my
flashlight to kind of show another
aspect of this technology might want to
close your eyes for this I don't whine
yeah typical scenario you're gaming and
you got a lamp right next to you you can
see how he's all ballooned out we can't
really see his face and show up that
bright I'm gonna switch back to active I
are completely subtract it out so not
only can we see in the dark we have
complete independence from any of the
light sources in the room so this is
what creates a phenomenal consistent
platform for doing all of our computer
vision and all of our detection you're
all familiar with Kinect skeltal
tracking welcome to the next generation
so as you can see we've got our next
generation skeleton happening right here
I'd like to point out just the
incredible stability that we have the
more you move around the more it's gonna
represent what you're actually doing so
you can shrug your shoulders you can
kind of lean forward you can move your
head back and forth so point out you
know the accurate spine the shoulders
all the expressiveness all running in
real time on our hardware platform other
key joints that I'll point out is the
hands so if you hold up your hands
we actually have joints that represent
the tips of your hands and the thumbs as
you rotate your hands around as you open
up as you close that you can actually
see that happening in the skeleton
itself pretty advanced stuff so we've
got you know had a great coverage of how
all the bones are connected this is how
they're all oriented next to each other
this is block man you saw a brief
glimpse of him in the video but as you
move around as you're
take your arms and your shoulders you
can pick up your leg and swing that all
around you can actually see the
orientation being represented in real
time we have enough fidelity with the
depth map to be able to check what your
accurately doing so it's a pretty pretty
phenomenal stuff I might say you know
but we didn't just stop there
you know I'm 6 4 my scale totally weighs
8 pounds if you want to know what's
going on with me at the body level you
got to be lunders down my muscles all
the forces that are going on what's
working my experiencing so muscle man is
a human based physics model applied
directly on top of our skeleton and our
high fidelity deathmatch and what you're
seeing here is a representation of the
actual forces that he's feeling in his
body so green representing no force and
then red being the most intense force so
you know as you shake weight between
your two different feet you can see that
we're detecting which foot he's got all
of his weight on on the floor ok you do
a little bit of a squat you can see the
force he's feeling it in his thigh but
we're seeing it on the screen so you
know kind of real-time representation it
was happening at his body level and the
last thing we can use is Technology
boards we can track up momentum so we
can give me a nice tight little jab
nothing too big see the white dot no so
we're actually able to track what's
going on now if you really put your back
into it and shift your weight you know
punch a bigger circle there we go you
can see shifting weight from one foot to
the next at a really accurate
representation of what's happening all
right so we have you know really great
telemetry in what's happening with the
body but as any good physical trainer
will tell you like this isn't enough
you know it's heart rate as well so what
we're doing here is we're using both
color feed and our active IR key to
actually see this pulse in his face
there's very subtle fluctuations in both
the intensity and in his skin codes
imperceptible to the human eye that
we're actually able to detect in real
time to detect what is heart rate
actually is so we've talked about the
body but you know it's not just about
the body we've got these fantastic
controllers as well so I'm gonna come
join them
come into the view controller all right
so you may have missed it but it
actually just identified me it did say
guests initially and now it actually
says Kareem I'm pre enrolled on this
block so that quickly and actually
identified who I was I walked into the
room my next box tells me they're both
holding controllers all right don't push
any buttons all right well we can detect
the real-time let's try something again
all right there we go
so as we're swapping controllers we're
able to detect in real-time who's
holding what controller yeah we can kind
of do one more thing going on a jumbo
join us all right so we're all here we
got the three of us controller they can
hand your controllers you want the other
thing that we can do is we can actually
swap places so let's go ahead and swap
so in real time it's actually able to
detect who's on what side of the screen
and so no longer do we have to swap
controller there's swap on the sofa to
actually get split screen the lined up
to how we are there's nothing more
annoying than being on the right side of
the cell that's lying on the side of the
screen
