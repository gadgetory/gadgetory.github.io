all new line of razors we have two of
them right here this is the Droid Razr m
the model that you can get here in the
US inside this box we have the Droid
Razr
eye now before we start I just want to
say I'm super excited because our grip
Dave made me my very own box cutter with
my name on it
alright let's bust it out now as I
mentioned this is the international
version of this sort of low-priced razor
line it's meant to be a little bit more
affordable the specs are just okay but
there are some key differences between
the eye and the amp
one key difference that is obvious right
off the bat is that the razor
eye actually has an Intel chip unlike
the M which has an atom chip let's see
what's in the box okay we have our
international power brick comes with the
earbuds and charging cable that's a
short little charging cable I'm not a
fan of that with the iPhone 5 so now I'm
totally hyper aware of the length of all
the charging cables it's amazing what
you can get obsessed with in life so
let's look at the phone
it is a 4.3 inch display which after all
the sort of mega phones we've been
unboxing lately looks tiny see it's I
think it's gonna come on no even though
we didn't charge it up let's compare
these side-by-side and while we wait for
this guy to start up let's do some specs
this is Motorola's first Android device
that contains an Intel chip it's a 2
gigahertz Medfield's single core chip
and I gotta tell you at first blush you
can tell it's just a single core it has
a 4.3 inch edge to edge Super AMOLED
display it runs I am sorry to report
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich jelly
bean is expected sometime later in the
year there's only 8 gigs of internal
storage but there is a microSD slot so
it's expandable to 32 gigs not 64
there's also an 8 megapixel camera and
the international version has a
dedicated camera button more importantly
and this is the reason that we wanted
the razor eye here's what the press
release has to say about the toughness
of this phone designed with premium
protective materials razor eye is built
to go everywhere a diamond-cut
aircraft-grade aluminum floor frame
surrounds the display which is made of
corning gorilla glass to deflect both
scratches and scrapes on the back razor
eye is made of DuPont Kevlar strong
three spilled coffee cotton the rain
don't worry
razor is protected with a splash guard
coating even on the electrical boards
inside it's like this thing was custom
designed for our torture chamber frankly
I consider all that a challenge now as I
mentioned it's very similar to the Droid
Razr em were not likely to see the eye
here in the US so let's hear about what
we're gonna get stateside it has the
same 4.3 inch screen with the edge to
edge bezel and Super AMOLED display the
same Kevlar backing it weighs just 4.4
ounces and it has the same 8 megapixel
camera a micro SD card slot for
expanding the onboard memory a
front-facing VGA
it is also running Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich even though Google owns
Motorola and here in the u.s. it does
run 4G LTE on Verizon but that is not
all razors just keep coming today this
we actually sent someone right down to
the store because this was just released
on the day that we're taping is the new
razor max HD we're gonna find out if
Alina foo wants to keep it and unbox it
for your viewing pleasure
alright so this is an update to the
original Droid RAZR MAXX the main
difference is that it's a lot bigger it
goes from the now kind of dinky seeming
4.3 inches to a 4.7 inch display and
then you remember the deal with the
razor max is that it's supposed to have
all-day battery life considering that
this is a 4.7 inch display and it's
running 4G LTE if that's true this
phone's gonna be pretty popular except
for the always legendary crappy Motorola
cameras sorry guys all right let's see
here pretty fancy box apparently square
power bricks or just it now there's it
charging cable and that appears to be it
no headphones okay let's look get to the
actual phone it's pretty thin relatively
speaking it's got that kind of cool
Kevlar looking backing let's fire it up
definitely feels more premium than the
razor ham which it is the razor M is
designed to be sort of a lower end phone
let's power this on and let's go through
the specs it has this nice big 4.7 inch
HD AMOLED display it runs at 1280 by 720
resolution it has a one-and-a-half
gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon s4
processor but a somewhat paltry one
gigabyte of onboard RAM it's available
on Verizon on their 4G LTE network
there's 32 gigs of storage that's
expandable through a microSD card
there's an 8 megapixel camera capable of
shooting 1080p HD video it does have an
HDMI port so that you could show some of
that video on your TV it ships with I am
once again sorry to reports Android 4.0
Ice Cream Sandwich even though Google
owns Motorola more importantly
it has the same 3300 milliamp battery as
the original max so three perfectly
serviceable droids I have to say if I
were gonna pick one I would probably go
for the cheaper one the max HD is a
really nice phone it's obviously premium
beautiful screen and I'm sure the
battery life is great but if I were
looking for a droid running last year's
operating system I wouldn't want to pay
that much for it I mean I'm sorry I know
maybe some people don't care about
having the latest and greatest OS but I
cannot in good conscience really
recommend a phone that isn't running the
latest version of the software for
security reasons and usability jellybean
is really good Google give it to people
anyway there you go three perfectly nice
razors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
