we're just going to take a quick look at
the new droid maxx from motorola which
is announced at the verizon press
conference here in New York just a few
moments ago we're taking a look at it
see it has a very large 5-inch screen
it's 720p AMOLED has very wide viewing
angles pretty nice running Android jelly
bean and as you can tell it is a pretty
thin it still has this Kevlar coating on
the back here that you would be familiar
with on the other older motorola devices
what actually said this one part though
is that it has a very massive battery as
a 35 mil and battery which supposedly
will allow it to run for 48 hours which
is pretty nice that's a huge huge hugely
impressive number to run for and we also
have 4G LTE cursive verizon device is
going to ship on the twentieth of august
for 2 99 99 and other features include a
8 megapixel camera here on the back
supposedly it allows you to take better
photos in low-light and we've also have
eight cores in this device allows you to
do at a cool google voice searches it
will actually listen to you while you're
you know in the background so you can
query make queries and make a lot of you
know questions while you know the phone
is on the table you can just talk to it
and will actually
you know look and do searches for you so
that's something that we definitely get
a chance and they have folks just got a
quick little look at the verizon droid
maxx by motorola i'm brian bennett it
seems like how many</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
