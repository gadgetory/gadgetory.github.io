us for another episode of the 359
podcast is this episode 97 on Wednesday
August help me uh 17 and this morning
we're joined by Roger Cheng and Ken
Jemaine guys thank you so much for
joining us ah thanks for having us happy
Wednesday everyone first off I want to
give a shout out to my wife it's our
wedding anniversary and you're here and
I'm here I'll be home early i'm gonna go
home early-ish and thank you their third
year round we're here three years yeah
where we got a kid in the burbs now it's
it's really i know it's official haha
well it's just I don't even know she
listens to this anymore but if she does
babe love you it's been a great three
years she's like I hear this it's fine
alright so we've got a we've got an
action-packed intel centric show for you
guys intel developer forum kicked off
yesterday we're going to talk about some
of the the biggest announcements there
including the possible death of the
audio jack now not just due to apple but
also intel with a USB type-c port will
be talking about project alloy the
virtual reality headset with no wires
that until showed off which virtually is
just a prototype but it's sort of a cool
glimpse of what we can see for the
future with VR and if we have time I'm
not sure we're gonna have time we'll be
able to we'll talk about Intel's
prototypes of our classes and the tiny
new computer called jewel about the size
of two dimes put place the side by side
and it's enough to run 4k video audio
Wi-Fi the full-fledged chip so kind of
crazy all right whenever you're ready
Brian oak just as always if you have any
questions about any topics or apple or
Samsung because we know you always have
questions about them leave them in the
comments section our producer Brian will
pick out the best questions and we will
do our best to answer them all right
we'll be back at you in exactly three
minutes and 59 seconds starting in three
two well
that was a good too much so that lets
sorry as three days I no no no I got I
got it right yesterday the other two
days I screwed up yes okay just move
this other way so then send us your
questions or recording the podcast will
be back to speak with you in just a
couple minutes and Roger you ready this
time hands-free oh the hazards gone yes
alright in three two welcome to the 359
when we talk about the top tech news of
the day only other crap you want to
throw in I'm Roger Cheng and with me is
the legendary kent german hi Roger I
happy here great to have you thank you
held all the way from the UK yes so I'm
we're honored to have you here in New
York so Intel kicked off its developer
forum yesterday and we got a lot of
interesting tidbits from the event the
most important is the revelation Intel
believes that the USB type-c port could
eventually replace or kill off the
traditional audio jack now that they're
all authority rumors out there the Apple
is going to do the same thing with a
lightning port if now Intel is kind of
backing it from the other side I mean
can I should we start investing in new
headphones or is this it I think it
might be actually yeah it seems you know
I still go to hotels years later after
we killed off the 10 point you know ten
point thing in that the iphone my still
send those checks you know yeah company
like who uses this now because no one
has like the large 30-pin yeah I think I
only spend a one hotel that actually had
the new lightning connector in the in
the you know the thing you the doctor
yes there's a soda yeah yeah so uh you
know that Apple did that and they just
went right ahead and then a lot of
people had to change so I think that we
are seeing like I think we will have to
invest in new headphones actually it
seems like that's going to happen yeah I
mean it looks like once again Apple is
going to lead the charge with this I
mean Samsung just few weeks ago kind of
made some cracks about how their Bell
galaxy note 7 still has an audio jack
but if what Intel's saying is too
believed you know phones might be able
to other phones are gonna do the exact
same thing I mean they'll probably get
there right I guess my one thing that I
kind of fear about this is so does that
mean that you can't charge the phone and
listen to music at the same time I think
that's what means yeah but unless you I
guess you get excited about that Brian's
face this is jaw just dropped about like
saying that but yeah I mean I think it's
one port you've only got one party
thirds audio or its power you can't go I
guess unless you got caught you know a
wireless charging then you could do that
but true if you have wireless charging
or I guess if the
you've got sort of a double yeah war cry
for their for USB type-c or lightning
but yeah I mean with both Apple and
Intel that's you know that's covering
pretty much the entire ecosystem so well
by the way just in case you guys are all
up in arms about that intel says the
advantages are of course the thinner
design yeah removing the audio chat
makes a mix for allows for thinner phone
also the possibility for digital sound
processing which means that tech Guppies
don't actually have to go to BOS or
Dolby to get all those nifty audio
tricks all right next up until also show
it off project alloy the VR headset
without pesky wires it uses the real
sense cameras to allow your your actual
hands to appear in the virtual world did
you have a chance to check out the
headset or take a look at the coverage
yeah I did it was total interesting idea
because every time we host an event
where you know we have a VR headset like
we have the HTC the vibe or something
you know it's funny to see people and
they kind of wander to the edge and
someone to get yanked back a little bit
yeah oh yeah yeah yeah we had that you
see to have a corded phone at home you
know and you try to reach across perhaps
something sounds like hot so yeah I
think that'd be cool I mean I I still
have a I still get a little motion
sickness with vr-zone admit so I'm not a
like not totally into it but I think
that for the technology if you could
just sort of wonder across the room and
be completely away from a computer
something that'd be really yeah problem
with a lot of stuff that Intel shows off
is a lot of is just there just reference
designs they don't actually make any
product you can really make the chips
that power these products and this
reference design won't actually show up
to its partners until the second half of
27 teams so it's a long way off it's
definitely long way off lastly just
wanted to chat about smart glasses that
until showed off powered by a new
computer called jewel which is about the
size of two dimes side by side I mean
it's does that excite you or this is
this google glass all over again and it
sounds like it but i think this is
another thing like you said they're just
making a stuff that goes in the product
so what a week what is this actually
going to do for a consumer and I mean
we're so far from that yeah it's hard to
say oh yeah if anything I mean this
stuff in these computers can go into
more IOT devices in the future all right
so for all of our coverage from IDF
check us out on cnet I'm Roger Cheng and
Kent Sherman thanks for listening
alright that was a good discussion
it's gonna be the Golden Age of dongles
know right that's devastating to me
because I for one I have a real hard
time sleeping so the way I kind of live
my life is I but wind down for a good
hour or so we should I headphones and
I'll put on headphones and I put my
phone on charge next to me and I've got
sleep phones which are essentially like
a sleep mask right with like flexible
headphones built in and I'll really tell
attached like one thing oh it's a little
wonderful I never i ever heard that but
yeah that does sound pretty Pleasant I
can't sleep without him anymore even if
there's no sound pumping through them
they're just kind of comfortable no um
but yeah I'll put on like nature sounds
in there and if I'm strapped angle than
that I'm gonna have one of two things
insomnia or a dead phone right well I
mean that's the things we're gonna be
all we're gonna beat dongle mania right
just gonna be extra ports or not well
you know if Apple does include wireless
charging their phone that would solve a
lot of the problems but yeah but then of
course you got by the pad yes and true
yeah yeah we've got some good discussion
going in the chat already alright Jay
Mason's wants to know from your
experience what actually sounds better
is there actually a benefit from the
lightning audio to the old 35 millimeter
well we don't really know what the
laughs I'm sorry the story said I think
that it there could be some advantages
and I forget what exactly it's yeah yeah
so yeah the key advantages are sort of
allowing companies to do more softly you
employ more software for audio
processing gansu doing things like
simulating the sounds as if you were in
a big concert hall or you know canceling
out jet engines or rumbling train oh
right so these are the kinds of features
that you might be able to get if you
work with adobe or bows but with USB
type-c and directly with lightning
you'll be able to do more of the
software so it's like apple or Samsung
could actually employ more saw audio
tricks without the help of other
third-party certain thing that the flip
side is is that I'm sure if Apple is
going to do this they figure this out is
that is the USB would a USBC upset have
more power consumption and you know
would that affect the battery and that
is an excellent point I don't know about
the lightning
in terms of the USB sorry yeah but USB
apparently they're going to introduce
new technology that allows for shut off
of non vital parts of the phone or parts
of the device so they argue that the
switch from USB to 3.55 or 3.55 to USB
is negligible in terms of power
difference so which is surprising is you
think like a powered headphone that that
would generate more energy a lot of
people seem to have a lot of loyalty
towards the old audio jack it's funny
some people would say i'd rather not the
phone get thinner I'd rather not this
feature I want to keep my eyes been on
the bandwagon for a while now-like I
don't care about the phone being thinner
I just wanted to like last longer you
more practical things like be waterproof
like I think we're thin enough at this
point and the novelty of it being a
little bit thinner a hair thinner just
isn't worth it for me I don't think
they're actually going to compensate
that with any better resiliency either
that's just gonna make it weaker yeah
I've got a collection of headphones and
I don't want throw them all away my
loyal team to my headphones I've been
listening to Sennheiser's and costs as a
consumer for 20 years I've had an iphone
for less than 10 where's my loyalty lie
mm-hmm I mean I think we've actually
talked about this on the show before are
the headphone manufacturers going to
fall in line and start producing USBC
lightning headphone models are they just
gonna depend on like third-party
developers to make Duncan said
composition and that's something else
thing up to the you know you could lose
something empty to carry around yeah and
then it just seems like it's some of the
bridge between two things that could
cause interference or you know just
whatever so I mean especially with Apple
I imagined the the audio the headset
makers are gonna line up and Purdue
young compatible phones like there's no
other single product that draws the kind
of demand for accessories like than the
iphone right do you remember how much
the dongle was between the 10 pin
connector and like uh like 39 yeah
there's guess what yeah i was just
looking that up but then my computer
lost connection but connectivity but
yeah it was it was kind of a outrageous
price yes it was a lot of ranting
there's a lot of anger over that move to
lightning but then it just happened and
everyone
over it after a while right yeah look at
he said like Apple just removed doesn't
really care about what you think because
they know you're gonna just get on board
that's translate so to Jay Mason's in
the chat I i think watching the chat
really uh answers your question if
people will be mad or glad whether the
the headphone jack is going away it
looks like collectively by and large
like most everyone here is kind of
ticked yeah I mean I'm disappointed I
don't want to see that happen I imagine
there's gonna be a lot of anger come
September when Apple releases its new
iphone but we just said like I think the
angers Chris aside subside people are
just gonna get over it eventually yeah I
mean just the headphones are of course
very you know depend on what you have
are very expensive things unless you're
using just the thing that comes in the
box but you have said ya know I've class
like your I've got her pose you know
exactly headphones and I've got a pair
of fancy bose noise cancelling
headphones I always weren't on the plane
and just I'm not relishing the idea of
like carrying little dongle that's like
plug it in so yeah bluetooth there's a
next discussion is about if there is
going to be a headphone cable at all
going forward but according goes so many
of our reviews bluetooth audio doesn't
hold suit yeah plus I mean I'm always
kind of worried that it's gonna it's
gonna conk out what I needed the most
truth that's that's the biggest
objection I have yeah I just don't know
I thinks is you typically have your
device close to you when you have
headphones on i don't i don't see I'm
not a really attached to bluetooth audio
in that sense like I don't think it's
saving me that much convenience and
roots right okay if I'm if I'm using it
to sort of you know make a connection
like past data back and forth sure it
great but if I'm using it for something
else but it is it does fall in line with
apples for philosophy of getting rid of
wires cables and I mean I'm I'm a sound
guy at heart and I hate cables I hidden
so much but it's a necessary evil yeah
and you know if you are a true
audiophile you're not going to sacrifice
your high quality headphones with the
decent cables for some crappy bluetooth
yeah yeah we're just not know it's uh
and I'm not even an audio file but I
would sort of feel the same way yeah any
more questions the same loyalty it's
just fun to watch people being like
screw this this is this dumb idea rental
video rental and bring it on
Scott does agree he thinks that the
headphone makers will kind of fall in
line Akash thinks that Apple is just
going to brainwash us all and we're
going to fall in line as you said well
it's important to know again I mean
we're talking about Apple a lot but the
subject of this discussion is Intel and
now coming from the other side the
Intel's the USB type-c ports are going
to be showing up on more phones and you
know theoretically a lot of these
handset makers are going to fall apple's
pattern dumped the audio jack and just
rely on the the USB type-c port because
it does for design wise it definitely
opens the door for a lot of different
designs thinner thinner designs for
these devices I am just kind of curious
if there is a fidelity jump with the
USBC I'm very interested personally to
see how it behaves I can't imagine there
being much of a discernible change yeah
I mean we'll have to say this is all
kind of theoretical right now but I do
wonder however if USBC will make easier
more seamless integration with maybe
home systems like maybe that can make an
easy way to take your like you could
transport 5.1 sound on your iPhone or
whatever like that and tap that right
into a home digital theater system
possibly there's a thought yeah maybe a
benefit trying to find the silver lining
in the death of an oil right or doing a
good job yeah um I don't know I think
Apple might be losing some customers on
this one I so that I'm highly skeptical
as anything I think they'll lose
customers were not lose customers but
sales my demand might be weak if just
cut the iphone 7 is it going to be as
different as everyone thinks of work it
second me as different as years past but
i think the audio jack is sort of a
negligible factor here yeah there's
something will be a lag between people
though and then i think they finally do
it probably but if they're they have
good headphones for all their good sign
huh i'm just going to keep these and
then the next time they upgrade
headphones than maybe they'll move in a
dress yeah yeah it'll be kind of
interesting to see how it plays out with
the user base and those who if somebody
was a true old-school audiophile analog
audio whatever like that yeah have they
ever gone to iphone in the first place
is this even a concern for
if they've gone iphone are they true
audiophile you know that kind of thing
is it that there's there's an
interesting thought to come now we're
just going down radical we really are
but that's it though like it's a
question of convenience versus quality
and are these people actually interested
have they ever been right or are we
trying to preach to a completely moot
choir here I don't know I'm sure there's
overlap there's overlap of people who
are we're just gonna be annoyed for
various reasons with the elimination of
that audio jack what do you guys
speculate do you think Tim Cook has
apple on the right path or is this a
frivolous decision mmm completely
personal completely biased sure can't do
I mean you've you've covered APPL for a
long time um gosh I mean with whether
this is you know he has the company as a
whole in the right path that's that's
hard for me to answer but um I you know
I think that this doesn't I think yes
this doesn't surprise me that Apple
might do this is because they're always
sort of saying we're kind of do
something they're always kind of
creating their own path and that sense
yeah and I could I think it fits within
them to say well we're just going to do
away with this 3.5 millimeter jack that
everybody's used for years we're going
to do a round thing and they'll mark it
it's it's better it's better quality it
seems the battery it saves this and and
I think they'll don't win a lot of fans
because they have people that are their
core fanbase i think is very much into
that like apple this is a different way
so we're going to do this so i think it
fits within them like it fits their path
I mean Adam but as far as Tim Cook as a
company as a whole well I will say I
won't i won't say whether not just takes
the company the right direction but from
a financial perspective dropping the
audio jack and just going lightning does
give Apple financial boost because they
license out the technology for learning
you have to pay to use it to be an
authorized lightning lightning accessory
and so you know they get a little bit of
extra change from that so financially
speaking it's it's probably a good move
yeah what's no one no one here cares
about know what's the UH what's the next
thing that they will remove to try and
make it more thing what do we there's
nothing left it's the top lane oh no the
clay I the glass so the home button yeah
that's actually that's actually next
that's what they can
and that will have you packed on its
thickness or no but it will have effect
on its size yeah because a bigger screen
got a huge chin right now right yeah Jay
Leno chin not not cool maybe they could
put in a bigger bet you know yeah I
think you're right though it is going to
be the home I think it's one thing that
would leaves they get the fingerprint
stuff to work on the screen I think they
can just dump the home the honky and
that would leave the volume rocker and
they on and off button and that's it
yeah here's an interesting perspective
remember what Apple were the first to
get rid of the floppy disk and they were
right about that yeah oh yeah God look
at how far we've come though and now
we're all up in arms about a tiny little
hole in the side of it well I mean like
the macbook what was the first embrace
USB type-c and nothing else I mean they
were the first ones to ditch in the
optical drive all together there you go
yeah yeah so yeah this tree it happened
before it's happened before it's gonna
happen again they've taken something
that's sick you no longer need this
thing they've used for yours Oh what
about the side buttons I think those
will probably have to stick around right
I think you could get into some kind of
like touch sensitive gesture e-type
control um I mean I suppose they could I
mean the nice thing about the physical
volume rocker is that you don't have to
be get to looking at the phone yeah
which is so if it's you know just on
your desk and it's too loud or if you
just need to adjust the volume maybe the
power button could be replaced by
something on the screen you never know
its true like that um yeah cuz you know
that's the only thing that you actually
but what if you just took the side of
the phone and like it's just the left
side you just go like this I just kind
of like brushed start shaving it on yeah
like that's how you control volume going
forward back you know what that could be
a thing yeah actually could just slide
your finger up and down like a like just
a strip or something and yeah yeah yeah
yeah I mean they're putting the what's
the speculation about the touch at the
top of the new macbook oh the like the
the LED LED LCD screen was a strip that
changes depending on the context of the
program you're a similar vein there yeah
good although that would add huge amount
of cost this is a size trip thing
because it would awesome we just said
we're just gonna buy it anyways about
the car well not just a cost but the
structural integrity I don't know if
you'd be able to like
place the aluminum frame with a small
strip of glass and have it work or
better be durable I don't know now we're
just really getting a rebel will they
put power button on the apple logo on
the back there you go mmm touch apple
for life all right we should have been
places story should definitely wrap
things up yeah yeah all right look if
you like anything you saw or heard here
check us out on cnet our podcast is also
