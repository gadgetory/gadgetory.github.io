city sets it's the airport passenger
terminal front and center this set is
this enormous plane it's 47 centimeters
long you also get an airport terminal
and this runway vehicle
let's build we have built this little
airport car system thing it's got some
really nice details here I particularly
like these little suitcases well halfway
through building the plane we're going
to put the roof on soon so I thought
we'd take a moment to appreciate some of
the interior details this toilet is
quite nice as a little swinging door
here and you can see a little like a ho
toilet bowl in the back there their
seats obviously up here we've got a
little drinks compartment slides down
worryingly close to the old pilots chair
if you ask me but there you go he's got
a little coffee cup again hot liquids
electronics spillages
the plane is finished it actually took a
little longer than I thought it would so
much of this plane is huge of solid
pieces of brick that I thought maybe it
wouldn't take that long but there are so
many tiny details all over the place
around the engines around the wheels I
think it's a bit of a shame that there's
no hinge on this which would made it
easier to get inside and mess around
with the interior but one minor
concession is that these bricks here
this strip of orange that actually sort
of attaches the roof to the rest of the
plane there aren't many studs on that so
it's reasonably easy to just pull
sections off if you did want to get
inside on a much more positive note I
love this door it's so cool it's got
this hinge on it so when you pull it
open it sort of opens in that way that
plane doors do which I really really
really like and on the underside as well
the landing gear these wheels are really
nice and this front one spins
halfway through building the terminal
there are some fun moving parts here
let's examine them so first off we've
got the revolving doors pretty cool
quite intimidating let's try putting
someone through it shall we
Oh got caught in the mechanism gets a
tight fit she's not gonna be walking out
the airport on that leg that's not good
that's not healthy right nice and slow
next up this baggage belt that's pretty
fun this came basically as one piece
only had to put on these little
adornments I pop on one of the little
Lego suitcases it's gone flying hang on
pull this up there we go here we go wait
for it
so already came together at the end
there the last few stages were mostly
sort of decoration a lot of stickers and
this air traffic control tower which is
really nice final detail is the chair
spins that's really nice in this radar
dish as well on the top that also is
adjustable so it's been a build of big
pieces but also of tiny details it's not
the cheapest set but you do get a lot of
Lego and quite a lot of building for
your money anyway that's all for now
check back next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
