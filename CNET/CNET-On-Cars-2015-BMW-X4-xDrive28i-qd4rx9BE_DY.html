for utility now there's all kinds of
variants of SUVs that are less about
utility and more about style and we're
in one of them right now let's drive it
the new wall from BMW and check the tech
now what an x4 is depends on your frame
of reference if you're coming from x3
this would be the coupe like slightly
less practical version of that vehicle
built on the same basic platform or if
you're gonna put a reference of the x6
the original coupe UV this is a shrunken
version but not on the same platform now
inside the x4 it's a familiar place if
you knew anything about 3 or 4 Series
cars in general you know the iDrive
interface has become a very excellent
place we control it here with this
controller that turns kicks and clicks
but you've also got a nice sized
touchpad that as we'll see writes very
quickly with your finger also familiar
to BMW buyers will be the fact they
nickel-and-dime you to death for
everything rear cameras extra heated
seats or extra navigations extra traffic
is extra bumper sensors for parking is
extra a lot of things go on top of that
base price we have built-in connectivity
that particularly is good at powering
online search for destinations you do
get some satellite imagery on this
vehicle but only to the one mile
resolution then it drops down below that
and you go back to pure graphics outtie
cars I started introducing 4G and it's
transformative in the vehicle plus they
push satellite imagery all the way down
to full magnification speaking of our
connectivity a lot of folks are not
familiar with this this is a cradle for
in this case your iOS device I've got an
iPod Touch here now but your iPhone
would go there and as you see it's got a
lightning connector there a little
spring that pops it up a little cooling
fan down there in fact when you dock
this in here you take advantage of Shore
power so you're always charging and
neatly and it connects to an external
antenna I like that
and of course BMWs these days all have
just about every media source you'd care
about and pretty much none you don't
need to care about your music collection
refers to your hard drive I would never
use that I don't think you would either
external devices are more interesting
I've got a USB jack underneath that
phone cradle bluetooth streaming and of
course
an auxilary jack for the old-school
devices of course we have AM FM HD radio
and satellite radio satellite radios
extra - as I recall you have for drive
modes in this vehicle which is fairly
classic BMW stuff starting at the bottom
the least responsive is Eco Pro which
you can configure what that does then
you've got a comfort level Sport and
Sport Plus where it starts to pull back
some of the stability control but not
all all the X's are of course powered by
an 8-speed automatic regardless of which
powertrain you pick up now if you're
under the Prowse a dead giveaway that we
had the little engine because look how
much space sits right here in front of
it that's where the rest would go if you
had the inline six in fact we have the 2
liter inline 4 with direct injection
complexly variable valve timing as well
as a twin-scroll single turbo just about
all the greatest hits of modern engine
engineering the numbers are pretty good
on paper certainly 240 horse 258
pound-feet of torque that's more
important especially for a vehicle like
this because it weighs over 4,100 pounds
but still gets to 60 in a pretty tiny 6
seconds flat MPG is 2028 that 20 makes
me a little nervous around town inline 6
is only 1 mpg thirstier let's go for a
ride and see which one we'd really like
to have
under way nice little snarl from this
little inline-four especially when you
get on the paddles to wind it out or put
it in sport or Sport+ ride quality is
really good handling is pretty sharp I
don't feel the need for the dynamic
suspension that is an option this one's
got a nice balance of of handling and
cornering as well as a good compliant
ride what I would like to do is try that
in Line six if you're buying one of
these you've got a head-to-head
test-drive them this car just feels like
it's a little bit much for the engine
also crappy rear visibility because of
the coupe roofline you've got this kind
of U shaped eyebrow on the rear window
you can't see a damn thing out of the
back of this car now as I mentioned
you're gonna get nickeled and dimed when
you set this car up I wish it was just
nickels and dimes we start about mid
forty fives for this car delivered with
absolutely nothing added and then go see
net style from there the big ones 3154
the tech package then you've got 700
bucks for driver assistance that's where
your rear cam comes in driver assistance
Plus is nearly $2,000 a lighting package
to go LED and auto high beam is nearly 2
grand
that cool phone cradles about 500 bucks
and blessedly were under $1,000 to add
Harman Kardon surround sound audio still
we're about 55,000 and that's the little
engine now for that six that I think the
smarter go that's another 3300</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
