the middle of winter it's disgusting out

of February it's 75 degrees just the way
nature intended if I'm gonna answer some
questions I gotta find some shade at
flow turbulence in honor of burnout
paradise getting an HD remaster what's
the next EA game you would like to see
get that treatment
it can't be Mass Effect that's easy
mutant league hockey mmm because it was
like a hockey game where you could play
as a demon or a which there was no
penalties you there was just death so
like you go on the power play because
your guy died because he got decapitated

across the way right that's the name of
my new band slug Zamboni

year of CES
I'm sure tan blue wants to know our rear
speakers really that important for
surround system here's the deal
wireless speakers all the ones that I've
seen they're kind of garbage but I think
you need them for really good surround
sound so you're sort of screwed maybe
the thing to do is get a wired one
figure out a way put those wires under
the carpet get someone to do it put them
in the walls it's way worth it I don't
know about Star Trek if you could
be the creative lead on a reboot of any
game what would it be
SSX I would love to bring that back I
know they had one a couple years ago but
I want a brand new SSX game I would love
to do that and I would also love to
bring back eternal darkness that was one
of my favorite games of all time on the
Gamecube like psychological effects in
the game where they would like pretend
the game shut off or like the volume
would go all the way down but it was all
fake like the sanity effects they called
it really rad bring that back I want to
be in charge of it thank you you know
yeah
absolutely not it's so goddamn hot out
today what's that one TV show that
everyone seems to like but in your
opinion sucks West world isn't that good
everybody don't treat me like a piece of
crap that show treats me like garbage
two different timelines going on at the
same time oh the big reveal is that the
good guys really the bad guys don't do
that to me don't treat me like garbage

phone do you recommend for someone that
doesn't care about phones but needs a
phone and never wants to buy another
phone again just get like a used iPhone
eight who cares right just it's got a
good camera it's gonna do you good
you'll be fine and it's the perfect
phone for people who don't care about
phones I don't understand it and like it
is so uber violent like how graphic does
that show need to be were there any
pieces of tech you impulse bought or
techy feds you went all in on that
people mocked you for were they right
they were all definitely right when I
was a kid I used to buy all these
nonsense digital watches that did all
this stuff that they didn't need to do
like you don't need a watch to control a
TV I don't know why I thought that was
cool but I got one I also had a watch
that vibrated when your phone would ring
how do I knew that for it but I bought
it was like $400 it also went off
actually well from the microwave would
run to like why can't they just be
robots with like gears spilling out of
them and they're like no we made
livers and pancreas is for these robots
to wear these draw whatever you want to
call them that show sucks greatest movie

Sun going into the lens that's okay
looks okay John says you Dan a B Alex
and Vinnie have turned into superheroes
overnight what are each of your
superpowers I don't think it's speak for
all the giant bomb people but my
superhero ability would be the power to
find shade wherever it might be even in
the desert because I am a pale man and I
need to find shade whenever possible if
the Sun is out I mean look perhaps I
already have the power your skin's gonna
thank you your skin's gonna thank you

top of my head well put these lobsters
