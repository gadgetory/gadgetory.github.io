we're gonna do answering all of your
questions about sling TV I'm joined by
David Katz my senior editor here at CNET
reviewed sling TV you are TV reviewing
guru this is right in your wheelhouse
what other compliments would you like me
to throw towards your direction I'll
take whatever you got all right fair
enough a washing slinger at chief
slinger chief executive slinger that's
all taker
um so sling TV is a very big deal a lot
of people have questions about it is it
can I cut the cord finally who's it for
so what I wanted to do is you know we
asked people on Twitter send us in your
questions about sling TV we got a few
responses that I want to get to I got a
couple at replies I want to get to
people are sort of on the fence about
this so real quick I know you did do a
full review for sling TV but what
exactly is it so sling TV is just a
service that you can buy it's 20 bucks a
month anybody with an internet
connection and a credit card that's the
United States can get it right the idea
is it provides live TV channels so the
big draw is ESPN and get ESPN and ESPN
to live just like if you had a cable box
you can also get TNT CNN and a few
others there's 11 channels on the basic
package they say 12 but course Cartoon
Network and Adult Swim
right right back to back on the same
channel so who is sling TV for who is
who this disorder sling partnership who
are they sort of directing this at well
they're saying Millennials people that
haven't bought cable in their lives
basically they're just used to watching
YouTube and Netflix um but there's also
an element of people who cut the cord in
the past who you know have a little bit
of money that can you know maybe afford
cable that don't want to or want to save
money on the share bill but still miss
live TV and I think that's really kind
of the key audience there's people who
are used to watching live TV that want
to get ESPN they want to get those
channels have CNN on when breaking news
happens things like that so those are
kind of the core two people despite the
marketing I think it's really applies
the court cutters to okay like I said we
asked people on Twitter using hashtag SC
net let us know what you are confused
about when it comes to sling TV
obviously we encourage everyone to read
Dave's a review
at Morpheus XP says a sling and dish are
they actively courting other networks to
be a part of sling to be like us a
sci-fi AMC I'm sure they are yeah one of
the big things is this was a deal that
was done last March between Disney and
dish and and Disney's the big guys here
they signed on gave them ESPN gave
everybody the ability to you know
provide the suite of channels there's
also the Disney Channel a bunch of kids
channels that come with this package and
then you know Turner signed on with TNT
and CNN and those channels so those are
the two big guns here there's also
scripts which has DIY and HGTV okay so
that's a pretty good suite of basic
cable channels there but like we said
you're also missing Comedy Central
you're also missing you know some of the
real big guns out there like Fox like
USA Network's that has some very popular
channels AMC it's gonna be well I think
before you get these guys on board
because I'm sure that's slang and or
dish talked to these guys beforehand and
said hey here's what we're doing a lot
of guys probably are gonna wait till
roll up their own proprietary channels
maybe Fox and you know things like the
ABC networks are already on there but
you know the big networks aren't so ABC
NBC CBS nothing get on over-the-air
antenna that you know area used to have
before they went you know under because
of the court ruling sure those guys
aren't available on here either so you
know you're basically getting a few
channels of basic cable here so as long
as you know what channels you're getting
and you like what's on there it's still
appealing right and that leads into a
lot of the questions we got Joe do on
Twitter says well there's no support for
local broadcast right so if you're still
someone who wants that you either need a
standard cable subscription or you get
yourself an antenna yeah and if you're a
court cutter you purchase or you might
already be familiar with the idea you
plug in antenna and any TV and get live
TV broadcast PBS is on that list
obviously which is great and then of
course there's live TV DVRs now you can
buy four antennas tableau a channel
master makes one we've reviewed them
they're great products where you can
basically turn your you know
over-the-air antenna into a DVR and get
you know the ability to pause and record
channels which is really cool and a lot
of people are used to it alright I want
to pivot into a little bit about sports
local broadcasting that is the massive
caveat and
I think the other one is live local
regional sports there's none of that
right and I know we could go on for
hours talking about how jacked up the
entire infrastructure currently is and
we do in our private drive but you know
first off I want to get to at Brown Minh
says there he heard that there was
rumors that the NCAA Final Four is going
to be blocked is that true from sling TV
so so we don't really know at the
blocking situation is OK at the end of
the day there's there's a lot of caveats
built into this system already you know
there's you can't pause on ESPN there's
a lot of things you can't do with this
system that you can expect you know
normally the people can do but I don't
really know how they're going to handle
sports I think they're still working on
it
sling has said that they're gonna have
what they call a sports add-on pack
that's extra $5 a month they already
offer a couple of them one for news and
info and one for kids channels and add a
few extra channels are not that
compelling now but the sports one is the
main thing because that's the real thing
I think keeps people attached to their
cable secure more than anything else is
local sports so which is you know
obviously owned by cable companies
around here and across the nation
and and those guys own everything the
team the the the pipes you know the
whole deal so those are the real kickers
and I don't think you're gonna see those
on these over-the-top services anytime
soon because people know that that's why
a lot of people keep driving to cable I
mean I pay $180 to Verizon every month
just to watch hockey really yeah you
throw your money away and maybe like
Bravo yeah you know let's see well there
you go and Bravo's another that's
basically sports for women sure and and
you know what that's not gonna come here
anytime soon because Bravo has such a
lucrative deal and and you'd still have
to pay you know $18 a season or you know
$2 an episode don't ask me how I know
for every Bravo you know that's on
Amazon well we tried to cut cable in my
family in between you know me like in
the MSG and her you know Indian the
Bravo it was it was difficult so you
know those are the things that those
those really specific channels that are
really popular they are gonna hold on
till the very end and get as much money
as a Canada people before they go to
something like this alright thanks so
much for for spending some time with us
and sling TV when are they saying it's
me they're saying February 9th it's
gonna come out we'll see they've been a
little bit delayed with some of the
stuff but that's what they're saying

review on cnet.com david reviewed every
last possible detail of sling TV and
thanks for being here but anytime Jeff
taking all right we will see you soon
