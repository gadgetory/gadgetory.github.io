missing from this BMW i8 Concept car
mirrors the two side mirrors have been
replaced by cameras with two additional
cameras on the back the rear view mirror
is now a screen instead of just single
images from each camera they've actually
fused the image to one display this
actually looks like the imagery from a
single camera and it's showing
everything that's behind me the updated
VW Microbus nicknamed buddy is also
missing a traditional car feature door
handles let me see if I cannot open up
this side door so I'm just gonna put my
hand right here the all-electric concept
vehicle also lets you open the trunk
with your foot but gesture control can
do more that open and closed doors with
a wave of your hand you can park a BMW
concept car using an apple watch a
special app detects the motion of the
gesture and authorizes the car to start
parking via the cloud it's always
activation like that and to get the car
in the parking space it's like the the
tennis forehand and to get it out its
activation again and then like waving
two times towards yourself to close
without using your hands
you'll someday be able to get your house
ready for your arrival with just your
voice so from inside our vehicle we
could control our connected smart home
devices Alexa turn on my kitchen lights
okay Alexa turn on my TV okay
a partnership between Ford and Amazon
would put the virtual personal assistant
Alexa into vehicles for the first time
