cnet.com and I'm here with the Moshi car
amo in-ear headphones moshi is known for
making very stylish products makes a lot
of iphone and ipad cases also has a line
of earphones and these are a mid-range
model priced at 120 dollars and really
their claim to fame is that their
earpieces are made out of ceramic a very
polished stone look to them they're very
cool looking they also sound good
they're considered balanced headphones I
found them nicely detailed with a decent
amount of base but really these do not
push the base so if you're used to an
earphone or want an earphone with a big
boomy base this is certainly not that
this has a flatter profile so really
more balanced across the trouble
mid-range and base these are slightly
bigger earpieces so they may not fit
everyone's ears quite as well as others
I thought they were pretty comfortable
they also do have an inline remote with
a microphone for making cell phone calls
that inline remote is Apple friendly and
they also come with a nice carrying case
a unique carrying case they're designed
to both protect the earphones and also
are good for cord management so all in
all in eyecatching earphone that also
sounds good it may not be for everybody
especially those who like a ton of base
but a decent enough value at one hundred
twenty dollars I'm David car noise and
those are the Moshi paramo in-ear
headphones thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
