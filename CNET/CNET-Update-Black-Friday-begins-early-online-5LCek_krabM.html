shopping event I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update the day after
thanksgiving may not be a crazy rush to
the stores like in years past many big
retailers are opening their doors on the
afternoon of Thanksgiving but online
shoppers will be first to get deals with
many stores offering black friday deals
starting online Thursday morning
including Walmart and JC Penney and a
few have sales online already including
the Disney Store Amazon started its
Black Friday on Monday and it calls it
black friday deals week with a limited
supply of products on sale for short
bursts of time and new products are
added as frequently as every 10 minutes
you're going to want the Amazon shopping
app to keep up with the sales Walmart's
online sales start Thursday morning and
it's cyber monday actually starts
Saturday this is expected to be the
biggest holiday yet for online shopping
the national retail federation expects
consumers to complete about forty
percent of their holiday shopping list
online ebay now is another way to avoid
the in-store mania the same day delivery
service is offering free delivery on all
orders now through christmas eve
normally there's an extra five dollar
charge for delivery but the service is
only offered in San Francisco San Jose
New York and Chicago the hottest tech
gift this year could be tablets Cena
asked readers what gadget they will buy
this season and forty percent set a
tablet in a distant second with phones
twenty three percent of readers said
they have a phone on their holiday
shopping list if you don't want to give
a gadget there are plenty of services
you can give for the holidays like you
can give someone a subscription to
Amazon Prime but it looks like you will
not be able to give someone a summary of
their genetic code that's because the
DNA analysis company 23andme was told to
halt sales of its service by the Food
and Drug Administration because it does
not have the department's marketing
clearance or approval the company sells
a saliva collection kit for about a
hundred dollars and the DNA tests can
tell clients whether they are at risk
for cancer or if they carry genes for
other genetic diseases like Parkinson's
and also if their body will respond to
certain drugs and those results fall
into the FDA's definition of a medical
device which requires approval from the
department but back to gadgets it seems
that Samsung is coming out with yet
another large screen smartphone the
company unveiled the galaxy grand 2 with
a screen that's a little over 5 inches
in size this is not going to be a top
end phone because it does not support a
fast 4G LTE wireless connection but does
have a good quad-core processor we don't
know yet when it's going on sale or even
if it's coming to the US that's your
tech news update and you can get more
details on the show blog sina com /
update from our studios in New York I'm
