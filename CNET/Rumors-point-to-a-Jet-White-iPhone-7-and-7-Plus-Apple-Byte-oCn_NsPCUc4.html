welcome to the Apple bite for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
and last week we talked about the speed
of the SSDs in the new MacBook Pros what
do you think about this pop quiz true or
false the new MacBook Pro outsold every
competing laptop in just five days think
about it well obviously it's true
otherwise it wouldn't be the lead story
of the show dummies duh now according to
slice intelligence and this pretty graph
the new MacBook Pros accumulated more
revenue from online orders in its first
five days compared to the surface book a
SUSE Chromebook flip Dell inspired on 2
+ 1 and Lenovo yoga 900 based on uber
seat data from almost 13,000 shoppers it
also generated 7 times the revenue in
its first 5 days compared to the 12-inch
MacBook launch and you know what that's
a good Apple now we know there's been so
much pent-up demand for new MacBook Pros
that people are going to upgrade even if
it left out a vocal group of
disappointed professionals and guess
what
that's who Apple is really targeting
these days and then general consumer now
you may be a working professional but
when you tell me you're fine with the
new MacBook Pros and lack of ports and
RAW processing power that's because most
of you are basically web surfing and
word processing on that Pro machine you
know it's true all right Apple
third-party retail inventory records
have revealed that the new MacBook Pros
width of touch bar will be available on
November the 17th
that's the date we're targeting now
Apple is currently showing a four to
five weeks shipping estimate for touch
bar models but the 13-inch without one
is available now and based on the
previous story you can expect big sales
numbers from this product one Phil
Schiller even claimed last week that the
new MacBook Pro has more orders from
Apple than any other pro notebook ever
and that the numbers will back that up
also remember those pricey 4k and 5k
displays for rich people from a
partnership with Apple and LG they just
drop the prices significantly with the
5k display now priced at 974 that's $325
less than before and the 4k display will
now be priced at five hundred and twenty
four dollars a
$175 cut from its original price yes
still pricey but at least a little more
competitive with what's out there which
makes you wonder what were they even
thinking in the first place
alright Mac OS zero ten point one point
two gets its second public beta released
just a week after the first one it
mostly fixes bugs and performance
enhancements but it also supports the
new emojis introduced with Unicode 9 we
talked about last week and make sure you
keep your eyes open for this one Mako's
that's my favorite alright iOS 10.2 also
received its first public beta if you
signed up it features the first look at
the TV app for iOS devices that was
introduced at Apple's keynote it's not
fully functional but it's a peek of the
interface and will support series live
tuned and feature and single sign-on
from your mobile devices and since we're
on iOS
let's just get a bunch of iPhone rumors
out of the way for this week Mac o
takara floated a rumor that Apple plans
to add a jet white color option for the
iPhone 7 and 7 plus you know the same
treatment that caused the original
launch of any jet black iPhones to be
delayed for weeks now no timetable is
given as well as the disclaimer that it
may be an unreliable report then we have
KJ Security's new reports that Apple is
unlikely to refresh the iPhone se until
after the first half of 2017 that's a
sweet spot for a lot of people with the
4.7 inch screen the main reason is to
wait until components are cheap enough
for Apple to make the same high margins
on the next upgrade to that phone and
this rumor from at least three or four
months ago was re-energized thanks to
people who saw it on Facebook for the
first time now the iPhone 8 is rumored
to get guess what wireless charging my
goodness now the Nikkei Asian Review
reports Foxconn is making wireless
charging modules to go along with the
10th anniversary iPhone that's scheduled
for release next year but it will only
get to the next iPhone if they're able
to produce enough units to meet
production so I'm just gonna hold back
on this for those of you who think this
is the first phone to ever get wireless
charge and before we go I care about you
all I really do so I've got a great
giveaway for my friends at Belkin if you
have an iPhone 7 and you need both the
to charge your phone while listening to
it at the same time we're doing an apple
bite giveaway for the Lightning audio
plus charge rock star three of them
could be yours all you have to do is
watch the last week's show tell me what
was the signature call that I use at the
end of the show and bonus points if you
can send me a clip of you doing it
holding it as long as possible and
remember to hold your camera in a
landscape mode please we'll announce the
three winners next week all right that's
gonna do it for this week's show you can
email us at the Apple bite at cnet.com

y'all next time for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
