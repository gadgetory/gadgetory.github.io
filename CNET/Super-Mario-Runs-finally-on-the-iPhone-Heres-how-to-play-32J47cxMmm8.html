Italian guide to your iPhone so what
should you expect
is it worth ten dollars here we go
just know that it doesn't work without
the internet in a subway or on a plane
Super Mario run will not load it needs a
connection for many that's going to be a
deal-breaker
it's also one button Mario each level is
about jumping and timing runs instead of
using a virtual game controller on
screen for many things you don't need to
do anything Mario will auto run and jump
small obstacles levels can be easy
enough for a three-year-old but the real
challenge is getting coins and building
high scores it ramps up fast as the game
goes on you can challenge other people
the sixty second score runs in a mode
called rally each rally cost one ticket
but gets earned by meeting weekly
achievements win the rally and you can
earn coins and toad followers use both
to unlock and buy little things for your
growing Mushroom Kingdom
a little toad house a decorative
mushroom for free you just get three
levels to play plus the toad rally runs
and the kingdom building experience but
you're going to want to pay ten dollars
for the whole package because that's the
only way you're gonna get the rest of
the 24 levels there's a lot of virtual
Mario currency going on in Super Mario
run you don't need to pay extra for it
but you get extra tickets for toad rally
challenges which you'll need to grab
coins and toads and keep unlocking
things but think of them as extras not
the main event each level is hard to
master two grabbing five pink purple or
black coins takes work in timing also
master the moves here are some tips be
patient every once in a while you'll
find a pause block which lets you stop
and think strategy double tapping and
long tapping increase your jumps which
you'll need some levels play like giant
puzzles so get used to wall jumps to
earning extra coins to unlock playable
characters like peach and Yoshi takes
time and have it uncovered all the
secrets if you're a Nintendo fan who
loves Mario though this little slice of
the Mushroom Kingdom looks like the real
deal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
