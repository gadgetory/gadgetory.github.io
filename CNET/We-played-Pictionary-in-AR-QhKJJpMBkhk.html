pictionary it has you drawing in the air
instead of on paper butter bear
butterfly
it's called pictionary err and we got a
chance to play it before it goes on sale
in June your mission is the same pick a
card and get others to guess your words
based on your drawing but the challenge
is that you cannot see what you're
drawing your doodles are showing up on
the app on the tablet or phone for the
people who are guessing it's a fun new
take on augmented reality but it is
being done in a low-tech way instead of
a pen you have a wand press the button
to draw and the light turns green the
app is using image recognition to record
the path of the green light to create
your lines
you don't need an internet connection
there's no syncing anything and that
makes it very easy to pick up and play
anywhere and this medium opens up the
game to new ways of playing you can act
out your drawing to get the point across
shower shower cap got it oh yeah nice
but if you're having a hard time and you
know your doodle is a complete mess you
can ask to erase the screen and try
again
math okay it'll work on Android and
Apple devices we even used an Apple TV
to mirror the screen for our demo but he
could just trip you up more if you try
to look back behind you to see what
you're doing there are several modes the
classic game play that puts 60 seconds
on the clock but you can also customize
how many rounds you want and how long
each round lasts or you can get creative
with a freestyle drawing mode I'm used
to like scratching something out or
adjusting it on the fly but now I don't
know where that line is so that was the
thing is like I had to trust
maybe maybe say like a simple drawing
and then I'd act more by oh yeah this
charades part like it really sells it
because then you can like really like
work with your drawing because it's just
floating in front of you I started to
realize just at the end that you could
do things to yourself like I could add
whiskers to my face or put a hat on my
head or like you were getting on a
scooter and you know actually riding the
scooter I think that's the part that
makes the most sense for this tightrope
gotta get it
Pictionary air is priced at about $20
it'll first be on sale in June at Target
stores and it will launch globally in
July</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
