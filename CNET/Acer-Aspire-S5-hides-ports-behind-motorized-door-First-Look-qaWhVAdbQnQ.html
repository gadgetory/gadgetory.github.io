a look at the Acer Aspire s5 now if you
remember all the way back at CES 2012 in
January we first saw the system at the
time Acer said it was going to be when
it finally came out the world's thinnest
13-inch Ultrabook and I will say it's
actually a hair thinner and a little
tiny bit lighter than even a 13-inch
MacBook Air I think there might be one
other laptop that's a hair thinner than
this but that's not technically called
an ultrabook
so for now I'd say the record stands but
that is not the most exciting thing
about this particular laptop I'm going
to show you what is if you look on the
sides here there are no USB ports
there's no video out anything like that
what you have to do is look very
carefully at the back and I'll show you
that's right here you press a tiny
button and that's right a little
motorised port door opens up and it's
got two USB 3.0 ports it's got HDMI and
it's actually got Thunderbolt which is
something you almost never see on a
laptop or at least a Windows laptop you
know I think that's pretty cool but
everyone I showed this to had a similar
reaction with one that's great and then
they had the very same question to a
person they all said what do you do when
that breaks down now I'm using this
thing over several days and dozens of
deployments of the of the door which HR
calls the magic flip I have not had a
problem with it but it's a legitimate
question what they try to do especially
with very portable laptops like this is
remove as many moving parts as possible
not add new ones that's kind of why a
lot of these smaller laptops have moved
to solid-state hard drives rather than
the traditional spinning platter hard
drives and it is very cool to see
Thunderbolt in a Windows laptop and
something usually don't find outside of
MacBooks even though this is a very thin
very light laptop it's got an Intel Core
i7 CPU in it that's the ultra low
voltage version but it's still plenty
speedy does not have the screen graphics
we're starting to see that in a few
ultrabooks but not here so you're not
gonna use this for a lot of games but I
thought that the the keyboard and the
touch pad worked fairly well for such a
small laptop one thing that drove me
crazy the keyboard is actually not
backlit that's something to see on
almost any Ultrabook these days too real
omission so if we were willing to take a
chance on that motorized magic flip port
or in the back
willing to spend a little bit more this
thing is $13.99 then you should
definitely check it out I am Dan I come
in and that is the Acer Aspire s5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
