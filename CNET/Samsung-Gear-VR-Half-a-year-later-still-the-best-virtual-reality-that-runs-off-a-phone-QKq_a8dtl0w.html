I'm Scott Stein in virtual reality
wearing the Samsung gear VR for the
galaxy s6 remember six months ago I had
taken a look at one of these for the
Samsung Note 4 hello and I thought it
was an interesting view into virtual
reality virtual reality is the ability
to transport yourself wearing
stereoscopic display that makes you feel
like you're in a three-dimensional world
that you can look all around in you can
get Google cardboard that's super cheap
or you can get this system which is the
highest quality one you can get the
works of the phone but this version
works just with the sx last year's
version works just with the note 4 as
the same types of optics uses the same
type of quad HD resolution display
that's on this but there are a few more
tweaks here there's a fan now to cool
down the lenses to prevent fogging when
you're wearing it and there's a micro
USB pass-through which means that you
could charge these up while you're
wearing them or having the phone in the
display there is an added trackpad here
this allows you to navigate and tap in
lieu of being able to move your hands
which you can't do yet in mobile virtual
reality setting it up is simple you just
slide the phone in and dock it and click
it into place and it works without
wearing glasses I have really bad vision
but when you put these on there's a dial
on top that adjusts focus you could just
kick back in a chair and be in your own
virtual movie theater like I am the only
problem is that the gear VR is not that
portable this set you know doesn't
really fit into a anything that's
smaller than a backpack so I kind of
know take it on the train all that much
plus you'd be sitting on a train with
this thing on your head maybe that's a
good thing
what's new is a revamped app store
oculus who is partnered with Samsung on
this headset has a whole collection of
mobile apps now dozens and dozens some
of which you can pay for others of which
are free the downside is this Google's
cardboard that cute little foldable
cardboard player you just pop any phone
into it
it works with any app that's available
on iOS or on the Google Play Store that
says it's VR compatible
pop it in try it out it probably works
plus it works with YouTube and its
panoramic VR videos this does not allow
you to tap into that every time you pop
in the phone it's launching you right
into the oculus experience which is not
connected to the rest of your Android
phone hopefully some day it will be it's
not now this does pair with a Bluetooth
game controller so you can actually play
games and feel a little more connected
but if you want stuff that's going to
feel really next wave there will be a
lot oculus is planning a a larger-scale
effort in mobile VR down the road this
is an innovators edition which means
it's kind of a collector's item the
Samsung gear VR costs an extra two
hundred dollars on top of your phone so
it's not cheap but if you want the best
that mobile VR has to offer right now
the Samsung gear VR is it I'm Scots
dying back in VR</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
