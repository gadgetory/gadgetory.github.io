cars there's less for that battery to
have to lug around that electric motor
to have to get up and go well here's a
little car that's now an electric car as
well the Fiat 500 now in the e-version
hundred miles on a charge in real world
city driving is what Fiats projecting
probably around 70 something in
mixed-use highway is harder on TVs than
city a charge on a 240 high current
circuit which is not unreasonable to
have at your home should take about four
hours in other words there's not a huge
battery in this car because there's not
a huge amount of bulk in this car it's a
nice benefit of having a smaller
platform when you go electric some other
changes you're gonna see on this guy
obviously there's no transmission in the
typical sense so you've just got that
interesting little push button deal that
reverse neutral drive and park thing
you've also got a slicker body on this
car they've done a bunch of smoothing
and they check out that front grille
that's also more of an air flow manager
not so much a grille there's no engine
in there to allow this car to be
slippery or and to help get as much
range as possible
no more speedometer in that central pod
that iconic 500 pod instead you've now
got what looks to be about a seven inch
round color LCD that has everything in
there including all kinds of indications
of charge range and things like that
there will be a pair of apps that will
connect to this car iOS and Android
right from the get you can send
destinations to the vehicle check its
charge state tell it to charge that's
pretty routine stuff actually in the
easy industry but at least they're not
missing a beat one place rent they might
miss a beat is they're still using that
dopey stock mounted TomTom you stick on
the top of the dash I've not been fun of
it when I've tried it before maybe the
integration is better in this car but I
doubt it I got a feeling you're gonna be
using your phone a lot no word I'm
pricing it's a little early but this car
will be out q2 of 2013 that prime means
smack in the middle of the year we'll
know a lot more then and we'll get one
in for a driving test asap
