episode 319 of the 359 podcast you know
me on BVG shout out the soul shoutout to
Dallas
shoutout to Malta to all of our
international listeners here and beyond
your host today include Alfred Eng and
Ben Fox Ruben way to go
I know there'd be this many people
watching the show can I can I can I
still back out of this or not yeah yeah
you can leave I can just do it on my own
are you holding your CNET award so yeah
they gave then we should places we just
lost everybody anyway so today on the
podcast we're gonna be talking about the
home pod that's apples $350 smart
speaker was expected to be available for
the holiday season unfortunately Apple
delayed it they said that on Friday
we're also talking about the Google
pixel buds which apparently offer
real-time eight died they're kind of a
dental dud
pixel duds they did get some noises they
did get some poor reviews we'll go over
some of the info from David car noise
review that just recently published as
always send in your questions and
comments
bujji we'll get to as many as you can at
the end of the show let's make podcast
history shut up here we go hang out
we'll see in the chat three minutes in
59 seconds from 3 - welcome to the 359
I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm alfred hang
interested in buying apple's new home
pod smart speaker for the holidays well
you're out of luck apple on friday said
it's delaying the release of the device
up until next year to me this is a
pretty big mess as far as I'm concerned
the Apple Apple was late already
- the smart speaker World Series isn't
that good to begin with they really
needed something like this to try to
engage people in their smarts bigger and
now they're just saying all right we're
gonna see it next year yeah well I
figured if you're going to be late you
might as well just continue being late
to make sure you have the best product
out there you know I think it's much
better than you know rushing out and
yeah here it is you know even though
it's not as good as it could be and I
think you know there's a lot of people
who are willing to wait for Apple o
total already been waiting
for like two three years now so what's
another year I mean that does remind me
of an old saying of mine where if you're
gonna be mitten if you're gonna be late
you might as well already be very very
late yes which is like okay fine but I
don't know you do you find this at at
least remotely embarrassing for the
company I mean like you you have you're
supposed to have a product launch for
the holiday season this is a major tech
company they should have stuck this lame
yeah I don't know I don't think Apple
actually needs the holiday season I mean
think about when they release their
phones and their laptops and those seem
to do just fine without the holiday well
they do they do especially with the
phones they do release them around
September as people get started until
the holiday season but you know you're
right yeah but maybe they don't come out
during the great Presidents Day sales or
you know they don't do a lot of sales to
begin with so you know that's that or
today is a great holiday president
next up CNET's own David Carr no I
reviewed the new Google pixel buds a
pair of one $59 Bluetooth earbuds that
can translate speech in real time
unfortunately the translation feature is
only available for pixel phone owners
and David said it isn't really that
different than the existing Google
Translate app apparently there were a
lot of reviews there were a lot NASA
yeah a lot of people did not like the
pixel buds which brings me back to the
home pot point would you rather have
something rushed to market and not work
as well and be eviscerated or would you
rather just be a year late and have it
be somewhat decent I don't actually
don't know if the home pot will be
decent but that's what I'm assuming
they're waiting it for I think the
problem that I have with the Google
pixel buds is is that this is a problem
of very high expectations when Google
first announced these things everybody
was talking about how this was like
Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy Babel
Fish I'm just gonna stick them in your
ear and all of a sudden you're gonna
understand Chinese
or Spanish never say I was definitely
one of those chumps that when I saw the
announcement I think this is incredible
I'm gonna get this my parents there's
this is gonna change everything any
issues with translations or anything
like
turns out that is not the case it
actually doesn't translate in real-time
it kind of it's basically like the
listening from your phone like the
Translate app yeah so it's only as good
as Google Translate is at which it's
basically a shortcut yeah it's a
shortcut for the Google Translate app
and the entire quote unquote killer
feature of this thing isn't that
different it's not even that great of
Bluetooth you know headsets were begin
with
that's definitely disappointing
considering that they're charging a
hundred and sixty dollars for it and it
always appeared like really bulky to me
I mean it has like a touchscreen feature
on it but it said David described them
as like they look like like Mentos
breath fresheners that you just kind of
like stick in your ear and they stay
there so not really something that I
would be too excited about but hopefully
they come up with something more similar
to the Babel Fish at some point either
way if you want to read more about these
stories check us out on CNN I'm Ben Fox
Ruben I'm Alfred Aang thanks for
listening
all right everybody thanks for joining
us for the recording of the podcast I'm
gonna go ahead and start delving through
the chat for really great comments and
questions to keep the conversation going
so go ahead and submit those at your
leisure until then when do we think do
we have a date for the home pod I think
they said early 2018 what's interesting
about no month the residence day baby
they what's interesting was that they
initially settled a December although
right they initially said December but
they never actually provided like a
clear date so for them to announce that
they were punting on this makes sense
cuz it's just before Black Friday Cyber
Monday and maybe they were hoping to at
least have an announcement ready to yeah
hey you had that three hundred fifty
dollars that you had sitting around why
don't you hold on to it for another
couple of weeks and we'll have the home
pod ready for you yeah now that I'm
thinking about it maybe like this isn't
that much of a big deal to me per se
because I haven't been looking forward
to the home pod I imagine that if
Nintendo had like delayed like Super
Mario Odyssey or something I'd be really
disappointed Oh totally yes so I imagine
I'm just gonna put myself in the shoes
of an Apple fan and assume that this is
their Super Mario Odyssey I think the
thing is is that I cover smart speakers
and
missing the launch of your first smart
speaker for the holiday to me does seem
like a big deal but I do appreciate the
points that you were making where you
were like look Apple has an extremely
loyal fan base and they're gonna buy
this product regardless whether it's a
couple months later whatever and if they
if they nail the execution and people
really like it and they are actually
willing to pay 350 which I'm still
wondering if they are nobody's gonna
remember this delay that's that's
another did they did they ever specify
why they were doing as if they're like
more is it because I remember seeing
something else saying there was like a
lack of like supply or stock no that
wasn't that wasn't it I can actually
read like the actual announcement but
either way to answer the initial
question early 2018 which generally
could mean January or if you were gonna
look at this from a very broad
perspective it could be as late as June
because early 2018 could mean the first
six months of 2018 I think they
intentionally kept it vague so they
would give her give themselves as much
time as possible it sounds about right
and from what I'm gathering from the
chat from James favor what would you
rather have a not finished product or
wait four more months I know what I want
I'd wait decipher I'd rather a product
be late and finished than on time and
feel like a beta and Danny Green
I've waited months to get kickstart a
Kickstarter items why not a home pod
yeah that's fine but Kickstarter items
are from much smaller companies and
generally their execution is very
different than what I would expect from
a company like Apple which is a
mastering Giant and they're the most
valued company in the world they're the
ones that set their own deadlines
they're the ones that said that it would
actually be available in December so I I
do see this personally as an
embarrassment for the company and people
should just like factor that in and you
know see that as a consideration yeah I
don't I think this is egg on their face
I don't really think it affects you know
people who are looking forward to buy it
that much I mean they're gonna weigh
like a couple tree wants for it but I
think they're gonna get a finished
product and in the end well for months
and in the grand scheme of things you
know I I hear you so let me let me read
the quote from Apple from Friday we
can't wait for people to experience home
pod
they can toast apples break through
wireless speaker for the home but we
need a little more time before it's
ready for our customers and that's basic
oh and and we'll start shipping in the
US UK and Australia in early 2018 short
sweet and it basically explanation of
why it's it sounded more like it's not
ready we still have to work out a couple
bugs as opposed to we have we don't have
enough supply or anything like that
so I wonder what the bugs are maybe they
only tested it with like Johnny Ives and
like you can only have his voice
activation I mean there's a theory that
this is Siri related but I don't really
have like much of I had to hang on on
that but Siri isn't that good and to
actually make something that cost three
hundred and fifty dollars and is
voice-activated and the voice assistant
is has been half-baked for a long time
maybe they're working on yeah but
they're not they're not exactly
marketing this on there on the assistant
though right they're working around like
these are really good speakers even in
there like apology they're saying you
know our breakthrough wireless speaker
for the home not our smart speaker or
smartest sister because they're
basically saying these are really good
speakers series on it you're right yeah
and that's because they obviously
recognize that Siri is subpar yeah to
the others my microphone
hey continuing on this was a
professional show by the way continuing
on with the conversation the dash says
delays are becoming an annual feature of
Apple right followed on my James favor
it sounds like it is becoming a trend
earpods last year now the home pod
that's a joint that's true with the air
pods there's also an isolated thing or
is this what tech is doing now because
they're trying to cram too much into too
little time well wasn't the issue of the
airport that's actually that they didn't
have that much like they had to increase
the stock of it Oh was that actual I
mean it was also it was delayed as well
but I I never knew if it was a software
issue or like they just needed it to
make even more of them look an argument
could also be made that the iPhone 10
was quote-unquote
delayed because they launched it after
the iPhone 8 the thing is is that Apple
was the one that established those
deadlines so traditionally
all of the iPhones tend to come out at
the same time but it's it's apples song
that we're all dancing to so if they
want to say hey it's coming out two
months later then yeah the other ones
then at least they're they're
establishing expectations properly I
mean like another one to throw out there
as far as a an embarrassing delays
Amazon go which is their cache earless
store they had this big to-do about it
last holiday season they said that one
was gonna be ready in 2017 and we're
still waiting for it
they still got time they're still got
like a month yeah no no they said early
2017 it's still early it's early 2017 we
still have we still have a little bit
more time but yeah III appreciate what
you're saying as far as you know
everybody wants to be wowed and maybe
they're cramming too much into it it
reminds me of the the Galaxy Note 7
situation where they did a little too
much was it the note 6 what was it even
called what are you talking about
the fire phone the phone from Amazon mmm
forget it next question I just like this
comment from Chris gamer he says
remember what happened to the first
speaker Apple made no I don't recall
that notes I think you're referring to
Chris please clarify the jobs say about
that very funny
ouch holy crap bees the first Apple
speaker oh my god I'm moving on uh-huh
Watson if this is just a speaker why
aren't apples
why isn't Apple releasing it as part of
beats since they own that company good
question that's a really good question
yeah question iPad about the air pods
it's the same question a lot of people
have been having about beets in general
is that what what is beets why are they
using beets like why did they even spend
billions of dollars on beets if they're
not actually going to be utilizing its
IP that much or promoting beets as a
company so it's it seems as though
they're trying to fold beets into apple
proper and that's that's their long-term
goal sounds like it and apologies that
was Chris Garner not Chris gamer
apparently I can't read anymore
razor 2048 why is a home pod so
expensive for the price you can get a
decent smartphone you can connect to
some speakers home pod is more expand
then the LGV 20 for chrissake my theory
is that it because Apple is selling it
hey that's a big point shocking another
another theory about home pod that I
heard from one I know list I talked to
on Friday was that the smart speaker
market in general got away from Apple
they realized that with the Google home
Mini and the Amazon echo Todd both of
those are priced at around 50 bucks
selling one for $350 which is seven
times that price maybe they realized
that it just wasn't a big enough market
so is there a possibility that they're
going to introduce a different or
smaller one along with the home pod I
mean like we could hope so but that's on
Apple the home pod Nano right the home
hard shuffle the home pod shuffle that's
actually a really good one and have it
be at a price point only does a little
bit more reason it only does random
commands no matter what you tell ya you
know you ask oh you want it just comes
up with the weather is look the argument
is is that you if you're gonna be
spending that much money especially if
you're gonna be spending like $700
because you want two of them you want it
to like fill a big room like a living
room maybe you want to go to you know
something like a Bose or something like
that yeah which which they're known for
audio
I mean post the Apple which is known for
a lot of things that's the thing the
audio files I already know what course
they're going down here but Apple's big
sell point is that audio fidelity that
they've got more bass or whatever better
sound out of the speaker so on that note
mark chung-yong the issue is what's the
value proposition of the home pod beyond
the music first direction versus a more
robust a voice assistant with key
partnerships and richer feature sets I
eat echo Google home so on I couldn't
agree more they're gonna make knowledge
that the speakers are give you a much
richer experience
I'm serious they're gonna say that these
therapies are richer if you spend the
happier fortune honor and share right
but like what's what they're saying that
these speakers yeah but like you said
you know you probably just buy a really
good speaker for cheaper than that yeah
and echo exactly exactly that's that's
what I'm sure a lot of people are
already doing right now and that's why
you know from from the way that I've
been seeing it Amazon is getting like
just this close to actually how you like
the Kleenex of smart I will tell you
this though is
I don't know how much you value your
privacy but as far as like between the
three like smart speakers out there I
would probably argue that Apple's home
provides the most privacy with a Siri
right like they're not you're not they
sell it to advertisers or anything like
that and no one else uses it so going
back to that comments are what's a value
proposition I guess if you're willing to
spend that kind of money and you really
value your privacy which sometimes those
things do actually work pretty well
together you would have a market for the
the home pod I'm struggling to actually
see that that is a pretty big market but
again this is Apple so there are a lot
of people that are going to be
interested because there are Apple
loyalists and they love Apple and it's a
pretty product sir and joy if home pod
gets good reception we'll other smart
speakers get pricier in their next
iterations just like the oneplus phones
also good question there's the Google
home max that's already selling for $400
so we already are gonna get an
opportunity to see during this holiday
season whether people are willing to
spend that kind of money on a smart
speaker I would probably say from seeing
sales of echo speakers the echo dot has
been by far the best seller so far as
it's cheap cheap stuff right only knew
the minis probably gonna outsell all the
other home product and you can put it in
multiple places around your home like
even if you have like a relatively small
home unless it's a studio maybe you want
to fit a home Mini or an echo dot in you
know multiple locations and not break
your budget doing if anything they
should start making smart speakers that
double as like other things in your home
like imagine it's like a toilet paper
holder but it's like to echo dots just I
actually like that idea so I like to see
like a really trap and then smart City
it's so cheap you just throw it out
after you catch a roach so let's talk
about how these speakers get worked into
other situations like razer 2048 brings
up they should give the home pod build
it into an amp for like 2.1 speaker
setup if user wants to use their own
large speakers and then decipher follow
that up saying i believe they're going
to market the home pod is a great
accessory for the Apple TV do we think
that'll get built into an Apple TV
natively any other devices in your home
that's an interesting idea so basically
you buy a home pod that's also an Apple
TV or an Apple TV that has full home pod
capabilities built into it I mean that
is certainly a possibility I hadn't
considered that idea so Bravo to the
commenters for coming up with that idea
I don't know no no I mean that's just a
great place to think though it's the
problem is is that like look if they're
not getting traction on a 350 dollar
smart speaker what is gonna cause them
to then expand that line it's just it
doesn't seem logical hey you know plus
they spit they make almost all their
money or they make 2/3 of their revenue
off of the iPhone so that's that's their
baby that's the thing that they really
care about yeah couple more home pod
questions and then we're gonna talk
about the buds
James favor has been announced that
other online streaming services might
work with home pod or is it just Apple
music and related Kevin Shaw to any
other smart speakers hook into Apple
music directly those are good questions
I don't actually know the answer is off
the top of my heart I know that the echo
does not hook into Apple music I know
the echo works with Spotify yes but you
have to like set up your account for it
so we can Alfred can look this stuff up
and then we'll get back to that question
and event until then James favor also
asks what do you say is better the Apple
or Google earphones I mean right now
they haven't used either of them but I
think right now it's our everywhere
there's I see that stuff like on the
train like every time I come in but if I
remember correctly as of right now the
higher ratings stand standard on CNET
from our reviewers the air pods do come
out a little bit ahead from the pixel
buds you want to spot check me on that
all the time if they're competing as
like headsets most reviewers will give
the advantage to the air pod
it also has longer battery life and it
charges faster and it kind of just looks
better it's not like you don't have to
submit that's too subjective people
thought it was weird if yeah but like
the like the but like pixel buttons they
liked our review said it's like they
could look like Mentos like they're mint
and then I mean the air pod doesn't
that much better it looks like the head
of a like a toothbrush like that you
chopped off when you put on your ears
but it's it's not mentos they have
Mentos a toothbrush uh-huh okay so the
air pods do have a better rating on CNET
they get four stars the pixel buds get
three stars but david karna mentions in
his review that from from purely a sound
perspective taking out the whole
realtime translation part they're
they're fairly comparable yeah and and
he's an audio guy so he's gonna notice a
lot of different things right his weird
like turn around he's not focusing so
much on the bells and whistles i i've
been listening to the ear buds that come
free with your iphone for years and it
doesn't bother me that much but they're
perfectly fine right from an audiophile
standpoint yeah they're not the best out
there but they're they're pretty good in
the vise and i'm not willing to spend a
hundred and sixty dollars all right no
more no no I'm talking about the ones
that come free oh oh but then I own so
you don't have to pain anymore
yeah yeah you don't have to spend any
additional money and you know I don't
really need to switch to bluetooth yeah
so like I'm not really a customer for
that but you know also Apple music is
available for the home assistant but you
need to do it through like your iOS
device like you have to stream it
through your iPhone or your iPad you
can't just say like play whatever on
Apple music cuz naturally on the Google
home assistant they're building in
Google Play yep as Amazon built-in Prime
yep and etc etcetera it's very hard to
keep up with this stuff - it's all like
cloud enabled software so you know today
it's one thing and you know they they're
constantly adding new features to this
stuff what I really want to do is I want
to get one of each and race them mm-hmm
like get away to like three people
standing in front of the three major
home speakers when they're all available
and shout out commands and see who
responds first along a long list of
functions so in general we've found so
far that the Google assistant has been
the best and
responds best to questions especially
trivia stuff also doesn't have more
response to colloquial kind of speech
yeah yeah it's and it's a little bit
more patient I'm human actually don't
like my Google home because of that
though because it sometimes it gives me
like too much stuff yeah we've talked
about this I'm like I don't care it
needs to be fast yeah that's if it's in
voice it needs to be fast by Alexa tends
to win with like more smart home
partnerships and there are a lot more
skills there are like 25,000 skills with
Alexa so between the two of them you'd
probably be happy with either one
the problem is with like Siri Cortana
those tend to do a lot worse than those
two other I did a comparison at home the
other day I'm pretty I I'm pretty
confident to me at least the Google home
many like sounds better than the echo
dot like just oh yeah there's on their
own I would think so yeah I'm for the
same price like I would definitely side
of the home assistant Mini on this one
yeah yeah I mean like Apple was earlier
to them sorry
Amazon was earlier to the market so you
would have to consciously get rid of
your echos at this point if you're
already an echo house household as
opposed to like a Google household so as
our few people are trickling in a little
bit late let's just revisit since we're
at the tail end of the show anyways
about the pixel buds again and the
criticisms that are coming across with
them we've decided that not we but those
the powers-that-be have decided that
sonically totally comparable design wise
subjective but the thing is there sell
point the translator is a bit of a miss
because as you said it's a oversold it
yeah you thought it was gonna be this
magic would you compare to Hitchhiker's
can i bowl fish yeah the Babel Fish and
it's not that at all it's just a native
bill translator yeah it's a glorified
translator into its but get it read to
you and your earbuds but no other bugs
have that at all out there nope
true but you also but you could also
just pull your phone out and read it
instead and you also only it only works
with pixel phones at this point so
Google is trying to get people to buy
pixel phones and get you into like a
pixel ecosystem they're trying to
develop so the tech ecosystem yeah and
so that's to me that's kind of
frustrating
you're gonna spend 160 dollars on this
thing if you're already an Android
customer there's like sorry not good
enough right you're gonna have to buy a
fix it you're cool you're cool not you
screw you all right so before we go
there's a great commentary in the chat
from intrepid chronics who says I wish
you could give these smart speakers
their own names I hate seeing Siri or
Alexa or etc etc sorry for everybody
who's triggered what would you name your
speaker if you had carte blanche you
what you mean like like other than echo
like Karl you name it Karl
you mean like from The Walking Dead like
that would that would be kind of fun
Karl no I mean if you had a chance if
you could rename because the the echo is
you know who or computer or you know
whatever what if or Amazon or Amazon
yeah what if like Amazon and all these
smart speaker companies partnered up
with the people that invented clap on
lights no the clapper and then I could
just you just clap it and say stuff
waste of time
no that would be nice if you can if you
could just name it anything I think that
would be helpful I'm asking what would
you name it I can't
James favor says c-3po c-3po sounds like
fun but I like get really boring after
all so like on the echo like there's a
three options that you have
oh man boy says Shaniqua there's there's
like echo Alexa Amazon and then computer
right I think like computers the worst
one because it has the most syllables
and I like to keep it to echo cuz it has
the least its start but it feels very
cool I'll say that I like I had to have
the one in my living room be computer
because the are others are like really
close and I like though here I pick it
up so I call a computer a lot and it's
like super fun Earl Grey sometimes I
don't even need anything I'm just like
computer how's your day mr. Tibbs says
Jeeves decipher says Samantha or Sam
from the movie her nice I think I mom
would you how's the weather I think I
would personally lean in favor of
referencing one of my favorite
television shows of all time and that is
I'd call
in dingus okay there is some there is a
value to like having to word thing like
hey Google or okay Siri or whatever hey
Siri yeah like Daddy okay you're smart
assistant daddy this is getting super
weird okay but you're less likely to say
something like hey Google randomly in a
conversation but anytime I'm like
talking broadly about Alexa because I
talk a lot about Alexa at home since I
write so much about it I invariably like
one of the echoes will go off and be
like sorry what's up
I'd be funny then how's it go if they
learn to ignore you because you say
their name too much yeah
one would hope so I noticed that it
started to get a little bit better where
if it's in the middle of like a sentence
that it like turns itself on but then
it's like oh you're not talking about me
Channing says Oracle from Batman I love
that reference Kris garner says
go-go-gadget I would probably say one of
the reasons Amazon doesn't do this quite
yet is that they don't want people
barking curse words yeah they're at the
echo and then like loading them on
YouTube or something and be like hey
your response to like this curse word
you know so I think they are trying to
limit it for potentially for that reason
they're fine crushed my dreams anyways
- everybody suggesting hell Hal 9000
from Space Odyssey - have you learned
nothing good one though I don't know
with how I mean like nobody in my house
is named Hal so that I thought that one
might actually work
fine yeah I'm solely against that
