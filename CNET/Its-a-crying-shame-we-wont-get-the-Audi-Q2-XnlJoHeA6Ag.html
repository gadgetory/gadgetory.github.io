Motor Show is that we get to see a bunch
of cool metal that we might not end up
getting in the United States one of
those things is Audi's q2 here packing a
total of six different power trains with
the plug-in hybrid on the way Audi's q2
weighs less than 2,700 pounds so it
doesn't need a whole lot of power to get
it moving it's made it to either 6-speed
manual or seven-speed dual-clutch
gearbox the q2 rides on the same MQB
platform that underpins both the Audi TT
and the Volkswagen Golf the interior of
the q2 is rather tech laid in the fair
it's got two separate screens the Q 2
packs Audi's virtual cockpit technology
which replaces traditional gauges with a
massive screen that you can configure to
include entertainment or navigation
however to prevent passengers from
sticking their head in between your face
and the steering wheel there's also a
second screen that pops out of the
dashboard that features redundant
controls with a rotary knob into click
box what's interesting about the q2 is
that all wheel drive is not standard
equipment front-wheel drive is standard
however all wheel drive is optional but
it is a very front bias system so the
rear wheels don't get traction until the
front wheels start to slip if you're
looking for a crossover built out of
space-age material carbon fibers
nanofibers all at PS you're not going to
find any of this here sadly Audi doesn't
think it can make a business case for
the q2 in the States that's too bad
because it aligns with the markets need
for smaller crossovers and it's loaded
with the tech that buyers are most
interested in it be nearly perfect for
folks looking to dip their toes in the
pool of luxury</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
