San Francisco a beautiful setting to
show you some photography tips that'll
help you maximize the modes and features
that are already on your smartphone to
show you these tips I'm using the iphone
5s and i'm using the LG G flex for
example HDR mode almost every phone is
gonna have this maybe you know it is
maybe you don't it's called high dynamic
range it's a great way to take really
great looking photos but there's ways to
use it in ways you should probably avoid
what HDR is doing is taking three photos
consecutively and then combining the
best aspects of those three photos into
one super image so it's gonna be great
for landscape photography it's gonna
really bring out the detail and trees
things like that the other key thing
about HDR photography is that you need
to hold your camera very steady is
taking three photos if you're moving
while you're taking those is gonna look
weird now you probably already know
about that feature that lets you tap
your screen to set the focus and
exposure for your shot well if you want
to make sure those settings don't change
all you need to do is tap and hold to
lock those settings that's great I mean
I think that's another great way to take
close-up photos too especially if
autofocus is having a hard time locking
in what you want to take the picture of
being able to really lock it down with
your finger is a good way to go another
great tip is to know that there's more
ways to take your picture than just
hitting the shutter button on your
screen a lot of times you can get a
shaky shot because you're pressing the
screen so hard now on the iphone you
might already know that you can use your
phone's volume up button to snap the
photo well you can extend that feature
with your headset and when your headset
is plugged in you can use the inline
Mike's volume up to also snap a photo
and use it as a sort of
shutter that's cool and then you're
you're totally erasing any kind of
vibration that might be transmitted to
the phone on the LG G flex you there's a
cool feature where you can actually
activate the shutter with voice commands
i could say cheese and just took a
picture I mean you can also say whiskey
whiskey random I love it whiskey
another great thing about today's
smartphones and they're super fast
processors is that you can enable a
burst mode that allows you to take our
rapid succession of like 20 shots all at
once and then you can just pick out the
best one later on it's really great for
taking pictures of kids or pets or
sporting events anything where there's a
fast paced action shot you want to
capture you just take all the shots all
at once and then pick out the best one
later on hopefully you get some that
aren't blurry on the iPhone all you have
to do is tap and hold that shutter
button and you'll just see that number
of shots climbed super fast and when
you're done at least on the 5s the phone
will create a thumbnail that you can tap
and then choose your favorites that you
can keep as your primary photos yeah on
the LG G flex actually have to hit the
mode button go into burst mode it's
still pretty quick and then it'll do a
rapid fire boom 20 shots right there
so now that you know how to use more of
your phone's modes and features
hopefully you'll be taking more creative
and interesting photos to upload to
Instagram yeah I'm pretty excited to use
my camera again and have an excuse to
shut whiskey in public whiskey God if I
could</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
