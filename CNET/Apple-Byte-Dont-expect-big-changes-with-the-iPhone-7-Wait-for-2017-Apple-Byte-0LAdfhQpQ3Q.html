everything good and bad inside the world
of Apple and yes I'm still licking my
wounds after the NBA Finals but we're
here for the Apple bite and the top
story might bring tears to your eyes
according to The Wall Street Journal
Apple is unlikely to make major changes
to the next iPhone and instead we'll
plan bigger changes for the 10th
anniversary iPhone in 2017 the new
iPhones will maintain the 4.7 and 5.5
inch screen sizes but the change this
year will indeed be the removal of the
headphone jack that will make the phone
thinner and improve its water resistance
according to their sources now other
outlets have reported the same thing
over the past couple of weeks their
sources also say implementing features
like the rumored curved OLED screen
weren't ready for this year's model
rumors also point to touch ID being
embedded into the screen and the removal
of the physical home button in a future
iphone again remember Tim Cook said this
in May but we're going to give you
things that you can't live without that
you just don't know that you need today
okay now it has to be more than the
removal of a headphone jack it just has
to be or maybe Tim just said this a year
too early I'll write a new report from a
co Takara claims the iphone 7 will ship
with their standard 3.5 millimeter
headphones but will also include a 3.5
millimeter jack to lightning adapter to
allow them to connect to the new device
a lot of rumors are being thrown around
right now but you know that adapter will
get lost and you will end up buying
another one but it seems like the only
way not to completely piss off users who
still want to use their current wired
headphones now microblogging site Weibo
has revealed the iphone 7 might have
dual sim trays for use with multiple
carriers after Rock fix shared photos
what they believe are components for the
iphone 7 this would allow your phone to
send and receive calls and messages from
multiple phone numbers you could also
potentially use multiple carriers based
on network coverage or pricing for
example you like verizon's phone signal
but you prefer t-mobile super LTE data
plans or one line could be your main
line while the others for
tick okay okay for saying that I get a
bad apple all right the Nikkei Asian
review reports Samsung and sharp are
ramping up their OLED production in
anticipation of apples rumored 2017
iphone it's just another sign that
really the 10th anniversary iphone will
be the one to get now Apple has told
suppliers it plans to launch an oled
iphone with a partial release in 2017
after originally targeting 2018 Samsung
has bumped up its OLED output fifty
percent this year and a separate report
says Foxconn own sharp also plans to
ship OLED screens to Apple by the end of
next year it's also possible Apple may
only launched the 5.5 inch phone with an
oled screen and may not expand Oh led to
the smaller 4.7 inch until 2018 it also
looks like the macbook pro non retina
display with an optical drive is on its
way out it's been completely removed
from the Apple Store floor displays and
you can only buy one really if you know
that it exists so you can bet we'll say
our official goodbyes when the new
macbook pros are released and right now
I like to take a moment to talk about
watch shows trace or what Apple calls it
watch os3 boring now I finally put it on
this Apple watch that's right you're
wondering am I wearing it yes I am and
it's truly breathed new life into the
device is streamlined the experience
it's so much more useful and it's
exceeded my expectations after watching
the WWDC announcement so if you own an
Apple watch you're going to love the
improvements watch OS makes that much of
a difference in if you haven't purchased
one just wait until the next gen apple
watchin really everything Apple is done
with this Apple watch deserves a good
Apple Plus this
