tablet with your eyes I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update it's day
two of the 2013 International Consumer
Electronic Show and this is where we get
a peek of what the future may hold for
our gadgets there's tons to talk about
but here's a quick breakdown of the tech
that has our attention one of the most
interesting smartphones ever before seen
here has been to yotaphone not yoda from
Star Wars this is filled why OTA it
looks like a normal Android phone from
the front but the back has an e
touchscreen display the whole point of
having a inc on the back is to help save
your battery life since it takes up so
little juice when powers running low
just switch whatever you're doing to the
back screen or customize the back to
show a photo or a nap and even though
Gorilla Glass 3 was just announced days
before CES this Yoda phone prototype
already has it plus it's curved on the
e-ink site to help improve readability
talk about a phone that can shake things
up the company still is refining the
design and plans to first release it in
Russia this year before taking it to
other countries and they are shopping it
around to US carriers and speaking of
battery savers imagine charging your
cell phone by using the power from your
tablet and you don't need a cord to do
it we've seen wireless charging before
but Fulton innovation is showing off
this new concept of transferring power
from device to device wirelessly your
phone can be both a power receiver and
transmitter let's hope device makers get
on this for future gear a startup called
the eye tribe has shown how future
devices can be controlled with your eyes
the team hacked a Windows 8 tablet and
installed infrared sensors and a camera
and design software that follows your
I've movements leading you scroll
through a page just by how you look at
the screen you can even use your eyes to
play games when I tried it out I was
able to play fruit ninja and slice up
the fruit just by looking at it makes
you feel like you have superpowers but
aside from gaming possibilities the eye
tribe says this could bring I control
technology to people with disabilities
and it would cost manufacturers only a
dollar more for the parts in a tablet or
phone and using your hands is also a
thing of the past with remote control
helicopters neuro skies showed off the
puzzlebox orbit which could be flown
with your mind
simply by concentrating and of course
CES is a place to find a solution to
your problems like having windows they
installed on a non-touchscreen computer
the touch eight smart pen is a stylus
that works on non touch screens the $80
pin connects to a USB port learns the
corners of the screen and awakens the
power of touch our editors did have a
little trouble getting it to work right
but it does show that something may be
available soon to bring touch to normal
monitors there's lots more coming up
during the week so stay tuned to a live
streaming coverage at cnet com / live
and catch up on all the news at CES cnet
com from CES 2013 in Las Vegas I'm
