with the much-hyped
nutribullet pro 900 series blender now
you might have seen the infomercials and
the commercials for this thing which
claim that it is the cornerstone of
changing your life of making yourself
healthier of unlocking secret nutrients
in your fruit and vegetables that you
didn't even know we're there
even the instruction manual that comes
with the book barely has any
instructions in it instead it focuses on
the blight of heart disease in America
and what happens when we don't take the
time to properly chew what we eat
rest assured nothing about this machine
is inherently magic I discussed this
when reviewing the Nutri ninja which has
similar claims all it does is finely
slice up the seeds and stems of fruit
and vegetables to include the pulp in
your smoothie drink however it actually
proves somewhat competent as a
convenient and easy to use single serve
blender it comes with a variety of cups
lids blades all of which fit one into
the other using the blender as a simple
as attaching the blades putting it on
the machine and you can press down for
pulse or press and turn to keep the
blender on Consumer Reports had a test
where this version cracked after
numerous ice tests designed to simulate
long-term wear and tear we didn't see
that but it's definitely something you
should look into when you're considering
the purchase of this blender in our
tests not only was it easy to use but it
made smoothies well it even made almond
butter well the 900 watt version of the
nutribullet also costs one hundred and
thirty dollars which is $40 more than
the similarly powered nutri ninja this
guy does do a little bit better on the
multitasking but the Nutri ninja
actually edges it slightly on the basics
we found that this was actually a pretty
solid machine but it's stuck in the
ground between a discount machine like
the $40 Hamilton Beach stay or go or the
$90 nutri ninja and a more powerful
machine like the 260 dollar ninja Ultima
so the nutribullet performs well enough
to be worth your consideration but in
terms of value I would recommend the
Nutri ninja over for CNET with the
nutribullet
