Nissan's product offerings have seemed a
little confused they lack the clear
vision that I see from companies like
Hyundai or Audi but it also benefits
from Nissan's best technology a
continuously variable transmission let's
get in the 2014 Nissan Altima and check
the tech
and here in the cabin is what I was
talking about the continuously variable
transmission this is Nissan's kind of
secret weapon for getting great fuel
economy instead of having fixed gears
has a system of pulleys and bands that
will constantly match engine speed with
the car speed and accelerator load some
of them aren't so good from other
automakers but Nissan's really as the
best in the business
this one really feels engaged when
you're driving and when I pull it into
reverse I get my rear view camera here
and it's got trajectory lines so I can
turn the wheel and I can see which way
I'll be backing that's really helpful
now this is a 7 inch touch screen here
this is part of the infotainment unit
you know Nissan hasn't really had a very
consistent vision as far as technology
goes and this really kind of looks like
I was an off-the-shelf unit from a
supplier but it's not bad and it's got
decent functions legal things navigation
phone digital audio the maps look pretty
good here they actually show in
perspective and plan view right now I'm
looking in plan view and if I pull out a
bit I can see the some traffic
information too so I can see some live
traffic and the nice thing about this
traffic information is it's not just
showing on the freeways so I see some
free flow on the freeway nearby here but
it's also showing on the surface streets
in downtown San Francisco so I've got
some red markers here telling me these
roads are pretty congested right now so
I can avoid them just by looking at this
and steering you know away from that
there's no real home screen with this
system there's just a series of plastic
buttons on the side here that could be
the navigation the map the different
audio sources and telephones over here
for some reason also there's a button
called apps we'll check that out in a
minute if I hit this navigation button I
get my destination options here so I've
got street address points of interest
one thing I'm not really crazy about
this system here is that sometimes you
don't really you have to hit those
button really precisely in the middle it
doesn't really react that well and can
be frustrating if you're driving along
and trying to hit something and it keeps
on not quite getting it right I wish
they kind of expand the touch area of
these buttons now along with these
destination options the Altima has also
got some connected features which is
pretty nice it's got Google online
search to get that I actually have to
have the nissanconnect app installed on
my phone which which I do there's also a
version for Android with the iPhone I
have to have a cable up here with the
Android you can probably do that with
just bluetooths
I've got three functions right now these
I can probably add some more in the
future but right now it's got I Heart
Radio also got some Facebook integration
and I've got Google online search so
really that Google online search should
be part of this navigation interface but
it's not really well integrated so I
have to go to this apps button I pushed
that I get some serious traffic stories
travel link which has fuel prices movie
time stuff like that then I press the my
apps button and I get the another button
for online search now I can go in there
it's a lot of button presses by the way
and it takes a little while to come up
because it's got to make a connection
through your phone to the Internet
now I get these options for just a
free-form search voice search which will
try that out right now
CNET just a key word just an easy
keyword now it's searching and actually
found it right away it found it pretty
quick and I can just say start
navigation and here I go
so that that's really convenient to have
but again not great integration that I
have to go through all those button
presses and also push the microphone
button on the screen here as opposed to
the voice command button embedded in the
car there's actually a button here for
more native voice command functions for
the car it also lets me ask for music
play artists new order
now because I have my iPhone hooked up
to the car here if I do USB Drive it
should work the same I can just say an
artist named play that artist it comes
up right away
so in this iPod screen here I've
actually got of course menu options to
choose artists albums on the screen here
you know or like I said a voice command
I've got other audio sources here I've
got satellite radio of course I've got
FM AM I don't have HD radio in this car
just regular FM AM I still got a CD
player and this is kind of silly they
just have an aux button and this will
actually cycle through the different
digital options I've got here so it
gives through iPod Bluetooth audio and
an aux input as well all this music
plays through in this car a Bose audio
system it's a nine speaker system we've
got a center channel up here but no
subwoofer and that's kind of a shame a
subwoofer would have added some more
more depth and richness to the music I
find the system produces a pretty
distinct sound I can hear all the
instruments and vocals with a good
amount of clarity but I have noticed a
little bit of fuzz in the mid range
depending on the very edge it's a little
disturbing and the bass isn't
particularly strong again subwoofer
would have been nice on this center
screen here in the instrument cluster I
can also go through a lot of my
information sources audio sources I can
of course see fuel economy but I can
also see phone navigation and all that
good kind of step now the Altimas engine
here is is kind of boring it's a 2.5
litre four-cylinder aluminium block and
and this one doesn't even use direct
injection like a lot of the other
automakers have this just has port
injection and makes hundred 80
horsepower 182 pound-feet of torque
those are actually pretty good numbers
and pretty comparable to the other
direct injection cars Nissan gets those
kinds of numbers because of their
variable valve timing they're they're
pretty good at that kind of stuff so
this is actually ends up being a pretty
efficient engine actually even without
some of the modern technologies like
direct injection
fuel economy numbers for the Optima 27
miles per gallon city 38 miles per
gallon highway now those are really high
and that's mostly due to the
continuously variable transmission and
if I'm just cruising along here at 25
then I slammed the accelerator it picks
up pretty fast
and it really just is a very smooth
linear acceleration that's the beauty of
the CVT it does it just a really fine
job in most circumstances there's about
any driving circumstances of matching
the engine speed and the vehicle speed
and what the driver wants the suspension
tuning is kind of funky I found with the
Nissan Sentra too that the dampers are
tuned pretty soft and so you feel a bit
of sway in the corners but to help the
handling out they've also got this thing
called an active understeer control this
is basically what's called corner
braking it applies a little bit of
brakes to the inside front wheel and
that helps the car come around the
corner a little bit sharper it's a nice
feature to have and it's such a new that
they put it in this midsize sedan I
always feel like Nissan's got different
engineers kind of different working on
different things the suspension guys
wanted a softer ride so they stop those
dampers but then the handling guys put
in that that corner control at corner
braking to to make it a little more of a
sporty car it's it's a weird mix base
price for 2014 Nissan Altima is twenty
two thousand one hundred and ten dollars
this SL trim is twenty seven thousand
eight hundred and sixty well that gets a
lot of nice convenience features USB
port all that good stuff
the navigation system comes in as part
of a technology package that's $1,090
that also includes some of those driver
assistance features like lane departure
warning and blind spot monitoring Nissan
also forces you to take the moonroof
option with the technology package
there's no good reason why they do that
but that puts the total price of this
2014 Nissan Altima with destination up
at thirty thousand two hundred sixty
dollars there are a lot of good options
in the midsize sedan segment and the
Nissan Altima doesn't really measure up
price by price compared to some of the
other ones from Ford or Chevy or even
Toyota it's got some good features here
but it's not all really consistent and
so I really liked the offerings from
some of the other manufacturers better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
