taking the robo-moe on its maiden voyage
cutting my front yard now we're going to
do a full review at the end of about a
month of testing but today I just wanted
to capture some things in the robo-moe
Diaries my yard is embarrassingly long
so I can either cut the yard and the
edge like do the edges and there's also
the option to just cut the yard without
edging the yard so I want to look nice
so I'm going to have an edge I'm going
to hit go alright there it goes
ok so it went straight to the edge of my
yard
and oh my gosh there's a stick there
alright went over the stick easy piece
and now my video producer
Tyler has some drone camera footage
going so right here is where you put the
wire that the robo-moe follows right so
it can't get like right up on the like
the very very very edge oh look at that
yeah so all this it did not cut because
it's supposed to be a certain distance
away from the sidewalk so it looks like
it's coming after me I wonder what it
will do
okay just miss me now I think it's
interesting that the Robo mode doesn't I
don't know it's not like making nice
lines you know like how a regular person
would mow it's just kind of darting off
on its own
oh it just uh it can't handle that grass
it's avoiding it it said nah not today
now not another thing that I can tell is
definitely impacting this grass is not
entirely dry it's a little wet and as
you can see on those wheels it's kind of
certain to clump up so I might need to
like clear those wheels a little bit so
I get some more traction so after 40
minutes of mowing the yard the robo-moe
basically said you know what girl I need
to go back to the base station and
recharge now at first I was a little you
know dubious but once I flipped over the
robo-moe and looked at the underside I
saw that there was a lot of wet grass
that had accumulated underneath the
robo-moe and around the mowing blades oh
my gosh that is a heck of a lot of wet
trimmings so kudos to the robo-moe for
working against these really wetter than
they should be
conditions doing a little bit of work in
my yard but then having the sense to
know hey girl I need to stop for the day
so check back with us next week for the
robo-moe Diaries where we give the
robo-moe another world explore some more
features and see if it will finally mow
all of my yard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
