welcome to the apple byte for all the
good and bad inside the world of apple
now we told you they'd sell a ton of
iPads and the big a announced they sold
three million iPads in the first three
days now it's a combination of minis and
ipad fours appleton revealed the
breakdown but it doubled their previous
record of 1.5 million units sold for the
Wi-Fi ipad 3 just seven months ago now
Tim Cook said they're practically sold
out of iPad minis but not actually sold
out so if you're one of the people
holding out for a Retina Display ipad
mini you're in luck do news reports that
au optronics the company that currently
supplies the 7.9 inch displays for the
first gen mini are already working on
the display for the 2nd gen mini and
will reportedly have double the
resolution at 2048 x 1536 now i think
it's still a great product if you're
willing to drop the cash on it and guess
what i don't have to lust after every
apple product it can't even fit in my
pants yeah comfortably and who said the
ipad mini isn't a good size is perfect
for the guys at sound man who are
already installed one inside the
dashboard of a 2012 volkswagen CC look
at how it fits so perfectly ok now i'm
getting one i'm kidding guys but one
product i'm going to have my way with
are the new imacs that are expected to
be available to order starting with the
21.5 inch model this month and then the
27 incher in december but the future of
the guts inside of the imac could look
very different bloomberg reports their
sources tell them that apple plans to
one day abandon intel chips and it will
be mobile chips that eventually run
inside its computer lineup Bob Mansfield
senior VP of Apple's new technologies
group is apparently leading the chipped
research and the article says Apple has
ambitious plans for the future with
their desktops but Apple will still
continue to rely on Intel for at least a
few more years
another thing you probably still won't
see on an imac blu-ray in an interview
with time Phil Schiller said native
blu-ray support will likely never come
to the Mac his blu-ray alternative is
iTunes and blu-ray comes with complex
issues that make it I'm not so great
technology according to Schiller now all
he really had to say was hey dummy we
can't fit a blu-ray in our five
millimeter thin iMac all right guys in
iOS news apple has released iOS 6.1 to
developers one of the new features will
allow you to now get movie tickets
through Siri using data and information
from fandango which is pretty slick now
there aren't any other major new
features here but some behind-the-scenes
improvements to maps let developers
search for map based addresses and
points of interest as well now we all
know Google is still developing their
own map app and they plan on submitting
it to the app store later this year
according to the Guardian it took a long
time for their Google Search app to get
approved and we'll see how or if apple
approves google's app since maps can
already be accessed in safari in it's a
direct competitor to Apple's own Maps we
also told you guys to expect microsoft
office for iOS in 2013 the verge is
officially reporting that it will come
in early 2013 and included a few small
screen shots that will allow users to
have basic access to view offline
documents on the go but if you want
editing capabilities you'll need a paid
office 365 subscription all right onto
the quick bytes we know about Apple and
Samsung yeah they've had their beef but
it was vernet X that was able to pull
off what Samsung couldn't a Texas judge
ruled that apple's facetime function for
the iphone ipod touch and ipad infringed
on for Vernet x patents and apple has
been told to pay 360 8.2 million dollars
in damage Burnett X also is planning on
seeking in order to block further use of
its inventions it really means they want
more money in a settlement and in a
great way to pay tribute to the late
Steve Jobs pics our headquarters
recently named their main building in
honor of SJ it was job too invested 10
million dollars to purchase pics are
from Lucas Films in 1986 the animation
studio was then later sold to Disney
47.4
billion dollars all right guys let's
wrap things up with a giveaway that may
not be for all of you but you know me
I'm a huge NBA fan and I have some of
the craziest dribbling skills and jump
shots that you've ever seen that's what
I actually wear when I play so to
celebrate the start of the season i'm
giving out five codes for the game NBA
2k13 on iOS devices all you guys have to
