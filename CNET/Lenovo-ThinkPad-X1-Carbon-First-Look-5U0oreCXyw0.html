look at the brand-new Lenovo ThinkPad x1
carbon now about a year ago we saw think
pan x1 and that was a laptop this is
before they even had ultra books that
was designed to sort of compete with the
MacBook Air and a handful of other
really super thin 13-inch laptops but
appealed to business users at the same
time that just was perfectly nice but it
wasn't really as thin wrists like as a
MacBook Air didn't really stand out from
the crowd too much when I first saw this
new version the x1 carbon I said to
myself you know they didn't really
change the name it's still called the x1
it kind of looks the same at first
glance I wonder if it's really been
upgraded enough for us to really pay
attention to but now that I actually
have the x1 carbon I gotta tell ya this
version feels a lot different than the
original I it's really a lot of fun to
use feels great in the hand very light
they bumped up the screen to a 14 inch
screen even though the body is still
just about the same size as a 13-inch
laptop and lenovo says this is the
world's lightest 14 inch laptop it's
just a hair under three pounds let's
just call it three pounds and it is as
thick as a 13-inch ultra book should be
even though it has a 14 inch screen and
of course it's got the latest 3rd gen
Intel Core i5 CPU a lot of the models
have have have 3g data antennas built in
it doesn't have a discreet graphics card
which we've actually seen on some
high-end ultra books recently just a
regular intel HD 4000 graphics but it
does have something I really appreciate
in a laptop of this size and that is a
1600 by 900 screen as opposed to the
1366 by 768 screen the lot of 13 and
even some 14 inch laptops have those
always sort of feel cheap I think 16 by
9 for 13 or 14 inches really the sweet
spot you want to be at the bounce screen
real estate and readability all at the
same time one cool feature is that you
can bend the lid all the way back like
this now the one problem you're gonna
have with the ThinkPad x1 carbon is
honestly the price
it starts at $13.99 this one tiny step
up model is $14.99 and it just gets more
expensive from there
some companies can get away with
charging a premium and certainly Lenovo
ThinkPad line is among those especially
if your business user let's say your
company is gonna buy the laptop you're
not gonna go out and buy it yourself
that being said if they could have
gotten this down closer to $1,000 even
for a slightly stripped down version it
would really be a must buy because
they've got all that sort of thinking
and engineering that goes into ThinkPads
especially the keyboard protects sort of
the the the curved bottom keys that are
a lot easier to type on and you get all
that built in here but you're still
paying a premium for it I did however
like this new style of trackpad which I
don't think I've seen on a lenovo before
it's a it's a glass covered trackpad and
it really is probably the most
responsive Windows trackpad I have ever
tried in fact it was so responsive I had
to take a few minutes to get used to it
because the the point it was just
nipping around all over the place so if
you can handle the high price again
$13.99 $14.99 or higher depending on
what CPU and how much harddrive space
you want I really have not seen an
ultra-thin laptop that's probably is
all-around usable outside of maybe a
MacBook Air if you're being Apple fan
then this guy right here I'm Dan
Ackerman and that is the Lenovo ThinkPad
x1 carbon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
