flagship phones before from the likes of
Samsung and HTC but these were merely
watered-down versions of their namesakes
that in reality were nothing like their
full-size brothers the Sony Xperia z1
compact however packs the same
supercharged processor and the same 20
megapixel camera as the top model but
wrapped it into a more pocket-friendly
4.3 inch body size aside the dead one
compact is almost identical to its
5-inch brother has the same all-glass
front and back with a gorgeous one-piece
aluminium band running around the edge
the same chunky power button post out to
the side and there's a dedicated camera
shutter button below it looks brilliant
and feels just as good to hold although
we've glass on both sides you'll want to
keep it safe from Keynes in your pocket
like its brother it's completely
waterproof so don't worry if you drop it
in the bath or your pint inside there's
a 2.2 gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800
processor sustain powerhouse quad core
Chet found in the regular Zed 1 which
provides a ton of power for gaming and
for photo editing it's a big step above
the dual-core chips are found inside the
Galaxy s4 mini or the HTC One mini the
20.7 megapixel camera on the back
meanwhile packs in loads of pixels
letting you digitally zoom in without
losing too much quality it also comes
with a bunch of shooting modes including
burst mode panorama and manual control
letting you get some great snaps in a
variety of conditions the screen is the
one aspect that doesn't quite stand up
to his larger sibling it has a 720
rather than full 1080p resolution which
might seem a little disappointing bear
in mind though that a smaller screen
needs fewer pixels to remain sharp in
fact I found the compact screen to be
extremely crisp with no fuzziness around
icons or small text the good colors and
great viewing angles to intergeneric
excellent display the Sony Xperia z1
compact provides loads of power and
great camera with a stunning waterproof
body if you've been lusting after a
top-end Android phone but prefer the
more pocketable size of the iPhone the
dead one compact is definitely the phone
to go for it is without doubt the best
compact Android phone around
I'm Andrew Hoyle 50 net and this is a
stony Xperia z1 compact</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
