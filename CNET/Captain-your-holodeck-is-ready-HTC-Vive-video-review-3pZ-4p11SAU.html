might not have ever tried virtual
reality before but you know what a
holodeck is there hasn't ever been a
real-life holodeck before until now the
HTC vive comes closest to turning your
own space into another world VR works by
putting a helmet on your face and
syncing video and audio so it looks like
what you see on 3d displays is all
around you vibe goes further it allows
you to walk around mapping the steps you
take into steps in virtual reality it
makes a virtual play space all you have
to do is draw the boundary it can be as
little as six and a half feet by five
feet or up to 16 feet diagonally it's
about a half-hour setup to get vibe up
and running including downloading
software and wiring up the headset
sensors and calibration to make all this
happen
vive has a lot of gear there's a headset
two light boxes that shoot out beams
across your room to locate your body and
controllers and yes those motion
controllers two of them act as tools for
your hands that morph into different
things in different apps oculus rift
right now just comes with a headset and
a game controller live has a complete
body rig for deep dive VR when it's on
it's the most amazing experience you can
have in virtual reality today but it
won't be the only one PlayStation VR and
the upcoming oculus touch controllers
have motion controls for your hands and
let you walk around a bit too not as
much as the vive will but if you have
the space and the patience the high-end
PC to tether to v is the first steps on
the holodeck
and program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
