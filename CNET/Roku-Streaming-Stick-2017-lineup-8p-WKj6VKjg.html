has a whopping five new models for 2017
which one should you get my pick for
most people is a $70 Roku streaming
stick plus sure it's more expensive than
most of the others but it's still
affordable and it's mix of features and
capabilities is the best on the market
I'll tackle the other Roku's later in
this video but for now let's take a
closer look at the plus this tiny stick
is designed to plug into the HDMI port
on your TV and remain out of sight it
includes a cable with something called
an advanced wireless receiver that's
supposed to improve Wi-Fi reception in
my test that didn't make much of a
difference but Wi-Fi recession was still
fine more important is this 4k HDR video
output streaming stick plus one of the
least expensive streamers to deliver the
highest quality 4k and high dynamic
range videos from Netflix Amazon Vudu
and other apps if you have compatible 4k
TV that means we'll be getting the best
picture for your streaming dollar and
even if you don't have a 4k TV yet
chances are good that your next TV will
be 4k the plus is cheap enough you might
want to get it now anyway and be ready
for the future
my favorite new feature is their emotes
ability to control your TV buttons for
power and volume are programmed
automatically during setup using the
information contained in your television
you probably won't have to do anything
to set it up worst case you'll have to
type in the TV makers name otherwise
everything I like about Roku is on board
including the best search in the
business simple menus that are easy to
customize and more apps or can otherwise
than the competition and all that
goodness trickles down to the cheaper
Roku's - my next favorite is the $50
streaming stick which is basically the
non 4k version of the plus it's remote
can do TV control and voice search - and
response times were just as snappy if
you have absolutely no plans to get a 4k
TV save the 20 bucks and get the
standard stick and if you don't care
about that TV control remote with voice
search get the Roku Express unlike last
year's version is plenty snappy to
respond it's not a stick so we need an
HDMI cable but it's still tiny this is
my go-to pick for ultra budget streaming
hardware for people with older TVs that
lack HDMI ports Roku sells the $40
Express plus it comes with a set of
yellow red and white analog cables you
can infuse that ancient set with a full
suite of modern apps finally there's the
most expensive Roku the $100 Roku ultra
it has all the capabilities of streaming
stick plus including 4k HDR in
traditional streaming box form its
remote has a headphone jack for private
listening there's a cool remote finder
that makes the clicker beep if it gets
lost and you can connect an ethernet
cable if your Wi-Fi isn't great those
features probably aren't worth another
30 bucks to most people unless they just
want the best Roku period in the end
Roku's 2017 line up has a streamer for
everyone but the star is a streaming
stick plus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
