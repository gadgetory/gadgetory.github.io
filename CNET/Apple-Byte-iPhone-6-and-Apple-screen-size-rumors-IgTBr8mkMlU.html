welcome to the Apple by for everything
inside the world of Apple now we're back
after a vacation break in all the
madness from CES which we'll get to but
first let's get to the show and the big
story this week Apple will refund at
least thirty 2.5 million dollars to
customers in a settlement with the
Federal Trade Commission over in-app
purchases now the refund is specific to
purchases made by kids without parental
consent like the horror story in 2011
about an eight-year-old girl that racked
up a 1400 dollar bill buying Smurf
berries in the smurfs village app now i
would argue that you can't put a price
on Smurf berries now the FTC agreement
will also make apple change its billing
methods to make sure it receives very
clear Express informed consent from
users before a nap charges them now
originally entering a password to
approve an initial in-app purchase would
allow a 15 minute window of time to make
additional purchases and in this case 15
minutes could save you fourteen hundred
dollars the FTC said Apple had received
tens of thousands of complaints of
unauthorized purchases like the little
girl who spent two thousand six hundred
dollars on tap pet hotel seriously who
would want to spend that much on this
app or five hundred dollars on tiny zoo
friends oh it's so cute totally worth it
and maybe I should complain that my
child spent over two hundred dollars
playing the injustice gods among us
mobile game just to unlock a limited
Superman prison costume that I can only
play on the console version now
obviously I think Apple should close
that window of time for additional
purchases and they've already been
refunding them made without parents
permission since last year but let's be
honest maybe some parents shouldn't give
their itunes pasco to their kids and if
you've ever spent more than two hundred
dollars on in-app purchases on any app
I'm giving you a bad apple
unless it's for a Superman prison
costume all right now what would an
apple by show be without more rumors
display research chimes in with Intel
from their sources to piggyback on
claims that will finally see a bigger
screen for the iphone 6 and a new ipad
model they predict an iphone 6 with a
5.5 inch screen with a 1920 x 1080
resolution and 401 pixels per inch now
they're also jumping on the ipad pro
bandwagon claiming we can expect to see
a 12 point nine inch ipad with a 27 32 x
2048 resolution and a 265 pixels per
inch while other reports continue to
claim a 12 point nine inch retina ipad
is in production and may launch in 2014
they are also supporting rumors claiming
that the iWatch might ship in two sizes
1.3 inches for women and 1.6 inches for
men with both sporting a 320 x 320
resolution and flexible AMOLED screens
and in one more rumors story for the
iphone 6 a report from digit times says
Apple's fingerprint sensor supplier TSMC
is preparing to begin production on
sensors for the iphone 6 in the second
quarter of 2014 and while you guys are
at it why don't we get those going for
the iPads to now we didn't have a show
for a while because we were working our
butts off at CES 2014 in Las Vegas now
Apple doesn't go to the show but we had
one of our best looking correspondents
check it out for us thanks Brian alright
guys we're here at the CES 2014 show
floor so let's go and see what we can
find in the ilounge pavilion alright
guys we're here with Patrick O'Neill
he's the CEO of olloclip that popular
lens attachment and you can't have a few
new things here that you're showing off
at the show right absolutely yeah we've
got our new macro lens are three in one
macro lens so this is a more
macro lens than we've had before so
we've got three lens elements on each
side which gives you a more clear
picture and you just drop it on the
hoods set the focus diffuse the light
and collect and diffuse it so you can
see it's just so easy where before with
the macro lens you had to sort of go in
and out to get the focus what you still
do on three-dimensional objects with
sponge easy with this lens and on the
flat objects it's just super easy and
then what's the retail price for this
out of seventy dollars you also have
another a little extra something
something here yeah we've got something
everybody's been wanting since 5s came
out old lens for the 5s so up yeah I got
my phone and I think you know that might
be a nice little fit they're all gold
everything I'm not sure I'm getting that
back now we know that beacons are kind
of going to be a big thing coming into
2014 and i'm here at stick and finds
booth and this is basically a bluetooth
vegan it's a sticker tracker that you
can stick on anything we have these
different kits that are available now
for sale 4999 for two of these guys it
also comes with an app that allows you
to see how far it is it has a 150 foot
range distance but you can put this
anywhere on like your luggage a shoe or
whatever this is a really clever idea
and you know something that we're gonna
see be a big thing and this little
beacon the stick and find can also send
out a signal or noise when you want to
locate it another really cool thing
treasure hunt this is a game that I want
to play where's this treasure where's
this excuse me excuse me ha ha ha ha ha
now in the ilounge pavillon we know
there are plenty of cases more than you
can imagine but we're here with laura
olson here with rock-forming tell us a
little bit about this unique case yeah
so rokform we manufacture protective
cases that are bountiful so our cases
mount a couple different ways first way
is there's grooves on the back of the
case so all you have to do is line it up
with the teeth of your accessory and
just give it a quarter click turn
and then you're mounted and ready to go
the other way they're mountable is there
is a rare earth magnet on the back
installed in the grip couldn't couldn't
you just call it a magnet does that make
it sound actually really cool when it's
a rare earth magnet yes it does make it
cooler which is what we're trying to go
for here so yeah rare earth magnet it
was about 10 pounds of force but any
magnetic surface you can just stick it
right on to and it will stick okay your
fridge toolbox forever so we see here
like bike handlebars but also there is
like a baby stroller yeah there's a
whole line of interchangeable
accessories you can get the bike mount
to the you know Universal stroller mount
any accessory you want to mount your
phone on and then how much are these
going to be so the stroller mount with
the case comes included for forty nine
dollars and that stroller mount is right
back there my mom
come on trust me guys having a nanny it
makes it a lot easier to get around and
the show really it's about 90% iphone
cases out there but we were able to get
a few things out there for you alright
that's going to do it for this week's
show we're back on track to our regular
apple byte schedule and you can always
