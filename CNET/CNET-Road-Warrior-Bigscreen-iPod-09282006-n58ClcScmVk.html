cnet.com and welcome to road warrior
where we take a look at the hottest
gadgets for life on the go
coming up a BMW with bluetooth a GPS
device with movies and music and a big
screen for your iPod let's start with
the averatec 30 360 laptop weighing in
at only 4 point 4 pounds for a cheap
laptop it has some cool features of
course this is a budget machine so
you're not gonna get a lot of bells and
whistles however I do want to note that
the speaker's although they're a little
strangely positioned right here have a
really clear sound if they don't get
very loud but as opposed to the tinny
sound that you get for most laptops
these are actually quite good also there
is a Wi-Fi on/off switch above the
keyboard which is really convenient for
turning the radio on and off and saving
your battery the 3360 also comes with a
DVD burner nice touch of Varitek next up
the Memorex I flip turns that little
iPod window into a big screen this is
the way it works press this thing to
flip this cartridge up and this iPod
just sits right in here
you click it in here you can also get a
32 gigabyte adapter in the package and
as you can see the screen is about 480
by 232 native resolution it's bigger the
experience is definitely under you
better with the iPod no need to drop
hundreds of dollars on a DVD player long
as you've already dropped hundreds of
dollars on the iPod and the I flip but
the iPod can't do GPS the Meo h 610 can
it's a GPS device and more reason though
I have it it's because it is an mp3
player and a video player as well and
this is something that you actually
could fit in your pocket the design is
really nice it's dominated by the
central touchscreen here and you can
either use your finger to navigate
around it or it comes with this handy
little stylus on a wrist strap the
design is is really sleek and it's got
the start button on this side and power
button on the top and then on the side
you even have an SD card slot for adding
more memory which you most certainly
will want to do if you're going to be
playing music and videos on the thing
Jasmine says she had a little trouble
getting the GPS to lock on in downtown
San Francisco but elsewhere it was fine
finally Brian coolly jumps inside the
BMW 335i has a good stereo with the
option for XM radio and an auxiliary
device but that's not what got Brian
excited now aside from those audio
options we've also got an interesting
treasure trove of tech under the menu
button over here on the right when I hit
that the first selection I see is the
phone and that gives me access to the
bluetooth menu pairing my trio 652 this
car was very easy without even
consulting the manual that's the test I
like to give any car we drive Brian also
loved the Bluetooth interface on the
335i that's it for this edition of road
warrior I'm Tom Merritt check back next
time for more gadgets that keep you
armed and dangerous' ly productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
