cars to be described as cheap they
prefer phrases like inexpensive and
built to stay that way or some other
wishful thinking the ad agency dreamed
up but damn it the cars on my list right
now are cheap these are my top five
hybrid cars that all start at way under
30 grand
now I'm ranking these cars by price
delivered with the destination charge
and also going to tell you their EP a
mileage and estimated annual fuel cost
just to make sure the cheapest to buy is
also the cheapest to drive let's go
number five the 2013 Honda Civic Hybrid
25 150 out-the-door mpg is 44 City 44
highway you know what that means
44 average annual fuel cost estimated at
twelve hundred and fifty bucks it's the
only car in our list that is not a
dedicated hybrid model by the way now
Honda recently did a major midstream
redo of the civics plasticky interior to
wide acclaim they're catching up on
cabin tech with a few apps like Pandora
and also offering lane departure warning
and forward collision warning things you
don't normally find and inexpensive
sorry cheap cars number four the 2013
Toyota Prius 24 995 delivered 51 City 48
highway 50 average annual fuel cost
estimated at eleven hundred parsimonious
box this is still the king of the hill
when it comes to hybrids folks the
classic Prius out sells all the other
hybrids often combined based a lot on
that magic fifty number it's one of the
few cars that owners routinely proclaim
as getting better than rated mpg if they
drive it gently which you know Prius
drivers tend to do the base Prius is not
exactly stripped of modern tech but you
won't get Toyotas generally excellent in
tuned suite of apps or GPS navigation
however a USB port streaming Bluetooth
and this touch tracer technology on the
wheel and - keeps it feeling pretty
techie number three the 2013 Honda cr-z
six speed twenty thousand seven sixty
five out the door thirty-one city 38
highway 34 average annual fuel cost
sixteen hundred bucks this is the only
car in our list you have to shift
yourself if you want the lowest MSRP all
the rest of our cars have a CVT
automatic now you can option the cr-z
with a CVT and it bumps the price up to
21 for 15 that still keeps it at number
three the cr-z is also the only car in
our list that says it's a sports car now
it's $1600 annual fuel cost happens to
make it the glutton of our list today
but it's still 250 bucks a year less
fuel than let's say a Honda Fit
which is not exactly a gasket number two
the 2013 Toyota Prius C the little Prius
19 875 out the door 53 city 46 highway
again 50 average annual fuel cost 1100
bucks this is the baby Prius and it
comes pretty bare-bones at this price
you've got to step up a trim level or
two to get stuff like six speakers fold
down rear seat roll-up windows
kidding but forget about navigation or
in tune at this price it does cover you
though with the USB port streaming
Bluetooth and automatic temperature
control I like this car a lot
the number-one cheap hybrid period is
the 2013 Honda Insight 19:3 90 delivered
get you 41 city 40 for highway 42
average annual fuel cost is kind of min
pack in our list at 1300 bucks
now Honda's got a weak seller here which
just goes to show the value of value
over price the insight uses Honda's AMA
powertrain that means it's a mild hybrid
and therefore doesn't run on pure
electric ever it's pretty lean inside as
well not even the USB port or bluetooth
at the base price hardly makes sense for
Honda to step up the content and worry
less about low price going forward but
for now at least it wins one award
cheapest by the way standard hybrid car
is no longer a tax credit from the IRS
that ended with vehicles purchased on or
after January 1 2011 so you've missed it
by quite a bit right now only more
advanced cars still get that credit if
you want to see more top fives like this

and modern driving head over to CNET on
