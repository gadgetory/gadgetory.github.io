Samsung shape m7 wireless speaker do you
have a dream of being able to listen to
music in every room of your home to be
honest I hadn't until I'd actually tried
it but Samsung and a dozen other
companies want to make someone's dream
at least come true the 350 dollar
Samsung shape m7 is the first in what
the company says is a complete range of
wireless music products from speakers to
blu-ray players and is trying to beat
Sonos at its own game the m7 is a large
speaker which can be placed either
vertically like this or horizontally and
it can be combined with other speakers
for stereo or even multi-channel sound
the speaker can either connect to your
router via Wi-Fi or to your phone or TV
via bluetooth there is also a 3.5
millimeter input for other devices at
the moment the speaker is controlled by
an Android or iPhone remote only there's
no PC or iPad functionality yet and it
can serve up Pandora Amazon music and
DLNA content generally using the app is
fairly easy though playlists for example
are very tricky you can't add Amazon
songs or create playlists on the fly the
speaker's big parlor trick though is its
ability to work as a sound bar with the
Bluetooth connection to Samsung TVs or
via the auxilary if you have another
brand and it works very well like this
sound quality is actually quite good
given the price with its largest size
meaning it can deliver more bass than
most equivalent Wi-Fi speakers it's more
detailed than the Sonos play 4/3 for
example and it can go pretty loudly
without distortion as well only when you
try putting 2 in stereo 2 the cracks
show Samsung itself calls this a stereo
effect and any other $700 stereo speaker
when you counter the two speakers
together will simply blow it away but if
you're looking for a speaker that works
well in the background with the promise
of more products to come in the future
then this is one of the best competitors
son√≠s has seen yet
this is type in your brief to see Netcom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
