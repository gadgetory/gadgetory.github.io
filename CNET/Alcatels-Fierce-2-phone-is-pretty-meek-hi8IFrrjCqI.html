the alcatel one touch fierce too for
tmobile now this unfortunately is one of
those phones that tells us that a good
deal isn't always worth it it's pretty
inexpensive about a hundred thirty
dollars all in for full retail price but
it doesn't do a lot of things really
well so there are three things that I
usually look at Anna phone one of them
is screen quality another is camera and
the third is performance unfortunately
this screen though five inches
resolution is pretty bad and it's really
dim even on full brightness likewise
with the camera five megapixels you've
got a flash there's autofocus so that's
good that the image quality was really
poor data speeds are also slower than
average the phone does support 4G but
not 4g LTE so even though sometimes you
can get some pretty decent speeds for
the most part when we're really really
slow I'm sure you can play games and
download things no problem you just need
a little bit of patience and a little
bit of a blind eye to the flaws on the
plus side it does run an Android 4.4
KitKat with a pretty lean display you
won't find it gunked up by a lot of the
custom layer that some vendors put on
their phones it also is pretty nice to
hold you've got this dark navy backing
with the soft touch finish a little bit
heavy in the hand but not too bad and
very groupable so the phone is easy to
use you do get your reliable google
experience on here but just in terms of
performance there are other phones that
are a lot better i'm justing at all
court for Cena you should definitely
