the most interesting stuff on the Dodge
Charger now has the number eight
attached to it let's drive the 2011
Charger Rallye plus and check the tech
now based on this rally plus trim level
charger is this 8.4 inch LCD one of the
biggest out there big square thing
really responsive touch controls I like
that and you get this even if you don't
option nav if you do option navigation
though you do get this Garmin powered
unit which as you can see has a familiar
interface but I find the roads to be
almost oversimplified and the little car
icons kind of cartoony the whole thing
smacked of fisher-price to me a lot of
good audio sources on this guy as well
we've got our USB port here which also
handles our iPod nicely Bluetooth audio
streaming standard aux Jack's over here
as well optical drive is here an SD card
slot I would trade that in a minute for
HD radio instead and there is no drive
space here to store your music I have no
problem with that available our adaptive
cruise control and collision warning
those two together nine hundred and
twenty-five bucks add the confidence
package for fifteen hundred dollars if
you're missing self confidence and get
blind spot technology also cross path
detection for backing into traffic as
well as rear parking sensors and a
backup camera which you'll want when
backing up this run pay shipping and our
car has smart beam headlights from that
package as well it's interesting the car
always puts the high beams on and ducks
them instead only when it sees oncoming
headlights or get this taillights in
front of you it's also got a technology
where it can swivel the lights up and
down based on what it sees on a camera
here in the mirror so that it can change
its beam cut off really advanced
lighting Oh check this out not just
cupholders not just cooled cupholders
heated and cooled cupholders that's what
sells cars
now at this level of charges Hemi in it
there's a Pentastar v-6 in it 292
horsepower 260 foot-pounds of torque
it's this kind of porky 4,000 pound car
up to 60 in about 7.3 seconds while
delivering 18 27 mpg out of an automatic
no manual is available let's see how it
works on the road okay underway in our
charger you know right away you're not
driving a Hemi but this v6 is no pig in
a poke
it's got good power especially if you're
on gear or on cam which is a little
difficult because this five-speed well
let's face it we're spoiled now with six
7s and 8's these days it kind of want
another gear in between - from time to
time but the power comes on pretty
evenly smoothly and the whole car feels
really well screwed together and I can't
get over how much they've improved the
quality of the interior materials it
gives you a good feeling and let's face
it you spend most of your time looking
at the inside not the outside of any car
you buy
okay my bottom line on the 2011 charger
Rallye plus goes like so not a pretty
car to my high but way prettier on the
inside where you actually spend your
time good work on the cabin the
centerpiece of that is where our story
of the eighths begins that eight plus
inch display is great responsive big and
bright but the nav hey I'd skip back
now the other eights are the lack of an
eight under the hood I'll be okay with
that
when and if they add direct injection to
this v6 I would also wait and buy a 2012
to get an 8-speed transmission</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
