mapping solution from the ground up and
it is beautiful this is what Lake Tahoe
looks like we're doing all the
cartography ourselves here's New York
City San Francisco this is a worldwide
effort we're covering the world
there's Italy New Zealand Singapore
Norway Paris I'm gonna go through
everything
beautiful beautiful maps now part of
maps is local search you have to be able
to find businesses and points of
interests and so we've already ingested
more than a hundred million business
listings around the world to make a
great local search once you find a
business bring up the info card and it's
beautiful we've integrated with Yelp so
you get reviews and ratings and lots of
photos right in the card we're also
building a traffic service we have this
great traffic view so it's easy to see
where the incidents are or where the the
slow traffic is and on top of that we
overlay the incidents so it's easy for
you to figure out whether traffic's
likely to speed up in a given location
anytime soon in addition to other data
sources we're using anonymous real-time
crowd-sourced data right from our iOS
users to keep this traffic fresh and
up-to-date all right so here's our maps
they're all vector based so everything
is really fast to zoom in and out you
can rotate and we rotate all the labels
when you zoom in far enough you'll see
buildings start to appear you can tap on
a point of interest here's Norma get the
info card again beautiful get reviews
and ratings from Yelp lots of photos we
also do 3d so I can zoom in and see just
what moment looks like and zoom out a
little bit here let's sort of move
around the city
rotate around some zoom back in there
beautiful I'll go back to 2d we have
satellite view of course here's our
satellite view but what I really want to
show you is flyover let's go ahead and
choose the transamerica pyramid
now this is not a movie this is being
rendered in real time so I can go ahead
and wrote this myself I can change the
camera angle fly through it myself just
beautiful
let me choose another place how about
the Sydney Opera House
and again I can wrote do this let's turn
it so I can look back at the city right
behind the Opera House I'll zoom out a
little bit change the camera angle
and that is fly over
now the last thing I'd like to show you
is turn-by-turn directions so switch to
the other device we can't all go and get
in a car and drive around so we have a
simulator if I turn by turn directions
here I'll go ahead and choose Coit Tower
I'll tap on that quick route button
gives me three different options I'll
choose route two let's go ahead and
start starting route to Coit Tower in
750 feet turn right onto Greenwich
Street turn right onto Greenwich Street
then turn left onto Grant Avenue now I
can watch this adaptive cinematic camera
angle as we go through corners in 400
feet turn left onto Grant Avenue when
two turns are close together we put both
signs up for you in 300 feet turn right
onto Lombard Street see where the the
footprint of all these buildings correct
in a quarter mile arrive at your
destination now any point I can get the
ETA up top it says one minute simulator
is going a lot faster than you should
drive in San Francisco we'll get there
faster I can also just tap on overview
which allows me to zoom out I can see
any part of the route and a time zoom in
over here just for peeing around or at
any point just tap to resume
you see it coming around Telegraph Hill
here arrived at Coit Tower
and that is turn-by-turn directions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
