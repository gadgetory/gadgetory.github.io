you how to shop for your home network
which basically means the wireless
router now if you want me to tell you
just what to buy I have a bunch of them
here in front of me but just a record
these are not the only device you should
get this has happened to be around when
I need but they do represent the three
categories of router that I want to tell
you now the bare minimum the chest right
and the cutting edge now let's start
with the bare minimum think about it at
home you just want to share the internet
and maybe some fire sometime and for
that this dealing sig fil meet the need
perfectly this is a single band router
that offer very good range and very good
data rate it has four LAN port on the
back here for you to plug in wide
devices now it lacks many thing it
doesn't have a Gigabit Ethernet no USB
port and no dual band either but it's
perfect for a small apartment for a dorm
room or a flower shop you know people
don't go to a flower shop expecting free
Wi-Fi now if you weren't more than that
you probably want to jump to the chest
right category I suspect that this is
actually the most public categories
because that's where a smart shopper
shop
that's because these devices offer you
just where you need without going
overboard and it's not too expensive and
for that category is this a Suze RT and
50 secure is the best example this is a
true dual man and 600 router now to
dwell man because is can work on both
the 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz
frequency bands at the same time and 600
because on each band you can have up to
300 megabits per second or second
ability per second combined now 300
megabit per second is not the fastest
Wi-Fi can get but that happened to be
the standard that most Wi-Fi clients
such as laptop iPad tablet I for etc
support and when it comes to networking
the speed is determined by the
slowest party involved in other words
when you pair a super fast Wi-Fi router
we are not so super fast Wi-Fi clients
you will have the not so super fast
Wi-Fi speed on top of that this router
also have a gigabit internet offering
very fast white connection and two USB
ports to host printers or extra hard
drives when working with extra hard rice
is offer the network storage for both
data sharings
and entertainment streaming contents who
connected network players at the price
about $100 now but if you have a more
than one a dollars to spend and you do
want to span it you can think about the
cutting-edge category and for that this
Netgear our 6300 is a very good example
now this router here has everything that
Isis has plus more
you see Gigabit Ethernet true dual band
2 USB port plus it's also support the
ladies ATO to point you have an AC Wi-Fi
standard that offer the speed of up to
1.3 gigabit per second 1300 megabit per
second that is of course you can only
have that scatter speed if you also use
clients that support the ATO to point
you have an AC standard and
unfortunately there are not many of them
if at all on the market now there will
be a lot of them in the future though
the private that future-proof about $200
now obviously there are many other
router on a market that feed those three
categories and stay somewhere in the
middle for example this dealing da 8 to
7 is another great router in the chest
right category or this Asus RT a C Sigma
C Q is also another great cutting edge
router or these two router right here
the dealing deer eight five seven of the
Cisco lynx is EA for 500 these both are
a lot faster and better than the chess
right category but not fast enough to be
cutting edge to find out more go to CNN
and check out the D
10 written version of the buying guy
that you can also find links to more
products and learn more about other
networking products such as power like
adapter or access point
one last thing when shopping for a home
network Park make sure you do your
homework your oh richard because you
cannot rely on chess commercial or say
in rap about the performance and
features of the products there are many
thing you cannot see for example the
Wi-Fi signal as seen out here we
actually it has every single router to
determine how stable the Wi-Fi signal is
there's many things you cannot deduce
from the look of the router
I can't though but that because I'm
don't know and there's been a proof guy
on how to spend your money on whole
network para happy shopping</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
