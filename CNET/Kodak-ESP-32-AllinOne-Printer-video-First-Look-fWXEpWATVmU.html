your first look at the Kodak ESP 3.2
all-in-one printer so this $100
multifunction device can print scan and
copy but that's just not enough for
today's average imaging devices this one
also has multiple connectivity options
including cloud printing but it still
doesn't earn my recommendation when
there are other printers out there like
the Epson Stylus and X 430 that will
give you all the same features as this
one plus separate ink cartridge tanks
and better imaging quality in a smaller
overall package but the ESP 3.2 does
have a pretty small footprint
it's just mediocre in most other regards
you don't get an auto document feeder on
top here for the scanning and copying
functions which may or may not deter
shoppers at the end of the day investing
in a printer is an exercise in personal
utility for example the NX 430 by Epson
is the best one you want if you have a
tiny workspace where as the canon pixma
MX 372 can be had for 80 bucks which is
cheaper than this one and that will give
you an auto document feeder so be sure
to measure up those specs and make sure
they're up to your personal buying
requirements the hardware is really my
main issue with the 3.2 however whereas
competing printers do feel sturdy and
able to withstand the bumps of daily use
this guy's cheap light plastic gives it
a flimsy and delicate feeling and this
thin arm keeping up the hood is old
technology that really Mars the overall
design under the hood you'll find a
standard ink cartridge bay with separate
cartridges for black and color so expect
the output quality to take a serious hit
compared to the NX 430 which has three
separate tanks for cyan magenta and
yellow colors taking a quick tour around
the device you'll find a small 2.4 inch
LCD screen up top and a couple virtual
buttons on the side of that you also get
a convenient multimedia card reader
though you won't find a USB port for
printing directly from a camera one
thing the three points you does have
going for it is your connectivity
options you can connect it using
standard USB cord but the built-in
wireless is really where you're gonna
get the most functionality with remote
printing and Kodak's new email print now
that feature lets you send print jobs
directly to the printer from anywhere
with email access and it does a lot to
free users from the shackles of that
annoying print driver software but
despite its versatility under the hood
you can get more features faster
performance and better imaging quality
out of competing systems like the NX 430
from Epson that's actually a $20 cheaper
and you can read more details on both
printers on cnet.com but that's going to
do it for me I'm Justin you you just
took a first look at the kodak ESP 3.2
all-in-one printer thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
