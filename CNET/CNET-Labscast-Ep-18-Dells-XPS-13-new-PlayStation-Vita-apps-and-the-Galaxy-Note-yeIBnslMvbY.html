a scene at labs can show now I know
Julie I know I'm even put my headphones
on that means it's real official okay
and we have our special guest to hear
today a Scully hello Scully now you know
it's actually real name people actually
name's Kelly so it's not as funny mr.
Mick skull that would be five miles last
names going that's right that's right or
or or the guys companion in uncharted is
his name Scully yes yes though so mr.
Mick skull Vin Scully gully captain
skulls a lot is he have his own camera
uh nobody got a theme in the overhead
shot really well okay we could cut to
him for reaction shots that we only
imagine he shot his shot is the overhead
she always okay that's his reaction
that's his camera it's kind of a
lifeless gave where I am something we
feel doesn't succeed we'll cut to you
Scully cut the Scully like product fail
alright so we got we have three big
things to talk about today because we're
also hardware and product focused here
on the scene at last cast number one is
and and this is a no particular order
they've taken the sony playstation vita
which we played around with the other
week yep and added a whole bunch of new
apps to it a new functionality well
that's kind of cool make some more than
just the uncharted game playing device
number two i got the samsung galaxy note
here it's the only hot phone of the year
so far or is it a tablet you tell me i
want the big pants pocket discussion
about that i'm sure and then julie has
got what Scott has deemed the the dell
book air Dell's version of a macbook air
that is avail XPS 13 which of these
topics would you like to discuss first
Scott why don't we dive into the Vita
the Vita I love it so we've been talking
about it in and yeah those new updates
came in we talked about this last week
and we were thinking about what the Vita
you know is good for addition to gaming
and I keep dreaming of personally it's
my Moby Dick the idea of a playstation
phone just because and i wrote a piece
about how I think the viet next video
should be a phone a lot of people
criticize it what I mean to say is that
I credit Sony to that degree that
they're capable of making a phone and
the xperia play as much as you may not
like it it's actually somewhat capable
as a concept if they only had analog
sticks and if the device only played
next gen games and now that the Vita is
all downloadable and also those cards
are so tiny and that screen resolution
is what 960 x 540 it's like iphone 4s
like there's no reason you can't shrink
that down to four inches or three and a
half and if you get those graphics down
to a smaller device I don't know the
thing is yeah those apps launch you know
there's netflix there's facebook there's
flickr there's a twitter capable app all
this stuff is trying to make it like a
smart device like a smartphone
everything looks like apps but it's just
not a phone there's not a phone and it's
so big that it's not I mean here doesn't
mean it's it's a very nice device is
just not very pocketable at all well
that's what they said about the samsung
note which they actually made into a
phone they're actually probably almost
the same so they are danette hold them
up they're uh they're very similar ones
obviously thinner here well you hold
vote yeah so here we go yeah your
magnets way from there yes right one is
a was 5.4 inch yeah 5.3 5.3 is a 5 inch
but it's significantly deeper yeah you
can see the thickness is the big deal
here but they're very similar sized
devices all told if you think about it
and you know you could use that screen
that that oled screen and use these apps
and it's touch compatible it works like
a smartphone I mean it's awesome for
videos and yeah that's it and those of
them those the types of functions I want
to see more on the Vita Netflix works
it's a little slow to start once it gets
going it is great on the screen the more
I want to see other video apps that the
live tweet app which is their version of
a twitter app which is okay it's not any
better than you could get from Twitter
I'd almost rather go to Twitter on the
web browser that's built in yeah and I
played around with facebook on it oh
that's right facebook coming on here but
you know you bring it up facebook was
very slow loading and then i noticed i
got pulled from the store i'll really
along there that was that was not that
impressive the twitter ones okay um
filter about you know whether you should
have an email client or not I don't know
but I think the more that you put in
those any streaming music services like
Pandora and others and obviously like
HBO Go Hulu Plus I'm sure they'll be on
the Vita at some point do you really
think so hulu plus i could see Sonya
will want its competitors on its device
now here you go well the relay station 3
so I feel like it's
but I can't get the actual signal here
so all right is the interface there are
no tweets there are no tweets you know
yeah what I'm Alex can we launch that
let's see uh Matt as long as
disconnection is going on yeah we get it
working the works around of the same way
yeah the netflix doesn't anything else
so that's all cool but it took them a
while to get those apps and games
available first obviously right and uh
you know i'm not sure i just like they
have twitter and facebook built into
xbox live right nobody ever uses that
the only way it would work well is you
want it for social connectivity in games
I don't feel like I feel like outside of
its like an iPhone I like the idea of
facebook connect because it's a more
even more than Game Center obviously
it's a more direct way of playing games
like words with friends now they could
if they I don't know if they want to put
facebook connect in because PSN is their
network but that would be how I'd like
to use Facebook as I agree and I don't
really care for tweeting in games
because this point annoying right these
like racing games i do want to tweet
your achievement no i don't ever want to
do that personally but you know yeah
it's not working here right now but
every video and audio app i mean again
the playstation 3 does have MLB it's got
NHL NFL game you know sunday game ticket
whatever they've got the name of it but
the you know game ticket service it's an
interval sunday ticket and they also
have Hulu Plus and they have voodoo on
the PlayStation 3 they were the first to
get voodoo and so you'd think like you
said would they want that well they've
done it so with it with i'm thinking
more of their music apps like pandora
they don't have that on music they might
not know because they have their own so
using a living yep you're texting music
unlimited oddly spelled yeah but also
the owl so that music inhibited service
how are those differently the same thing
is a type thing i think is really see
umbrella brand okay and then a music has
media art of it again because i provide
around with i was on the ps3 I tried it
was like oh this is kind of an
interesting function but most people
haven't played around with it I don't
know but it's for radio like a tune in
radio app they used to have a PSP radio
app that wasn't that great but they
should they should have a radio app on
the Vita I think that's kind of go to
poen over-the-air signals not a poem
like like tunein radio all of the other
web radio yeah okay okay sure and I'll
see I mean basically it's as functional
as anyone
those devices you're dealing with a you
know the ARM architecture and everything
else you just it's it's just Sony's
operating system so I mean I think you
brought up a good point Scott when you
talk about the sony ericsson playstation
phone yeah that was okay as a phone but
did not satisfy if a gaming device right
so yeah the xperia play you know if you
get the game me right in this what
happens when you had a half-hearted
phone if you even do maybe some sort of
VoIP calling well they'll be skype on it
and that I thing is in this you get
there make sense yeah that could be
interesting and I still say shrink this
down like the PSP Go which I actually
bought yes yeah I it's obviously it's
it's not perfect but it was really nice
and small I took it out the other day I
was like wow this really compact and if
they put two analog sticks in and you
put me the next-gen Vita get to that
size there's no reason there's no UMD in
here there's no reason why you couldn't
eventually shrink this down that's true
it is pretty huge it's big you shrink it
down make it really pocketable then you
make it sort of an Xperia Play type
foaming it like this look at this same
size screen maybe ads I mean give me the
two analog sticks on it sure but it
doesn't have to have the giant wings on
it or the you know it doesn't really
need that I'd but the touch screen on
the back we didn't really need that do
not got that's the number yo things were
not good what is that for I mean so they
could say they have a stably use it for
David's work they sure weren't it into
things it is like to me it's like six
axis on the ps3 when I first launch
certain games use that thing and you're
like I don't want to use this uh-huh
yeah the the main feature that you love
the whole point of the Vita is the dual
analog sticks it's got ident it's got a
console like control that's awesome so
you want to use that and and like you
said Dan about complexity I agree it has
one as maybe one two maybe three too
many interactivity functions that you'll
never go back to like I feel like when I
play the video right now one hundred
percent of the time I'm pretty much
using the analog sticks and controls
that's great yeah uncharted anything
else touch I would use if I if there
wasn't if I had to get an iphone type
game that was ported to it you're like
oh it's makes sense to port those things
the back touch yeah the back side it's
used for weird like it has an itch on
its buying like little babies because
you PSP are you using for things like
other claims
uncharted used to zoom in the in the
sniper rifle or extra steering functions
be there isn't anything I found that you
couldn't already do with the other
buttons all right it's not it's not in
the Senate all big redundancy x 2 x 3
just amazing through it it seems like
yeah like why seems like a lot of
investment in like a really weird little
exit lectures put more stuff more
confusing well that's the it did look
like it's a marketing you have the list
just solidify the prices like you know
okay yes its cost this much because that
you do all this stuff now here's the
question if you were considering getting
a PlayStation Vita for the games and
maybe you have convinced yourself yet
are these extra apps uh Twitter and
Netflix and the one or two other apps
they really have is any that gonna push
over the edge not me no no I designed
for the games um I I would only for its
sweet like I said a video and and music
apps because i don't want to pay sony
does have a store for renting like
itunes like renting TV shows and movies
I don't want to keep paying for that
stuff so if i can get netflix hulu plus
or whatever else i want youtube is
YouTube app on there and i can watch
videos on I'm on the go I do like that
as a selling point I don't think but
only if you don't have an iPhone or an
Android smartphone yeah which do those
exact things exactly right but the thing
is I think that's what people expect and
I think that's what you expect now via
slaughter tainment that's a good point
so you're saying that's the baseline no
matter what the device is meant for if
it doesn't do Twitter and Netflix and
few other things then you just kind of
have to have them to just be in the game
some people will disagree and I think
there's a lot of people say no just
dedicated games but I just think that
it's already on its way there it's
clearly the Vita is designed to be a
smart device it is it is in that
territory and so I feel like to not have
it feels weird okay that's all I feel
like it's not even a song I don't need
but that's all good yeah oh no I was
just gonna say yeah it's pretty much um
out of the box at this point those those
apps just out of the box for everything
exactly you know the fire SS oh yeah you
got the me even laptops have some of you
know some of those apps on like skype is
already there and like right now the
facebook app is stuff they're they're
making the witches for the laptops
was like you did that that's already
gotten as part of other out-of-the-box
experience already XP that no offense to
3ds you know it's yeah 3 DSS like yeah
but uh but yeah for so for the PSP to
have that now is just late in the game
is like a lot of their stuff that
they're featuring as this huge price
point is just like dude that's already
been done to death at this point like
what is new about your product that you
know justifies the back touch panel
that's know exactly I can scratch my PSP
when i get when it is that's a haha does
the best extent no you know what say
that now that's gonna be a game mechanic
in six months yes the Itchy console yeah
i think they have to keep it happy like
a pokemon i think it's on to something
if they can get the battery life better
and they can make my portable and just
make it smaller oh I got a I got a
territory cool little caveat about the
playstation vita if you're i went into
best buy this week just to see like how
they had it set up and they had a big
rack of the first party accessories
which i don't think we got any of here i
take cases and stuff so I said oh they
have the power adapter cuz you know
maybe want one at home when at work you
lose what's the first thing you loses
the AC chord yeah um and I saw AC
adapter fifteen dollars that's actually
pretty good if you lose your AC adapter
for anything is usually like pretty
expensive to replace it right so so
sorry Apple equation nah but it's not
here's what it is the box that says AC
adapter in it has the the converter
block and the plug that goes into the
wall it does not have the cable that
connects that to the Vita itself oh no
that cable it sold separately under the
name USB cable in a separate $15 five
well it is what Apple does it's the same
thing where they sell you the one cable
separately and the power brick is
another option exactly so so if you lose
your cable if you lose your power cord
and you probably those connected just go
don't go to the store and just buy the
AC adapter because you'll get home
you'll open it up and there won't be the
cable to connect this is another
proprietary party not a micro USB oh no
it's a fun it's a little I think it
might be the same one that the PSP Go
has i call it son of a track it's a
little uh looks like a mini version of a
30-pin yeah yeah kind of it does
it does all right so that those are the
latest updates for the Vita maybe next
time we'll actually get our act together
ahead of time and get some ad hoc Wi-Fi
go in and play against each other where
we'll do a little round robin tournament
which i think would be kind of fun to
say so I gotta say like oh and a final
known that you're right like totally
confusing about the Vita that it's great
as a social elements between Twitter and
Facebook and then their myriad of social
apps they have aa know that idea have
names like party and near and like
whatever else it's so confusing when you
look at it I just want like I agree with
you I just want one thing that connects
me Sony social right Sony social nicely
have all those features my friend know
why geolocation stuff its messaging
rights make it all one connections
whatever you want just a too many way
too many socially things going on I got
scared may I like the features but I'm
just like wait just show me what is
going on well this cool you can't see
your ps3 network friends on there and
get updates and stuff yes okay but i
only have like you and david karna i
think my only friends on playstation
network and as you said like there are
ways you can get your vita games that's
another small note the game library of
evil downloadable PSP games download
them on your ps3 and connect them over
with that system transfer complicated oh
my god and all right speaking of secret
stuff things that are not complicated
it's not complicated when you wanna make
a really cool new laptop you just take
the most popular laptop out there and
your copy it hey that's what dell did hi
Julie what if you got right there i have
the dell XPS 13 upside down it doesn't
matter but if you do if you took that
dell circular logo off the back of the
lid replace it with an apple logo with
the lid closed you would not be able to
tell the difference uh no actually not
because i'm just in terms of the black
bottom right yeah and it's not as
tapered in the front but if you just
looked at the lid like from the top down
well i think if you look at that from
the side view right here mm-hmm you
probably you probably would think this
is a macbook air um the average person
might think yes exactly where and that's
clearly what they're going for our eyes
are I don't mean to sound like that guy
it's just like we're not usually easily
perceived that way it's that soldier
yeah the top bottom silver but
yeah i mean what's you open at this kind
of generic though except that has grown
glass for the screen that's pretty good
yeah and the air does not have that and
i like that all over that's a bigger
trackpad that most of the dells normally
have but back today's i'm presuming yeah
back your keys which is nice yes and the
glass of the screen is nice but the
screen itself i didn't think that was
really that great it's only 1366 x 768
law 13 h ere is 1440 x 900 and it's an
end and it's a tweener size-wise well
it's it's I'll get to the point in a
second it's gonna say the screen one
lower resolution than you'd expect from
a premium 13 inch and a lot of the ultra
books have that same resolution but some
of them have like 16 x 600 x 900 would
be great but it's also it just looks
terrible off access it's not a great
looking screen you just move your head a
little bit and it really washes out they
really cheap desktop two screens yeah
the one saying it has good you know
coming from TV back and you want
something has got good uniformity across
the screen you don't have to move your
head to get something in focus right and
that's that's and that was a problem
with the original version of the s that
you buy OS yeah the you looked at
reviewing the 13-inch for this week but
yet it's got a noticeably better screen
this time than the first iteration and
it had that type of screen where you had
to move your head a little bit to to not
get that sort of gray-green wash and so
this so this has got a bad screen is
that we're just saying yeah i mean one
it's a low resolution screen that you
really want in the kind of a premium
product lower than the macbook air and
it's got terrible off-axis viewing uh
Walt Mossberg of the wall street
journal's said largely the same thing
about it but he said that that della
told him they're going to make a higher
resolution screen available soon which
will hopefully be better probably 1600 x
900 which is which is great i I've seen
13-inch 13 inch laptops with 1920 x 1080
only like one or two but that's just too
small yeah anything 1600 x 900 i think
it's perfect for something like this it
is i've come around at of iOS 13-inch
done reviewing the essay has a 900 x 900
you yeah yeah and it is great it's um
it's just right yeah you can pack a
little more on the screen here here like
it a lot ok i like it but you see what
about the the the the audio faxes yeah
it's it's terror hold up to the camera
let's see if
you can see that grey green yeah I can
totally see where flips for the black
something like girls- yeah but the thing
is about a laptop he doesn't need to
have great off axis because it is a
singular default so often you're using
in kind of a collaborative way yeah or
you're just watching it we're like
you're looking around a different thing
if you're on a train or something you go
to jam it in under a seat like they're
just a great yes not cool yeah uh yeah I
know I've but I like it too that's the
thing um it feels huge ya feel so
heavier than you think it will because I
think because as Scott pointed out it's
a 13 inch screen in something that's
more like an 11 or 12 inch body it's
actually a very small body for 13 inch I
measured it it is slightly larger than
the 11 inch air and slightly smaller
than the 13 inch air liquor yeah the
footprint feels really nice it's it's
just crosses over and feels dense and
heavy does feel dance the bottom is a
little thicker but the material feels
nice like a rubberized that's like it's
like it's like aluminum on the back
magnesium alloy and then carbon fiber I
believe on the bottom and I like I like
the use of the real estate up here I do
wish that the Ayers has when a vessel
yeah well they do it partially to save
weight they do and then on the 11 inch
air I think it's really because you get
a full keyboard that's uncompromised I
thought the keyboard is really good on
this to have nice soft touch they don't
colac a lot the quiet which I appreciate
yes a night it's a nice look it is nice
now it's got these weird ridges on the
bottoms guy can you see that yeah the
dough has yeah really you're gonna bumpy
bumpy under Scott's a little lever yeah
they're seized at the carbon fiber so
much doing that or actually imprinted in
now that that's imprinted but I mean
it's got the ridges for I guess probably
heat um yeah cuz the fence right there
at the body is yeah so so the air
obviously it's flat on the bottom and
that and that makes it a little little
thinner overall what price are we
looking at that's 999 with a 128 gig SSD
and a core i5 it's pretty good that is
Grace is good you can get the same thing
in a cheaper feeling thing for like a
hundred or two hundred dollars less like
the folio 13 from HP epsilon which is
100
less but that's for 999 I'm happy with
that you can spend and I think another
200 bucks or 150 and get a core i7 and a
256 gig SSD but no higher screen
resolution just yet oh yeah I like a lot
i call it the first quote very important
laptop of 2012 I just want to know
battery life I know that word that's
still at dry ending battery life that's
the magic number for this is that it
almost got four hours I mean four hours
five hours of the right four hours 57
yeah but does not a slice Petry open up
now 11 in chair territory right not 13
inch air territory now and then and and
dared to go back to again Walt Mossberg
who got this a few days before us is the
only one who did I said that the battery
life was kind of disappointing to him I
don't know if you ran an actual
benchmark on it like we did but so he
did it just five I don't behind for
would bother me but I overall I think
it's actually quite nice I wish was a
hair lighter and I wish I had a better
screen yeah there you go are most of the
the res is 13 by 7 yeah yeah yeah but
this is an XPS as they're high in line
you want more yeah I kind of expected
that for me it was a lot better than
their previous big high-profile launch
which was the I think the XPS 14 Z which
was just a big bulky oh yeah um boat of
a laptop that they launched right when
everyone else was launching their
ultrabooks oh look it's so thin we
compared to what our other products yeah
it's then compared to other down to our
desktops crisis it's a good sense I like
the design nobody liked better Scott
just move quick quick got check that or
folio 13 um I like the size of this
better okay I like to feel two side by
side maybe later we'll grab like the
sizes better but again it while I fully
13 was the number of ports this huh I've
got our compromise no ethernet obviously
yes I USB ports no SD card and displays
for instead of hdmi right nothing and
the fully 13s battery life was awesome
um in the six our territory thing so
that's why I like it using it but sighs
why is this design and desires yeah
sorry sign in design is awesome she says
it's kinda sighs again I'm very cool so
our third big gadget of the week is the
samsung galaxy
see note I saw this ad at CES sounds
like wow that's actually something cool
because I wasn't expecting to see
anything randomly cool it's a big big
phone / small tablet I'll turn it on
briefly here because the battery's about
to die but it's a phablet it's a phablet
the phone it's a phone 'let I don't know
here a phone yeah that's take a week
that's vomit sounds makes like a plastic
on the back yeah yes it certainly feels
like a pushes in like it's another it's
cheap plastic on the back that's the
real that's the biggest problem is very
lightweight though ooh-wee you're holed
up to the camera you doing yes pressed
another so to turn it on and then do
like a finger swipe to actually get to
the menu yeah then just watch your
finger there you go and then you're
calling someone else got you've had your
turn on the phone somehow okay I don't
want to do that yeah you broke talk to
them on air yeah go there and then we
have a stylist or now you know that I
think that'll does okay it does ever see
the other ryan brian has yeah that's the
well advertised feature I guess see the
ads for this are not bad no no they're
actually pretty enticing and that's all
point the concept of the phone or tablet
or phablet is very enticing and and they
do a good job advertising it's a
question of practicality when you
actually get it in your hands you know
is it too big to use as a as a phone is
it too small to use the tablet we were
doing a pants check before that's our I
I manage that now i am wearing pants
eject murray feiss lifted in the front
pocket of my jeans it fit but i wouldn't
go running around with it you were
wearing but i guess more casual slacks
it fit in there if your cargo pants
that'd be fine skinny jeans not so much
it's my bad boy bearings but then so
fragile you be afraid to to really run
around that just naked in your pocket
that much either just feels really
plasticky to me any wide wide flat like
that curvature of any robot legs would
uh it's it's almost cami it's
approaching the six inch kindle sighs i
wish i have one here but i feel like
this is not far off that's a sensation
screen this is 5.3 uh it's like the same
thing i can pocket the kindle if i want
to in a jacket pocket oh yeah and you
can put that new jacket by it I put my
blazer box green yeah that's a great
screen
that in my bucket that would be digging
into my skin right now while I'm sitting
down can hold up the Vita and the right
medicine calls the 5-inch screen club
and you hear me that's why but you know
what I downloaded like Angry Birds on
there and it looks really nice on the
big screen obviously movies look really
great on it but when use a web browser
it defaults to the mobile route because
it's an android device and then really
no matter what anyone says it's
one-size-fits-all and whether it's a 3
inch phone or a 5 inch phone or a 7 inch
tablet or nine inch tablet it's the same
thing so it default to the mobile
version of the website and let you go in
and manually change it on whatever site
you're on so you see those you know like
basic boring text links that used to get
on your blackberry or your whatever else
so it must be a way to hack it I'm sure
someone's rig things no way are you
talking about on so as so that your
browser appears as a full browser rather
than a mobile browser right oh it's not
so much a hack is literally in the
settings like you can change it to to
have to not go to the mobile version yes
I it doesn't ipod ipad version and blah
it's just like it's literally like a
ticker-tape okay you can choose the
fault is it goes to the mobile version
that I have to manually on every cycle
go to the full version so that was
annoying the finger responsiveness it's
good for an android phone uh it's still
not the same as you know what I mean
it's just not and there are proprietary
you know trade secret reasons for that
and if you did not use an iPhone or an
iPad a lot you probably wouldn't notice
but if you do you notice that's that we
good oh that's just gonna say that has
anyone seen the film top secret the old
movie yeah this is seen whether the
commit commandant comes up and and
there's a big telephone in the
foreground it ends I'm Baker because
you've got in the foreground of you your
shot they're nicer oh my god let me know
if you've condition improves I remember
they is dead that's a good reference oh
yeah yeah that the we're not showing it
now obviously but the stylist I'm
interested that it I guess it uses wacom
technology yes it's yes an active stylus
they can't use like your 3ds stylist or
anything right and it allows some extra
functionality and serve like I'm
sketching this fun it's a little sketch
pad but how do people walk around
sketching skating comment and it's
healed over
day I do we have it I'm gonna go to the
park a new character too i'm going to
edit a PDF today kapiti artists
practicing their art as he got up on the
wall its residue leaving a electronic
paper trail then that the police can
follow meet put on the battery this is
trying to make is trying to appeal the
David Hockney to try to steal him away
from the iphone is near the edge device
of choice so if you just need a phone
I'm not sure this is the right device
for you if you just need tablet again
I'm not sure it's sort of a jack of all
trades master of none but it's cool and
I appreciate people doing different
things and playing around with stuff you
know so so that's my take on it I'm not
sure I'd find it that useful but I
prenatal ugh analog sticks ah that's the
final step but you know the more
different types of phones we have in
terrible things the better oh yeah oh no
but a magnet on it I can destroy you
have right tell tell us about these
things here we delay my face for the
head of the whole podcast which way i
feel like i'm d magnet magnetized the
entire studio with the S yeah I wasn't
able to talk about twenty fair last week
as I was away and the week before and
then we didn't have a show last week but
when I looked at Toy Fair came back one
of things I enjoy playing with nanodots
who make these little tiny magnets have
finally made mega dots which are the
larger marble sized version and you can
get them in a pack of 30 and you mix
them together and that looks like some
strange infectious disease of magnets
and you can make them into bracelets or
whatever else and interestingly
myth-busting thing apparently the Nano
dot guys had reminded me that as far as
demagnetization or concerns really only
need to worry about magnetic hard drives
and credit cards they're reminding me
that for LCD screens or phones even you
can bring these magnets right up to it
and be fine now as is these two solid
state stuff is fine right so we ramp to
your smartphone etc of course most
people are not comfortable with that I'm
still not comfortable with it even
knowing that it freaks me out but of
course magnets are in devices like iPads
so there you go um and uh yeah so there
are these things so tell me what I tell
me about the danger of accidentally
swallowing these yeah yeah so these are
not for kids in fact they have a clear
warning for for the age and I think it's
much higher than you expect they
certainly don't look like something a
kid would find fun at all
no one of the dangers they warned about
as if I'm being sarcastic but you think
they look incredibly fun if you swallow
these little dots they said the risk
could potentially be that they would go
into your intestines that your
intestines could stick together across
that these little dots go to ocean
strong magnets in other parts of it's
terrifying but that is a real risk to
swallowing these they also said this is
a grid point that the magnet strength on
these larger ones was reduced is they
they proudly said that if they had
brought them up to the strength of the
smaller dots these would break your
fingers if you played with them when
they snap together there was a racket
they could snap they could break your
back what's the bet that will come out
with an extreme edition he's great thank
you snapping power but they're there it
also gas four point oh haha they're
awesomely addictive little desk toys and
there's a you know you can build stuff
out of them but they are not for little
kids or even be youngest kids they're
they're a good thing good thing Joseph
