expensive refrigerators and this one
here the RF to 3m 1890s G is one of the
latest and also one of the most
expensive at a retail price of $4,200
for your money you're getting a new and
improved design with attractive
stainless steel accents inside of the
fridge an it the Auto filling water
pitcher in the door and modern looking
recessed handles for the freezer and the
Flex drawer now if you're a repeat
viewer of my samsung fridge reviews then
you might remember that I've long taken
umbrage with a certain narrow little
shelf tucked away beneath the icemaker
in these high-end French door models
that shelf was way too tight to fit
anything so we poured some pace picante
into it and called it the salsa mode
since it wasn't good for anything else
well today I am happy to announce here
in this video that the salsa mode is
dead Samsung killed it off and replaced
it with this water pitcher along with
the but urban-type compartment next to
it it's a little bit more deep than
before and can almost fit things you
know good enough as for the rest of the
fridge you get about 23 cubic feet of
total storage space which is fine for a
counter depth model like this one get
the full-size model that sticks out past
your countertops that you need a little
more room now samsung's high-end fridges
are usually pretty strong performers in
our cooling tests and the ole RF to 3m
was no different at both the default
setting and the coldest setting it
yielded steady accurate temperatures
throughout the entire fridge without any
hot spots I also appreciated that flex
tour and it's variety of temperature
settings it was able to hit all of them
within a degree or two and I was able to
switch it from the warmest setting down
to the coldest setting in less than
three hours which is really great I
think it's a pretty good-looking design
too if you like this new trend of black
stainless steel appliances it'll fit
right in and with darker metallic
accents in the fridge and the Flex
drawer it feels like something you might
find in a chef's kitchen it's a sturdy
good-looking build but isn't worth 4200
I'll leave that to you and your budget
and point out that these high-end
Samsung refrigerators typically end up
on sale for at least five or six hundred
dollars off so maybe consider waiting
for prices like that before you splurge
but if you do decide to splurge I really
think that you're gonna like this fridge
quite a bit
