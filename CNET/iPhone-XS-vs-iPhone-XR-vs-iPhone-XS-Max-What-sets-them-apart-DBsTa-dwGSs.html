iPhones but the names can be confusing
there's the 10s the 10 R and the 10s max
how do you know which one to choose
we're breaking down the specs and
working out the difference between the
cheapest and most expensive phones on
that note let's start with price
starting from lowest to highest the
iPhone 10 R is the cheapest of the bunch
starting at seven hundred and forty nine
dollars in the u.s. next is the iPhone
10 s the successor to last year's iPhone
10 in size the base price is nine
hundred and ninety nine dollars the 10 s
max is the most expensive at one
thousand and ninety nine dollars but can
cost up to one thousand four hundred and
forty nine dollars for the biggest
storage option design wise they all look
fairly similar from the front the big
difference is their size and type of
screen the iPhone 10 R has a 6.1 inch
LCD screen that Apple calls a liquid
Retina display the phone comes in six
different colors the 10 s has a slightly
smaller 5.8 inch screen but it is the
same size as the original iPhone 10 it's
also an OLED screen that Apple calls the
super retina HD display the big phone on
the block is the iPhone 10 s max it's a
6.5 inch phone also with an OLED screen
it's also the heaviest of the lot as you
would expect at 7.34 ounces or 208 grams
both the 10 s and the 10s max come in
space grey silver or the new gold finish
apart from the screen type the other big
difference is that the 10r doesn't have
3d touch like the other two phones
instead it has a haptic touch feature so
you can press on the screen to launch
the camera or a flashlight all the
phones have Apple's newest a12 chip and
all our water resistant up to 30 minutes
the
and s and Max can go down to two meters
while the R is only rated to one meter
as for storage the 10 R comes with 64
128 or 256 gigabytes while the other two
goat 64 256 and 512 gigabytes
there is no home button on any of the
phones and all use face ID so your face
unlocks the device and authorizes
purchases through Apple pay
they all have wireless charging the
biggest phone the 10 s max will also let
you look at content side by side on the
screen all three phones have dual SIM
functionality so you can have two
numbers on the one phone moving to the
rear camera the 10 R does things a
little differently from the other two it
has a single lens 12 megapixel camera at
F 1.8 aperture the 10s and 10's max on
the other hand have a dual camera on the
back both at 12 megapixels the
wide-angle lens its F 1 point 8 and the
telephoto 4 2 X optical zoom is at F 2
point 4 or 3 will let you selectively
control the blur on portrait mode photos
around the front or 3 share the same
true depth camera with an aperture of
f-22 and a 7 megapixel sensor you'll be
able to make an emojis on all three the
iPhone 10s and 10's Macs are available
on September 21 with pre-orders a week
before in the US if you want to get your
hands on the cheaper 10 R you'll have to
wait a bit longer
it's available on October 26 with
pre-orders the week before so here's the
cheat sheet if you want the smaller size
phone with the best of all worlds that's
the 10 s the cheapest phone is the 10 R
and the biggest one is the tennis max
but don't expect all those flagship
features to come cheap
