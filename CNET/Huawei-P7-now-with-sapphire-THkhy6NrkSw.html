i'm holding in fact the difference is
that it has a sapphire screen I'm tosca
dual-core Christina and here at CES 2015
in Las Vegas looking at it you can't
really tell that it has a sapphire
screen because it is just as transparent
and responsive as the kind of glass that
you would find on any other smartphone
but it is here main benefit it's
supposed to be much harder than regular
glass and much stronger too for
accidental drops now why would Huawei
want to do this because they can
sapphire is the talk of the town right
now so they experimented with one of
their top products to include this new
material apart from the screen the other
difference that you're going to find
between this and the regular edition of
the phone is the color this one has rose
gold finish on the side and this sort of
black slate gray reflective surface on
the back now for the main specs we've
got android 4.4 on a 5-inch 1080p
display looks really pretty you bought a
13 megapixel camera on the back with
flash happy to see that then 8 megapixel
camera on the front inside we've got a
1.8 your government's octa-core
processor this phone is really beautiful
the original p7 looked really great I've
seen it in white but this is the only
one to have these really cool colors so
if you want them you have to get this
phone it is currently available in Asia
and the UK for 488 pounds that's the
equivalent of about seven hundred sixty
dollars once again I'm just a good ole
Christina you can check out more details
about this and other phones that we're
seeing here at CES at cnet com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
