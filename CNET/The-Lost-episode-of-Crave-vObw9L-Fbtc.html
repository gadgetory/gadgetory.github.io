veronica belmont with you today is Susie
Brannon she's responsible for getting a
lot of our video on the internets anyway
so this is the video podcast where we
talk about some of the wild crazy cool
stuff that we find on the crave blog at
crave sina com and so today we're going
to delve a little bit into lost because
we're both huge fans of yes we are is
awesome yes and this new season started
and so we got to thinking what would be
some of the stuff that you would find on
the crave blog that might help the
losties out a little bit so what did you
find well they have those old archaic
computers you know throughout the island
and the various hatches and I thought
well if they have those I'm sure they
have some old-school large laptops and
to carry those around they may be
interested in the new wooden laptop case
that the moma is currently selling they
could probably carve one out themselves
i'm sure i just can't get wrap my head
around you get a really light laptop and
then you go and i win in laptop and it
has no strap either it has like little
canvas handles its first so yes very old
school is like a briefcase that turns
into your laptop nice yeah well I found
something that I thought might help them
pretty well it is a gps shoe called the
explorer so if they were wearing these
shoes they'd be able to find them right
away it's like a sneaker and it just has
GPS built right into it so all you have
to do is wear and people can track your
movements because that's not creepy at
all hmm I'll have to rethink that one
but it'll be good for them yes exactly
and then if they have the little zipper
like the old kangaroos and think I've
like their parachute and different
things in ah that Island an auteur you
go JJ Abrams yeah he needs to be welcome
to the cast anyway I also found a
flashlight looks like a regular old
flashlight except for the fact that you
can also stun people with it delize
shuck them yeah and then eight hundred
thousand volts and that's legal yeah
well I mean if someone's attacking you
gotta protect yourself true true if
you're lost in the dark it can be a
flash
right right I'll be useful for the
losties I agree because they could have
probably stunned that giant polar bear
they came across and speaking of strange
things on the island where there's a
polar bear I'm sure there is ice snow
some sort of Arctic environment I see
where you're going and yes what I found
on crave is this super awesome robot and
it is from the Japanese who are the best
robot makers ever and they love cute
things and this is a cute robot that is
a snowplow it's about three feet high it
looks like a cute little animal it has
GPS in it and there's video cameras for
their eyeballs and it goes along and
eats the snow and as it eats it it poops
out these huge ice blocks it poops out
it picks that I slacks it's awesome and
you could use those then if you lived on
the island for refrigerating your food
because your hats just blew up there you
go and you're on a tropical island
speaking of keeping everything cool
because they no longer have a hatch they
seem to somehow still have their little
Dharma Initiative food everywhere in the
island this is a major question I have
is all the food like they're not really
concerned the hatch blew up and all
their food was in it spoiler alert yes
R'hllor sorry if you didn't watch the
end of last season um but what I found
on crave this week is there's a website
called insanely great tease and yeah
they have a very awesome thing set up
where you can call up PDFs of labels for
all the kinds of food that they have
down in the hatch print them up and put
them around your food so they have these
awesome ones for beer and they have
mayonnaise and peanut butter and andy
rourke candy bars yeah very good so if
you want to like have a lost party you
know and have all your friends over I
totally trip them out to turn all those
up and tape a lot big service probably
think you were a little crazy yeah
probably but they think that anyway we
talk about poop poop crazy anyway if you
want to send us in your crazy
see links or videos or all the stuff
that you find out there on the internet
