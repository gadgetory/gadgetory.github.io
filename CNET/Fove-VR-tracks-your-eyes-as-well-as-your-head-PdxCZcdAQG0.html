a lot about VR headsets from the oculus
rift to the Sony Morpheus but we've yet
to see one with native I tracking that
is until now this is the fold vr I
tracking headset now what makes this one
different is that it actually has little
sensors inside of it that are actually
tracking your pupil so whenever you look
at the game knows what you're looking at
so on the demo I saw there a bunch of
spaceships all over the screen and each
time I looked at a spaceship this big
laser will shoot out from like my chest
or my mouth or something like that and
it will destroy the spaceship so it was
actually pretty fun so the stations are
all across the screen I have to look
around to turn my head sometimes because
you know the script my my field of view
is a little narrow so it does so there
is a little bit of strategy little like
tactics in there it's just the demo it's
not a full game but actually did have
fun playing it now this is a late
prototype headset so it's not you know
one hundred percent consumer-ready you
know wasn't as comfortable as I like my
VR headsets to be but they're probably
going to change that before release
speaking of release there about a year
away from that they're targeting a price
point of below 500 there is a
Kickstarter campaign right now so look
for that once again i'm eric franklin
and this has been a first look at the
full I tracking VR headset
