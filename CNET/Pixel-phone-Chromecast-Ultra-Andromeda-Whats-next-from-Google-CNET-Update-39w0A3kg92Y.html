new gadgets next week thanks to a number
of early leaks and reports we already
have an idea of what to expect at
Google's October fourth press
announcement for starters ventureBeat
published this photo of Google's
upcoming phone long reported to be
called the pixel and there will also be
a larger one called the pixel XL we've
heard for a while now that Google's next
flagship phone will ditch the Nexus
brand and instead be called the pixel
even though pixel is the name reserved
for Chromebooks but even that is
changing several news outlets have
reported the Chrome operating system is
going to merge together with Android
creating this hybrid system that's being
referred to as Andromeda google
reportedly is working on a new tablet
and a laptop that will have this new
hybrid operating system but to add to
all this naming confusion the tablet may
be called a nexus that's according to
android police and 925 Google I guess we
shouldn't get mad at Google for being a
little confusing and awkward because
this week the company turns 18 years old
so happy birthday Google as the company
enters adulthood it's starting to expand
into more mature tech for boring
grown-ups like Wi-Fi routers android
police reports that Google's home Wi-Fi
router called Google Wi-Fi will be
announced at the event next week and
cost a hundred and thirty dollars
launching alongside the Google homesmart
speaker and a new chromecast possibly
called the 4k chromecast ultra
ventureBeat published this leaked image
android police once again has inside
sources saying that it's going to stream
4k resolution video costing about
seventy dollars and that's double the
cost of the old chromecast we'll have to
see how it compares to Roke whose brand
new streaming devices that are hitting
stores this holiday season the company
just unveiled five new TV streaming
devices with the cheapest just thirty
dollars that's it for this tech news
