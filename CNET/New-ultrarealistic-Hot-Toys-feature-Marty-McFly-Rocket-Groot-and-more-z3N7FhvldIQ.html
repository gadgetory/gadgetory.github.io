uniform an extra head sculpt and my
favorite part a magnetic shield that can

Captain America goes for 225 dollars hot
off the heels of the latest Batman
videogame Arkham Knight

comes with nearly every gadget included
in the game

the line launcher and many more and you
could own the Batman from Arkham City
for $230 and of course I've saved my
favorite for last it's the first time
Hot Toys has ever used the Back to the
Future license obviously we're looking
at Marty McFly from the first film
complete with his iconic skateboard
outfit and camcorder that he uses to
film Doc's time travel experiment first

accessories are enough to make any fan

note on the back better yet the sideshow
