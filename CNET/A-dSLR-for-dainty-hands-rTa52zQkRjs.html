attempt to make a DSLR to attract folks
who are abandoning DSLRs because they're
too big the camera has a few inches
shaved off it compared to the t5 i but
the most notable changes the grip which
is shorter and shallower and the cameras
definitely a smaller lighter version
that feels quite at home in my female a
relatively small hands aside from the
size though there's nothing that
particularly stands out in fact because
of the smaller size it loses the
articulated display of the t5 I it gains
three extra scene modes kids food and
candlelight on top of the three other
multi-shot modes but otherwise it's
feature set is really subpar for the
money it lacks built-in wireless and GPS
it doesn't have any interesting options
like special effects and intervalometer
extra bracketing modes or any of that it
does have a soft shutter mode but I
found that a necessity more than an
option not just because of the loud
shutter slap but because there's a bit
of camera shake at shutter speeds under
about 100th of a second the soft shutter
fixes that the camera delivers the same
image and video quality as the t5 I
though not to as high ISO sensitivities
JPEGs look okay through iso 1600 and
they're clean through iso 800 but the t5
eyes seem to do about a stop better with
the same lenses videos are fine for
personal use they show the same aliasing
and waray problems though performance is
also very good well it can't sustain the
t5 eyes burst rate it's comparable to
others in its class and fast enough for
catching kids and pets in action my
bigger problem with continuous shooting
is the viewfinder like all the rebels it
has these tiny little dots that are hard
to spot until after you focused and
they've lit up that makes keeping a
moving subject and focus difficult
unlike most consumer DSLRs the automatic
focus point selection servo autofocus
aren't accurate enough
live view autofocus works well
especially with touch autofocus and I
really like the responsiveness of the
touch screen in its interface but the
LCD is really reflective and hard to see
in direct sunlight so you can't use it
as much the sl1 is a nice basic DSLR
that should probably be a little cheaper
and a little smaller through the lens
optical viewfinder is the primary reason
left for consumers to buy a DSLR and the
SL ones simply isn't that good
especially compared to the newer
electronic viewfinders on mirrorless
interchangeable-lens models you can get
so much more with an ilc for the same
money and they tend to be more compact
with smaller lenses I don't think people
will be really disappointed with the sl1
but it's just not the best option at its
current kit price of around seven
hundred fifty dollars I'm Lori grinning
and this is the canon eos rebel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
