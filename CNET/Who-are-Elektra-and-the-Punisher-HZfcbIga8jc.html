new characters from Marvel's extensive
back catalogue but who are electra and
the Punisher here's a quick primer let's
start with the lecturer who made her
first appearance in daredevil number 168
in 1981 electric porn elektra natchios
is a skilled martial artist who after
the death of her father became an
assassin for the evil ninja sect the
hand boat later went a bit lone wolf
created by Frank Miller electra and
daredevil have a long and complex
romantic history which should add drama
to her role in the show second season
next up is muscular killer the Punisher
who got his first airing in the amazing
spider-man number 129 in 1974 the
Punishers real name is Frank Castle this
former US Marines wife and child were
tragically killed in a New York gun
battle after which Castle declared war
on criminals and kills as many as he can
without mercy like a lecturer the
Punisher doesn't really have superpowers
as such but relies on his training and
you nisshin's expertise to dispatch
wrongdoers while he hates crime his
lethal no-holds-barred approach often
puts him at odds with Marvel's various
heroes both characters have appeared on
screen before Elektra was played by
Jennifer Garner in the dodgy 2003 film
daredevil and an equally if he spin-off
in 2005 The Punisher meanwhile has been
portrayed by Dolph Lundgren Thomas Jane
and Ray Stevenson in varying Lee
faithful adaptations that should be
enough to get you pine for the new
season of daredevil bring it on
