Middleditch and Amanda crew's Silicon
Valley season three and tell us it was
just I asked them to talk about their
character but in a way of how is
Thomas's character the show is compared
to him in real life Oh from your
perspective that's fine
well there's similarities in that Thomas
really is into a lot of cool things like
gurps I heard about this you know you
want to explain this again kind of a
little bit okay
garrison gurps stands for a generic
universal role-playing system I gave it
right into this camera down to Steve
Jackson made it if you've heard of
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons it's kind of like
that
you got your character sheets you got a
bunch of really close friends and you
have a game master and it's one of the
best experiences we could ever have so
he's into some of those things but he
unlike Richard Thomas is super
charismatic uh he's um he's I just say
that was the biggest difference he's
much more charismatic and oh did you
want to add it more handsome in person
yeah well that's the obvious one but
people get to see that they've seen him
in interviews with him right now and
they've seen him in the show yeah I'm
studyin
he's not awkward at all so do me yeah
who is a mannequin true Oh Amanda is a
real tomboy
she's Chris cussing and defying and good
wine that's a great distributor so Joe
jabberin and all kinds of fun stuff and
she's a real she's one of the boys man
she's really she's really fun what's her
way to like help Monica is a bit more I
don't ain't no little she's a bit more
put together she wouldn't have her hair
blowing like this they fine with it now
I asked the other guys a last question
before we wrap it up I last asked the
other guys about how season one you were
you know the main female in the show
season two a few extras we know Silicon
Valley still has that large gap of men
to women ratio but that I mean that kind
of gives you a lot more time to shine
right and we have women on the show if
we went on they shine to see Suzanne
Cryer we had alice wetterlund on and
also you know i didn't like a lot of
that flack for the show in particular
looks sure I mean called call what
social issue you need to in terms of
real Silicon Valley but like for our
show I wanted to be like were you not
watching it we have a she's a woman of
power and I'm working charity and
something rare about my role on the show
that in most roles that I play I'm like
you know the love interest I just serve
as the love interest and that's I don't
do that on the show I serve purpose as a
businesswoman and I think she's a great
role model for women awesome thanks guys
so thank you so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
