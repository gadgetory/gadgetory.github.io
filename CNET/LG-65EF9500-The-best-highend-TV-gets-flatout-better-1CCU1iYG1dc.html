it's the best TV I've tested so far of
course it's also one of the most
expensive
it's an OLED TV and oullette is a
fundamentally different display
technology than the LED LCD tech used in
the vast majority of TVs sold today
the most obvious external difference is
that OLED is exceedingly thin this TV
measures just a quarter inch deep and
its thinnest part although it bulges
wider here to accommodate stuff like
inputs and the power supply it's styling
in other areas is pretty sleek too with
a very thin frame around the picture and
a cool semi-transparent stand
unlike most other OLED TVs which have
curved screens the EF 9500 is flat
I actually prefer a flat screen because
the curve seems a bit distorted but the
picture quality differences are
negligible in the end the choice comes
down to aesthetics and LG's curved and
flat o LEDs cost the same LG packed all
of its best features into this TV it's
smart TV system uses webOS which I like
for its simple layout and speedier
reaction times compared to the old
version everything is controlled with
this slick motion remote complete with
the nifty scroll wheel onboard apps
include most of the heavy hitters
including 4k compatible versions of
Netflix Amazon Instant Video and YouTube
the TV can also play back next
generation HDR video from Amazon and in
the future other providers HDR promises
even better image quality than 4k and
unlike previous LG OLED TVs the EF 9500
also worked with external HDR sources
like 4k blu-ray players due out next
year the main reason I like OLED so much
however has to do with its picture
quality it can deliver a perfect black
for incredible contrast and pop without
the bloomin artifacts of competing LED
LCDs it also looks equally good from the
sweet spot in front of the screen and
the far end of the couch and as expected
at this price color accuracy bright room
performance and video processing are all
top-notch all of that makes LG's EF 9500
OLED the best television you can buy
today if you could spare the cash I'm
