the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple and this
week it's a whole lot of good now the
sexy headline comes straight from Tim
Cook during Apple's recent earnings
report which we'll get to in a bit
now Cook said development for the Apple
watch is right on schedule
and they expect to begin shipping in
April he also added my expectations are
high on it I'm using it every day and I
love it and I can't live without it
oh my goodness I mean I just wonder how
did Timmy even survive a day before the
Apple watch life is already so tough
especially when you're the CEO of a
multi-billion dollar company
my friends the struggle is real speaking
of struggling the Apple watch's battery
life might be something Cupertino is
having trouble with after a recent
report from nine-to-five Matt claimed
that Apple was aiming for two and a half
to four hours of active use with the
Apple watch now don't freak out just yet
that means actually interacting with the
watch and not with the people around you
they are targeting a goal of 19 hours of
active and passive use combined or three
days of standby time or four days if the
watch is sleeping you know since you
probably paid a minimum $349 to have
something and sit on your desk for four
days doing nothing now this is the first
real until we've heard about the battery
life but the report also says Apple may
not be able to reach the 19 hour mixed
use school for the first gen this pretty
much aligns with Tim Cook's previous
comments that Apple expects you'll be
charging their SmartWatch daily but this
is one of those products that is
screaming to me wait for the second gen
alright let's get to the earnings an
Apple recently reported their first
fiscal quarter of 2015 and it was G
double OD good posting a net quarterly
profit of 18 billion dollars on seventy
four point six billion dollars in
revenue that's the most profitable
quarter ever by any company ever no one
has done it better now Apple sold a
record seventy four point five million
iPhones
the corner up from 51 million a year
earlier max were up 5.5 million compared
to 4.8 million the year before but iPad
sales dipped to 20 1.4 million from 26
million last year the iPhone now makes
up 69 percent of apples revenue and
ipods well they're bunched in that tiny
slice of the pie called under here now
the iPhone 6 release was really the eye
opener here Cook said there with some
clear geographical preferences for the
iPhone 6 versus the six plus you can
also thank China for the big jump in
numbers for 16 point 1 billion dollars
in revenue jumping up 70 percent from
last year
you'll have 20 Apple stores there very
soon and they'll be doubling that by mid
2016 so we can expect to see more big
numbers in the future with all this
momentum all right iPad sales are down
in that probably won't change anytime
soon with no major revamp coming in it's
still a product that lasts a good two to
three years easily I keep telling you
all I'm a big fan of the iPad pro for
traveling and these top-notch renderings
by Martin hey Jack gives us an idea of
what we might see when it releases now
he envisions the big bezel coming back
shows off a size comparison and even
includes details like the smudge and
spit marks that all of you have on your
iPad's plus a glowing Apple logo stylus
cool in theory but not cool if you have
to recharge it okay in some quick Apple
software updates OS 10 point 10 point to
bring some security fixes Wi-Fi
disconnecting issues are fixed and the
ability to browse your iCloud Drive in
Time Machine and iOS 8.1 point 3 was
also released and brings bug fixes but
the biggest improvement reduces the
amount of storage required to perform a
software update in the future and I know
you all like that but before we go
Believe It or Not sometimes the Apple
bite makes mistakes I know crazy huh
well last week we told you about how
Apple got rid of the free iTunes song of
the week and a lot of you wrote me and
we're mad about that so on behalf of you
we threw out a bad apple well right
after that Apple added a whole new
section on the iTunes Store called free
on iTunes that includes 16 songs
and 22 full-length TV episodes right now
so you know what the bad apple is on me
yeah I deserve that one
and maybe that one okay okay okay that's
enough
but my favorite free song Nicki jams
travel stewardess
all right that's gonna do it for this
week's show
you can always email me at the Apple
bite at cnn.com or tweet me at Bryant
Tong thanks for watching we'll catch you
all next time for another bite of the
Apple
