entertainment electronics relates to
everybody's life that's why they devoted
zip code to these displays the tablets a
different story this is one of the
newest pieces of technology does a lot
of things well web email games ebooks
and all those apps but statistics tell
us an awful lot of you are still on the
fence about even owning one of these
here's one more roll of the tablet I bet
you don't know so well that might tip
the balance for you and that is as a
perfect partner for your television
look at where you watch TV probably a
big stack of boxes just like this every
one of them brings you different content
on a different interface a
different-looking screen trying to find
what you want when you want it how you
want it is chaotic at best and even that
fancy unified remote you bought and
spend so much time programming that
doesn't really Corral all that stuff all
that well now introduce a tablet and
things get interesting not fully baked
but interesting all kinds of apps will
let you go through programming an
electronic program guide that's so much
more intuitive than the one on your TV
screen that you poke at with a remote
look how all kinds of content from air
the streaming to cable the discs can all
be shown in a nice browsable fashion you
flick through almost like iTunes
coverflow and most of the big
manufacturers electronics now are
building these ecosystems for your
television your tablet and your
smartphone will often talk to each other
control each other and share content
like this ecosystem from Samsung their
tablet can be an elaborate remote for
their TV that lets me browse listings
for example and then watch them I can
also make settings changes on the
television right from here and of course
it's an android device with a true web
browser that has flash support so I can
go online to watch companion content
without bugginess oh and check this out
i'm watching tron on the blu-ray player
and I've got the Tron app loaded here on
my ipad using a technology called second
screen these two stay in sync and I'm
getting unique special content on the
tablet it relates to exactly what I'm
watching on the TV on the movie right
now now this may seem like a bit much
when all you want to do is sack out and
watch a movie seems that way to me but
this definitely shows the potential of
the TV tablet marriage and of course any
tablet can handle the web which means
you can jump into chats or fan sites or
just about anything else about your
favorite show in real time Hanna tablets
also great for email Facebook Twitter
and all the other things that we are
increasingly doing while watching TV
consider the research that shows most of
us don't just sit down and watch TV
anymore we interact with a second maybe
even a third device and since the tablet
is a great size much bigger than a
smartphone but also nice and light much
more handleable than a laptop this is
kind of the ultimate partner the
ultimate use of couch time now given all
that goodness there are a few drawbacks
first of all this guy doesn't fit in the
palm of your hand like a regular remote
weighs a bit more too by the way the
battery life nowhere near as good as a
regular remote and if you have it set
properly it's probably always turning
itself off every five or ten minutes
those can be some drawbacks now so far
this has all been about the TV at the
center and the tablet kind of in orbit
around it but it goes the other way as
well for example if you have an iPad
with Apple's AirPlay technology and an
apple TV hooked up to your television
like I do you can be watching a video on
your tablet and then decide no I want to
watch it on that TV here in the room
press one button and it gets bounced
over there over your home wireless
network the same can work for photos and
audio as well and with other electronics
gear the supports airplay you don't have
to have an Apple TV box by the way this
does not use that new apple icloud
technology this is over your home
network icloud is a whole nother topic
finally there are apps from the guys you
pay for TV the cable and satellite
operators these install on your tablet
and roll up TiVo like functions video on
demand and remote viewing all through a
single app the Achilles heel is often
the thicket of limitations on what you
can watch where and when for example
this time warner app only works when
you're connected to your home Wi-Fi
connection on their router and these
types of apps also require you maintain
cable and internet service so while it's
not perfect the tablets probably the
best partner for your television more
elegant than the laptop or smartphone
you use already and as you use one of
these in the living room more and more
you'll start to see the future of the
way we're going to watch TV today
