today we're going to take a look at the
google chromecast this is Google's $35
streaming stick that made a big splash
when it was announced back in July and
recently it's gotten a few updates in
the last couple months now there's not
much to the hardware it's a gray stick
with a solid feel and it's designed to
plug right into a spare hdmi input on
the back of your TV it's a sleek look
but that spoiled just a little bit by
the fact that it also needs power so
you'll have to connect the included
micro USB cable either to a USB port on
the back your TV or to the included
power adapter setup is surprisingly easy
using either an Android or iOS device
which leads you through the simple
step-by-step process once you're ready
to go using the chromecast is as easy as
opening up a supported app on a phone or
tablet you hit the cast button and it
beams the content straight to your TV
you can pause and fast-forward right
from your mobile device and even adjust
the volume you can even have multiple
devices controlling the chromecast at
once which is pretty fun if you have a
group of friends and your training
YouTube videos on your TV now you may
have noticed two crucial details to how
the chromecast works the first is that
apps need to support the device and
right now the list is a little short
there's Netflix YouTube Pandora HBO Go
Hulu Plus and Google music plus android
users can also access google movies and
TV it's better than what the chromecast
offered at launch but it's still not
much compared to Roku or Apple TV
chromecast also doesn't support photos
music or videos stored on your tablet or
smartphone and it could be a little
frustrating that you can't do something
simple like beam your photos right to
your TV screen the other important
detail with the chromecast is that
unlike Roku or Apple TV you need to use
a tablet or smartphone to control it
there's no remote control there's also
not a traditional user interface at all
so if you're in a household we're not
everyone has their own mobile device
it's not a great choice there's one
other way to get content to the
chromecast and less using screen
mirroring fire up the Chrome browser on
a pc mac or chromebook and
the chromecast extension and you can
mirror any tab in chrome on your TV
including any streaming video that you
can find on the web it sounds great but
in practice I found it doesn't work that
well with poor image quality and a lot
of dropouts and glitches a lot of it
depends on your home networking and
laptop performance but don't expect a
flawless experience from the screen
mirroring feature so where does that
leave chromecast even with the recent
updates I still don't think it's quite
as good of a value as Roku's boxes which
can be had for just fifty dollars for
example the roku LT supports a lot more
services including Amazon Instant MLB TV
rdio PBS watch ESPN and Disney Channel
plus it also has a traditional on screen
interface and it lets you listen to
music and view your photos stored on
your phone for most people it's a better
box that's worth the fifteen dollar
extra but if you're fine with chromecast
limitations it's hard to deny the $35 is
a tempting price especially if you've
purchased movies and TV shows in the
Android ecosystem and need a way to
watch them on your TV chromecast has
made some solid improvements over the
last few months but it needs to go a
little further to become a truly great
streaming device I'm Matthew miskovic
and this is the google chromecast</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
