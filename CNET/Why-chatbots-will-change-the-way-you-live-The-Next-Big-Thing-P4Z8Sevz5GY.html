the hottest trending big platform topic
in technology as we enter 2016 largely
thanks of some major announcements
recently that Microsoft and Facebook
want to power them as big platforms for
other partners to come in and use so
today we're launching messenger platform
in essence a chat bot is any machine or
server probably in the cloud that you
have a conversation with in natural
language it figures out what you mean
using artificial intelligence and it can
deliver answers that are consistent
useful and tailored to you and the more
you use it the more personalized it'll
get Google just announced assistant a
chat bot technology which they emphasize
will be very good at tracking your
follow-on questions to get a more
tailored result as you keep talking to
it we want to bring the kits this time
and then if that's the case Google
should refine the answer and suggest
family-friendly options and maybe even
ask me would you like for tickets to any
of these it will also be present in
their coming competitor to Amazon echo
this is a far cry from the dumb wooden
interactions we have today with IVR
systems or the pretty simple speech
recognition that you have on your phone
a chat bot can be interacted with by you
either through text messaging if you
will with characters or can be done via
voice either one is in the chat bot
realm much of the interest in chat BOTS
comes from this concept that we may have
hit peek app or app saturation but there
is only so much you can do when you ask
people to download an app and deal with
an actual visual interface that is
limited by the features that were
written into it by the software
developer most of us want to have an
intuitive conversation rather than
interface navigation now if done poorly
a system this powerful and this variable
can go left kind of hard
Microsoft learned that in an early
demonstration of their chat bot
technology if done right however brands
retailers information sources will find
that they can have thousands even
millions of conversations at once with
all manner of consumers and present a
consistent portrayal of themselves
without all the vagaries that we now
have in sort of the tired triad of join
us in the social conversation down
have to go with your 900 others or call
or see one of our reps who are very
likely unevenly trained in many ways the
chatbot is about creating one essence of
a brand or entity not millions of
fragments of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
