but what if you have luggage that won't
lose you this is the CX one it's a piece
of self-driving luggage it has camera
sensors on it to follow you wherever you
go
this carry-on luggage is made by a
company called forward X robotics I took
it for a spin and it did a pretty good
job of following me wherever I went so
this is what the luggage is seen with
its camera it has self-driving
technology to be able to track the owner
wherever he or she may go but if you go
out of range out of the camera it can
still find you with the help of a
connected wristband
now it's smart enough to use facial
recognition so it shouldn't start
following someone else I hope it has
four-wheel drive with a max speed of
seven miles an hour this is only an
early demo but the company plans to
launch this luggage sometime in the year
the company isn't ready yet to share
details on pricing but if you're
interested in having some baggage that
you just can't escape well stay tuned
for more details I'm Bridget Carey for
