podcast i'm veronica belmont and i'm
james kim and this is a very special
edition of the Cray video podcast where
we check out what we crave for the
holiday season yeah a lot of times we
talk about stuff that's kind of weird or
at landish or doesn't exist yet but this
is the stuff that we wouldn't mind
getting a nice little boxes right during
the holidays you start off what do you
want I want to see I want an apple 30
interested in my display oh who doesn't
okay they're just gorgeous see that you
have expensive taste would be so weak
yes Apple okay I like that speaking of
Apple I know that we crossed over on the
macbook pro right we both want a brand
new Mecca yes what size do you want I
want this I want the 12-inch but the
only thing you know they only have 15
inch and I have an old g4 powerbook the
reason I want this is because I want to
dual boot it and I want to run my zune
that is on this list to off of the
macbook you'd have to run it in boot
camp not parallels I know cuz you can't
use virtualization can I ask you about
that when I get there yeah okay so what
else you have on your list I would see
well other than that um oh I want a
rumba rumba we saw them at CES last year
and you know there's just the robot
vacuum very mainstream robots and they
have a version for pets I have two
kitties okay and so I want one that will
be able to get all the pet hair it's
like a hepa filter or something like I
don't know it does something okay that's
a really that's a very utilitarian a
gift in there yeah what I hope you get
it I I have the this is not a stocking
stuffer this is a 32 inch LCD from
Samsung this is to replace my 12-inch
vcr combo that's been sitting there
forever jvc nice thing it's going to be
get relegated down to the downstairs
dude room but yeah I mean with all these
new game consoles coming out with with
high-resolution DVD playback hinge 32
inch you know 32 it I don't want to take
them what do you have you have like a 48
inch haha alright well anyway I have on
married and I have two kids and blah
blah blah tuition and so gaming consoles
21 I want the weed because it's cheaper
and it's more of an excuse for my wife
because i'm going to buy it for my kid
I'm gonna go for the wii box oh you okay
I release the next box oh you have an
xbox 360 so I think it the next bundle
package of those two consoles is the
perfect holiday gift because it costs
about as much as a ps3
so you can get your HD content on the
xbox and your fun you know on a 50-inch
plasma gosh anyway we wish the next
thing on my list is a nikon d80 okay
which is a notch ESL very very good
camera d70 and i highly recommend i just
rolled down a flight of stairs other day
and it still works so well at least are
durable yes they're very durable they
are working out now it's great you're
getting you're gonna be happy with
hopefully you get that I have to really
begged I think it's done a thousand
dollars and then like you by the limit
yeah exactly so what I mentioned zune
earlier I want a zune it's probably the
most Arab approachable gift for me and
if you're watching uh mama I also want
them to go get up and what that also
that cool the speaker dock for it from
Octavio yeah I thoughts from Australia
it's like looks wicked looks like it
sounds great um I don't know we'll have
to see when we get it in well at least
yours is tangible and actually going to
be available because I want a new ipod
but I'm so paralyzed by the fear that
the second i buy an ipod a new one will
come out a week later that what i want
is the mystery i pod the best i pod it's
just going to come out and is going to
be there for like a year i'm not going
to make any upgrades to it and so i
won't have wasted my money okay someone
else's money that's what i call I vapor
pod anyway you can't wait to hear your
new year's resolutions but that's for
another show anyway we have a lot of
creditors who are showing off what they
want for the holiday season and visit
