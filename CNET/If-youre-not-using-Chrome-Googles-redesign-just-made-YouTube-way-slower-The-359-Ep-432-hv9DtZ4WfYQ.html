Dan Ackerman if you're watching this
video on YouTube and from a non Chrome
browser things could be loading real
slow for you please don't blame us for
that it turns out that a Google redesign
has made YouTube's load 5 times slower
on Firefox and edge at least according
to Chris Peterson a Mozilla Technical
Program Manager YouTube's redesign
relies on an API that's only found in
Chrome and it means it takes much longer
to load if you're not using it Peterson
recommended a firefox extension called
youtube classic that you could use to
fix the slow loading times but honestly
is there anything that roused people up
more than you know slow loading times
well it's it's this browser platform war
that's the next that's the next big
battleground and what years ago ie
versus you know Firefox and going even
back before that chrome was winning for
a long time but you know the guys who
make the hardware have an upper hand
here you buy a MacBook it comes with
Safari and that's it and if you buy a
Windows laptop or PC it comes with the
windows edge edia with IE buried
somewhere in there so do you think that
they did this on purpose though to get
more people to use Chrome I mean it's
already the most popular browser online
with like 59% web usage yeah wow that's
interesting cuz edge has a huge drsa
edge because you just buy a laptop and
if you don't know there are other
browsers you can get you just use that I
feel like most people use edge to
download chrome though that's listen
that's power users like us people who
have two or three new laptops a week
like me 100% but you know edge has
advantages to here's the thing we've
done a bunch of testing and if you're on
a Mac and you have Safari or if you're
on a Windows machine they have edge you
actually do get more efficient use of
your system and it could make your
battery life longer that said chrome is
generally speaking less annoying you
gotta treat that yeah so next up
Facebook finally launched watch party
its group watching feature that had
announced on f8 think about it like
watching live videos with friends that
you invited on messenger or just on
Facebook in general like being in a
living room watching jeopardy together
or football I remember doing something
similar to this but
for facebook my friends and I would just
be in a name chatroom watch wrestling
together on like Monday nights and then
just chat about it there I just feel
like this is kind of like the next step
on air I'm curious how many people would
actually use it we've got time for this
what are you talking about you're there
watching a video and they're in like a
chat room together yeah or are they in
like a multi video chat with all their
little teen heads in it I'm pretty sure
it's the first one which is exactly what
we're doing right now on YouTube right
but this one is like you invite your
friends only whereas like ours is like
live and a whole bunch people can come
to it be like if I only want it like me
you and Bryan to watch like the show
together which is kind of like what our
audience is already I will say to do to
put aside the snark for a minute
everyone is trying to capture one
particular scientific psychological
concept which is the social utility of
the shared experience and people are
trying to package that in different ways
and this is what we would call a remote
symmetrical experience so it's happening
in different places at the same time you
can have an asymmetrical you know remote
experience or you know it's like words
with friends for example as something
that happens at the same place but a
different time yeah you know with
different people
going to a museum together is a remote
is a symmetrical local experience
so finally Apple released a patch for
its MacBook Pro allowing it to go at its
full potential now there were reports of
heat issues leading to slow performances
which Apple acknowledged and supposedly
fixed with this bug now Dan you've taken
a look at this and yes yeah tell us more
about it you can see that's that's
what's not supposed to happen
that's the clock frequency and the
internal temperature that what that's
what is supposed to happen it's pretty
stable you're running a big video
rendering task of running a game
benchmark loop which is what we were
doing right there I've got the the new
core i9 MacBook right here and in our
initial testing we didn't notice this
issue
neither did Apple because our tests were
fairly sure they don't take a long time
run if you're rendering over to you for
an hour you were gonna get this crazy
up-and-down spike on these new ones
which is not good it basically means the
CPU thinks it's overheating clocks down
at speed to not be as good not run as
fast and
when it cools off it goes back up and
you get this crazy ping-pong it's
shocking that this got out the door from
Apple in this condition that it took
basically you know YouTube people and
and other people on reddit to like
notices was happening and they were the
first guys to win who went out and spent
four or five thousand dollars on these
and they're like what's happening here
Apple to their credit said you guys
found it we looked into it it was
actually just a little software bug that
was causing this happen here's a patch
that fixed it I downloaded the patch I
ran it again looks like it works okay
now so it wasn't really overheating it
just kind of thought it was but I
smashed up yeah well that's all the time
we have if you liked what you heard
check us out and see net i'm alfred ring
i'm still dan thanks for listening
over by minutes not bad we did a lot to
go over here if we cut out all the
everyone saying your name Tippi Todd
we'd have like seven more cents got a
right Claud but Dan we're still alive
and people want to know your name
because we get a lot of new viewers all
that zeti just case in point also stop
slouching III me yes camera I was
noticing why is this night different
from all other nights I am reclining
okay anyways jump into the chat take
your questions and comments about the
topics that we discussed today so Dan
what you're trying to say in summation
is spikes are bad in this particular
case yes you want your your machine to
act smooth and easy and and and just
like a gentle wave not like an
earthquake we're going by Sonic the
Hedgehog rules right now so yeah you
don't want that you land on a spike and
you lose all your goat rings not in
Sonic mania plus you don't what happens
when you land on a spike there if you
play as mighty the armadillo you bounce
house mighty neat I'm talking on Sonic
the Hedgehog is that's a completely
different game dude come on out a
completely different game come on get
with it you play enough smash you should
know Sonic mania I don't know who
armadillo man is out what is this a game
guy but you guys just lost me anyways so
let's talk a little bit more about the
max you seem to have a lot to say Dan I
definitely want to know more about it so
I'm confused you say that it thought it
was overheating so what exactly does
that mean
is that just it's reading something
wrong right missing there was a missing
a bit of software a missing key in a
driver somewhere that that made the
Machine feel like it had to clock down
the frequency speed of the processor
even the super high end core I nine
processors to bring the system
temperature down at which point it would
go oh the temperatures down I can go
back to being full speed again and it
would go back up and go all I'm too I'm
too hot I got to cool down again and
we'd go back down again and that's why
you had that spike
in reality at first glance when people
started to notice this one guy put a you
know said this is crazy
he did a YouTube video where he put the
MacBook in a freezer and there it ran
more evenly and people thought you know
what this is the first time we're seeing
this Intel Core I 9 there's six core
processor in the same back Book Pro
that's not any thicker doesn't have any
extra fans or anything it's made of
aluminum maybe they doesn't have
adequate cooling and they just shoved
too much processor into a very thin
aluminum body and it's just overheating
and that is a huge huge huge design flaw
and we can't believe that that would
happen but it was now that's the worst
case yeah it turns out that does not
seem to have been the case that's what
people were panicking about the reality
is still very bad but it's not unfixable
the reality is that there is adequate
cooling as far as we can tell for this
core I nine so far but there was a
software bug that caused it to freak out
and go faster slower faster slower
faster slower after you're doing
something like encoding the 4k video or
playing a doing of running a 3d game
benchmark for like you know 10 15
minutes 20 minutes and a half an hour
after a while it would go whoa I'm
freaking out man
freaking out what if it's just doing
high-intensity training though yeah
right like a lot of reps yeah it gets
stronger
so Apple said in rare form now usually
if something goes wrong with your Apple
product they may say you're using it
wrong you're holding the phone wrong
user error or or you know the keyboards
you should be using it John yeah we will
sell you a portable mini fridge but that
was not the case to their credit they
spent a weekend looking at it these
things just came out like July 12 13
something like that so people were just
starting to buy them and discover the
problem immediately so Apple to their
credit within a week or so said oh hey
we looked at it we found this software
problem we're fixing it it's a it's a
little download install it you're good
to go I did that I ran the same test
again the results went back to normal so
I am I am much more pleased now but it
is true
it should not have gotten to this point
and if you buy one of these at a store
now you're still gonna have to download
the update because they don't have new
configure you know they don't have the
new software build pre-built into this
yet you're gonna have to wait a couple
weeks for those to get into the retail
channel that's what I order one online
it'll probably have the patch that's
what I love doing whenever I spend
$4,000 on everything how do I fix it i
$24.99 for the 15 inch this
configuration with the core 9 and a 2
terabyte hard drive is like 4600 and
they go up to 6000 plus and they needed
an out-of-the-box patch yeah to do the
kind of stuff that if you're the guy
who's buying this that's the stuff
you're doing you're shooting in 4k or
higher resolutions and you're rendering
it down you're encoding and you're doing
all kinds of crazy stuff that's where
this bug kicked in so clearly Apple
should have had a more intense set of
benchmark tests in their own lab to
discover this before the products yep do
we have any questions sir and Roy's call
and Dan out says uh playing running a 3d
game benchmark and I say if nice safe
Dan what did I say you originally said
playing and then you adjusted to running
to make it sound more professional I
will I will get over that so yeah APEC
says do we really think it's software or
they just didn't put enough inside to
properly cool the noodle that's what
that's what the issue was however now
I'm able to run it at very high you know
three gigahertz and above clock speeds
and the temperature remains you know
high 80s within within normal range even
when it was throttling the temperature
wasn't actually getting that high it
just kind of thuds the actual
temperature was not really that high it
may maybe hit 99 or 100 at Peaks but
that shouldn't know cause it to freak
out like that independently from Apple
the morning Apple released the patch a
few hours before some guy on reddit
stumbled across essentially what the
problem was and he had a software hack
to to adjust it all so he took a
different approach to it kind of a like
a like a side door into into tricking
the system to not fall for that false
impression that it needed to clock down
so so independent people came to this
conclusion is Apple what goes into your
high-performance test when you were
testing it out after we had our regular
testing and in Geekbench a sit a bench
and running some video encoding they
generally don't take half an hour or
more to do because we've got a lot of
things to do man and the same tests we
run on every laptop and they're usually
very reliable and tell us what's
happening and in this case this machine
scored fine before the patch and you
know we're like okay but when we found
out this was an issue we went back and
devised a quick test that would take
longer so we took a 4k video like an
ultra high-definition video and we
encoded it to open in QuickTime and that
conversion process took 15 you know plus
minutes and that definitely set off the
spike and then you know there are not a
lot of games or games with bench while
you can't run 3d mark on a Mac for
example we ran Tomb Raider which is a
cross-platform Mac PC game there's a
benchmark built-in that you can run and
then it will just keep going and it'll
just keep running over and over again
and we set everything to like super high
on that to really you know tax the
system and we let that run for a while
and that started spiking then I
downloaded the patch after it was
available about 1:00 p.m. Eastern
yesterday and I did the same test no
spikes and I think we had some images if
anybody really wants to see you can go
to seen it and find my article and
you'll you'll see the the before and
after first you'll see one illustration
that has the spiky 2018 next to the non
spiky 2017 core i7 MacBook Pro so same
model from last year core i7 did not
have that problem
that's one chart and then in the next
illustration I put the spiky 2018 pre
patch next to the spiky next to the non
spiky 2018 post patch look there we go
am i showing the right thing oh let's
see that is probably on the left it's
probably the 2017 there's a console
version remind you that on the left is -
2017 MacBook Pro see the clock speed
remains high doesn't move that much the
sips temperature is fine and on the
right side of the screen is the 2018 and
you can see it's freaking the fudge out
and that's not supposed to happen
now after I
to patch you'll see the next
illustration that is the spiky right
there on the left literally a brighter
image is after yeah I move that one over
as explained in the caption because you
know I'm not a I'm not a data info
graphic designer I just did this myself
and on the right is what happened after
I applied the patch much more
normal-looking performance that is again
what you would expect and look how high
it gets it gets it's hittin it so it's
peaking up to like four and change this
is a base clock speed of 2.9 gigahertz
in the quarry 9 which is the same 2.9
that's in the core i7 but again it can
you can spike higher and it's a 6 core
chip instead of a quad core chip
extremely helpful thank you Dan I'd do
my best
let's fly through some more questions
from APEC here we go do we really think
it's software or oh I'm sorry I read
that one isn't it still not reaching its
full core potential clock speed even
after the update and does it still
bottleneck mmm that's a good question in
our initial tests ad seems like it's
doing pretty good you saw it it was it
was it was going up too it was hitting
peaks above above 4 gigahertz I don't
have any other coin 9 systems to compare
it to yet that's still a very new chip I
actually have just unboxed one it's an
Acer predator gaming laptop that has a
core i9 so we're gonna see what that one
can do and that's a much bigger system
with gigantic fans and it's huge and you
turn it on and go you know cuz it's
cooling itself cuz it's a gaming laptop
and we'll test that one to stay tuned
from maniac 618 did the test after the
patch speed up or stay the same I think
we kind of just covered that we now this
just happened yesterday so we were
mostly looking at what the clock speed
did and what the system temperature did
however we went back and rear and our
official test and we did not notice a
difference got it from CERN dragon how
is the color profile on the screen
what's the accuracy percentage um that
is a good question I'm gonna have to get
back to you on that however the screen
is different from previous MacBook Pro
screens and that it is a true tone
screen which means it's got the same
true tone technology built in that you
find on the iPhone
and the iPads which means it's got a
little light sensor somewhere in there
that adjusts the screen color
temperature basically the the white
balance level to what's around you so if
you're in a room with cold lights like
this it'll be bluer if you're in a
warmer lit room it'll be it'll look a
little warmer a little more yellowish
the theory behind that is especially if
you're a designer or something you want
the colors that you see on the screen to
match what you're seeing around you in
the world the difference is subtle if
you go back and look at the video for
the 15-inch MacBook Pro that we did we
do a little demo of that turning the
true tone off and on it's subtle but
it's there would you recommend buying a
new eye 9 if somebody already has the
2017 set up no no okay
okay buy anything ever now yeah wait let
me do another now is the software patch
for the macbook actually similar to the
mitigation for the battery issue on the
iPhone um
don't know I'm pretty sure it's
different like those are two different
yeah this this is like literally missing
a little warning sign that says it was
missing something that basically made
the CPU think it needed to throttle down
when it didn't yeah different but we
live in a world of patches we have in
the world of day one patches that's a
good video game analogy any game you buy
now has a day one patch you put the you
get whatever got well you get a console
game yeah a PC game whatever it is day
one does a giant patch for it already
because they they go to press with it
and it's still not ready and they're
cute and they keep working on it it's
good in a way because you get a better
product in the end but it's bad in a way
because it teaches companies that they
can ship incomplete products yes a
overall that's there's no good to that
whatsoever let's move on to YouTube from
Josh Moya do you think that the YouTube
slowdown was deliberate or just an issue
that Google actually wholesomely
honestly did not notice and are they
promising you know the story better than
I do are they promising to fix it they
haven't responded to our request for
comments they've responded to anybody's
and I I can't believe they would stay
silent on
they did I have not found it but I it
can't be like don't that but that's a
huge that that's why people have
antitrust issues yeah but the other
thing is like it's crazy to me that they
would do this whole redesign and not
consider people on other browsers you
know like like oh we put this like API
in Chrome but oh wait we completely
forgot about you forgot to test it just
like Apple forgot to test the MacBook
rendering like an hour long you know 4k
video or 5k video or higher or certainly
not
maybe there's a rush to put products out
there and and not enough time for
testing which is dare I say why I'm so
you know happy to be working here with
this great group of people that we have
here where we dedicate the time and
effort and manpower to performance
testing and other kinds of testing on
all kinds of products whether it's
televisions or computers or phones we're
one of the only organizations that
actually has you know dedicated testing
and product review teams and you know
when people say why is it important that
you do that well this is why it's
important yeah either this was done on
purpose or this was an incredibly stupid
oversight on on their behalf as in terms
of the readers they'll never you'll
never catch them saying they did it on
purpose unless Michael Kohn as their
lawyer and he taped it woof
okay so we're running out of time let's
go back to the YouTube issue again from
Joel gee here's a great point to be made
we talked about comparing chrome to
Firefox because they are the top
contenders out there as far as browsers
go hey edge is also a browser well
that's the point that we're gonna make
here the edge is still used by millions
is not terrible it's not terrible
Internet Explorer is poor B etter in the
chat says I can't get my Internet
Explorer on YouTube anymore that's a
great video no not not really a problem
for the YouTube issue does this only
impact non chromium based browsers this
is from Joel
they say that they use Vivaldi by the
opportune Minette uses chromium and
they're not seeing any slowdown that
would be the end yeah so the redesign
with YouTube basically it relies on an
on an API that's only implemented in
Chrome which I assume would include
chromium so yeah this really only
applies
- you know non chromium browsers alright
to round things out let's talk a little
bit about this Facebook watch thing APEC
recalls back to when Xbox had group
watch for Netflix and other movies that
was my favorite thing really even oh I
used to love that because I have so many
friends that are still upstate hence all
the Buffalo paraphernalia around me and
we would get on a wonderful life we
would get on Netflix to catch up and put
on a movie and just yell at each other
like we strongly do on the couch at
college and I even like the fact it was
it was so lame it's such an aesthetic
stupid lame thing but they had the
little avatars in front of the screen
that looked like mr. science I like okay
I admit I like that I do more live
tweeting with people while they're on
that's more my you're accomplishing
basically the same with the head of a
closed circle now though it's like same
thing with what was going on with Xbox
we're on Twitter that lets like
everybody like you you have to you know
everyone's input on bachelor whereas on
something like watch party or what was
available with Xbox like it's just like
you and your friends you can like you
don't have to care about like what some
random pops up all the productive things
these people could be doing instead has
anyone tried reading a book book party
mm-hmm book club we should have one of
those and and I will say to clarify uh
Brian III probably was more bougie I
lived in Amherst that's fine but
everybody likes to watch a movie once in
a while yeah just without other people
get gakuen in my ear that wasn't the
point this was more like a group fun
idea but anyways
Burton Ltd says the problem with
Facebook watch party is that it's only
videos that are on Facebook which is
never anything you want to watch apart
from short clips if ya up your upload
your own videos that would be great I
would agree that they should partner out
to other streaming services like a
YouTube or Netflix or Hulu or any other
place that actually has good video
content yeah that's a good point I think
the goal is for them to you know build
more content like they they had all
their new hub for original shows called
like Facebook watch there's no content
on there that I'd seen that's like worth
watching right now like one of them that
I see shared on my Facebook feed a lot
is um what's that show that was on MTV
like Rob died Rick or whatever where
it's basically tosh point-o but not tosh
point-o and he just takes viral clips
from the internet and like that's it's a
stream of a horrible confession to make
I don't think you should do it on this
show I'm gonna do it anyway because you
mentioned it
my guiltiest of guilty pleasures in
terms of media is is tosh point-o i
cannot get enough of that show it is the
exact opposite of every other type of
media i consume i love it it's just i be
populations of he's so funny it's
america's funniest also wrong yeah i'm
like oh let's see what's on PBS Oh tosh
point-o let's go it's on PBS now you
heard here first folks Dan Ackerman has
a guilty pleasure oh my god it's it's uh
my other by out my other guilty pleasure
was the league on FX I don't think
that's much of a guilty pleasure a lot
of people find the league very
stimulating if I watch it on something
when it became a draftkings commercial
yeah I know right
yeah we got any more questions just to
break topic real quick sir enjoys asking
dan last episode you were on you praised
the HP EliteBook any recommendation of a
high-end elite book but not mad costly
is the elite book folio worthy um that's
a good question I got it I I have to
remember back that must have been a
couple of appearances ago I mean it's
still a good line but I don't I don't
recall the top of my head what they have
going on right now
here's another last-minute question to
just kind of pass through from APEC and
this is an interesting thought and since
we talked about how Facebook's become so
video obsessed and how pretty much I've
read these video of says we shouldn't
isolate Facebook in this but now that
they're watching this group party do we
think Facebook's gonna go down the
premium service line and start allowing
for paid rentals mm-hmm like an HBO type
thing yeah or or or YouTube where you
could buy movies on there they're right
they're all pretty much doing this now
Google Play yeah yeah we're a for
premium and prime
I wonder that's not that doesn't seem
like it's that far off or incorporate
the services within it like you guys had
a grade you guys kind of hinted out a
great idea which is if you're a Netflix
subscriber and your friends are Netflix
subscribers you can you can cast a video
within a Netflix movie within Facebook
and all watch it together I think
Facebook is going to stay - it's like
free model for a while now because like
instead of charging you to watch this
show they could probably charge
advertisers and like once they build up
it's about if I work like that couldn't
you share something on Spotify easily
and listen to it together from thinks oh
yeah but like that paid for that though
I mean let's say pay for Spotify yeah if
you had that just for Forbes that was
back when Spotify was still kind of
trying to build a name for yourself what
was the one where you could DJ for other
people like DJ and I used that way
before that there was a great one where
you just go in and you'd like DJ for
like a roomful of people online I
totally remember what you're talking
about it was essentially the great
granddaddy of plug Dada yeah it was
blind identical yeah and I was crushed
when that went away yes all the time
rocking my rocking my rare groove I did
like plug DJ though I use that in
college a lot it by all means in
purposes it's the exact same thing okay
to my recollection but we are out of
time we are not gonna be on tomorrow we
are not going to be on Monday but you
