fan well my friends you are in for a
real treat I have in my hands the
long-awaited follow-up to the HTC one
called the HTC One m8 this luxurious
handset is the company's latest flagship
device for 2014 hi guys I'm Brian
Bennett for seen it and I can
emphatically say that the m8 is the
classiest smartphone I've seen all year
that includes some seriously
good-looking products like the samsung
galaxy s5 and Sony Xperia z2 so what
makes the m8 so sexy a whole heck of a
lot like its predecessor the One m8
flaunts a slick aluminium unibody
chassis HTC also polished the bezel the
edges around the screen to glint and
reflect ambient light to catch your eye
as you rotate it
HTC expanded the screen dimensions to
bringing the One m8 LCD display to five
inches across up from the old ones 4.7
inch screen
despite the phone's larger display
though the device remains roughly the
same size thickness and weight
understandably it stands a little taller
but the m8 stereo speakers which bracket
the bigger screen pack more of an audio
wallop to HTC claims these improve boom
sound speakers offer 20% higher volume
plus a greater frequency range which
should translate into deeper richer
audio the m8 also has a sharper 5
megapixel front-facing camera for better
selfies complimenting the phone's 16
gigabytes or 32 gigabytes of internal
memory you'll be glad to know that the
One m8 has a micro SD card expansion
slot - it's a feature the old HTC one
lacked the One m8 still has an IR
blaster but instead of the HTC One whose
power button doubled as its infrared
emitter the m8 conceals it under a dark
plastic band on its top edge this
coupled with HTC's TV app let you use
the phone as a universal remote for
example it will command HD TVs cable or
satellite boxes plus home theater
receivers simultaneously you can also
set the app to alert you when your
favorite programs are on the air and
fire everything up to the
right Channel with one finger tap the
real star of the HTC One m8 show though
is its distinctive to a lens camera
system on back you find not one but two
lenses and dual LED flash connected to
what HTC calls a four megapixel ultra
pixel sensor the smaller lens senses
distance and depth with this data the
camera app lets you do all sorts of wild
photo editing tricks the coolest is
something called u Focus which gives the
m8 light sure like depth of field
effects once you've taken an image you
focus lets you pick a point in the photo
to keep and focus once selected the app
either blurs the background or the
foreground the foreground ur function
applies special filters to the
background like simulated pencil sketch
marks motion blurring even animated
objects to indicate the changing of the
seasons a 3d effect warps pictures as
well to lend them cartoon like depth
which you can alter by tilting the phone
aside from that you get a bucketload of
shooting modes such as night HDR sweep
panorama plus manual camera settings for
just about everything the old HTC One
Zoe engine is here too
that means the phone's gallery app
groups images and video by events plus
smashes them up into highlight reels
with canned themes and music
automatically running Android 4-4-2 Kit
Kat the HTC One m8 also features the
company's latest Sense 6 custom
interface along with a cleaner look and
flatter icons since 6 has new gesture
controls as well you can pick up the
phone then double tap the screen to wake
it up without touching the power button
likewise you can fire up the camera by
turning the device horizontally and
pressing down the volume button the
blinkfeed news aggregator is back as
well it's been revamped a bit though to
let you choose custom topics and pull in
notifications from third-party apps and
services powering the device is a
state-of-the-art 2.3 gigahertz quad-core
snapdragon 801 processor along with 2
gigabytes of RAM that makes the m8
snappy and very responsive now there are
a few things about the HTC One m8 that
I'm not crazy about I know this might
sound trivial but for some reason the
back of the phone feels smoother and
more slippery than the first
HTC one also the mas polished bezel
lacks the same flash and reflective
Sparkle as the previous one other than
that the m8 looks to be one mighty fine
smartphone
I'm Brian Bennett for CNN we've just
taken a first look at the HTC One m8</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
