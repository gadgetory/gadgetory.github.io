Google issues for everything google that
we can pack inside of a show let's jump
into it in the big news this week starts
from nest Google's division for
connected home products now they
announced their new nest cam which is
the newest iteration from their Dropcam
acquisition it's a 1080p resolution 130
degree field of view camera with
infrared night vision and a new nest
aware cloud service to save your
recordings and it works with a new nest
app to watch the video stream from
anywhere and come on who wouldn't want a
camera owned by google in your home
watching 24 7 i'm only kidding just a
little bit but i'm just glad these
things didn't exist when I was a
teenager because yeah this sucks for you
all now they also announced their second
generation nest protect smoke detector
but there were no new updates to the
nest thermostat nest also released this
general video about smart home
automation the video features things
like lights fans doors and kitchen
products rumors have already pointed to
nest working on sprinkler management and
front door security products so it could
be a hint at other areas they're
focusing on in the future now in the
mobile space the information reports
that Google secretly bought the app
streaming startup agha we late last year
but it wasn't reported until this week a
Ghawi stands for any game anywhere
instantly and think of it like the
netflix of apps where users can stream
games and apps to their phone without
having to download them first this could
allow people to try apps before buying
them and agha we can also stream windows
pc games to android iOS or connected tvs
now they say it's still at least a year
or more out according to the report so
we'll see how this gets implemented down
the road plus more details about the 1+2
phone have been trickling out thanks to
their website and I mean trickle because
they announced them one by one just what
everyone wants for an upcoming phone but
the latest is that the phone will use
qualcomm snapdragon 810 processor and it
will be version 2.1 of the chipset that
they collaborated with qualcomm
engineers to fine tune for the oneplus 2
now according to them the overheating
issues that have plagued the 810
won't be affecting the latest phone it's
also confirmed the oneplus 2 will cost
more than three hundred and twenty two
dollars due to the increased price of
the chipset but they didn't give an
exact retail price because why would
they do that that's for another day and
yes you still need an invite to get this
phone when it releases all right android
wear 5.1 point one is finally rolling
out to the motorola 360 with an
over-the-air update to get some of the
new features like flicking your wrist to
see notifications or drawing emojis oh
also mobile gamers samsung is rolling
out their game recorder plus app on some
of their devices it's an app that can
record your screen up to 1080p full
resolution with a floating UI that
record your face and let you record game
commentary over it and it can be edited
afterwards it's pretty slick now it's
available for the s6 s6 edge galaxy s5
s4 and the note for note 3 and note 2
and the biggest news of the week twitter
is testing out something that could
change the course of history yes they've
used the android app to test out new
ideas in the past and this one is a
biggie they're experimenting with
changing the favorite star icon with a
heart stars are now hearts believe that
alright that's going to do for this
week's show you can always email us at
google licious at cnet com or tweet me
