also tells you the weather lets you set
a timer or even play a game of blackjack
vector is from the makers of the cosmo
toy robot so it's no surprise they look
related and yes vector is a heat
according to his creators unlike cosmo
vector is fully autonomous so you don't
need your phone to play the idea is that
vector lives on the kitchen counter all
rolls around your home it's a virtual
assistant and cute companion in one with
a color IPS display to show how his
feeling and a touch sensor on the back
if you say hey vector take a photo of me
he works out the best framing and takes
a shot soon he'll get a messaging
feature so when he sees a face he
recognizes he delivers a message for
kids you could set it up so vector rolls
up and says hey you didn't clean your
room when they get home from school a
range of sensors stops vector from
rolling off a table and it can also map
out spaces for microphones detect the
direction of who's talking so if you say
hey vector come here it works out where
you are and moves towards you even
though the robot is connected to the
cloud Anke says the photos never leave
your device and voice data is never
stored vector is 249 dollars which isn't
exactly cheap but it is a lot more
affordable than many other much bigger
robots for the home like buddy or misty
at launch it will have around 100 to 150
responses but this will grow and Anki is
planning to push out updates every month
if you want to get your hands on one
vector will also be available on
Kickstarter for a discounted price of
199 dollars shipping in October like its
older sibling Cosmo and SDK will be
available in early 2019 Siri code vector
