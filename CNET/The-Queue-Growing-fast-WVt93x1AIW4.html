restaurant on Google Maps others show

two-year contract last week google gave
us street views on their maps and it
didn't take very long for savvy web
surfers to find the best candid shots
there are now websites listing links to
the interesting sightings including a
guy with an impromptu porta potty a
dogfight in the park sunbathers a
woman's who is wondering why we are
camera-equipped cars taking pictures of
her lowriders speeding cars and accident
being narrowly avoided and you thought
Google having your search history was
scary how exciting is it when you decide
to buy that brand new electronics item
and you can't wait to get it home to
tear it open then you find out it's an
empty box true story according to Terry
Heaton he says he visited a compusa
liquidation sale and bought 3500 bucks
worth of stuff including a 269 dollar
digital camera box it didn't realize
until he got home and the comp says it's
his problem since all sales were final
buyer beware make sure the product is in
the box before you buy it especially if
it's an open item remember realplayer
from the company that pioneered Web
Audio their latest player will have a
feature that lets you download video
from popular websites it's an annoying
issue and you like what you see but
there's no way to save the video now the
new real player will add a right click
download function to your browser so you
can save video in various formats
including real Windows Media flash and
QuickTime once you have the video you
can watch it offline or you can burn it
to CD or DVD now won't download
protected video like TV show clips on
the network site with the new player
launches at the end of June and it is
free finally the site having a web
address on a t-shirt is like so last
year now it's time for a text messaging
call to action and react ich will help
you get it the site lets you make a
custom shirt with a message and a text
keyword when someone sees your shirt
they can text message your keyword to
41411 and then get a response that you
pre program you can change the auto
response at any time and subscribers if
they decide to sign up to your alerts

like sending one out
