hundred dollar in ear headphone called
the super buds these are from nht a
company known for making quality
speakers and they come with their own
cannabis themed packaging though they
don't include any smoking related
accessories coupons to your local
marijuana dispensary know except for the
artwork on their box the headphones are
drug free and look like your typical
earphones albeit ones with aluminum clad
housings they seem well-built and while
they wait a little more than your
standard plastic in your headphones
they're comfortable to wear and fit
snugly and by that I mean they offer a
tight seal and good noise isolation
I like the braided shoelace like cord
and the headphones are equipped with a
one-button inline a remote and
microphone that allows you to answer and
end calls and both pause and skip audio
tracks forward and back on iOS and
Android devices the remote has no volume
controls however as far as sound goes
the super buds may not be the most
accurate sounding in-ear headphones but
the bass is big and fat without being
overpowering it helps that the lows are
balanced by a sweep mid-range and
forgiving treble so harsh sounding mp3s
go down nice and easy this headphone
isn't highly detailed but the stereo
imaging is admirably open and it really
shined with electronica EDM and any bass
centric music all in all it's a good
value and well worth a long look
particularly if you are someone who
listen to a lot of bass centric music
I'm David Carr noise those are the nht
super buds thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
