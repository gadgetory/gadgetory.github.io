is actually a sports car but the nissan
motor sports division created a Nismo
version of this car and then they went
and created that Nismo RS version and
that's what we have here today either
the mismo Division that Nissan has gone
crazy or some people like to drive the
Juke is really fast
the Duke is undeniably a funky looking
little car it's got very strange
lighting in front we've got these slash
blinker lights on top of the fenders
we've got round halogen headlights in
front and then we have strips of white
LEDs below that it's a crazy mix of
stuff but I really like it they only
come in black white or silver and we get
these red mirror caps to really
accentuate the look they also set a
little lower than the standard juke for
better handling and aerodynamics and we
also get these 18-inch wheels standard
the Nismo RS comes in either front-wheel
drive or all-wheel drive version but
Nissan gives you kind of a hard choice
at that point the front wheel drive
version only comes with a six-speed
manual transmission and the
all-wheel-drive version which has a
pretty cool torque vectoring system only
comes with the continuously variable
transmission in automatic Recaro seats
come standard with the Nismo RS version
of the Juke and I sort of hate these
seats these will keep you in place if
you're ripping around the corners but
it's just so tough to get your butt over
these bolsters it's not entirely
comfortable and I wouldn't want to do it
every day up in the dashboard here we
have basically a double din head unit
this is the Nissan navigation package
it's pretty good this is a really small
screen though it's a 5.8 inch
touchscreen but the navigation system is
pretty good one thing I like about it is
it proactively reads out traffic
problems on the road ahead of you even
if you don't have a route programmed in
the really cool thing about this head
unit this actually comes with
nissanconnect so I've got my phone
plugged into the USB port down here
psiphon and it's running the
nissanconnect the app they also have it
for Android so with a nissanconnect app
running on my phone I can hit this apps
screen over here and I have to hit a my
apps but then if I want to do online
search for a destination I just have
this online search button wait for it to
come up so I can enter any search term I
want here I'll just throw in CBS and it
goes out to Google searches for results
gives me CBS Interactive that's our
local headquarters here and once I hit
that button then it shows me the address
the phone number I could
have it make a call through the
Bluetooth hands-free phone system where
I hit the start button that throws it
into the navigation system now you
notice I went through a lot of steps to
get there I really wish they would put
this app kind of in the main navigation
menu so I could find it a lot quicker
and get my destinations programmed a lot
faster but now let me show you the true
magic of the Nissan Juke so down here
I've got the screen showing climate
control and I can change the temperature
of course and change some of the
settings here but if I push this D mode
button suddenly I get Drive settings so
this is fairly unique for a car in the
segment you get a lot of control over
how this car drives right now it's a
normal it's showing the torque curve on
the screen here not really gonna be
looking at that while I'm driving I put
it in Eco and it gives me this Eco
screen my eco score for how efficiently
I'm driving now when I hit the sport but
and that's what I really want to do in
the Nismo RS I get this thing showing my
turbo boost and it also changes the
accelerator profile to a sport setting
so it's a lot more sensitive I get a lot
more power with just a little touch on
the gas pedal and it also changes the
steering program to a sport program so
the steering suddenly becomes heavier
more responsive and that's something you
don't really find too often on many cars
today and certainly not in cars in the
segment so I really like that part of it
all right really test the Nissan Juke
Nismo RS I brought up to a windy road
this is the Stars natural element so I
got a nice tight corner here coming
around told us nicely I can feel that
front wheels dig it in it's actually got
a limited slip differential on the front
wheels but let me talk a little about
the engine the whole point of the Nismo
RS is that Nissan Motor Sports Group has
taken this engine 1.6 liter
four-cylinder turbocharged
direct-injection
and got the horsepower up to 215 they've
got the torque of the 210 pound feet
amazingly good numbers for that small of
an engine for fuel economy with this
engine it's rated 25 miles per gallon
city 31 miles per gallon highway that's
a certainly decent fuel economy
searching for a car that's really this
fun all right let's price out our 2014
Nissan Juke Nismo RS base price for this
model is 26,000 $120 navigation package
cost $1,200 and with destination our
total prices is 28 130 that's a pretty
high price for this car
and personally I would go with the
standard Nismo model that doesn't have
these annoying Recaro seats shaves about
$3,000 off not as powerful but still a
fun car handles really well that's the
one I would get
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
