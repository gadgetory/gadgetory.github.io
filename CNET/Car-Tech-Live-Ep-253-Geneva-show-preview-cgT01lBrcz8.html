Nissan add a new Fiat meanwhile Land
Rover makes the book go topless these
cars and more in our geneva auto show
preview that's right folks on this car
tech live march first 2012 we are going
to be talking geneva auto show which
happens next week yes I'm really looking
forward to this not not only for the
free trip Switzerland but definitely
there there have been some interesting
cars that have been popping up over this
last week especially there's a lot of
cars that we've been seeing we you know
every car company usually releases a few
photos or some sketches or some kind of
indication of what they're going to be
showing at Geneva but well the big one
of course anytime there's a new Ferrari
everybody goes crazy except for like no
one seemed to really care about the
California really i mean i like the FF
but yeah the FF did it didn't have as
much impact it didn't seem in the good
the California can't get excited own it
it's the porsche boxster of Ferraris the
California is but what we're talking
about right now is yesterday morning
actually Ferrari unveiled on their own
website the new f12 berlinetta one long
alphanumeric mess of a name but it's
basically their 599 replacement and it
is the most powerful the fastest Ferrari
that they've ever built is more powerful
even than the 599 double X the race
special that last week we said there's
no way possible they'd match that
because this one output 740 horsepower
wow so that's just 700 they get it 740
Italian I don't know is nothing Italian
something something to tell you I don't
know if they basically have their they
got the engines really light the I guess
they're using a lot of the same
technology that they were using in the
59 XX but then with the new v12 engine I
think that they've kind of debuted on
the on the FF that we just mentioned
right they'll be using the direct
injection and that which they've been
using in their most recent cars to pump
up the horsepower that
more efficiency but no turbos in this
thing now now all naturally aspirated
right that's a classic Ferrari if you
got 12 cylinders and you really need a
turbo yeah what's a displacement on the
6.2 6.3 liters it's in between there
depends on how far i choose to round
that but it's like sixty two hundred
some-odd feces Wow it's impressive that
they can get that much horsepower out of
this car yeah well I mean it's it's an
f1 kind of thing you know it's a it
probably makes a very f1e noise the red
lines pretty lofty the interesting thing
here also is that it's putting out
somewhere in the neighborhood of five
hundred and some-odd pound-feet of
torque lost the number in there a little
more horsepower a lot more horsepower
than pork yeah which basically kind of
lets you know that that all that horse I
mean the way that works when you see
that much more horsepower than torque
you know the red line is going to be
pretty high up yeah so yea high
compression engine I'm sure you have
this car looks looks I don't know i'm
not sure if it looks good yet it's
actually got some pretty distinct
features distinct contour lines i don't
even really like the side contour line
and this is of course seeing a photo and
lots of times you see a card person and
it's like totally different experience
yeah i mean it's actually looking more
like a rendering i'm pretty sure that
this this was have been heavily dr. to
kind of bring those those contour lines
to the to the forefront make them more
uh more and more work obvious i guess
someone someone mentioned that it looked
like a snake with wheels and i can't
unsee that now but yeah they've got some
interesting sort of uh they've even
though the engines in the front the
transmissions in the back kind of like
we were used to seeing in this class of
ferrari vehicle so they've got the
weight balance is biased towards the
rear by about six percent the the
vehicle overall is a couple hundred
pounds lighter than the 599 that goes
out and then they've also made it not
only slippery ER through the air it has
less a lower coefficient of drag but it
also generates about two hundred and
some-odd pounds more downforce so it
it's both generating more downforce and
generating less drag at the same time
and they do some very interesting things
to make that happen now they start with
this thing called an air bridge at the
front of the at the front of the vehicle
that kind of like pushes down on the
front of the vehicle but at the same
time brings the air up and over the body
so it reduces aerodynamic drag and also
reduces that sort of pocket of air that
you get is you behind the vehicle and
then they also have these active
shutters on the on the brake vents so
they they break Vince at the front of
the vehicle only open up when the brakes
are hot so you're not just like
generating aerodynamic drag cooling off
brakes that are already cool when you're
just blowing down the Autobahn for
example right and he says these contours
are probably mostly functional I imagine
that you know like when the Nissan GTR
came out they you know people comment on
some of the weird minds and that but
Nissan said hey every little bit was
designed for maximum arrow efficiency
and downforce and all this kind of stuff
so everything really worked right well I
mean there's probably definitely you
know they work with pininfarina to kind
of maintain the kind of style so it's
like they want similar proportions to
the 599 that's sort of like long hood
the passenger sit way in the back the
close to the center of the wheel well
they want that GT car sort of sort of
form factor so a lot of this is just
telling me I'm pretty sure those
headlights look that way because that's
the way for I wanted them to look yeah
but then yeah they also kind of brought
their own sort of design center in on
the design so that the the aerodynamic
things are they want it to happen are
also integrated in now what do you think
of the face of this car I'm going to
picture the front of it and it has a
very distinct face it's got a big wide
sort of grin little evil looking grin
and certainly the headlights make eyes I
mean they certainly have an eye look to
them well I mean I think you kind of hit
the nail on the head when you're talking
about the side and I mean my personal
opinion is that this is probably the
ugliest vehicle Ferraris ever built it
just it doesn't look good it just
doesn't that's competing with the 308
but yeah
not a good looking vehicle but I mean it
does it looks purposeful yeah man it
looks fast and who knows maybe it'll
grow on me when I see it in person maybe
nobody cares what I think because I
can't afford a Ferrari anyway so I'm not
really their target market well if you
can't afford a Ferrari then there may be
the BMW m6 which also will be a pretty
good performance car they have a new one
they just announced that's a little
while ago and this is also should be at
the show here this one so the 0 to 60
time with that Ferrari the new f12 is
what 3.1 seconds i think they said oh
yeah 3.10 262 yeah just take under 460
and the new m6 is 4.2 seconds so it's
pretty slow compared Ferrari but yeah so
this m6 is based on the new 6 series
which we actually have one in the garage
right now not the m6 but the new 6
series so it's got the same body lines
is that new one but also has the M stuff
like the kind of slightly bulging hood
and some of the other things they're
also boasting with this car though and I
don't think this is going to be the case
with the Ferrari with the m6 that
they're looking at an average fuel
economy about 24 miles per gallon yeah I
think I did the math on the Ferrari I
think it's like just under 20 highway
because they're saying it's thirty
percent more efficient than the old 599
so I went back and looked at the old 599
and added thirty percent to it yeah and
about 25 well this new m6 will have the
BMW z8 win scroll or a 4.4 liter engine
with two twin scroll turbo chargers
which gets a ton of power out of this
thing though this is like the the engine
on the m5 yeah it's sort of like four
Scrolls total exactly and that's you
know that's one thing that makes the the
new m6 somewhat less exciting because it
really has the same driveline the same
character or the same technology driving
technology as the m5 where the invite
was pretty exciting in and of itself and
if you don't want a sedan the the m6
definitely looks better than the last
generation of m6 even though i still
take
she with the rear end of it um but I
mean if you if you want that sort of
like m5 vehicle but you just can't live
with the idea of two more doors get an
orange m6 right it's like the m5 oh that
that's for family man oh yeah I want a
race car I want left Headroom of course
they also make the m6 in a convertible
for you if you want that which
convertible m cars make me roll my I
just you yeah how can you got an odd I'm
sure this will be a stellar performer
although like most of the the Big M cars
like this using them on the road is all
is such a waste because when you're just
driving around on public roads you you
use maybe ten percent of the potential
well as I understand the new m5 is
really comfortable though oh yeah even
if you're not using that potential that
that trip to the track right is really
nice yeah then once you get it on the
track you can blow you can rip up your
tires have you seen all those videos on
YouTube comparing the the m5 to the GTR
Oh No there's like all these videos on
YouTube popping up where it's just like
putting them hit the head and it's just
if pure linkbait as if the cards do not
belong in the same class for the money
that i think i'd buy the m5 yeah
interesting that well sir I mean I think
if you my my rationale is the GTR is
definitely a faster car but I think you
pick up more chicks with the m5 right
everybody look at the GTR do I like it
fell out of an anime yeah you must be
one of those nerdy car guys and when
somebody rides in the passenger seat
there going like let's take my car
instead really rough let's take my jetta
instead on the comfort mode yeah listen
to the premium audio system well that's
the dual personality nature of BMWs I'm
always so impressed with those they they
have sure they have their they're
incredibly aggressive sport mode then
you turn to change a few buttons and
suddenly just like a drive through the
country yeah just like me haha just like
me just like you let's take it down a
notch to something a little more
pedestrian maybe okay mitsubishi there
uh that's a bit she has been kind of
crap crap but confused they've been a
very confused brand yeah they they've
been doing some weird things in the u.s.
you know watching different cars and
none of
really quite caught on although they do
have the I me which there you know was
this kind of opinion of their green
credentials and all of their Lancer
variants are interesting and by Lancer
variants I count the Outlanders right
yeah and then that's kind of big become
their their whole stocking guards I
think they still make the Eclipse but i
don't know why i think the eclipse I
think it's due to be discontinued yeah
but it's it I I mean the eclipses is a
classic case of oh how the mighty have
fallen yeah one of the the first real
you know performance cars that you can
get as a Japanese imports kind of become
a two-door gallant now and this horrible
right this set but the probably are
going to launch something new at Geneva
and they've just released a picture of
the front of this car it's it's got some
intriguing styling things and the idea
is that they're they're relaunching sort
of the brand in Europe is gonna my
takeaway from this mmm that they will
have a new line of cars they'll have new
technologies new stuff to show up maybe
you know hopefully a really cohesive
brand identity will come out of this or
they'll just start putting this news on
their letter variants that could be too
that might be the case it looks like
it's this very is a very SUV look to the
front end it does yeah so I mean I'm
guessing it's like some sort of
Outlander design steady yeah I think it
could be that and I also think they're
trying to maybe game more European
market share so whatever we see there
may not have any impact on the US market
you know hopefully I mean I love like to
see this company come up with some uh
you know a cohesive vision and stuff
like that do something kind of like he
and Hyundai have done and really you
know come out with new cars and new
exciting cars but you know we'll see
well they could like you know basically
kill the Eclipse wait a couple years and
bring it back awesome again that'd be
great a smaller Eclipse cuz the thing
got huge oh yeah bring back the
all-wheel drive system that used to be
optional it used to make it great and
the small turbocharged engine and they'd
have something to fight the ft-86 people
will start caring about mitsubishi again
and then from there they could go all I
mean I guess they've got the Lancer the
lancer evo kind of already is that yeah
although I hear they're gonna that mean
those rumors are going to discontinue
the evo well me there's rumors that
super is going to discontinue the WRX oh
I think we may we may start this may
actually be the beginning of the end for
those like you know 3 400 horsepower
all-wheel drive econo boxes which is too
bad plumbing because we've got this new
generation of veloster turbo and the
genesis coupe people are starting to be
more interested in real lightweight rear
wheel drive vehicle so the genesis coupe
turbo and the end the the toyota and
subaru ft-86 colognes are probably going
to fill in that space right but i also
more efficient yeah but I think Anton
mitsubishi Antoine is just giving you
your prescription for success here that
was the yeah the new eclipse the Eclipse
back right you'll be whisked away to
Japan to design this new car I think
soon definitely I'm all over that nissan
is coming out with a new vehicle in
geneva this is actually a concept called
the invitation but it shows what looks
like a actually production level car
although i was like if in an alternate
reality nissan designed the fit yes this
is what it would look like and it
without a sense of scale this may be a
smaller car yeah because i think the
verse is about the same size of the fit
and i don't really know if this is going
to replace the Versa cuz it couldnt the
verse that just came out right yeah I
don't think this will replace the verse
I believe this does look like it might
be smaller because if you look at where
the rear doors they come all the way
back there's not much cargo area behind
their right and this is sort of a very
European thing to have you can either
have rear seats or you can have cargo
space but you know you can't really have
both those would be like fiat 500 sighs
yeah could be that would be nice
actually a really cool like tiny city
car that that sort of uh that class of
vehicle is really hot right now yeah and
I like the look of this design you know
again a concept but it does show some
some nice lines and all that
and you know it'd be great to see Nissan
actually come up with a coherent design
language to get the same thing as all of
their cars look like they were just
designed by reaching into a box of
design cues and pulling them out blindly
right everything's different
everything's I think yeah they're just
you can't really there's no brand
identity this is the problem here you
look at you know three different
Nissan's and it's like is that from the
same company this kind of has some like
Nissan Quest sort of things happening on
the front and as much as I don't like
the way the quest looks though that the
sort of trapezoidal grille and and in
you know the kind of the way that it
works with the lights do work better on
this smaller vehicle in my opinion yeah
yeah like the cut outside of the way the
girls would have cuts into the the
headlight space which is actually a cue
I've seen and some other design things
coming out recent like taking their
boomerang headlights and flipping them
yeah and then using that to kind of
mission with the grill so you know it's
some interesting things going on there
yeah and in a engine for this I would
assume they've got that 1.6 liter direct
injection they've been using in the Juke
which could show up in something like
this and give it great power actually
probably more power than something this
small really needs yeah definitely way
more than this car would probably ever
get to market with ya if it ever did get
to market let's take it down a notch
further well actually kind of up and
down a notch right this is the new Fiat
500l so Fiat is taking the the 500 which
they just launched in the u.s. recently
small city car and stretching it making
a bigger I'm so it's like the Fiat
clubman yes exactly the 11 club in all
it needs is the hospital doors in back
yeah this is probably still about the
same size as a regular Mini Cooper yeah
I mean it's gonna be small i think yet
it's probably not much bigger than the
standard 500 either but it does have
four doors and for headlights i just
realized that i looked at a picture like
20 times and i just realized that it's
got that sort of like dual hit like
Nissan Juke thing going on there that
that's you lookin yeah it's because
it mimics the look of the running the
guess those in the DRLs with the yeah
the actual headlights and it's also got
fog lights too so yeah just just like
the Juke there are way too many lights
out friday this is like those old Vespas
where you put like a ton of lights I you
know all over the front of them yeah
definitely so you can see and but they
really got like a Cooper thing going on
here with the black the black pillars a
contrast colour roof that makes it look
like exploding so it's definitely a very
Cooper alike in my opinion yeah the
question is do people want a larger 500
I don't think people have figured out
they actually want small five there are
people who want a tiny car um and if
they're looking at the Fiat 500s because
it's tiny uh I mean well I mean granted
the 500 is the only car that Fiat cells
in America right now so I mean at some
point they're going to have to add more
models to that line up and let you know
unless they just kind of want to be like
sion and only have like three or four
models and that's just it well I mean
kind of like mini that many is based
every car off their the original Mini
Cooper and they're just slightly longer
or slightly fatter or slightly I refuse
to count the country man is being based
off the original cover it's just it's
styled similarly but it did that
everything about that vehicle is just
completely different and weird well
let's sit in a second yeah we will get
back to that actually I don't know if
the 500l will come to the u.s. although
I'd imagine they do need to pump up that
line if the 500 proves successful it's
certainly successful in Europe right ah
toyota is actually showing off a couple
of new cars or previewed a couple cards
for geneva and we talked previously
about a new small hybrid which seems
like maybe a prius next gen kind of
thing but they've also got a car a fuel
cell car we haven't I heard about fuel
cells in a little while this is the
reason the FC v dash are the R stands
for racing yes I don't think that this
kind of has a somewhat Prius like
roofline but actually everything from
about the the front fender back looks
like a Prius right but then it's got the
strain
front hood thing going on which I don't
know almost looks like construction
equipment yeah I don't know what's going
on there it's I I don't even have the
words to describe it for the the audio
listeners it looks kind of like a whale
with a mustache yeah there's a little
bit of a boat's bow yeah yeah there's a
little bit of yeah baleen sort of whale
teeth down in some sections of weird
stuff going on pictures yeah they did
they haven't really said any specs for
this car but it is interesting that
they're saying we're still working on
fuel cell cars and I think they want
actually put the scar into production at
fuel cell car into production in 2015 so
I would assume that wouldn't be like
full-on production is it would just be
like some sort of like FCX Clarity least
type program yeah it might be a you know
fuel cell cars may be ready for
production by mid this decade what two
years from now yeah three years from now
I can't do math today they will uh you
know I mean I think there's going to be
some test plates out there maybe they'll
be on the same scale is like the
electric cars you know there's certainly
Nissan Leafs being sold but not in huge
quantity and not in every region another
story we have from Geneva this is kind
of cool is that Mercedes Benz this is
more of a text or emo of our kind of
thing mercedes-benz has announced that
for their new a-class they are going to
integrate the iphone for the
infotainment system and actually
integrate siri with it they're going to
have to integrate it well because if you
look at the picture they put the i
applied doc exactly where we hate it
yeah in the dual of compartment where
you can't actually do anything right if
when you ever get in the driver's seat
it's like you gotta reach way over plug
it in always bring someone with you yeah
then go like hey plug that in for me or
just have an iphone just dedicated to
being in the car you leave all the time
sicard the second data plan and all of
that but yeah like Nessa that one cool
thing about this though is that people
have found that trying to use Siri with
their current bluetooth hands-free
systems it doesn't always work because
Siri needs a little more direct
connection I guess right think the thing
is if your car has its own voice command
system and it doesn't defer to
do whatever the the regular phones voice
command system would be in any case then
theory can't jump in so it looks like
there are they just giving you an option
to choose to use their voice come in or
Siri it'd be nice if there was just a
switch you know or like an option in a
menu that you could kind of go to and go
like hey I got an iphone I want to use
Siri I don't really care about your
command voice command system yeah I
think I mean my takeaway on this is
there really basing this new
infotainment system in the a class which
is not a car they sell here although
they are thinking of selling it here
around the iphone and series so it I
mean and this is the kind of integration
that people have been saying like my
microphone is great I'd rather use that
for my infotainment system so why aren't
you giving that to me and I think they
are you know maybe going in that
direction and if that's something that
works in a class it could certainly work
in you know other other vehicles right
further further up maybe trickle up sort
of thing in its good exactly trickle
upwards so if they're putting that much
focus on the on the iphone this always
as an Android user this always annoys me
because it's just I understand the
iphone is a very popular phone it's
pretty easy to develop or because it's
constant but I can't help but think like
all right so something like a simple
switch that says I want to use my
phone's voice command system means that
not only are you given that option to
iPhone users you're also giving it to
Android users because there's a
perfectly good voice search or a number
of purply good voice search apps on the
android that can be accessed that exact
same way you'd be killing two birds with
one stone there same with windows mobile
but by developing specifically for the
iphone you're essentially saying to me
as a non iphone user well if you want to
use your phone in this car probably not
buy it yeah well I we prepared to like
work around whatever they've got in
place well there's certainly I mean I
found or talking to BMW for example who
develops mostly the most of their app
connections for iphone they're saying
you know we'd like to develop for
android but there's so many flavors and
everything and it's hard to get any sort
of standard out of it edge sounds like a
cop-out yeah
well yeah I mean they they'll come up
with something soon certainly and you
know if they get this voice yeah command
working well then if that could be
integrated well there's a lot of ways
this could go but let's move on to our
mini news from that will be at Geneva
yes I've just a second ago I voiced a
little bit of disdain for the mini
cooper countryman and now I get to
really kind of dive into that because
man is actually going to be debuting a
junk cooper works version of the
countryman at geneva this year and it is
the most powerful mini that they've I
guess ever made it help with 211
horsepower that's only three more
horsepower than a standard cooper
countryman i don't know how much just
the countryman weighs more than a
standard like cooper coupe but i don't
know if that 3 horsepower is enough to
make up for the weight difference so
they're actually cracking more power out
of that JCW system though this is a
four-cylinder twin-scroll turbo charged
engine so i don't know if this is
exactly the same one but i mean i think
yeah i assume so one point six liters
yeah it's got to be the same one maybe
it's slightly different turbo because
this has that over overboost function
that we saw on some BMWs where for a
brief moment your normal torque output
is 207 pound-feet at max but if you need
like a little bit of extra grunt for a
you know a passing maneuver for example
it can over boost the 221 so I think
there's a new turbo in this vehicle
right that is definitely a new new
version of the John Cooper Works system
so that that's pretty cool actually you
know the most interesting thing I could
take away from this is that eventually
that engine will find its way in a
proper mini but I mean this one this
other than that I mean this is pretty
much everything else you would expect
from a john cooper works just been Shin
tweaks a button that has sport on it you
know red all over the interior this also
has the all four wheel drive system so
this is the first all-wheel-drive John
Cooper Works vehicle ever also sounds
like a rally competitor to me
except for the fact that's only got 200
horsepower 211 horsepower which you need
a little more in rally I suppose well i
mean i think if not really yeah rally
cars it's kind of really more about
maintaining your speed and handling
that's your balls out power well that's
a one of the minis will be looking for
in geneva the other one is a concept
they show off recently they really some
photos for and i don't know if i'm going
to be too excited about looking for this
one lady divisive everything it's the
mini clubvan concept and they took a
they started off with a mini club man
and they changed the m2 a V 0 and then
they just call it a day right they also
would covered up the side windows in the
rear which is like like you could have
done that with a vinyl wrap it looks
like they did it with the vinyl wrap
yeah I mean maybe they just put some
boards over the windows or something i'm
pretty sure middle if they want to call
it a concept but i mean as concepts goes
it's pretty lazy yeah i think they still
have the the rear seat even they they
have the doors are in the same
configuration the doors are in the exact
same configuration is the club club man
and you know there's not a lot of room
in the back of the club club man to
begin with so this club van doesn't
exactly have a lot of room and actually
whenever i have been thinking about this
car for some reason webvan always pops
up into my head failed grocery delivery
service from the dot-com glory days i
don't know i'm thinking i mean if you
just didn't need to move a lot of stuff
around like I need to have a cupcake
delivery service yeah maybe but I don't
really understand why you would buy this
over a regular club men unless it was
less expensive yeah unless they were
just like hey we took the windows out so
we're gonna charge you less for it or if
there were there were a stripped-down
trim a la ford transit connect where you
just get it doesn't have anything in it
yeah yeah this doesn't really get
interesting this doesn't really get me
excited about the mini bright I mean
they've done much cooler concepts in the
past this one okay I don't know but
speaking of like that was a lazy concept
this is probably in my opinion the
stupidest concepts we're gonna see at
Geneva this year it's the range rover
evoque convertible concept um and it's
just like someone at land rover looked
at the murano crosscabriolet in the Fed
that's crap but I mean yeah we could do
it too right so they basically stripped
the roof back on the Murano Burano on
the range rover evoque a perfectly good
crossover mind you and replaced it with
a power folding hardtop they've also got
a rollover protection system so if you
the vehicle detects it's about to flip
over hoops pop up on the rear passenger
so you don't crush yourself mmm but
other than that is the exact same car
with a convertible top and it's like
this something you expect to see it's
seema and if it's just like hey like I
we basically got rid of all of the trunk
space in the range rover and made it
less useful right you except to get that
hole open air thing which they leave oak
at a pretty bit the milk had a huge
glass glass roof I mean you don't get
air was like one your windows down here
about 80% there yeah and you can see
this guy and everything this you can
just see all around maybe this is like a
beach cabana sort of drive around the
thing about for c convertible is there
only really good for the first two
passengers in the back seat it's just
like all that wind comes with the
cleaning directly into your mouth right
you don't want to be on the freeway
instead so it's like you get two seats
back there that no one's gonna want to
sit in any way i don't know i think it's
done yeah y'all get there i'll look at
it and i'll sit in the fed this is the
car for me i think what they should have
done better here is just instead of
doing the whole convertible risk just
remove the roof just like all together
yeah just you know maybe have some
canvas you could air with her own hole
up over like a range rover evoque spider
oh you don't think it had done actually
has made the whole interior weatherproof
so it could rain it could snow in the
thing it wouldn't matter wouldn't like
mess up she's like a jeep wrangler
exactly what you want I guess Jeep
already makes that yeah alright well
that reedom top on this that is our
Geneva preview and my headphones are
falling off my head yeah that is our
Geneva preview will be there next week
posting will have a special package up
on cnet com showing all of our coverage
from the show that will start on Tuesday
will be posting from the show Tuesday
and Wednesday of videos blog post photos
all sorts of stuff everything we can
find at the show that's cool so he's
trying to steal that lytro camera from
price that would be awesome did give it
its first real test in a real situation
yet but let's go on the road now we are
on the road in the BMW 328i this is the
new engine the BMW is putting into the
3-series in the low end they are
bringing back the four-cylinder to the
US which they haven't had here for years
right so as we've been seeing over years
28 no longer means 2.8 liters in this
case we've got a two liter so it's a
about the thing side of the engine in a
regular Honda Civic yeah but it is that
got direct injection so they're more
precision there in the beating of the
fuel better efficiency and more power
right and also a twin-scroll
turbocharger which BMW has been using a
lot lately yeah so it's a geared more
towards comfort no images anywhere so
I'm guessing there's no support plus
mode so you just got regular sport you
got normal and eco pro which is actually
I think what BMW wants you to pay the
most attention to because they put the
pro suffix on it yeah and you know part
of the thing with this new engine two is
that you can get an average I think fuel
economy is something like 25 36 and you
can get a fuel economy average of about
30 miles reality in this car if you
drive it normally I mean if you're
always hammering it now you won't get
that good but you know normal driving
i'd say about 34 a BMW right so we've
got a couple of efficiency technologies
at work here the first is there like
efficientdynamics regenerative system
which kind of ditches the alternator in
favor of a regenerative braking system
so you don't have that alternator drag
all the time when you're driving the
second is a start-stop system so when
you come to a stop at a light for longer
than a couple of seconds the engine will
actually shut it
off off and re-engage Sue's you lift
your foot off of the break fortunately
there is a button right there and you're
the start/stop button now lets you turn
that function off yeah now we have all
the electronics in this car this car is
pretty well optioned up so we have a
screen here actually I think the screen
is standard but we've got a navigation
system which has good 3d maps and all
the stuff we've got a nice Harman Kardon
audio system too and a lot of audio
sources as well I we pretty much got the
full range of audio sources bluetooth
streaming even that Pandora integration
which is nice yeah there's a BMW apps
thing that lets you use an iphone to get
all sorts of music integration with this
car and one of the coolest things that
one of the new things is this that I'm
looking at right in front of me
projected on the mirror I can't see it I
thought when I was in the seat and it is
really cool it's kind of a can show your
speed as you're driving along so you
have to glance down at your speedometer
if you're doing turn by turn direction
that kind of show the the next turn the
distance to the turn of the street name
is you're looking for and it's also in
color so it's a really cool so that is
the new 2012 BMW 328i which is as we
mentioned a pretty drastic change over
the previous one is they've dropped a
couple cylinders from the engine right
they've also kind of tweaked to styling
a little bit on the outside I think you
look I don't know if I think it looks
better or not but I like it I you know
it's not drastically different than the
three Serie than the original 3-series I
guess some BWW aficionados might be like
going oh this is way different but you
know I mean they lowered the front down
or the front end down a little bit yeah
it looks like but the hood has a
slightly more prominent look the grill
seems to be a little narrower or not
quite as high so but yeah I think it's a
good look yeah I mean it definitely
looks I think it looks better when you
start adding the sporty or things onto
it the bigger wheels for the the 335 or
you know the when you start getting into
you know the this sort of m sport
package the more aggressive front
building that the lower air dam but I
guess in the 328i biggest luxury trim is
that what we had yeah this is the luxury
law
design yeah and I would have preferred
to have the sport line because frankly
even though this thing did handle well I
did feel that the suspension was a
little bit floaty a little move too
little too much in the corners well mean
it kind of like place to the the
3-series being all things to all people
for some people I mean it is just like a
really nice alternative to a Camry its
just oh yeah well it's just like I
looking at Alexis you know such and such
but then I decided to get the BMW
because it's just got a nice three
interior you'd be amazed how many times
I hear people say that they're not
thinking about the ultimate driving
machine and so by basically kind of
splitting the the vehicle into those
different lines and yeah I think it's
interesting that they're doing this sort
of line thing instead of trim levels
yeah well I guess in addition to trim
levels they allow the vehicle to kind of
let people to kind of cater the vehicle
to what they're looking for right and
and like you're saying I think this is a
car I mean that through 28 has often
been a car for the the person who isn't
really like really in the BMW's or isn't
really into you know aggressive driving
or anything like that they just want
something transportation it looks nice
and they hear BMWs are good quality so
and they got money to spend right what
did you think of the auto stop thing it
only really happened once while I was
driving it and did I mean it I it didn't
really bother me yeah I was a little the
first time but the only time it happened
I kind of looked down and went oh I
don't start that's interesting and then
I took my foot off the brake and I went
on my way and I would assume that over
time I would just kind of either stop
paying attention to it or just get used
to it force I mean I feel like if they
put a button right there and you're the
start/stop button lets you turn it off
so if you're the kind of person who just
really if you're in a rush and you're
going to be like taking off from every
light with everything the cars guy turn
it off and it won't really bother you
but I think I think it's good that it's
an option yeah o our missing can Patriot
here Brian Cooley love the button the
turn off that idle stop he hated that
idle stop function it certainly I found
it certainly made itself felt the car
you know when it when the engine
shutdown he felt it when the engine
kicked in you really felt it and you
didn't really feel the same thing like
in the buick lacrosse
had recently which also shut off its
engine at stop lights and stop signs and
wherever you happen to stop that was a
lot smoother mm-hmm this BMW was not the
whole idle stop experience was not
smooth now i think in Europe they're
sort of used to this behavior they don't
mind it so BMW saying you know what's
good for Europeans is good for Americans
yeah well I guess I suppose I think from
from my frame of mind I haven't driven
very many cars that have the feature
that aren't hybrids and when you're in a
hybrid you can cheat so it's just like
oh yeah the engine shuts off and you can
stop on the gas and the vehicle start
moving immediately because you're
cheating with electric power yeah with
this I feel like it would take a mental
switch to know that you can't just go
off brick on the gas just like if you
can't be late has to be like a I'm off
the brake the engine started now i'm on
the gas and it i think just in America
we're kind of used to like green go Fran
it's just sometimes you the lights green
and you have to make sure no one's got
to run the light and it's just you know
that extra half of a second I think
people were just so afraid the car
behind them is gonna start beeping
because they're in such a rush that you
know that people are kind of a little
bit weird about taking that extra half a
second right just kind of get the car
going smoothly well that's one thing I
found with this car is just because I'm
was very sort of aware of what the
engine is doing I would lift off the
brake and wait for word does it really
feel that engine kick in and come up to
full power before I push the accelerator
and I don't think I needed to wait quite
that long and it's certainly nobody was
really Hawking me because the way people
drive in most cities it's just like oh
wait the light turn green Oh behind your
texting yeah exactly it's a yeah there
wasn't any urgency to get off from the
light you know what's up for myself and
so I didn't really have fine it
troublesome or difficult to keep up with
you know people leaving off the light
but it yeah it is a little bit of a
hesitation and is a little weird and you
know it's hard to sort of judge where
that is now see this is the thing I
think is that people you know your
casual buyers of this car who maybe
don't really know how an engine works
well I would say like this is weird why
is it doing this
and they'll go to the dealership and say
like can you fix this in the dealer will
I hit the button right exactly like 600
bucks that's a BMW dealership right so I
mean I don't know I think that's kind of
one of those things that I think would
be explained when they hand you the keys
to the car like oh yeah it's got
start/stop function so you save fuel
that may be as much explanation as you
get during the buying process but I feel
like if someone lets you know that then
I don't think people just be caught off
guard with it now it'll definitely
happen during the test drive yeah what
one thing I notice tutoring it's idle
stop when that was engaged is that the
wheel you can't really turn the wheel
because it's still hydraulic boosted
power steering really yeah I haven't
made the jump to electric like everyone
else yeah apparently not but if you did
really tug the wheel around hard like if
you really wanted to turn the wheel
usual start back up yeah what oh that's
awesome yeah because it would realize oh
but we need boost here so it would take
a little bit long but you know would do
it yeah I wonder if this just like you
know laziness on POWs part or it is like
the hydraulic steering helpless prenup
reserved our ultimate driving machine
cred hi thing yeah I mean and I'm it
behaved like a hydraulic steering boost
I can't imagine it is electric but it is
interesting that they have held back on
that if they have because I think other
companies have done a decent job of
tuning electric power steering systems
and you know if you're using boost its
you know there's already some
interference from the real Road feel but
I think BMW wants to stick to that
hydraulic boost for preserving one more
generation yeah that'll happen
eventually well I'm sure they'll go to
electric eventually and it's itching to
because this car was getting that we're
averaging like 30 miles per gallon which
is great and if they added electric
power steering that might boost it even
more couple miles per you coming well
maybe like one or two yeah I mean not a
lot every little bit counts though when
you're you're trying to reach 40
certainly trying to reach a cafe so
whatever cafe wants them to do in a
couple of years every little bit counts
right last thing I kind of want to
discuss about this car is the app
integration
which is cool you saw me I was actually
driving a different BMW starday but I
was twittering tweeting like I'm gonna
be arriving in 20 minutes yeah it was
like can tweets from the car this has
that to the app system where it only
works at the iphone which leaves out
half of the populace but it's kind of
cool stuff it does integrate with
Twitter and Facebook and it was funny
actually I was looking at my Twitter
feed on the screen I saw your tweet
about the Ferrari that 12 that we just
talked about earlier and that was on the
screen so I selected it and then there
was an option to make the car read out
the tweet uh wonder how it pronounced if
Jill berlinetta it I think they did AAA
at that point that it took I should try
to pronounce the or tried to read out
the URL of the picture nice too but it
was a female's voice so I was hearing
your tweet in a female voice hmm it was
pretty funny but it was smooth it was a
very good rendering of the text in and
it didn't sound robotic at all these
tweets look really robotic I'm looking
at now is like it's cold out 50 degrees
Fahrenheit and I'm driving my BMW yeah
i'm online in my BMW with BMW connected
arrives and arriving at the street
address in all caps at about 350 pmo
surprised that tweet doesn't say in my
BMW yes a lot of them do although I was
looking at the app that lets you do that
kind of stuff and I think you can edit
the templates as well oh yeah the first
thing I would do is take in my BMW off
for the end of every day yeah it was a
it was an amusing time out there and I
could actually retweet to every tweeted
your uh oh yeah I meant to ask you that
if you if you'd actually done that
retweet from inside of the vehicle oh
yeah everything very interesting all
right well that is the BMW 328i that
well let's take a look at what's in our
garage XE that review is that but
looking up in the cnet garage we just
can we the reviews of that 328i that
review is up posted videos up and the
twitter yaris antoine spent a good
amount of time in that car finding out
all its virtues in
I got 11 virgin in the car the hits ago
next up we have our in the graduate now
we have the BMW 650i this is the new
sixth series of 2012 60 Ruiz so good
time driving that car a lot of good
stuff there tons of technology oh and
then coming up well we've got our Geneva
show next week so we look at a lot of
cars not driving any but we'll beat the
duty of a show that's been car tech live
for march first 2012 I've been wind
Cunningham here in studio with antuan
goodwin and Mitch Tang at the board you
can take a look at our show nuts look at
