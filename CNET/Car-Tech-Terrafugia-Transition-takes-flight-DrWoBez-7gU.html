new york international auto show is this
the Terrafugia transition a lot of you
have read stories about this may be seen
youtube videos of it flying around this
is what you probably think of as a
flying car but terribly gia says no this
is really a roadable aircraft the idea
is that you can drive this from your
home to a local airport take off fly
around a bit land again and drive it
back home let's go and see what makes it
work now the engine is back here it
powers this prop obviously when it's in
flight that prop has a carbon fiber
shaft that goes to the engine the engine
is a hundred horsepower rotax style and
there's also a power transition feature
that the pilot can operate shifting the
power from this prop to the wheels when
you want to go to the ground these
wheels are down here off of the swallow
style rear air frame those are run by a
pulley that runs into the engine top
speed on the road is about 65 miles per
hour in the air 105 miles an hour
despite how cool you might think this is
not many people are going to find a use
for this thing it's really on the level
of amphibious car about a hundred people
have actually signed up to buy one and
that's probably as many as can really
use it because it's not something you're
going to drive to the airport fly long
distances then drive really far again
and take long trips back and forth like
that in fact terrafugia estimates that
most people probably only drive it about
fifteen percent of the time and fly at
85 percent of the time think of it it is
an airplane that you don't have to keep
at the airport you can actually drive at
home although you won't want to drive it
too far home because at its top speed
and considering this design it's
probably not going to feel really safe
on the freeway they'll probably want to
keep it on lower speed roads at 45 40
miles an hour top speed I'm Wayne
Cunningham looking at the terrafugia
transition at the 2012 new york
international auto show
