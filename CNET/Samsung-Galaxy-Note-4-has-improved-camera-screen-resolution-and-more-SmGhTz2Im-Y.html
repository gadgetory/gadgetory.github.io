that a lot of tablet users have been
waiting for the Samsung Galaxy Note 4
what is different well it's got a 5.7
inch screen that is higher resolution
this is 2560 by 1440 a really beautiful
crisp display and of course it's got an
S Pen Stylus but it also has a 16
megapixel rear camera with optical image
stabilization so it takes really stable
shots the 3.7 inch front-facing camera
also has some tweaks low lighting
improvements and there are a whole bunch
of selfie modes to enable you to use
either the heart rate monitor to tap it
or to turn around and use the rear
camera and facial image recognition to
take selfies of yourself as if you
weren't already taking enough selfies
and the S Pen has a few more tweaks -
there are there's much more sensitivity
in terms of how it writes but it also
has and along with the UI that an
operating system that Samsung has
built-in there's more drag-and-drop
pc-like functionality so you can
actually take screens and drag them and
resize them all around the screen and be
able to tap them as you choose play
videos in one and have a little more of
that cut-and-paste feel - you can cut
and paste and look upwards so there's
more S Pen functionality that's in here
and the frame feels better - this is
actually a metal outer frame here so it
feels a little more sturdy gone is the
stitched leather type feel that was
before but it's still plastic back it's
removable so you can still access the
battery and the SD card and all of that
it is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 805
processor so it's plenty fast this is a
look at the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 first
time that we've gotten our hands on it
here at CNET and don't forget there's
also a note edge which has a side screen
if you want to go to another level with
the note for basically the same features
plus that in the edge
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at a
large screen that actually doesn't even
feel that large anymore in the scheme of
things
