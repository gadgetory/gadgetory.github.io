all-new my cloud ex4 NASA over from WD
now if you remember I review these my
clouds just a short while ago was great
device but I did have a one complaint
and that is cultures a single hard drive
on the inside and therefore it's
acceptable to data loss if the drive on
this side on the inside fail well in an
extreme effort to make me happy EE
introduce this guy right here px for now
it come with not two not three but four
into the drive on the inside and that
means a couple of thing that first is
that you can now set up to God the data
against the case where one or even two
hard drives on inside film at the same
time or you can have up to 16 terabytes
tort specs and of course the server come
with a lot more features now this new my
cloudy x4 server you of course have all
the goodies the my cloud has such as the
ease of you the support for Time Machine
backup media streaming and a very good
set of personal cloud feature that allow
you to connect to your home server
remotely via the internet using a
computer or a mobile device so to avoid
Sarah like a broken record
I would only talk about here what the
eh4 has that the my cloud doesn't and
there's quite a few of them now this is
a for bein a server and that means it
can host four hard drives on the inside
as you can see the hard drive it can be
very easily install or replace just put
the latch here it comes out or push back
in and press it now it stay back in the
place and in fact if you replace this
hard drive one at a time you can
actually replace them why the server is
still working now this for drive here
can be set up in all available raid
configuration including raid 5 which is
the most popular because it balances
between storage space performance and
data safety in my testing the server
here could build a rate very fast in
many cases it took just less than 10
minutes to do that and you can view the
red building progress as
other information of the server using
this small LCD right here is very handy
actually on the back here this server
has dual everything now take a look it
has two ethernet ports you need only one
port to make it work but two port means
you can use them together to balance the
load off of failsafe purposes there are
two USB 3.0 port to host more storage
for backup or to expand the server
storage and take a look at this it come
not one but two power port that's right
you can actually use two power adapter
with this server in case one of them
fail or somebody tripped on it
only one adapter is included however on
the inside the server now has a few
business feature including the support
for ice cozy Active Directory and
virtual volume you can have also alter
back up to the server back up within
itself back up between AIDS and the
external storage and backup between
different server in a local network or
over the Internet
and finally the server now supports apps
meaning you can download more apps to
install on it to add more feature and
function to it in the future you
probably can run plex server on this one
too now in my testing is not the fastest
server ever seen but it's very fast
offering sustained speed of 50 megabyte
per second for writing and some 90
megabyte per second for reading now that
is very fast for a whole network and can
handle all of your storage needs
so how much do you have to pay for this
server well that depends the server is
available in 4 options including no
storage who have to buy your hard drive
here by 12t by and 1610 by that cost
three eighty eight hundred nine fifty
and eleven fifty dollars respectively
these are very good prices compared with
similar server on the market now you
know this is not the best server ever
seen but for home user it might just be
because it's easy to use and most
importantly now your data is a lot safer
with it compared to the previous
my cloud server so the question is am I
happy with it well maybe maybe not you
have to with the
with you said come to find out one thing
is for sure though and that's of course
I'm don't know and this has been the
first look at the my club ex4 Nast
server from Daddy Austin that oh one
more thing here nice Michael a t-shirt
will make it yours as a bluebird</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
