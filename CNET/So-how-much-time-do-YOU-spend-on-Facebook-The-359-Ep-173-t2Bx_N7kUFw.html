February's second episode 173 of the 359
podcast and today I am joined by Ben Fox
Rubin and Roger Cheng I don't know why I
just stuttered on that good morning guys
yeah I'm pretty forgetful I get it it's
so cool how's everybody doing today yeah
good Thursday right it's thursday
alright yeah what up the end of the week
and devour week partners are falling
over all right what are we talking about
today we're going to continue earning
season talking about Facebook which had
a monster quarter talk about a couple
problems that they're gonna have coming
down the pike also a couple new
interesting ideas for the Amazon Alexa
they haven't come out quite yet but they
will be here sometime soon or maybe not
we'll end up finding out and then last
we're going to talk about using social
media to help disabled activists come
out and protest as always send in your
questions and comments and Brian will
get to them at the end of the show all
right hang on everybody we're going to
record this podcast way back and join
you in the chat and we'll hang out for a
little bit so here we go in three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Rubin
Roger Cheng facebook posted another
monster quarter with profit doubling and
monthly users hitting 1.86 billion Wow
with Abby yeah video has gotten folks to
spend more time on Facebook too but
lurking just below the surface are a
handful of problems for the social media
giant first up the company is running
out of space to cram its ads especially
on mobile you know because those are
much smaller screens Sheriff so it's
growth is expected to slow later this
year so Roger how big of a problem do
you think it's going to be for them in
terms of maintaining his growth
trajectory yeah it's gonna be a problem
I think it's a problem that most sites
have it's just the lack of real estate
right lack of tolerance for these ads
total I think we're all kind of getting
annoyed with these ads and I don't know
companies like Google Facebook are
trying to make them more seamless or
they try to make them less intrusive but
the fact of the matter is yeah like when
I'm on my phone and I'm quickly going to
my feet like I don't need to get
inundated
ads and they're trying to do that
especially as possible because that's
how they make money right what was
interesting about the facebook earnings
they make over eighty percent of their
revenue from mobile so and and there's
much less real estate in that area so
that's that's a bit of a problem for
them second also this is related to
Facebook oculus isn't really
contributing to growth and was also
found guilty in an intellectual property
case costing for now they may appeal
five hundred million dollars you know
what's interesting is sort of the lack
of reaction to it I feel like this was a
huge controversy well for a while it was
this thing that is over hang on on
oculus just this looming threat yeah
they essentially say the whole idea is
to create the oculus rift but now that
the ruling is out and there's 500
million dollar bounty like no one I
don't think anyone really seems to care
I think it's kind of overshadowed by the
prophets and facebooking put out like
500 billion which is whatever from the
money pot exactly know how the couch
underneath grab a little change just
they all probably still I would argue
they probably still going to appeal at
five hundred million dollars is nothing
to sneeze at but right we'll see how big
that ends up getting next your Alexa
your Amazon alexa may someday rat you
out if you're ditching class that's just
one of several new ideas that were
considered at a hackathon amazon helped
host recently not so it's really
interesting that amazon's kind of
fostering you know further I guess use
of the elects of the echo speaker I mean
do you think this stuff is that is it
all pie in the sky or is this actually
are actually gonna see this stuff in
elec so soon some of this stuff is going
to come so the idea of what what you do
is there's there's this platform that
gets your attendance records and you
would be able to have that port over to
your echo so you walk in you know mom
walks in and says like oh you know Billy
you weren't in class today or you missed
trigonometry or whatever that is
certainly a possibility if a school is
using that type of software it's not
just schools right like what were some
of the other applications at the second
thought there was one like ticketmaster
had this idea where you could say like
what are some nearby concerts or bank
right you could ask like what are some
local mortgages so some of it is
certainly possible but we might not see
all of it right well lastly our own
Maggie region did a profile or feature
uh taking a look at the sort of the the
way that activists are using social
media facebook facebook groups it's
really make it easier for the disability
community to show up at these protests
obviously between the women's marg some
of the band that the protests over the
immigration banned from this past
weekend there have been plenty of
opportunities for people but
historically the disabled community has
not really been able to go at the
logistical reasons like in terms of lack
of access sometimes it's difficult for
people to stand up for a long time there
are all these logistical issues but
facebook and twitter has sort of made it
a lot easier to created this sort of
channel for people to talk and
participate yeah definitely well check
out Maggie's story if you want to read
more about these check us out on cnet on
Ben Fox Rubin i'm dr. Jenn thanks for
listening and in the chat lovely be 35
says 30 hours a week on facebook wow
that's all present there's a lot 30
hours continuously i'm assuming sprinkle
to up today continuously would be paid
that can't be in its entirety there's no
way that was weird they're now in
second with 30 hours a week that's
pretty that sounds like a lot even for
facebook yeah i mean people just spent a
lot of time on that watching video use
it as a second screen i suppose yeah i
know my wife is her eyes are like when
she's free she's she stopped watching TV
and like regular media she watches
mostly videos on facebook oh my wife
umana Cruz's face off of montclair are a
lot of my wife uses a lot of money
groups but she also mostly uses it to
stalk girls she knew from high school
and see you know yet what because she is
also you just told that you just added
her as a doctor watches this podcast
yeah my wife doesn't she did initially
she stopped caring a long time ago and
but we have you wonderful fan so thank
you much thanks for joining us in
contrast Naaman says a few minutes a day
at less than
10 Wow okay to extremes yeah yeah i
think i'd like to think that mine ebbs
and flows heavily yeah i would agree and
depending on the day like if I'm real
busy here and I just want to go home and
crash at night the last thing I want to
do is look at some yeah stupid cat meme
or something it you know what I it's
it's hard for me to like count it up but
I look at facebook maybe two minutes at
a time every time I basically open up my
phone right I'll just which is Elsa 30
out yeah I guess so I like I'll see an
alert of like alright hit the alert see
what one is one thing I've done recently
is I've turned off alert just because I
got tired of getting aggressive I'll go
and address it when I can yeah i still
have messages forwarded to me so if
somebody directly needs to contact me
they can still use that it's plateau get
any other I'm not getting buzzes in my
phone on the fly anymore that's kind of
nice actually I think I mean I've cut
down the number of Lords but I still do
get them and i think that's that's what
hooks me and everyone every time and
then i'll spend like 10 two or three
minutes on facebook they're one of the
one of the things that facebook is
trying to do to get people to spend even
more time on facebook is to promote
longer videos so we shall see some of
that later this year and expect to you
know i guess just sit there and watch
stuff on Facebook the more alive videos
or either live videos or just wondering
yeah I think they're trying to go from a
premium content right content wall
street journal reported that they're
working on a app for set-top boxes which
doesn't surprise me at all it's a I was
confused by this work on videos I was
confused by that story was that for
set-top boxes like Roku boxes or set-top
boxes like your normal cable box I would
assume it's for roku right that wouldn't
be that hard of a hard to do is it no
because it seemed like they just said
television set-top box which isn't that
clear anymore right that could totally
be a cable that couldn't be a game like
a channel on your cable box I didn't
know your cable box could have apps
maybe that's not well yeah it could be a
channel i guess theoretically if it's on
my Roku you know i'm gonna go on there
every now and then so i don't think
that's a bad idea for them it's yeah I
spend with I spent a lot of time one
only two that on the roku box so I can
eat I can imagine watching watching this
yes narcissist
Tom big in the chat says not as much
time as I spend on YouTube Oh bless your
heart yeah there we go hey let out here
we'll use there we go Jerry says no
Facebook here I've got a life Wow very
spesh that is no true I don't have a
wide width I don't have a life good job
good job fan there you go excuse me if I
could if I could spend less time on
Facebook obviously I would you guys are
you like chained to it in some ways you
know because of my job like you have to
keep somewhat appraised of like what the
newest features are what's going on on
this stuff it's the same thing with
Twitter we're like well that's altima
same free content well no I want to ask
like what what do you spend more time on
Facebook or Twitter almost certainly
Twitter yeah same here yeah and I had to
like detox after the election I took
some time off because I was just on it
constantly there was so much news went
out to the cabin for a while yeah it's
some fishing I got to know me Shannon
says basically all the time because
Facebook seem so ubiquitous and video
sucks me and fast yeah looks like there
you go rude ok coming and Mark
Zuckerberg loves you so I think you're
gonna get to be a great customer for
facebook moving forward yeah buddy and
Ricardo they are in a gray area because
they're spending 15 to 30 minutes a day
but it's on Instagram but Instagram is
owned by Facebook and Instagram has been
doing more video too right yup so that
is that's like video is getting really
big number one and the ads are more
expensive so they can make more money
off of video and you can just you just
can suck people in so yeah there's
definitely this rabbit hole you can fall
into with video what well the Facebook
content in general but like video in
particular like one after another it
just it's kind of like YouTube right
right let's change gears real quick
cause I'm going to wrap it up soon kevin
says I actively help him support the
disabled people social media definitely
have given them a way to express
everything I've seen a lot of them go to
rallies protests fundraisers social
media is empowering and that's great
absolutely one hundred truth right there
ya know so specifically to this story I
mean obviously
was the women's march in DC this woman
here that Maggie talked to actually
created a special channel disability
caucus the special Facebook page it's
got an offshoot of the women's March
movement and it was sort of it served as
a resource for the disabled community in
terms of like places to stay that are
that they're more handicapped friendly
right to make it to make it easier for
folks that do want to protest action
that say like cuz everybody deserves a
voice exactly cuz it's you know the the
easiest these excuse of the easy thing
to say is like well you can just protest
at home or on social media online that's
everyone should have a fair share fair
chance to represent is actually yeah
physically voice their own opinion so
absolutely yeah totally agree with that
and I think you need to move on right
you can or get out of here we got a
short show today unfortunately everybody
but thanks for joining us it was great
to have you yeah well that's that's it
for the week yes I think that's it for
