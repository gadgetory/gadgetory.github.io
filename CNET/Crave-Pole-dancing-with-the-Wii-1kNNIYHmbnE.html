sync wirelessly and we dancing plus miss
erica OGG in the studio say hello yeah
hey all about amor on this week's crate
what's up guys you're watching crave
where we talk about all the cool hip fun
quirky goodies that are out there I'm
here join with erica OGG back in the
studio thanks for coming of course and
everything you see and hear us talk
about for the most part is on our blog
at krave cnet com and there's something
in Erica's lap you want to tell us what
you got this is the HP compaq to 133 and
I've gotten to play around with a little
bit and I love it I'm constantly in
search of the ultimate blogging machine
where I can just pound out you know a
quick blog entry and it's got Wi-Fi it's
cheap it's one of those rivals to the
EPC that's koo i mean i like the design
its kind of even like a polish stylized
right with kind of a brush metal looking
at yeah and you you'll be holding on to
that for a little longer problem until
they make me give it back just okay now
another item that's on a crate blog
super hot is the blackberry 9000 they
like to call t blackberry bold Bonnie
cha gotta take a look at it and she
talked about how bold this screen was
that it's really vibrant the best you
seen a smartphone it looks really sexy
yeah I haven't gotten to play with it
but looking at it and you got kind of a
different design with the buttons and
all that and I think looks really nice I
also have the IFI explore card which
just came out this week and it's an SD
card and it goes in your camera this one
actually has GPS in it so not only does
it use Wi-Fi to upload your photos
wirelessly it also uses skyhook wireless
to triangulate where you are so that
when you upload your photos it has
geo-tagging of where you were when you
close so people could kind of know like
your whereabouts and you know where you
took your rose you want them to know
that all the time well if you don't then
you don't want this product so those are
some of things on the crave blog and now
we told you guys that we were going to
announce our top three one liners from
our keyboard pants contest we got some
real good ones and we also got some ones
that out we're not going to be able to
say on our show but first up here we go
Bryce Cranmer's entry was I type 60
words per minute would you like to beat
my score wow these people have a lot of
times but we love it because they love
crave any now Dan showed in if I said
that right from Pennsylvania he wrote I
just hope Brian doesn't
to unzip any files and finally Steven
delfano he said how about a threesome

about that was the serving cuz I'm maybe
it's because I'm not attracted to me

the wii called Wii Fit well what about

of a sudden you know the disco ball
