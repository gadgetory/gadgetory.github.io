cnet.com and I'm here with these sony
SRS @bt X 540 Bluetooth speaker this is
the flagship portable Bluetooth speaker
in Sony's lineup for 2013 and it is a
very good model as you can see it is
sleek it is well designed it's a fairly
hefty unit it weighs around four pounds
and around $300 it competes directly
with the bose soundlink bluetooth mobile
speaker 2 as well as the big Jambox what
I liked about it is that it offers clean
sound also pretty big sound it doesn't
over accentuate the bass too much but
there is ample bass this delivers
impressive sound for a compact bluetooth
speaker and yes as I said it is portable
it has a rechargeable battery inside it
delivers about 6 hours of battery life
that's not great you can do better than
that
if you lower the volume a bit but you
should be able to get through a good
portion of the day with that battery
life another nice feature is that it has
a USB port in the back so when you do
have the AC adapter plugged in you can
charge other devices such as smartphones
while you have this on a couple of other
features worth noting this does have
built-in speakerphone capabilities
there's a button on top of the unit for
answering calls
there's also volume controls and a few
buttons on the side but it does have a
pretty minimalist design and you
basically are expected to use your smart
phone or tablet as a remote and there is
an exhilarating put for devices that
aren't Bluetooth enabled this also has
another sort of hot feature of the
moment that is NFC pairing NFC is a
feature that's available in some smart
phones this allows you to tap to pair
your device but it doesn't make pairing
that much easier and you do have to
download a special app to make it work
but the feature did work when I try the
NFC pairing and you can also disconnect
by tapping on the speaker with your
smart phone well the speaker will
certainly fit in a suitcase and it does
come with a carrying case it is a nice
neoprene carrying case so one
necessarily say this is
the best speaker to take with you in a
bag on an airplane for a longer trip the
BT X 300 might be a little bit better
than that although this does offer
bigger and richer sound than that
speaker does and I would recommend this
speaker over that smaller speaker
because of that sound and all in all I
really did like it a lot and it
certainly does compete well with the
Bose and big jambox and should be on
your shortlist for portable bluetooth
speakers I'm David karna and that's the
sony srs BT X 500 thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
