is a first look at the new Xbox 360 250
gig model so let's take a look at some
of its cosmetics it's now sporting a
piano black finish that's really a
fingerprint magnet it has more of an
edgy design with sharp lines and vents
but this is clearly a more male gear
design now this new 360 is packed with a
250 gig hard drive and built-in Wi-Fi
with 802 11 n Microsoft says it's a
whisper quiet and it's definitely
quieter compared to the previous 360
model which is a good thing for ex
boxers now on the front side the buttons
on the 360 are all touch sensitive now
there are no physical buttons here so to
power it up just press your finger on
the silver button and it fires up to
open up the game disc tray you just
swipe your finger over this little notch
and you'll also be able to find two USB
ports here on the front on the side the
hard drive is different so it won't be
interchangeable with your old one all
you have to do is pop this side plate
off and then just pull this tab to pop
out the 250 gig drive if you have the
Xbox transfer cable you can use it to
move your game saves and files over from
your old Xbox to this new one but if you
don't there will be one available for
$19.99 now if we flip it to the back
you'll see your connection for power
optical audio the standard AV connection
for the 360 composite or component
cables and HDMI this port here is an
auxilary connection specifically for
Microsoft's Kinect previous models will
have to plug in the Kinect with USB and
then have a separate cable running to
power and you'll find your Ethernet and
three additional connections giving the
360 a total of five now when you compare
the new Xbox side-by-side with the
previous model Microsoft has cut off
some of the fat with the design it
actually can fit inside of the original
360 and they've trimmed down the sides
of the power supply as well the new Xbox
360 retails for $2.99 and its new
redesign packs more value into the
system for the same price I'm Brian
Chong for cnet.com with their first look
at the Xbox 360 250 gig model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
