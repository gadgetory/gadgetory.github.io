Alfred hang Instagram is expected to
announce the ability to shoot longer
more polished video as well as a
snapchat discovery like hub later today
it's another instance where Instagram
and its parent Facebook is seemingly
copying snapchat again well yeah I mean
it's almost as if you know the long
video format and really didn't work for
Facebook so were like oh there's more
people using Instagram now maybe we'll
try it out that way I'll say this I
hated when Instagram updated their video
limits from like 15 seconds to a whole
minute right so for them to you know
kind of go with this whole we're gonna
do like a full length thing I mean
reportedly right like nothing's really
confirmed yet but that's kind of the
direction where where it seems to be
heading to be fair though I have also
been wrong about this met many times
where like people say like oh we love
the the minute video format well I mean
I don't know if I
I understand the minute video for a man
the 15-second format especially I just
kind of scrolling through it's easy to
get through a minute video I don't know
if I'm gonna be scrolling through and
all of a sudden it's like a half hour
yeah polished news video or something
unless it's the seen a video of course
yes but yeah it does it's not really
conducive with the way I use Instagram
terms like kind of flicking through so I
mean we'll see this is what do you make
of this discovery hub discovery hub like
feature people have been complaining
about the way that Instagram brings like
videos to your feed like bring the
chronological feedback a lot from an
explorer like I usually explore tab a
lot but like it is annoying when I click
on something I was like oh cool this was
supposed to two weeks ago why is this
showing up on my feet now right kind of
thing so I don't know if they'll do the
same job of discovery and also I really
hope Instagram like they're they're
probably copying like the worst snapchat
feature because like nobody uses
discovery right like people really go on
snapchat to like talk with their friends
and like see their friends stories and
things like yeah discovery is just kind
of like oh cool like with Instagram I
mean you are you are checking things out
and so I guess there might be more of an
appetite if there's a dedicated section
to to video and this really
I feel like they're putting this in
position to let you know actual content
producers come in and make pong videos
definitely their play to compete against
YouTube I mean there was that study from
like the Pew Research Center like in
March or so that was talking about how
Facebook's not the top like app for
social media app among like Millennials
anymore like it's like YouTube and then
Instagram all right and Facebook oh we
own this one we just like take all the
things that failed on Facebook and like
try to put them on Instagram all right
so we need to talk about net neutrality
California is actually weighing a bill
right now that would actually provide
the strongest protections out there for
an open Internet but there is surprise a
surprise political infighting that is
threatening to water it down ultimately
it's surprising actually that is a
Democrat Democratic Assemblyman from Los
Angeles who is introducing amendments to
the existing proposals that would kind
of strip out the power on these bills
it's just uh it's just sort of the the
next turn in the wheel the net
neutrality
yep opera I mean if this passes though
is this like one of those scenarios
where because there's so many companies
in California that it would kind of
affect the rest of the country or it's
not just companies in California
basically any company who has to do
business with California would have to
honor those rules if you're honoring
those rules from one state you kind of
have to do that for everything
especially a state as large as
California we'll see what happens again
this is a there's gonna be hearing on
this later today so we'll give you
updates as you come along lastly the
sweepstakes for 21st Century Fox
continues Disney just rolled in with a
seventy one point three billion dollar
offer for Fox that outbids Comcast a 65
billion dollar offer as well as Disney's
original bid and so I mean for geeks the
bright side as this combines potentially
Disney's Marvel characters Avengers
characters with Fox's x-men characters
giving us that kind of dream Marvel
reunion man they really want that
Deadpool money huh I mean Deadpool is a
successful franchise so we'll see
alright for these stories check us out
have seen it I'm Rob Chang I'm alfred
Aang thanks for listening
well two seconds to pass the today we
did it kind of I'm impressed I'm proud
of you finally anyways as always time to
jump into the chat pull out some great
questions and comments so that we can
keep the conversation going and connect
with you guys our favorite part of the
show stick around I'm gonna dig through
in the meantime let's take a question
from Michael Brown in regards to the
Disney Comcast Fox debacle what we need
like a trendy hip cool name for this
whole thing is it like a scandal or are
they fighting each other no it's not
scandal it's Secret Wars some secret
it's pretty good pull out for good pull
anyways Michael Brown says does anyone
think comcast is just trolling Disney to
try and get them to cough up a lot more
money we're just gonna get y'all get
your own movie you can get way more
money just hang tight all right just
hang tight no they got those mouse
pocket on your ebay order so that like
people think that other people are
interested in it raises the price that
would be the ultimate solid by Comcast
unfortunately no I think Comcast
legitimately wants to have the Fox
assets I mean they're fairly valuable
you've got avatar one of the most
profitable movies of all time you've got
the x-men franchise you've got all the
Fox TV shows they're like if Disney got
their hands on avatar there would be
like 80 of them by the end of this
decade oh yeah and then there would be
Avatar spin-offs yeah the origin story
was their planet Pandora oh yeah that's
right yeah Michael Brown also has is a
confirm that Deadpool is the main demand
for purchasing Fox I mean right now he's
almost untouchable the last movie did
really well the first movie but like
blew everyone's mind as far as how well
it could possibly have done I mean
that's I think you know the x-men are
still above more lucrative at large
however at this point Deadpool and x-men
are virtually merged yeah totally I mean
especially with Deadpool kind of no
spoilers all right fine I mean there's
talk of you know an x-force franchise
they want to build or speed
out of Deadpool really you know I don't
think we would look at Deadpool is just
a singular property that they're
interested they're obviously interested
in the entire x-men franchise but it
just goes beyond x-men right there's
Seth MacFarlane strange properties or
there's well there is fantastic for not
exactly the most lucrative property but
imagine what Marvel could do with that
like Disney's Marvel could do with the
Fantastic Four and it's not just
comic-book stuff I mean there's there's
definitely tons of other Fox entertainer
properties that would fit well with
Disney the other thing we don't really
talk about as much Fox owns a 30% stake
in Hulu as does Disney as does comcast
whoever wins the Fox sweepstakes
basically takes a 60% control of Hulu
and that's a streaming service I used to
become a joke but now is legit Pleasant
Disney want to start its own streaming
service exactly Netflix is me like Fox
then if they had all the Fox properties
that's just way more content that they
have in their library that they don't
have to pay for that they can stream out
to you and anyway it's not warm to watch
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
although no Netflix say more about it oh
you're right I'd pay for just that alone
it is interesting though like we say
it's not just about the comic books but
that's undoubtedly massive driving force
right now because it's just the
blockbuster result oh yeah every
blockbuster movie now is somehow based
in a comic book it's a trend it will die
someday it will phase out it'll go the
way of the Western I think it as a big
comic book fan myself I Nev in feeling
the fatigue right now and we we joke
about the Star Wars movies and being
like a million of them now it'd be funny
if like they jump on this bandwagon just
right at the last second and like
comcast scoops up comics just in time
for people to be like nevermind
yeah that that happens I hope Comcast
just like ends up wasting all its money
like that I'm pretty sure they've done a
good job with the NBC Universal property
is just I mean remember fast and the
fast food franchise is probably one of
the most favorite comic I'm just saying
the terms of like franchises like
they've done well with you know what
fast and furious is pretty much like a
comic book property at this
those movies are there they are
superheroes now there I mean you can
argue across like like kick a nuclear
miss yes just a regular on my back well
like a nuclear missile just series where
the cars kind of shield Vin Diesel from
an explosion which makes absolutely the
fire goes past Vin Diesel he's somehow
remains unscathed I mean these are
comic-book movies let's face it here's a
question about net neutrality from a dog
will ISP really follow the net
neutrality deal for all states couldn't
they just do like a regional service
yeah I think they could dad
no actually it's no really no it's
really tough to do that because you see
that's that's why I'm in here and you're
out there I mean you I mean
theoretically you could you could sort
of break it up so somehow the traffic in
California but it's such a logistical
nightmare that it's it's hard to say
whether or not they would actually do
that I mean you mean they can't do what
like trunk did where I was just like oh
GDP are by the way you can visit our
website trunk is gone it's now tribune
again oh boy it did away with the trunk
name but go back to your question yes
they could theoretically do that it
would be really tough and keep in mind
there are other other states doing this
or a Washington Oregon I think New York
is considering one and if you see this
weird patchwork of states enforcing net
neutrality laws within their borders
that's gonna make things really
difficult for the eyes peas in terms of
where they should or shouldn't honor
those those laws so we'll see that's
yeah and it's one thing it's easier to
do across continents because you know
you can more easily shut down parts of
the internet regionally from country to
country as opposed to state-by-state
that's that's tough let's move on back
into Instagram since that's gonna be
coming up in a hot second Michael Brown
asks if Instagram tried to add to that
market it'll be smart for them because a
lot of kids looking at you Alfred use
Instagram as well as adults yeah Alfred
all right Oprah's Instagram is actually
give us give us your opinions youngin
honestly yeah I mean I I think people
use Instagram though is like a time
waster kind of thing
we're like they're just they're like the
subway yeah you're not gonna be there
for like a 30 minute thing though
that for me is sitting down and watching
something and like it might be cool if
there was integration portal where you
can like cast it to your TV I like to
watch on TV cuz that's what I do if like
YouTube videos you can't do that now
right no you can't do that friends maybe
they'll announce that today yeah uh from
my perspective this is all this another
kind of crazy cockamamie move I want to
use stronger language and I'm
uncomfortable using in the scenario but
I mean look at Facebook live Facebook
watch look how well those panned out
everybody wants to be a TV network right
now everybody wants to be Netflix but
they're not a media company just exactly
but neither was Facebook and now look
it's like that's that's Facebook's yeah
line Facebook continues to insist that
it's not a media you're a technology
company so yes everyone wants to get in
this obviously it's because that's where
the money is right they they want to go
into long-form content because that's
where all the Luke Earth ads are they
want to be a YouTube they want to be a
Netflix just by Fox yeah but yeah so
we'll see Tammy Thompson does state the
obvious just a way to justify ad roles
on longer form video you can't do it on
those short clips that's exactly it you
hit right on the nose there that's why
we have a 30 minute show now 30:59 Thank
You Fleur bye
yeah but we're fun yeah yeah we're okay
we're the exception to the rule so if
Instagram does roll out this like
hour-long like format now do you think
that the 359 is gonna pop up there after
whoo that's great question offered I
don't know get all the kids get all the
well have to find out what this
announcement actually is before we can
figure we could figure out 15 they've
already got a spread over weight right
it's actually so I'm cool with that
don't don't tell Beecham
here's one from med 669 will the app be
able to finally
turn on the tablet yet if they can't
make it make the app turn I say step
back and fix that problem before adding
more yeah yeah that's my point though
that like instagrams supposed to be like
this like square it's a vertical
experience it was so long until
Instagram started letting you upload
like photos like yes wide yeah yeah or
whatever like it would only be square
photos and you'd have to crop it it was
the worst thing and like so that's
that's kind of what you know like that
that's what works for Instagram and like
I don't really see them making it like a
vertical like me I mean if they were to
do the like the the casting feature they
would have to make it horizontal right
like it's not gonna look good on ya I
mean and like to be fair like live even
though I don't really watch that many
Instagram live videos I know that kicked
off for a lot of them only because like
so many celebrities use it because it's
less for more than like a Facebook live
or anything like that and that feature
really isn't available on snapchat yeah
a lot of celebrities have used like
Instagram live and that's like how a lot
of like these like celebrity gossip
stories pop up now right oh Kim
Kardashian said this at like the two
hour and 38 like minute mark on her live
stream like definitely I have someone
with Kim Kardashian Instagram a lot of
beat yeah I just I find that ironic
though that like Instagram came it blew
up because it was a mobile specific
video format or media format photos and
videos and now they're like kind of
moving trying to move back to like
traditional media at a time where like
everyone else has been trying to copy
Instagram yeah aside from snapchat I
mean the irony is not lost on us right
now in this conversation but look at
stuff like vine when that launched their
whole gimmick was it's gotta be a six
second video and nowadays nobody is
sticking on to their gimmicks yet vine
had this like really strong cult
following well that's also like why vine
died though because they can you like
monetize it correct so like they keep
threatening vine 2.0 you think it's
gonna come back and be like 30 minute
minimum I feel like once you break the
minute markets are like whatever you
actually just go crazy you actually need
to have a pilot video and
jeez
I like the APEC is asking do we think if
Facebook Instagram snapchat are just
getting too big for their britches
spreading spreading themselves too thin
will other services that they originally
offer continue to suffer and lose
support as they keep trying to become TV
networks that's a question I mean that's
I feel like that's the dilemma for all
big companies they kind of spread out
and do different things that's kind of
like Google turn into alphabet I don't
know we'll see that they are they're
different teams I mean Kevin sighs from
the CEO of Instagram he's still in
charge of that project and Facebook
still has tons of resources and to pour
it into their nest feed and it's not
just trying to become like a media like
power is you know they're they're
literally trying to be like everything
on the internet now where it's like
they've got their like fake Craigslist
with the marketplace and they've got
their fake tinder that's coming out soon
with their their new like dating feature
and stuff like that
yeah I think for Facebook it the idea is
like how can we get people to stay on
our property as long as possible and you
know this is what happens when you make
it's the Walmart best I've got money to
throw at everything so thanks Alfred for
not turning on not muting your phone for
the show better be important yeah
actually Instagram of course it makes me
think that you know Ned six six nine
points out it's a great way to train
people to make great short videos
there's something to be said about
working in media for 17 plus years that
you get attuned to things like timing
and format and being able to push
content forward without hemming and
hawing and bumbling and stumbling as I'm
doing right now but I remember once upon
a time this little show used to struggle
to get to to the four-minute mark and
then they bought an egg timer and then
stopped caring what are you talking
about we still care was just
we're just terrible on you know timing
that's all I do like that we have to
celebrate when you get four minutes you
know I will say also a particularly when
it comes to just sort of like personal
video like people take 5 minute long
personal videos like I am guilt
like my kids my kids and like even when
I'm watching my kids video after a
million - I'm like I'm getting kind of
bored you know I got a move on like they
don't do anything until the
three-and-a-half mark well that's true
too
but I mean the ideas like I'm fearful
like my fee being flooded with like long
boring videos because you know videos
they're cut for a reason right there
edited for a reason is it ironic that in
the the current state of social media
we're in where the attention spans
continue to get shorter and we keep
getting mandated to make more concise
messages into content that we produce
that these platforms are just kind of
opening the gates and saying let's
stream the world yeah oh yeah because I
make some more money I think was it cuz
I'd get bored you leave yeah but like
it's more about like ad dollars yeah
they're spending more time there's some
videos art that are worth sticking
around for for a longer for a longer
period of time those are the ones I'm
gonna bring in money today well you know
what I did do something the other day I
did put on like a three-hour long
wouldn't like the NASA streams the space
streams like the soothing music and
stuff ya know I was not high it wouldn't
have hurt but see that kind of stuff
just atmospheric but if they're supposed
to be action where the hell is I mean
there's a whole network of that like
style of like live streaming on YouTube
though it's like really popular now
there's like at least 3000 something
streamers like every day that I see
whenever I check out the 24/7 lo-fi
hip-hop chill beats to study to channel
on YouTube which I'm sure you've seen it
and there's like Grammys 2019 white
grannies that's going to the Grammys now
that's what I call Lofa hip hop chill
music to study to 24/7 but yeah there's
like that there's like all these like
live streaming channels that are
literally just like atmospheric there's
a reason why the Netflix stocks yeah the
the fireplace yep yeah it's weird I just
don't understand why III think it's just
more continuing throw anything at the
wall and see what sticks well I think
there's definitely come a bifurcation of
how our viewing patterns are I think for
the most
part on a daily basis we want shorter
videos we have short attention spans but
if there are things that we're
passionate about we'll dig in for like
an hour or two hours and stuff right
mm-hmm 3:59
videos on cnet.com or youtube yes or
youtube.com or periscope or livestream
website or echo yeah I like I watch the
are like 30 minute videos all the time
just because it's like something I'm
very passionate about and there you go
and he's a millennial he's supposed to
have short attention span yeah I mean
yeah it's not about re-watch ability is
a totally different story I don't know
why we're defending ourselves and this
we're not poor Alfred brought this upon
us but it's it's it's more about the
live experience like we're all checking
the headlines first thing in the morning
we're all reading the paper together
that's kind of the way I see this show
yeah oh no no rebuttal to that know that
I think that's spot-on okay white okay
let's take a couple more quick questions
Brandon Stiles what's the point of
uploading any video to Instagram when
the quality is butchered to death doing
an impression now you're in my language
they're supposed to only be like a
minute long like not about I wonder if
they're gonna address that today I mean
that that could be a really if they want
to really push he's kind of polished
slickly produced videos you're right
that's that's an excellent point like
cual video quality resolution is gonna
have to be upped so we'll see let me
rephrase that question now what is the
point of uploading anything to Instagram
period question mark hmm
it's a broader philosophical yes so I am
i I recently stopped uploading things on
Instagram and I like have to stop myself
now when I take a photo it sounds like
oh that would look good on us cramps
like no don't do it like just why is it
is get out of the cycle I don't really
wanna like it's like okay quiet little
photo I like a bunch of people like I
feel good about myself
I don't I don't know man people people
need it people but there's been a few
times now where like I'll take a photo
I'm like that was a really good photo
but
I don't want to show this too well you
just show to your girlfriend that's what
I do now well for folks who are lonely
this is a way for them to communicate
for that with the outside world I wonder
if this is kind of a step back towards
channel surfing you know we're on the
apex of a fully chord cut society I know
we'll never be on 100 percent there but
it's definitely a continuing climbing
number is this these constant stream of
consciousness platforms from the chilled
cow to the Lofa hip hop to the NASA
streams to people putting their entire
lives on Instagram capability
potentially coming is this going back to
like channel surfing liked it background
noise you know actually I feel like
consciously watching because I've I cut
the cord a long time ago when I put
something on to watch I'm watching it
I'm not back rounding it I would say
that's fairly - I think to your original
point about how Instagram and even in
some ways Facebook it's it's about
wasting time or killing time when you're
you're sit around doing nothing like my
wife does that a lot she flicks through
Facebook Facebook newsfeed for videos
she doesn't like the video she just
moves on next one right so it just I
feel like that's become our new channel
surfing yeah I mean I found myself doing
that last weekend where I there was like
nothing on Netflix that I wanted to
watch i coded youtube I they oh there's
nothing here either
and then I watch I put something on on
Twitch like in the background oh really
like a smashed ornament okay anyway so
super smash no more smash we're done
with smash at least for now it's that
like at the end of year we talk about
smash again no more smash only because I
suck at it
dammit I really like green Mario one
more question remember burn and hype
that was before CNN bought it in
accident do you think streaming apps he
bean did I read it wrong yeah I read it
wrong sorry Beaman hype do you think
streaming apps especially short vids are
just a fad and won't last
I think there's it's an awkward fit
trying to get both into one format like
it's it's either short video or it's
Paul I don't know if they coexist well
it's a fad I mean in the same way that
like short films aren't a fad it's just
a different format
right I think they're I think they're
both able to they're both able to exist
maybe separately I think idea of making
them coexist together in one platform I
think it's still awkward and most
companies have struggled to do that I
would say maybe YouTube because it's
just a giant repository for this stuff
it's probably done it best yeah but like
there's also like various youtubers that
like make their whole career off of like
just like short videos alright ZD does
that a lot
that's what I'm saying like I think
YouTube is probably done the best job
yeah that's also the place you go for
all video right yeah it's not like it's
not like these other places where you
sort of have a mindset of what Instagram
about is about right and it's not about
long-form it yeah I don't know I mean
YouTube always added that freedom of the
lack of constraint the lack of format so
people can can experiment with how their
creativity can flesh out some make three
minute videos ten minute videos hour
long videos 24 minute long videos but it
feels like they're trying to force us
into just staying online more just like
we're talking about with Facebook they
just want you to stay there forever the
Walmart effect yeah that's I mean
they're trying to force you though like
no they're not sure to force you but
that's the goal right it's good you to
spend more and more time on these
platforms more time there means more
exposure to potential ads which means
more money it's really interesting to me
that so after Google and Apple and both
they're like conferences yep did this
whole like oh we're all about like
digital oneth wellness now and check it
out we'll tell you how much time you're
spending on each app like Instagram and
Facebook go with like decided let's make
them stay on the app even longer there
you go
so digital wellness is all about staying
online so anyways come back in an hour
and we'll have the full Instagram
livestream feeding out that you can put
on in the background and not care about
any more than this outro music - say it
- I would rather just steal that stream
and put it back out there frankly yeah
the event starts at 10:00 a.m. Pacific
1:00 p.m. Eastern yeah definitely check
us out go back to see net for all the
live coverage there we'll be watching
I'm curious to see what the with that
you can actually only watch the stream
on Instagram where like oh you're right
that's super annoying wait is it is that
your eyes so that I think it's I think
it's only on Instagram live
terrible what a terrible idea yeah but
we're going to relay it there you go
again see that be on Instagram watch it
on seeing it we'll have it on our site
