at CES talking to the parrot ar.drone
version 2 point 0 this new version of
this quadcopter has a 720p camera right
there so you can take videos of your
adventures and we're going to it is
unarmed by the way and we're going to
talk to honorees they do of a CEO or
parent about what this thing is about
still making me a little nervous we will
be right back so only what's new in the
parrot ar.drone to point out so the pod
I don't open oh come with an HD camera
and if there's a possibility to record
on your iPad on your iPhone the what I
our own okay and give you control it the
same way or their new modes to control
it and especially a new mode called
absolute control where it's much more
easy for beginners to control the flying
device and you do that how do you
control it is that a moving your finger
around or tilting there yes I control it
tilting the device yeah but now you have
a magnetometer in the iphone or ipad but
also you have one on the loan so both
are a line and you don't have to
montazeri align yourself with your own
you just pilot as if you were the pilot
in front is in front left is left i
delight okay however always done now i
understand there are also games on this
device kind of augmented reality where
you're looking here at what your drone
sees and there's additional reality
exactly top of it so you we use a camera
to detect enemy stud and we have own
battles to own risers and on video games
where the party's already
but also added sing to the reality 3d
images that you see on your iPad but me
the most interesting thing about this is
as a filmmakers tool so are people using
this to make movies or as part of making
new new types of films it's a new kind
of device I take device and you have now
sells end of video taken by the users on
YouTube flying over crocodiles or there
is a one flying in the middle of the
firework by night well have their own
flying there and you have a user who add
ricotta cheese and now you can do it an
HD now you can do it in HD and put it on
youtube very</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
