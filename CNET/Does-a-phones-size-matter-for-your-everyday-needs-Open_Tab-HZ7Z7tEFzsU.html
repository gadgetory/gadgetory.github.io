our own colleague Jessica Dulko dull
Court reviewed this week here's what's
going on inside the galaxy note 7 it's
got a 5.7 inch curved screen it runs
Android marshmallow come on we all know
new gets the new hotness 64 gigabyte
agree days away from nougat I'm sad I
think nougats next week isn't it I guess
I guess it should get on it look let's
get that out of the way it should have
nougat on it the announcement will but
just not who knows when 64 gigs of
storage iris scanning that'll scan your
eyeball so you can unlock the phone
because that's the thing we all want an
S Pen Stylus water-resistant for 30
minutes in five feet of water and it
starts at the low low price of $850 oh
my god it's a phone big big costly
expensive phone what do you guys think
about the Galaxy Note 7 so personally
I'm not into big phones no really I have
an iPhone se cuz I wanted that exact
shape I really really like having a
4-inch iPhone decided when I'm on the
subway or or a train I could hold it
with my one hand and not get robbed by
somebody ranking it out of my hand is
that a thing I feel like that's a thing
maybe I'm paranoid I think you are but I
mean you know yeah but I wanted to chase
down with some paranoia I wanted a
better processor but I Scott in our
office had the phone and I held it and
it has a real good grip to it because of
its curved screen okay so even though
it's like a 5.8 inch screen I could
actually see myself holding it right and
this is a here about is if I think it's
5.8 that has this is a five-point this
is a 5.7 mm-hmm it's manageable I also
have freakishly large hands at cs6 age
that's the six edge yeah yeah there's a
six so the but the note is significantly
larger than that the note was it's just
a little bit larger than that but it
didn't feel that way somehow
right and has the pet inside but on the
whole I'd prefer I wish more smaller
phones were out with better specs more
and more like reasonable phone sizes
appear to be like getting the shaft in
terms of features sure but they'll be
lower in costs but maybe I want to watch
a 1080p movie on a 4-inch phone I know
nobody else does but I would like to
yeah but you you don't need to watch a
1080p movie on a 4-inch phone like you
would you could get away with watching
like a 360 P movie but do you know I
mean like what no I'm just I mean I get
away with MIT but like there's still a
color gamut thing going on where it just
looks a little better but I'm not D huh
no I'm not trying to I'm not trying to
like crap on it you are again but you
are so alright I guess I understand what
you're saying but like going back to the
notion of like big tech like yeah it
seemed like we were going in one
complete
you know over-the-top sort of like
phablet direction for a while and now I
don't think what you want out of a phone
is uncommon I do think people want
something that's not as gigantic as
five-point-seven enough this thing I
have a hard time with what that's yours
no this is well it's it's our house
iPhone that we I do camera testing stuff
right and that's a six plus this is a
six plus 6s plus 6s plus and yeah it's
just it's I mean I've got big hands in
that yeah it's uncomfortable to use so
but like my point is also this and I
guess like this is maybe a crappy sort
of comparison but like these are pretty
I guess these are pretty much the same
size right they do but the green looks a
little bit my screen might be a little
bigger
and that's all the topic of today's show
bigger is better
except for Michael does yeah nevermind
so I guess what is for us what do you
like about having a larger phone what's
the fun that you have again I have a
Nexus 6p
mm-hmm III like it a great deal I also
wish like I don't know this I had a an
lg g3 which had the same screen size but
wasn't as tall mm-hmm it's like for me
you got to figure out a way to like make
the edge-to-edge as a sort of tiny as
possible like I want I don't want any of
I don't want any of the front of the
phone to be wasted on like this part the
white part I know that's asking a lot
but but that's for me like that's the
next step it's pretty much one-to-one
like there's a lot of like space up
there that I'm pissed off about so Raj
jumped in in our chat saying that this
time a phone company should put their
money on R&amp;amp;D on batteries make
supercapacitor batteries smaller in size
so I can do for a better life that is
what everyone is working on everyone
wants to figure out a way to improve
battery life to me that is the next big
technological Renaissance that we will
hit is like amazing battery life and
we're just not there yet and that's why
the Apple iWatch 2 that's coming out I
don't think is really going to impress
anyone
you know they're talking about rumors
about the watch were supposed to have a
cellular connection independent from an
iPhone and now that's probably not gonna
happen
so it's battery thing we'll get there
we're just not there yet and a few
chatters Quincy Brandon and Oscar are
talking about the iris scanner that's in
the galaxy note 7 which is that's it
that's I believe new for Samsung in that
phone yes one of them saying that people
would like it if it's on iPhone I'm
creeped out by IR scanning in general I
don't like the term iris scanning iris
scanning implies that I need to like
well do this let's do that let's come up
with an apple name for iris scanning
because I'm sure they'll have I scan you
know like when you put the word iris in
it just implies mm something clockwork
orangey and I don't want to do that just
call it something else just caught like
a pupil looker I don't know just don't
call it iris but looker people look here
that's terrible
