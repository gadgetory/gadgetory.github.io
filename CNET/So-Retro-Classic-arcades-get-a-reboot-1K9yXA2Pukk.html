classic American arcade it's it's not
just a trend it's not just a Fed people
have strong connections to the things
they grew up with and a strong affinity
to recreate those experiences
when he first told people we wanted to
open a retro arcade they all told us it
can't be done don't bother isn't gonna
happen but we really knew there is great
appetite across multiple generations I
really think the Golden Age of arcades
in general started in sort of the late
70s early 80s and they kind of started
to die off in the late 90s and so after
a certain period people are kind of
remembering you know I loved going back
to the arcades and just playing it was
such a fun experience and there's
something that you miss in our current
culture that these games bring back ok I
think I just we've been collecting these
games for a number of years all the way
back in college in fact we had a pinball
machine and I don't our dorm room and
that's sort of how we met some of the
games we've gotten are really just been
trades you know I say hey I have this
game that you've been looking for for a
long time you have a few that I'm
interested in let's just do a straight
swap
well for all we have about 90 games
probably so we have a good bit in
storage when people call the arcade to
see if we have specific games they
always want to know if we have centipede
they always want to know if we have
Street Fighter 2 they always want to
know if we have Mortal Kombat those are
really popular games that come out but
you definitely see a pop-culture bump
for a lot of these titles for instance
when ready player one comes out I
guarantee the price of joust is going to
skyrocket so I'm glad we have ours now
we had one instance where the world
record-holder of doubts came in if you
look over at the high scores there
you'll see you know kind of the highest
possible score that you can see and I
think he still had like you know plenty
of lives to continue on if he want to do
I like playing current consoles as well
but it's still kind of an isolating
experience it's just not the same as
being shoulder-to-shoulder playing the
same game with someone being able to
trash talk and have fun it's just such a
great social experience people who are
in there kind of late 20s to 40s who
just you know kind of have a little bit
of nostalgia for their youth for a time
when things were simpler when things are
easy and I think kind of stepping into
the arcade really kind of sends them
back in time a little bit
