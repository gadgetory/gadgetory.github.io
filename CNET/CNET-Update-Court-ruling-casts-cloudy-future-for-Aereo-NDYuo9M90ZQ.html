Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update this week while Google is showing
off shiny new smart watches at its
conference in San Francisco the
television start-up Aereo is dealing
with a death sentence the US Supreme
Court ruled that the two-year old
service violates copyright laws it was a
convenient way for cable cord cutters to
watch live local TV instead of
installing an antenna in your home to
get free over-the-air broadcast channels
you could just pay $10 a month for Aereo
to handle everything for you your tiny
antenna was in a room with other
customer antennas and the company sent
that TV signaled to you over the
Internet
Aereo did this without paying for any
broadcaster retransmission fees because
of the antenna loophole it was argued
that it was like an equipment rental
company but the court shut that loophole
down and ruled that Aereo is no
different from a cable company with
fancier technology since it was
broadcasting copyrighted works to the
public by all counts it looks like this
is the end of Aereo and if there is a
way it can continue it would have to
evolve to offer a different type of
service if you want to watch broadcast
TV without paying for cable you'll have
to stick with subscription services like
Amazon Netflix or Hulu but new episodes
sometimes are delayed by as much as a
week there's also the option of a
digital antenna there are a few
companies out there that are trying to
make the rabbit ear experience a bit
more snazzy take for example a product
called Moe who channel's the antenna and
box combo offers a channel guide it
mashes up the free broadcast stations
with apps and a web browser it'll go on
sale soon for $150
in other news apple's ipod touch line
got a bit of a reboot the ipod touches
which are basically iphones without the
phone they all dropped in price and the
cheapest model with only 16 gigs of
memory now comes in all the bright
colors and Apple added a camera to the
back before only the two higher memory
models got the back camera with all six
color options so that means now
the cheapest iPod Touch is $200 it
doesn't make much sense to buy an iPod
Touch if you already have a smart phone
but if you wish your iPod was an iPhone
you can use a mobile hotspot to give it
wireless access wherever you go so you
can stay in touch with messaging apps or
with Skype freedompop
is one that makes a hotspot case that
fits your iPod touch now the coverage
may not be perfect in your area but you
do get 500 megabytes of 4G data for free
every month that's your tech news update

stories at cnet.com and you can stay
