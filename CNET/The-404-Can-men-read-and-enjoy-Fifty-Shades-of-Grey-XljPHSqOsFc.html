fifty shades of grey because one of my
friends got it on the Internet yeah
throw things at me you got it I mean why
are you reading 50 shades of grey it's
not for you it's for who said is not for
me sub first of all everyone it's porn
okay it's like that movie secretary with
James Spader nangeln yeah so is it for
me I can read the time for you it's for
women public oh come on that is totally
sex no it's not it is not for women uh
come on Serge says my wife's reading
that and a banana it's for chicks Roscoe
I understand that a lot of women read it
but saying that it's like implicitly
written more women yes is I don't know i
don't i don't think that's that's true
men can physically understand yeah and
process the words in this book but it's
not for you and I is lifetime television
for men know that they come out and say
it's television for women uh Oh James
has not said that this is only for women
the chat room is unanimous there's a
chat room know anybody in the chat room
even read one sentence from 50 there the
six men on the show yeah okay it's for
moms it's a chick it's for mom
definitely for mom I think anyone that
is capable of having a sexual fantasy
can properly read 50 shades of green
enjoy and why is it for women I've read
certain passages yeah okay yeah and the
de sexual descriptions are our illusions
that only women could truly appreciate
ya different from a romance novel which
are for Regina stuff yeah okay romantic
novels for with actively retirement we
are in a row and romance novels or more
women are all about like strong muscular
men riding in on a horseback and
cynicism rescuing a woman from a tower
and then making love to her it talks
about like throbbing members it like
love pudding yes you know that's what
this is no that's not what this is a
modern equivalent no it's nice if that
what I were agreeing with that ready
that you haven't read
and you know i have read because it's
actually really really explicit men can
enjoy it i'm just not that the depth of
the target demographic for this book is
not men it's that simple you can't argue
with that i guess not i mean i think if
you probably surveyed a sample size of
like 200 people that yeah majority that
would probably be with it but I'm just
saying if there's no way that I can't
read this know you mess around okay you
can you can you're just gonna I don't
know i'm not actually read a book</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
