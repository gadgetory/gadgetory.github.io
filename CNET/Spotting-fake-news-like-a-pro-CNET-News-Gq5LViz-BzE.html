share information in the event of an
emergency unfortunately it also makes it
really easy to share fake information so
I'm here to help with some tips nobody
likes being wrong and you'll feel dumb
for sharing something fake unless it's
from the onion because they're brilliant
and sometimes we all need a good laugh
number one check the source see an
article with an absolutely crazy
headline like Tim Cook eats iPhone ten
at Apple event and aren't sure if it's
real look at the URL sometimes spoof
websites can look a lot like reputable
news organizations double check the
spelling of the site and the domain you
shouldn't trust tech news from CNET
unicorns dot CEO just like you shouldn't
trust strange URLs claiming to have
exclusive stories or breaking news if it
looks legit Google the keywords and
click on the news tab to see if other
official news outlets are running the
same story if you see more than one
major site reporting it you're probably
good to share number two check the image
if you're on Twitter the news moves fast
it moves so fast you might not feel like
you have time to double check that
retweet you're just trying to help boost
the signal I know I know we all want to
help but some massive jerks out there do
this thing where they steal a picture on
the internet and pretend it's a friend
or family member lost in chaos
that's where Google's reverse image
search comes in handy on a laptop you
can drag and drop a picture into Google
Images to see where else it pops up is
the photo on a ton of other websites has
it been online for years
is it a meme that you missed fake fake
fake and honestly really hurtful to the
people who actually do have missing
loved ones that need to be found number
three check your biases let's go back to
that crazy Tim Cook story I totally made
up if you love Android and hate Apple
you might be more than willing to
believe that story if it popped up in
your news feeds same for Apple fans if I
swapped out Tim Cook for Sergey Brin so
what do you do you head behind enemy
lines and pop that bubble don't be
afraid to go to websites you don't
normally visit in order to double-check
a story it kind of ties into checking
your sources but if all of your sources
have the same point of view it's really
only one source you know
number four check your gut if you take
all of these steps and something still
doesn't feel quite right it's okay not
to post right this second wait watch
listen you'll have more chances to share
verified information I promise
number five breathe this one is the
hardest because when you're drowning in
posts you can really get carried away
with sharing every single thing you see
and repeating things you've read take a
deep breath count to 60 go through the
previous tips then decide if it's
accurate and helpful if you share so
there you go five easy ways to do your
part to keep fake news from spreading
online and if you do all of these things
and somehow still end up being wrong
that's okay just pull the post or update
it with accurate information and a link
don't litter online just like you
wouldn't litter in real life take out
the trash we all want to help especially
when we feel helpless and social media
is one of the easiest ways to do that
but remember that spreading false
information to the exact opposite of
helping it obfuscates and diverts
attention from the people and stories
that need it you can do this we're
counting on you until next time be good
