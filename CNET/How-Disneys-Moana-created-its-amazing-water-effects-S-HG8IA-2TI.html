been home to our family Rhonda reef a
great danger is coming now we see a lot
of movies that I've had water in it
before but this movie is around water
all the time I mean what is one of the
hardest things first of all just about
basically building water but through
effects one of the things we knew about
is that we were going to be out there on
the water with our characters out on the
open ocean all the time we knew that the
existing solutions that were out there
on the market weren't exactly what we
were going to be looking for to achieve
the results we wanted so we developed
our own simulation engine called splash
what we found is there's certainly a
limitation on what you can simulate or
calculate on any given computer even if
you build a big monster machine so they
explored distributed computing allowing
our simulation engine to run across
multiple machines thinking all about the
same problem and essentially you know
supercomputer style here's an example
you can see just this one wave breaking
over probably you know 75 or 100 yards
and just that you can imagine that this
is in tens or hundreds of millions of
particles this is billions of particles
being calculated all at the same time
here you can see how we cut out a piece
of the water and that area is simulated
and affected by the boats motion outside
of that the general mathematical
equations for how an open ocean looks
are reasonably well known so we knew
that we could get good looking results
there but then the challenge became how
do we blend those two regions together
and really what needed to be a seamless
way so here we seas just sort of a
graphic depiction of what that is when
we started to get that together this is
going on back about a year ago we
started to see some promising results as
we tied in that simulated region into
the broader ocean if you look carefully
at this you can see on the left-hand
side there's kind of a seam back there
where there there's a slight
discontinuity between our simulation and
the open ocean this is a test a couple
months after that we're getting more
promising results we're starting to
arctor
the water to our liking root we
certainly want to evoke that incredible
feeling of the South Pacific and and
what that that water makes you think of
this is an early test you can see Moana
kind of bobbing up and down not entirely
in sync with the boat but we're really
encouraged by what we're getting from
the water itself I hero of man what it's
actually Maui shapeshifter demigod of
the wind and sea hero of men I interrupt
it from the top hero of men go so every
time we weren't on the open ocean we
tended to be on an island when we were
when we were on an island we tended to
be on the shoreline you see the sand
getting wet you see as the water recedes
the dampness gets absorbed back into the
sand all these things you experience
every time you go to the beach but you
don't really think about them so we
always want control so we have to
provide our artists in effects in
lighting with many many levels of
controls so that we can balance out the
colors we can balance out the movement
of the water in a way that is going to
give us the exact effect we're all
looking for so this these various colors
here represent those different mats and
so forth that we have control over
individually when it comes to tuning a
final shot so here you see a few
different types of splashes and we also
have things like water spouts and here's
a shot created from Foundation effects
where Maui is getting tormented by the
ocean and the only thing created by the
effects artist is just the splashes
coming off of Maui because the water
spouts themselves are just part of this
Foundation effects library super
effective for the movie and really
allowed us add incredible production
value to much of the movie in in a very
straightforward way and again focus on
the really really big effects
