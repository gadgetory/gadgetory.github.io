scooter could speed up your commute they
shrink down small enough to fit in the
trunk of a Miata or even on the trains
luggage racks with a good electric
scooter you never have to stop for
traffic they're small enough to weave
between cars fast enough to take the
bike lane and you can switch to the
sidewalk whenever you need but not all
folding electric scooters are the same
some like this fusion z1000 are built
like a tank it's durable but you might
not want to lift it's thirty six pound
frame others like the E Micro one might
weigh 17 pounds at most but it's utter
lack suspension means you'll feel every
bump in the rift to make sure your
scooter can handle all sorts of terrain
look for shocks and coil springs
they'll keep your ride smooth
comfortable handlebars also make a
surprisingly big difference and if
you'll be weaving through pedestrians or
cars short stubby handlebars are way
better than wide lines when it comes to
your scooters electric motor the more
watts the butter and you may want to
screw to with the motor upfront the
electric brake builds into many front
wheel drive scooters can slow you down
far more effectively than a rear disc
brake and keep you from skidding into
pedestrians or objects the best scooters
will also have a second foot brake over
the rear wheel so you can use both
brakes together in emergencies
personally I've found thumb levers give
me a much better grip on the handlebars
then bike style brake levers and I'd
recommend scooters with a real computer
mounted up top some scooters have simple
battery readouts the computers can keep
track of your mileage and sometimes
offer advanced features like cruise
control look for a scooter that charges
in just a few hours so you'll never run
out of juice but if you get stranded
without power it helped to have a
scooter with a low deck height too it's
much easier to kick and you don't have
to stretch to touch the ground if you
ever plan to ride at night it's nice to
have built-in headlights and taillights
folding handle bars on these scooters
may mean it may not be easy at those
lights yourself and if you do plan to
take your scooter on the bus or train
look for one you can fold down quickly
so you don't get trampled by a crowd
some scooters take several
time-consuming steps to shrink
while others are lightning-fast this
Glee on even has a carry handle like a
roving suitcase no matter which electric
scooter you pick be sure to wear a
helmet and stay safe you can check out
