innovative most exciting samsung gear vr
we design gr big gear vr especially for
innovative consumers and developers who
with the support of Samsung will move
virtual reality to the bold next new
level so all you need to do is you put
your note for writing like like we did
and you put on the headset just like you
did and now you're ready to go anywhere
now I'm singing this for the first time
so I'm just going to describe hopefully
there's something like well I'm so
behind us we could six people here
you're gonna have women in a tutu no one
said that voice I've got a couple of
acrobats in front of me and it's like
I'm in a theater it's like I'm there
because I can turn around now all I'm
watching is out to season in fact and
they're carrying on I mean it's
incredible a completely mobile VR is a
magical thing you can pick it up and
take it with you you can put it on and
then turn completely 360 degrees in the
virtual world but it's a hard problem to
do well and we need to bring a lot of
different technologies to bear on this
so one of the biggest ones is the
samsung Super AMOLED display the I
unlike an LCD panel which can take 10 or
20 milliseconds to change pixel state
the super-mo LEDs can turn on and off
almost instantly this lets us light up a
pixel and then turn it off a fraction of
a frame later which lets us kill motion
blur now these screenings are such high
resolution that there was a lot of
skepticism about what level of graphics
we would be able to render at the
consistent rates necessary for virtual
reality but Samsung has gotten us very
low level access to the hardware
platform here and this has enabled us to
develop an innovative software
architecture that can continue to
maintain smooth accurate updates from
the head tracking even when the system
is actually overloaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
