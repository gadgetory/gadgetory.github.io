before it may look familiar to you
because we reviewed the first generation
Honeywell lyric thermostat back in July
of 2014
back then smart thermostats were kind of
revolutionary we had seen the nest but
we hadn't seen anything else quite like
it
this was Honeywell's answer to the Nest
Learning Thermostat and in many ways it
did a great job of achieving that
competition but it also fell short in a
lot of ways to its performance just
wasn't on par so Honeywell is back now
with the second-generation model that
cost two hundred and fifty bucks the
same as nest but it still falls short I
really can't figure out why they would
release the second gen model with a lot
of the same glitches and performance
issues that the previous model had - so
geofencing that's a feature that this
model has that just really doesn't work
all that well with the first gen model
it would come in and out it was body it
was hit or miss this model was more of
the same it just really didn't work all
that well so if you are looking for a
smart thermostat I definitely wouldn't
recommend this one even though it does
add in-home kit compatibility so you can
actually use Siri and voice control
integrations to command your thermostat
set the temperature to 70 degrees they
set my temperature to 72 degrees and
it'll do it but is it worth it I don't
think so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
