on mobile and desktop and and here is
the new design this design reflects the
evolving face of your newsfeed it it's
designed for the way that we're all
sharing today and the trends that we see
going forward and now there are three
things that we're going to focus on
today in this design rich stories visual
and engaging your choice of different
feeds dig into any topic that you want
and a mobile inspired consistent you I
the same Facebook experience across all
of your mobile devices and desktop as
well now we're really proud to show you
this new design and we're excited to get
it into all of your hands into the hands
of all the people around the world who
love Facebook and now in order to get
into some more detail on this I'd like
to hand it off to our director of design
Julie zoo
thank you Mark so this is the current
state of our homepage today and this is
the section that's devoted to news feed
as you can see it's about a little less
than forty percent of the total real
estate of the screen and yet what we
talk to people we hear this over and
over again this is what matters to me
these are the things and my friends are
saying and sharing and doing and seeing
and the rest of it frankly is just
clutter so when we synthesize all this
feedback and we took a step back and we
thought about how we might make newsfeed
better it came back down to the stories
understanding what it is that people
wanted to share with the things that
they were posting and then designing the
very best container to let those stories
shine let's walk through a couple of
examples over the weekend some friends
and I had a little get together and one
of my friends is a really phenomenal
photographer she's always lugging around
her 22 megapixel you know canon mark 3
with her wherever she goes and I always
love to see the photos that she takes in
my newsfeed afterwards and yep they
don't quite represent the rich high
quality photos that she takes they say a
picture is worth a thousand words and
today's designs probably more like 500
in the new facebook redesign we're
really taking these photos and putting
them front and center so that they're
more visual more beautiful and more
immersive so that you can get a sense of
the experiences that your friends are
sharing from the moments that they
captured throughout their daily lives
and this isn't just for individual
photos we're also giving the photo
albums that you share a major facelift
so that if a friend of mine goes to
china and she takes these amazing photos
i can see them and instantly they tell
me the story of her adventures there my
friend Chris true hard loves to share
these articles these little gems that he
finds all around the internet in the new
design we want these attachments and
articles to really shine
this starts to resemble something more
like what you might see from the table
of contents of a well-curated magazine
we've got a much larger image a more
prominent title and as longer summary
that tells you what this article is
about where our we're also starting to
add the logo of the publishers in the
corner so that when I see something like
this I can instantly know what it is and
click and read the whole article if I
want to you take all of these stories
and you put them together and what do
you get you get this a richer simpler
more beautiful newsfeed on both desktop
web and on mobile that's focused on the
things that you care about what your
friends is are saying what your network
is sharing and what's going on with the
people and pages that you care about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
