a look at the main gear e x el 15 this
is something that you don't see terribly
often it's a 15 inch gaming laptop now
of course you see from boutique PC
makers like origin and alienware and
obviously main gear to be gaming
desktops big desktop replacement 17 inch
gaming laptops not as often to see
people the 15 inch ones but what you get
in this case is something that I think
Miz potentially valuable depending on
what your circumstances are it's
basically desktop replacement power
boiled down to a mid-sized laptop they
wouldn't exactly call portable but at
least you can pick it up and carry it
around with you you know maybe once a
week if you're going to somebody's house
or going from you know home to work or
something like that it's a little bit
plain looking and that's because unlike
alienware which can have a very
customized laptop bonding with the alien
head and the grills and the lights
smaller companies like main gear in
origin they get off the shelf laptop
bodies often from a company called clevo
and then they customize them by adding
in this case is a little Maingear logo
panel on the back and they put their
name right here on the speaker grill but
more importantly they customize the
inside what we've got in this particular
model which starts at about 14 99 this
configuration is about 2300 is the
latest and greatest laptop parts it's
got one of the new core i7 quad-core
intel cpus the third generation of those
which we sometimes use the coding Ivy
Bridge to describe it's also got the
very latest in nvidia graphics and when
you put those together you get a pretty
powerful gaming system that's offset by
the fact that even though it's very
expensive doesn't particularly look like
a premium product looks a little bit
generic the keyboard is kind of an older
style not not the widely spaced island
style keys were used to i also found
that with the number pad here the
keyboard kind of got pushed off a little
bit too far to the side i made a lot of
mistakes while typing on it and the
touchpad it's got the buttons below it
it's not a big click pad it doesn't have
special surface same services the rest
of the wrist rest just not a very
premium feel therefore the touchpad as
well you do get what you look for in a
gaming laptop which is a full 1080p
screen 1920 x 1080
illusion when I fired up the hablo free
on here I actually got tired of playing
on a smaller 15-inch screen so I just
took the hdmi output and plugged into a
big 24 inch monitor and was able to take
advantage of all the components while
moving it on to a bigger screen that is
actually one of the one of the nice
extras here you get not just HDMI but
also display port and DVI outputs and a
whole bunch of audio ins and outs as
well this is definitely a good system if
you're a multimedia junkie and have a
lot of things you want to hook up to i'm
dan ackerman and that is the main gear
