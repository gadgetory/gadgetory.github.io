Google's smart display so the first
thing you notice about this thing when
you hold it in your hands is how tight
it is look at this thing this is my hand
and this is the length of the thing in
its entirety compared to the other smart
displays we've seen this thing is
minuscule so this thing is not a camera
the other smart displays we tested have
a camera this is actually an ambient
light sensor so as this thing shows
pictures it can adapt to the brightness
of those pictures based on the light
it's picking up in the room these are
microphones for your voice commands
here's a little mute button on the back
this does have fairly big bezels going
around the screen which feels
unnecessary and it's only a seven-inch
screen still it's kind of cute it looks
like a little bit like they took a
tablet and they took a Google home Mini
and they sort of squished them together
but still I'm gonna give it cute it has
that fabric back that's similar to the
Google home Mini like the mini it's
available in a few different colors and
there's not that much else to say about
this thing until we plug it in and see
how it works so that's what we're gonna
do
the Google home hum is available
starting today for a hundred and fifty
dollars you can buy it in chalk charcoal
aqua and sand you can control the volume
with this toggle on the back otherwise
use voice controls or the touchscreen
but this isn't Google's first smart
display not really
the Lenovo smart display in the JBL link
view both use Google assistant you can
issue all the same commands that you
went to an ordinary Google home smart
speaker even the way the touchscreen
works is very similar from one device to
the next it comes in handy for watching
videos and looking at pics you can watch
live TV with you to TV
it also shows more info if you ask about
the weather or search for a place to eat
search for a recipe and it'll show you
the steps and you can scroll through
them or multitask while you cook this
touch screen and Google assistant are a
pretty good combo if you're looking for
kitchen help and that's the basics so is
it good
in short yeah but the smart display
landscape is becoming more competitive
and strangely this is Google's answer to
this thing look at these two the echo
show could practically eat this thing
still I don't feel like these are being
marketed to the same people and if you
want something more like this consider
the Lenovo smart display they're roughly
the same size they're roughly the same
price and they both have cameras and
this one doesn't the NBA EQ sensor also
works well the pics look much more
natural than on a normal screen that
blares them like a billboard Google
assistant will even find your best
personal pics for your ambient screen
slideshow with a feature called live
albums if I take a new pic and add it to
my album of co-workers it'll show up on
my screen automatically a couple of
annoyances the integration with the nest
hello video doorbell hasn't worked
reliably for us so far it won't always
announce who's at the door and show up
on the screen like it's supposed to and
even when it does you can't talk to the
person with your home hub
that's a strange omission that I'd hope
will be patched soon but it's solenoid
also Google had a few oversights here
scrolling works well or not at all it
can send directions to your phone but
not if you ask directly for them and
again I'm sure most of these are gonna
get fixed but expect to encounter an
occasional annoyance if you're buying
this thing right
now I've gotten to spend some time with
it I really like all the new features
packed into this tiny little thing
scroll down for a view of your smart
home you'll see shortcut buttons here
for common tasks these lights show up
based on the location of your home hub
and you can tap here and see all of your
smart home devices room by room
it's really well organized and I really
like it so this whole view is going to
roll out as an update to Lenovo screen
and JBL's screen as well but that
doesn't take away from how useful it is
the hub's a good fit if you want
something smaller and more unassuming
given its size you could literally find
a spot for it almost anywhere near a
plug it has a fine mic and the sound
quality is passable but not nearly as
good as the other smart displays we've
tested it's not even quite as good as
the Google home Mini but that's about
the level it's at so again it's a
different kind of smart display it's not
the same premium behemoth as the others
but it's an affordable and cute smart
home control center that'll fit into any
room and it fills that role very well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
