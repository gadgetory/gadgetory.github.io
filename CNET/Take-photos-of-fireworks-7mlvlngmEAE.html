as difficult as you might think whether
you've got a smartphone or a DSLR I'm
going to show you a couple of top tips
to make sure your firework photos are
spectacular the key of all firework
photography is stabilization so if you
have a smartphone you might want to
invest in something like this it's a
gorilla pod grip tight you place your
smartphone in the cradle and it's stable
of course if you have a DSLR a standard
tripod is all you'll need first up
shooting on a smartphone you can use
your default smartphone camera app if
you want to use this make sure you turn
off your flash and HDR mode
it might sound obvious but make sure you
find out where the fireworks are gonna
be set off from and get into position
early because you want to beat the
crowds and get the best vantage point
you'll definitely want to take a couple
of test shots using a long exposure
first up get an idea of what the
exposure will be like optimum for the
light conditions that surround you and
make sure you use that for the fireworks
when they start to go off now onto
dslr's
you'll want to use manual mode and set
everything else to your liking use a
mid-range aperture something between f/8
and f/11 keep your ISO low around 100 an
experiment with different shutter speeds
during the fireworks with different
effects a good starting point is around
three seconds but you can definitely
make it longer or shorter depending on
this sort of effects that you want to
gather and of course depending on the
ambient light you'll also want to use
self timer on your DSLR so you don't
introduce any camera shake but if you
have a remote shutter release this also
works really well don't feel left out if
you have a compact camera though because
there are plenty of tips on how to use a
compact for great firework photos over
at CNET I'm Alexis Avedis and remember
have fun with your photography</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
