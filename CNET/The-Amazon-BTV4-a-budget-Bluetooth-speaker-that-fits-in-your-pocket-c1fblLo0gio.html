a first look at the Amazon basics btv
for Bluetooth speaker this thing is
available right now on Amazon for 20
bucks
which makes it the cheapest speaker
we've seen that can also play wirelessly
it also feels and sounds pretty much
like what you'd expect at that price
there's a couple buttons on the side for
pairing it to a Bluetooth enabled phone
or computer and there's also a port for
hooking up an aux cable but you'll have
to supply your own the bottom has a
couple of rubber strips that keep the
speaker from moving around on the table
and the three watt speaker inside keep
it playing music at average volumes on
the plus side amazon rates the
rechargeable battery at 10 hours which
is about double the expectancy of other
speakers we've tested here keep in mind
though that your mileage may vary
depending on how loud your playing music
so in terms of sound quality you
definitely won't be blown away nor will
it fill a room with super deep bass but
it does work well if you're planning to
use it next to a sink or on your dresser
just keep in mind that it will distort
at loud volumes so what you see is what
you get with the BT v4 for 20 bucks you
get a decent sounding speaker with a
rechargeable battery and even a small
bag to put it in while you're carrying
it around you can read more details in
my full review on CNET but that's going
to do it for me
I'm Justin you you just took a first
look at the Amazon basics B TV for
Bluetooth speaker thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
