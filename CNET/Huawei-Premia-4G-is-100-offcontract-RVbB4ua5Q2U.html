dollar Android phone with no contracts
I'm just a good ball court for cnet this
is the huawei premia 4g the pro me is a
4G LTE phone for metropcs it runs
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich so it
isn't the most up-to-date version but it
will have pretty much all the basics for
a modern Android operating system it's
very close to stock Android not entirely
there's still a couple touches that are
all of Huawei's own but if you're
looking for something with a very
minimal Android skin then this is a good
option there is however quite a bit of
bloatware specifically there's an app
called my extras and it will ping you
relentlessly unless you go ahead and
change the settings or disable the app
in the app manager there is a 4-inch
wvga screen it is bright and colorful
not the sharpest I've seen but
completely acceptable for this kind of
device it's a black phone with a lighter
grey backing very finely textured
surface so it won't slip out of your
hands but it isn't that absolute most
comfortable either because it doesn't
have that soft touch coating however I
have no complaints on the back there's a
decent 5 megapixel camera with LED flash
nice to see that flash there on the
front is a 1.3 megapixel front-facing
camera the rear facing camera can
capture 720p HD video performance is a
bit of an issue on this phone I found
the 4g LTE network is slower than other
LTE networks but it was pretty
consistent and didn't hang battery life
is really short it's only rated 24 hours
of talk time and I noticed that the
battery drained really quickly
especially if I had the screen timeout
on anything longer than about 30 seconds
or a minute ninety nine dollars after
fifty dollar mail-in rebate is a really
phenomenal price for an unlocked phone
however I think you can do a little bit
better for metropcs and I would
recommend taking a look at the LG motion
4G if you're looking for a phone in this
price point I'm Jessica doll court for
cnet this has been your first look at
the huawei premia 4G
