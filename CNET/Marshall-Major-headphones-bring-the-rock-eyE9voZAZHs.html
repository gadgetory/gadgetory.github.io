today I'm looking at the Marshall major
fx50 headphones while most of the
current crop of celebrity-endorsed
headphones beats Simon Cowell's exes and
so on a voice to sound good with pop and
urban music there are very few designed
for rock and this is where the Marshalls
come in the company has been designing
guitar amps for 50 years and these
headphones are designed to commemorate
that and like Marshall amps these cans
are also designed to go to 11
the headphones feature a sturdy build
our collapsible and come with a cloth
bag for storing them away as far as
looks go these wouldn't be Marshall
headphones if they didn't include some
details from the iconic amplifiers while
the Marshall minor earphones look like
amp knobs these look like the amps
themselves with a gold trim a tweed type
cloth on the earpieces and the same
vinyl that covers the boxes on the ear
band they're just okay comfort wise but
you can bend them to fit and they reject
noise quite well if you have an iPhone
there is a three button remote and mic
and the mic will also work with other
smartphones the cable also features a
coiled section so they can stretch up to
twice its length if you need it to
stretch to the back of your computer for
example sound quality is rocking as
you'd expect with a very warm yet
detailed sound that really suits heavy
music but they're not ham-fisted or
overly pumps like beats there is more
mid-range than anything else travel
detail is a little bit reticent and
symbols can be a little bit splashy but
they're very well balanced overall
compared to the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins p3
they're much more exciting and fun and
also thirty bucks cheaper if you're
looking for a sturdy rock centric pair
of headphones that will match your
Zildjian t-shirt these are the ones to
go for this has been ty Pendlebury for
