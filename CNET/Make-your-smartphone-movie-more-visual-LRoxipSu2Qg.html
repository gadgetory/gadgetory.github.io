week we're looking at moving pictures
okay so we're looking at ways that we
can utilize our pocket cameras to get
nice fluid shots with a bit of motion to
it so one of our big challenges with
pocket filmmaking is we normally find
people film with their devices in one of
two ways
they either stand there rigid like a
statue and the shot never moves or they
do this and they don't really care how
they're holding the camera it's just
jello and vibrating and just crazy
pictures all over the place and once you
blow that up a little bigger screen
you'll find your audience just can't
watch it but if one ban the digital zoom
do not use it ever it is terrible all
that's doing is its blowin up the pixels
on the resolution of your smartphone
camera it is not actually getting it
closer to the picture in this example if
I'm standing in the garden I'm just
zooming in on something using my digital
zoom
look how boring that is I got to stand
there and wait for that camera to go on
in look at the subject pull back out
again it's slow it's one steady pace and
and boring whereas in this other example
if I just move straight in on that item
that same shot and I bring my camera
closer to the subject and then I walk
back out again everything in the frames
changing it's far more interesting much
more vibrant
your audience will love you for it tip 2
is to introduce an active frame now you
might say what's an active frame in this
little example I'm about to show you I'm
filming something quite static so I'm
holding the smartphone right in front of
me and I'm just not moving now if I just
move and shift my weight from left leg
to right leg just from side to side you
see the background the foreground
proportions changed just a little bit
and it just keeps a picture nice and
flowing and it looks great
so that's called an active frame try it
it's really easy to do and it just helps
lift your pictures a lot
tip three is a really really basic one
but one that we all forget and that is
to show a fresh perspective a new point
of view so rather than just putting the
camera eye level where we're all used to
looking at the camera position it's
somewhere else in frame up high down low
show the audience something different
from an angle they're not used to seen a
very simple way of getting some motion
of the shots when you're out and about
is to look at the things that are moving
around you such as lifts escalators
travel adders they're all great
platforms you can just stand on and
shoot and get some nice motion happening
in your footage closer to home have a
look inside your house and see what
you've got that you can utilize put your
camera on to get a bit of motion
happening such as a lazy susan most
kitchens have got one of these and you
can just pop your camera on top of that
spin it around and get a fantastic point
of view now if we want to get fancy
there's a couple of great devices we can
utilize to stabilize and get motion into
our shots we've seen the Steadicam
braces we can get through our pocket
cameras well now there's other things
such as this cam caddy these are great
because you can a fix your camera to the
base plate there and hold these really
really low to the ground for nice
tracking shots another fantastic product
is a device called a slider you simply
attach a smartphone camera and push it
from left to right to give these
beautiful gliding style shots I've got
one of these laying around your garage a
fantastic filmmaking tool stick your
camera on top find a nice smooth surface
take it for a spin you'll be surprised
that sorts of shots you can get
however step it up a notch and look at
this it's called a pico Dali these are
really really cool and this is my pick
of the toolbox if you want to get
something for Christmas
these devices are amazing they've got a
tripod screw mount on the top there you
fix your camera you can lock the wheels
in any one direction or another take it
for a spin on a smooth surface and
you've got beautiful dolly shots
wherever you go super portable alright
that's it for me it's time to start
wrapping things up the inspiration of
pocket film I'm gonna leave you with
this week was called The Fixer I was all
shot on an iPhone believe it or not it's
very dark gruesome so every bit
screamish give it a mess but if you want
to check out some fantastic pocket
cinematography The Fixer is it next time
we catch up I'm gonna teach you
everything I know about lighting for
pocket filmmaking I think you're going
to enjoy it see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
