ocz vector 180 solid-state drive this
one is the latest high-end drive on the
market trying to compete to this one
from Samsung but first this one is a
standard internal drive to replace these
replicas dry like this one right here
for a laptop and this one right here for
desktop computer it support SATA 3 sick
vb per second and will work in any place
where record drive is being used now
what the benefits of SSD at the fact
that they have no moving parts and they
are very fast and generally better for
data we return though you can only write
so much data to them before they become
unreliable in something called endurance
rating with this Victor 180 for example
you can write up 250 gigabyte of data to
it per day every day for five years the
total of ninety one terabyte there's a
lot of data because most of us do not
write more than five big per day and
sure not every day but other SSD can
have a high endurance the samsung for
example it has up to 150 Tara by the
vector also have shorter warranty of
five years the Samsung has tenure but
it's going to come with shield plus
feature meaning that you will need to
show the serial number of the dry before
you can have support and also have it
replaced in case of defect ocz will also
pay for you to ship the defective unit
back another good thing is that the
vector 180 here come with a very cool
feature called powerful in management
basically it has power supply on itself
so that it can take the time and finish
all the writing and shut down properly
in case of sudden power loss that puts
the fact that it comes with this desktop
adapter right here me and the drive
works really well in desktop where
certain power lost happen a lot more
often than in a laptop now in testing
the new drive here performed quite well
but not as well as some other high-end
drive basically it register the
sustained real-world copy speed up some
three
50 megabyte per second for both reading
and writing but still if you replace
your hard drives in a computer with this
one the computer's performance will
improve a huge deal now the best thing
about the drive here is the price it
available in four capacity from how to
20 gig to a 960 gig and cost between 90
dollars and five hundred dollars now
those are the suggested retail price and
that means the strip right gonna be
quite a bit lower among the driver check
out my full review at cnet com basically
if you don't expect topknot bands Mach
number well you'll be happy with this
one very important though do not expect
to look this cool at home after all this
is my hand and that's because I'm down
low and it has been the first look at
the ocz vector 180s or stayed dry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
