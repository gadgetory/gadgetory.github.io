welcome to the Apple by this week it's
all about apples announcements for the
ipad new that's what I'm calling it so
let's get to it and to the stories now
this was tim cook's first major launch
event and we made sure to give him the
warm apple byte welcome
yeah we get out of hand sometimes but
forget whatever rumors you heard the new
iPad is being called the new iPad and it
delivers on a lot of what we expected a
Retina Display that's crystal clear with
twice the resolution of previous iPads
at 2048 x 1536 with 1080p video support
and it's really the most impactful new
feature now the new a5x processor is
still dual-core but it brings quad-core
graphics power you can be sure games and
apps will look pretty sexy on this then
we have the rear camera it's been
boosted of 5 megapixels with 1080p video
capture at 30 frames per second it's a
welcome improvement but unfortunately
this is really going to kick start the I
take pictures with my iPad in public
phenomena I've already seen it at
concerts and basketball games you do not
want to be that person yeah don't be
that guy now apples also bringing a 4G
LTE option for faster data connectivity
voice dictation is really nice but the
lack of full series support is a letdown
it really should have been on the level
with the iPhone but i forgot its beta
just advertised as an official feature
and the best part with all these
improvements you're still getting around
10 hours of battery life for those long
lonely nights now the new iPad goes on
sale March 16th pricing starts at 499
for the 16 gig Wi-Fi and 629 for the
Wi-Fi 4g model and in a trend that Apple
started with the iphone they'll still be
offering the previous gen 16 gig ipad 2
starting at 399 for a lower entry price
point now if you're wondering which 4g
ipad you should consider verizon says
they'll be supporting the hotspot
feature on launch and your monthly data
plan will include hotspot use instead of
charging you an extra 20 bucks per month
like they've done with smartphones can
you believe the carriers actually plane
nice well not so nice AT&amp;amp;T is working
with Apple to get the feature enabled
but it won't be ready for launch time so
here's the breakdown for data pricing on
both carriers with their data plans with
the future of 80s hotspot feature to be
determined now mine's on pre-order but
if you are hoping to get an iPad new on
its release date you might have to wait
in an actual apple store line with
smelly people after online or
for certain models are slipping past the
date or you could try Radio Shack that's
right The Shack is the only other
company at the moment taking pre-orders
if you buy a fifty dollar gift card from
them first nice guys all right the Apple
TV also saw an update no not that Apple
TV but the little $99 black box it now
supports 1080p video playback from
iTunes Netflix YouTube and more you'll
also be able to stream previous itunes
purchases like your movies TV shows and
music except those from Universal and
Fox right now due to content agreements
that Apple's working out on the software
side the ilife collection on the iPad is
complete with iPhoto for 499 getting its
own dedicated app with a full ensuite of
editing tools that we've never seen from
Apple a cool new feature for making
picture journals that's like a scrap
board with widgets you can add and
having new ways of sharing your pictures
like beaming them or sending them to
facebook now garageband in iMovie were
also updated with improvements of their
own for 499 apiece now with the release
of the new iPad apples also increase
their over-the-air download limit for
the app sort of 50 megs from the
previous 20 meg limit but the best
software update hands down has to be iOS
5.1 it's available now and it addresses
the number-one requests the ability
delete photos from the photo stream the
camera shortcut is now always visible on
the lock screen with improved face
detection audio is optimized on the iPad
to sound louder and clearer for videos
but if you're on AT&amp;amp;T and you did the
update for your iphone 4s when you're
connected to their hspa+ network you'll
now see a 4g icon even though it's
technically not 4g just faster 3g that
they call 4g but you know what i don't
care this is the most amazing update
ever end I might as well just go out
upgrade to a 4s so i can have apples
first 4g phone alright will be here next
week just a day before the ipad new
comes out but send us all your questions
to the alpha beta cnet com for our email
episode that's going to do for this
week's show i'm brian song we'll catch
you next time for another bite of the
Apple
