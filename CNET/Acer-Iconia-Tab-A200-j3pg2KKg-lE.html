follow-up to his a 500 in a 100 tablets
the Iconia Tab a 200 can it stand from
the pack of nearly weekly Android tablet
releases that's what we're here to find
out people the 8200 has the lowest price
yet of any post honeycomb 10-inch tablet
it has expandable memory options a full
USB port a well-designed and grippy
backside which I really appreciated and
is upgradable to Ice Cream Sandwich
while running honeycomb we saw poor
Wi-Fi performance but performance
greatly improved we actually did upgrade
to the new OS unfortunately there's only
one low quality front-facing camera and
there's no back camera there's also no
HDMI and Acer ring Acer's app and
bookmark hub is slow to start and while
it should make launching apps more
efficient it doesn't if the a200 was a
member of the Expendables
it will probably be the Randy Couture
character I don't even remember his name
you probably didn't even notice him in
the movie but the point is it's dull is
boring with no real special features at
its current price it's the cheapest way
to get Ice Cream Sandwich on a tablet
but that's expected to change over the
next few months however if you can live
with a couple of missing features the
8200 is the current cheapest
non-contract android deal out there if
you're interested check out the full
review for more information once again
I'm Eric Franklin and this is the Acer
Iconia Tab A two
