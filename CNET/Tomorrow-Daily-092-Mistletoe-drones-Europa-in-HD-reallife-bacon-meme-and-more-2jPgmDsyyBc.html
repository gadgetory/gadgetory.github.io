remastered image of Europa and explains
why it's such an interesting place an
internet meme becomes a reality and yes
there's bacon make it involved I like it
and of course a chain restaurant this
holiday season has decided to use drones
to help you hook up which is weird
tomorrow daily
greetings citizens with the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best peak
talk show in the known universe i am
your host Ashley skeletron amis always
uppercutting the sky little Matt little
mac I knew you were gonna do that joke
that's hot we spend too much time
together do you say okay how are you
dogs it's true they're they're great
yeah well you should are you know well
little chilly willy's losing weight he's
fat guys he's on a diet Thank You
Shirley on a diet do you have like a
montage like there's no rocky montage
now um he'll talk he literally a year
ago looked like a barrel with legs and
now he looks like a dog I love that's
bad dogs so I don't want to hear about
this really unhealthy handle lose weight
so ah the other the other stupid idiot
Bailey is great she's fine she's tiny
she's very skinny and spindly and very
hyper so why are we talking about my dad
so we got to talk about space and robots
and stuff oh you need good stuff yeah
yeah let's hit the headlines
okay so we already have a rover on Mars
we've had we've landed a couple Rovers
on Mars curiosity's their spirit
opportunity always great all these great
spacecraft are out there out and about
well uh Europa is sort of one of the
next big destinations for NASA okay and
this week NASA released a remastered
high-definition photo of Europa's
surface which is a moon for on Jupiter
it's its orbits Jupiter this is one of
Jupiter's moons if you weren't familiar
with what Europa is this picture that
they released is really cool because
it's actually what the human eye would
see if you were looking at the planet oh
it's all their belt appropriate colors
which is super awesome and they also
released this video that you're seeing a
little bit of here but I highly
recommend you actually go seek it out on
NASA's YouTube page and listen to it
because you've got scientists on there
explaining why Europa is so fascinating
and why it's it's sort of this really
cool place of interest that they're kind
of gonna try to do a flyby of soon not
land well you got to fly by first and
then and then the next step would be
logically sending a rover there just
like we did with Mars okay okay so um
this is really neat though this image
that they made were all was created with
images taken by the galileo spacecraft
which was put into service like
originally they had sent it out and and
then decided at one point like oh why
don't we just have it like orbit Europa
I'm like get some photos and do some
passes and figure it out so this is what
it would kind of look like fear on the
surface you'll be see Jupiter right
there which is kind of crazy so the
image that they release this HD
remastered image was take they were
taken by Galileo on the first and
fourteenth orbits in like 95 and 98 but
they combined all these pictures to
create this high def remastered image
which is stunning and NASA said if you
want sort of a key to how this image
looks they said the areas that are blue
and whitish are relatively pure water
ice on the on the picture oh and then
the ones the spots on the pictures that
are reddish and brown on Europa are non
ice components in higher concentrations
and then the polar regions are
little bit more blue and the equator
regions are a little more white which
suggests a difference in I screen size
so bigger bigger piece of ice um so yeah
it's a really cool thing and I really
love that they that they released this
sort of hi-def remastered sort of image
of your rope I just really love that
we're able to even do that like just the
idea that like hey we're going to
release this HD this amazing huge image
of a moon I go citizen that is so far
away in the solar system I mean it would
take us a really long time to get there
was just really cool like I like that
they did that so how long do you think
before you head out there well I know I
as far as I'm aware that they are
already planning their in the planning
stages of sending doing the flyby free
rope and I don't forget when that
launches but it's within I think the
next like five to ten years so probably
closer to five to ten but I like I'm
sorry to anybody who's actually at NASA
JPL that I didn't have that like written
down but we can find out more about it
you just head over nasa's website and
really you should be going there anyway
because it's awesome yeah so tell me um
oh ok so it means so so this this story
is just fun stories like not it's like
it's going to the future because you
have you heard of the meme press button
receive bacon oh yeah so it's like the
hand dryer this is the meme yeah so you
see this on a hand dryer just images
it's me press the button and dry your
hands well the Internet turn this in to
push button receive bacon okay and it
does the meme hilarious during a
hackathon a hackathon called destruction
as a great hack a 48-hour hackathon
these these clever young students
decided that they would make a bacon
printer so press button receive bacon
guys so they went ahead and they they
did it and now the whole theme of this
hackathon was light it up okay so this
is basically using a laser printed it's
a laser printer okay a laser printer
uses a heat source that's underneath the
roller rena fuses okay i gotcha and it's
from the from the roller so the light is
essentially heating it so that it's a
really hot roller because they asked to
be hot enough to transfer it heats up to
they thought 30 50 but it ended up going
up to 450 now here they are using it if
you're watching is like just enough to
cook some delicious bacon
they're putting it in yep they're
putting it through the door and it comes
out on the other side semi-cooked there
me kicked they're hoping to get it
hotter and obviously there's a lot of
like four people have to hold the thing
oh yeah the cut you feed it in but again
it was a 48-hour hackathon IM assuming
overseeing is like some of the other
stuff they put together yes they put
together a skull fan first I don't know
how about Santa a lighted up themed and
then there was a it was an Altoids
infinite mirror okay which again when
she saw ya light it up so so there you
go yeah basically it disassembled a
laserjet they used a drivetrain and the
fuser roller to to create the heat cook
the bacon there now there you go I
wonder if they'll refine that maybe in a
year and hit better system maybe we'll
see it hit Kickstarter within a year
there is seemingly very proud of it
their whole like website and I like that
yeah it's it's got twelve thousand views
on YouTube and God knows it's gonna have
more so so I have a quiet I've the
hashtag of the day oh you got a Shen
okay okay so hashtag of the day would be
TD meme and the question would be what
meme would you want to see brought to
life and how would it work okay uh why
don't you go first so if the mines
already happened which is the Doge meme
came right to life my an actual like
friend of mine I follow her on Twitter
as follows me her name's Scarl Regina I
dressed up her shib her little shiba inu
okay as dose with with little images I
were all around at Ted so it was great
she like put took a harness I'm like
made a little little words like so then
you pull scary or that no I got to talk
about it I'll put it I'll put it over
this right now is imposed Judy come ova
wit you know how to if you have your
phone no fish Halloween okay yeah
all right mine would be the Alara
dicaprio one where he's like skipping
you know yeah that's a good one and I'd
just make him do it all the time you
have to do it like once a day once a day
or said Keano well that's real life
that's real life that's so it got to
reel in here good ya know I'm sad
thinking about sad keanu you know you
can buy a 3d printed mini sad keanu that
you can put on top of your monitor i
want that i want to put him on my
shoulder it's pretty great it's for that
shelf of the photoshop can somebody
photoshop said Keano inside our studio
sitting right now
on his shoulder yeah okay there we go
okay um i have to tell you about this
story because there I have some
questions about it i'm not really sure
go into it with question I'm going into
this with question so we have questions
so TGI Fridays in the UK so not here in
the US but in the UK announced that that
they were going to be throwing some
drones into their dining area now first
of all that seems like it would be
really loud but here's what the drums
are doing if you're watching this video
for just listening a drone is carrying
around mistletoe and then hovering it
over people again blowing all of their
there is no scuff on the tiniest like
they're gonna blow the food around like
I don't even know what's going on it's
they're encouraging people to make out
yeah see this is like really
inappropriate okay so they're they're
gonna send drones with mistletoe around
as part of their new together miss
marketing campaign and so I guess there
was some nationwide survey where fifty
three percent of UK citizen said that
they had kissed under the mistletoe at
Christmas time which is that's forty
seven percent that had not so they
thought that was kind of a high
percentage and that uh and that they
were gonna throw some drones into the
restaurant for people to kiss under the
mistletoe which okay first of all uh
what if I go to like I'm like what do
you do I your brother yeah we're like
your brother or your mom or whatever
it's like weird you got a good guy just
bite the bullet and it's it's a lot
mistletoe la is is not negotiate there
are eight ton of glaring issues with
this first of all loud by the way and if
you are listening and not watching it
was also a camera on it so it like watch
them another level watch you and I'm
sure they'll make some promotional video
about it after the holidays or as part
of the camera in this kids I think it's
adorable I think it's adorable but there
are glaring issues there Gloria she's
just live again like you said wind like
there's a whole bunch of easy you see
the girl and her hair's like blowing
around it's like it's gonna get in your
face and then it's all if you're people
watching can know another glaring issue
that we're completely missing because
I'm sure there's a longer list sound
sound is a big one also employee
interference cuz the employees are
supposed to be the ones piloting these
drones oh really yeah I don't think
they're that and then also there's a lot
of drunk people right so what are their
just SWAT near and
knock it down and hit somebody queries
the drain um but I'm gonna kiss you
drone this should make a much cuter like
you too but like if it wasn't tied
around a company like it was a
commercial I'm as a commercial I'm gonna
teach our fridays and beat together for
together miss love is that every table
yeah no I'm not gonna hate I mean I
don't know how you'd want to do it but I
don't think a real-life deployment of
drones is like the way to go come to TGI
Fridays where we've forced you to kiss
your girlfriend but yeah like a first
date you're just not even sure what if
you just ate an onion burgers I don't
eat garlic have to stop serving garlic I
mean could go on and on but we're not
going to we're going to now today we're
gonna take a break we're gonna take a
break we'll take a quick 30 second break
we're gonna eat some garlic and then
we're gonna come back and we've got
we've got some great stuff I'm pretty
excited don't get to it sit sit like
with some great stuff it's gonna be
amazing cool don't click away it's
tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show it is a tuesday
which is i think actually kales favorite
day of the week i love tuesdays because
it's new release day
I think we got to just burn through
these it's also talking tuesday thats
its also team fortress 2 or just tuesday
yeah okay let's go so there's so much go
through these first first off number one
persona q is out this is a very
anticipated title from what I've been
hearing I have not played it yet but I'm
hearing it's very very good it's on 3ds
if you got your 3ds or maybe you're
thinking about getting one for yourself
for Christmas because you're selfish and
you want to buy stuff for you yeah I
wasn't it Kalin uh so yeah this uh I've
been hearing great great things the
persona franchise is really I mean it's
an acclaimed franchise listen if you
like if you like anything remotely good
in gaming just just go get persona q
that's wow that is a bold statement
continued go to the next one goes we
have the imitation game is in theaters
this is that this is I'm actually really
interested in this it's got the batch oh
okay then yeah the batch stars as
touring he sees playing touring which is
like the the grandfather of modern
cookie I mean is like this guy is the
guy so this is like sort of his kind of
experience during the war and the code
cracking and all that stuff okay this
sounds pretty awesome very very good
he's he is generating a lot of award
show buzz for this role for his for his
performance as Alan Turing so highly
recommended and obviously uh you noticed
Tywin Lannister's in this movie so also
i would go with it just for that tying
the guy with my deal dance great actors
is just great actors um okay normally we
do not jump on the hype train for
trailers however hold on yeah get your
boots ready cuz we're gonna get on the
hype train for a second we're gonna talk
about some huge trailers that are
dropping this week surprises number one
star wars the force awakens oh the force
had a spot the first woke up it had its
coffee it's ready to show you a teaser
it's ready for run which is I'm very
excited about show but it's not out not
yet so here is the thing there are only
a select number of cities showing this
movie and JJ Abrams on the bad robot
twitter posted this picture and he says
a tiny peek at what we're working on so
select theaters cross-country hope you
enjoyed have a most
excellent thanksgiving best jjs got a
little tight fighter on there's a good
through it's 88 seconds apparently
because it says like 88 seconds on the
bottom but here's the catch okay so I'm
gonna pull up the list of cities that
you can see this in its I think it's
like six or nine city united states
sorry everyone else and hopefully but
here's what I'm hoping is that they'll
do the same thing like maybe on monday
they'll release the trailer to the
Internet at large they have to their
right only going to launch it on
Saturday my guys think the whole jailer
just because some idiot who I'm probably
watching yeah yeah is going to record it
and put it online and they're gonna be
like that we just got to put it up just
like they did with the Avengers 2
trailer anyway Oh Barney what Allison I
agree with that ok so I like but the
thing is as they did this before for
phantom menace and people were buying
tickets to a bug's life and I forget
what the other movie was but they put a
teaser trailer in front of them people
were so jacked about seeing a Star Wars
movie again that people would buy
tickets to the movie to like a bug's
life walk in watch a trailer and just
leap and not get their money back no and
then they would just leave so okay
trailers gonna play before movies at 30
theaters starting this friday and
continuing through the weekend here's
here's the list the whole list due out
let's do a few yeah okay you got los
angeles irvine San Fran San Jose San
Diego toronto and vancouver so canadians

washington DC Miami Atlanta Chicago
Boston Detroit Minneapolis Kansas City
New York Cleveland Philadelphia
Nashville Knoxville Dallas Houston
Austin Salt Lake City Seattle Milwaukee
Phoenix okay so major US cities
yesterday no nothing for anyone that
lives outside the US no sorry all right
let's go but it'll show up on the
internet and speaking of showing up on
the internet we were actually expecting
the Jurassic world trailer to drop on
Thursday Thanksgiving I was supposed to
drop on Thanksgiving uh but they
released it a couple days early I would
love to awesome but we don't know but
I'm assuming because they were heading
off a Marvel situation where the age of
Ultron trailer dropped early so we're
not going to show you too much of it
just in case you don't want to be
spoiled some people don't like to watch
trailers this is like all act 1 stuff
but obviously looks like the park is
open they were not kidding in the the
teaser mark is in fact open for people
to visit now I'm and Chris Pratt stars
in this
looks really interesting obviously takes
place you were saying 20 years in the
future for your choice dress 10 years in
the future basically this is my favorite
part yeah the longest sure this is a
Tyler saurus which is a they've long
wanted to put one in the Jurassic yeah
the telus horses but I love so but
basically I Isla Nublar the original
Island has been rejuvenated right yeah
as a resort rather than just an
amusement park and so now people are
going again higher level of technology
and unfortunately a new type of
dinosaurs and things go terribly wrong
wait no they don't this one everything's
totally totally goa trance fine everyone
just has a good time they go home there
sleepy no it doesn't look like that in
the trailer looks like they're running
from dinos hey Logan way to go see we
watched the whole trailer we gave away a
bunch of stuff sorry however like you
knew what was gonna happen address its
first things go wrong yep I have to say
I mentioned this on Twitter the the plot
of that movie seems to be my entire life
experience playing Dino Park tycoon as a
kid on daus what's Dino park tycoon okay
first of all this should have been your
greatest game of all time like this
should be number one on your list it was
like theme park tycoon but it was it
predated that even I was released around
the same time where you had a dinosaur
park and you built up your dinosaur park
and you could breed dinosaurs you could
you had a hatch eggs yeah little
hatchery you could you can do all kinds
of stuff you set up your Dino park and
but here's the crazy thing and this is
why it reminds me of this is that I used
to you had to choose what type of fences
this type of enclosures your dinosaurs
are behind so if you had like a
triceratops which I know doesn't exist
anymore we were aware that Triceratops
are not actually thing now um you would
beat you it would say he's a pretty
docile he quit behind like in a wood
fence whatever like you know the glass
whatever but then like for the higher
the dangerous carnivores you'd want to
put them behind like electrified fences
but you could choose not to if you
didn't have enough money so I always put
my t-rexes behind like chicken wire and
then they would get out but I always
played it as if I was feeding the
dinosaurs and giving them recreation I
was being a really good park owner
because I was taking care of the
dinosaurs baby yeah like by giving them
humans to eat like it seemed in it but
and then
it was fun also they have recreation has
aided chase after the humans I can eat
them it's a really nice thing to do I
don't think you're on the right side
you're welcome dinosaurs not on the red
side you're welcome I'm never on the
right side I always play games really
weird fallout 3 cleaning up the
apocalypse one can at a time I'm I'm the
weirdo who's like goggles here and I'm
like putting things into my bag like
cleaning it was great cleaving a male
che over there I gotta recycle these
nuka-cola right where can I do that
that's how I play open world games where
should have you write the Jurassic for
the extra a portable I think I already
did I mean obviously they took all of my
playthroughs and just mash them into a
movie by the way I have a theory that
they're gonna make two more uh dresser I
think you're probably right after this
not with Chris Pratt though they're not
gonna be able to afford him know he's
gonna be too expensive although if
Jurassic Park roll if jurassic world is
really really huge they'll pay him it
would be a big payoff for I'm are sure
people are going for the did they do it
people were excited about the dinosaurs
for this not chris pratt as much as I
thought that's true anyone see him along
the trail of our Jimmy jab now it's time
for your gibbering jab either feedback
was a really solid transition yep you're
right I agree perfect um okay so we
asked you guys to use the hashtag TV
powers to tell us what superhero power
ability would happen how it would work
in the real world oh my god yes okay
alright Paul wrote to us and said I'd be
a reverse rogue instead of borrowing
people's powers I'd absorb and destroy
their illness I mean if they have
insurance haha I like that you couch mad
at me oh wow really I'm insurance that's
do-gooder not to do it wow I didn't
expect anybody to be like not selfish ya
know a place next one yourself linnemann
wrote I would like to have Cyclops's
powers to use a pair of google glass
with the laser from the watch nice tying
it into another yeah yeah Martin wrote
if I could have any power it would be
Wolverines overactive immune system
volunteer myself as a living petri dish
to cure disease again a do-gooder I are
all these people such good human you
said be good humans they being used
they're being better than good better
you bring great humans you're being
great that's how we end the show today
because of the great humans because
Martin and Paul are run their their
change in the curve okay what is that
you have another one oh yeah Spyro Spyro
the Dragon run to us oh good and said
I'd have Tony Stark's brain so
university would be a breeze like that
okay see that's yeah that's more that's
good and then Alec emailed us and said i
would want x-ray vision in the real
world you could use the same technology
they used to see what's in what inside
earth looks like doctors could use this
to see what's wrong and where the where
before they do surgery or see where
veins are or firemen could use it to see
if there's someone in a burning house or
please could see if the person has a gun
and then a pizza yeah check out all the
pizza emoticon which is the life Ken
