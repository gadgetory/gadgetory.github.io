welcome to pray video podcast I'm
Veronica Belmont joined today by the
fabulous mr tom merritt that's my name
and so the Oscars for this weekend yes
did you have fun watching I kind of they
were ok Ellen did pretty well it was a
little better than last time I didn't I
don't think i watch the last one but
anyway tumblers so today we're going to
talk about things well you told me
earlier that you're not allowed to have
to give away the gift bags anymore yeah
they don't do the gift bags for people
that they used to do with like tens of
thousands of dollars of free stuff
because the IRS moved in I said we're
gonna tax everybody all the people i
don't know thanks know Fergus for me
they used to get like cars and phones
and blackberries and all that kind of
really yeah islands of their very own no
more however one thing that they should
have gotten in case they didn't get an
Oscar was a gold razr oh like solid gold
motorola razr no I mean well I've looked
at the Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana phone before and
I actually bought video about it no so
it's not solid gold or Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana
know it's kind of gaudy like it's dipped
in spray paint kinda yeah I got
something that would be good for a
celebrity gift bag what's that it is the
Mirage 3d hologram creator it's like
this device that you set anything in a
bowl in the center and it creates a
hologram above the bowl what would they
need that for for stand-ins you just get
like one of their action figures you put
it in the bowl and then there's just you
know for the red carpet interviews and
stuff it all really stiff anyway help me
obi-wan Kenobi you're my only hope
anyway yeah that could be one thing
another thing that would help actors
when they were rehearsing for movies
would be the oh I can't remember the
name it's the the advanced memory brain
system don't like a chew need this one
obviously the handheld brain and memory
fitness device it's a small handheld
device and it's supposed to balance your
left and right brain that's good because
you don't want to have one piece of your
brain get bigger than your clock yeah
you just fall over but anyway so it'll
help them you know retain information to
remember their lines yeah oh I see for
the millions
it's good there's also Fox fury has they
make LED like professional bright LED
lights they came out with a headband for
personal use a headband so like yes it
goes around your head and it projects
light 150 feet ahead of you at a 45
degree angle perfect for bars at the
after parties trying to find the
restroom you know you can clear a path
yeah but don't you think you'd kind of
be the center of attention if you had a
big like beam of light and coming
through we won too many pina coladas
everyone can see you coming anyway oh so
we were talking about cell phones
earlier and if you did have a solid gold
phone of any kind that was actually
worth something you might want the rivet
advanced system it's a security system
for your cell phone oh because people
have had their their information right
so you could just attach it to your
pants and then you would never lose your
cell phone well of a Paris's pants
sometimes come unattached so my network
yeah there's that thanks thanks Tom I
was that was a good one they could have
thrown the iphone in the bag though I
they definitely would love doesn't exist
yet no but I mean you know stars are
early adopters they like to have things
before anyone else does did you see the
commercial I did it was okay it was fun
didn't make me want to buy the
overpriced low battery phone well apple
also had those ads before that would
hate I heard that Apple had those ads
before they showed all famous historical
figures yeah and now they're kind of
harkening back to that ad can play with
famous people and famous movie roles
talking on the phone yeah I didn't
really it was okay I'm Doug it oh well
okay we're being played also thank my
mom if you wanna check the drain plug
