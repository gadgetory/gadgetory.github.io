and oven or stove is one of the most
important investments you'll make in
your kitchen these appliances will set
you back at least five hundred dollars
you'll use them nearly every day and
they're yours for at least a decade here
are some things to keep in mind when
you're ready to buy a new oven or stove
first answer these questions before you
begin to shop what type of home cook are
you be realistic about the features you
need and will use in an oven or range to
keep yourself from wasting money on
upgrades that you don't need what type
of appliance does your kitchen
accommodate and what type of power
hookup do you have you have a built in
wall oven and separate cooktop or do you
have space for a rain stick with the
product that will fit into your current
setup unless you're ready for a big
renovation to accompany your new
appliance purchase what's your budget
some ranges can cost as much as a year
salary for real with that said set a
budget and stick to it
fortunately our testing has shown that
you can find a good appliance at any
price point when it comes to cooktops
you can choose between gas electric or
induction now smooth electric cook talks
like this one are easy to scratch and
you can't use every type of cookware for
the surface gas cooktops provide you
with the uniform flame for cooking but
our kitchen tests show that they don't
boil water for quite as fast as an
electric cooktop an induction cooktops
use the heat created from
electromagnetic energy to cook your food
which means fast and efficient cooking
when it comes to ovens you want one that
will evenly baked or roast your food
with gas ovens we've seen in our cook
test that they have a harder time
producing even baking results than
electric ovens convection fans which
helped distribute hot air in your oven
can help keep everything in your oven
cooking evenly there are lots of other
features that you can get with your oven
or stove such as special cooking modes
baking drawers and even Wi-Fi
connectivity so you can control your
appliance from your smart phone but all
of that it's just
Xtra all you really need is a stovetop
that heats pots at a decent clip and an
oven that will cook your food evenly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
