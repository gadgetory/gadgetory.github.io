coming I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update google is very serious
about building its own fleet of robots
it has acquired several robot making
companies and it most recently purchased
Boston Dynamics it's an engineering
company that's gained fame for its
animal like robots such as the Wildcat
which can run 16 miles an hour Boston
Dynamics has designed robots for the
Pentagon and it also is working on a
humanoid robot called atlas it can walk
through rubble and handle many obstacles
google told the new york times that it
will honor existing government contracts
but it's not out to become a military
contractor on its own you see Google may
be working on robots that can help do
work in a warehouse or a manufacturing
plant or maybe these robots will
eventually help humans in the home
Google does have big dreams but it would
take many years for that to happen the
guy in charge of this new robots
apartment at Google used to be in charge
of the Android operating system and
Google isn't the only one with ambitious
acquisitions the wall street journal
reports that sprint is working on a bid
to merge with tmobile next year sprint
may be offering more than 20 billion
dollars but according to the journal
sprint hasn't decided yet if it'll
actually move ahead with the bid to buy
t-mobile in the meantime sprint expanded
its 4G LTE coverage to 70 more cities in
total Sprint's past service is now in
300 markets across the u.s. and it's
been playing catch up to the other three
carriers when it comes to rolling out 4g
LTE but sprint has also been touting a
new program called sprint spark it uses
new technology to ramp up 4G speeds to a
possible 60 megabits a second compare
that to four G's average speed of 8
megabits per second that means a
one-hour HD video would download in
under three minutes sprint says the
technology could go as fast as one
gigabit per second but right now sprint
spark is only in New York LA Chicago
Tampa
Miami and you can only reach that speed
with a tri-band device such as the
galaxy s4 amazon is making a last minute
