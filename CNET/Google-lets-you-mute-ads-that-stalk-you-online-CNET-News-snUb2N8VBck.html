web and an online ad keeps following you
everywhere you go well Google is finally
giving you the power to shoo away and
mute those pestering reminder ads these
reminder ads usually come when you're
looking to buy something online but then
you change your mind and even though you
don't want the item anymore
it just follows you on every website
nagging you to come back well you can
now mute some of the ones being served
up by Google although it's a kind of a
hassle you see first you have to log on
to your Google account and then go to
the add settings section it's under
personal info and privacy you then click
manage add settings and Google is
rolling out a new section inside this
called your reminder ads here's the list
of all the ads trying to lure you back
you can accept the ones you want to
banish well vanish for 90 days at least
and if you mute an ad on your desktop it
should also be muted when browsing on a
smart phone the bad news is that ads may
still follow you around this only
applies to the ones that are served up
by Google's ad service and you may still
get ads that follow you on YouTube Gmail
and Google search but Google does plan
on expanding the mute function to more
places in the coming months now back in
2012 Google did give users the power to
mute one specific ad at a time by
clicking the X in the corner of an ad
and the search giant says that millions
of people are muting ads daily will you
take advantage of these new mute
settings let us know in the comments I'm
Bridget Carey and when this video is
done I promise not to follow you around
the web but you know it'd be nice if you
came back to watch more videos I'm just
saying no pressure or anything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
