the Google developer conference is going
on right now at the same time that we're
filming this episode so far the big news
is that Google Wave is now open to
everyone and Google is launching an app
store for Chrome operating system this
basically is just a software store where
you can find programs to run online we
will have a more in-depth summary of the
conference announcement in the next
episode of loaded as expected the
European Union did slap a hefty fine on
chip makers for price fixing the fine
was for 331 million euro or 420 1
million dollars Samsung received the
highest fine at 145 million euro Barnes
&amp;amp; Noble wants to make it easier for you
to publish your novel the company
announced puppet it lets you upload a
document convert it to epub and sell it
over the barnes &amp;amp; noble store we don't
know what Commission they will take on
your book sales because this service is
not open just yet they're just taking
requests for invitations you can find it
at barnesandnoble.com / puppet you can
now make shutterfly albums from facebook
albums these are those cute photo books
that you create an order unfortunately
Facebook photos won't look so great if
you blow them up because they're
uploaded to the site and low resolution
so if you make these books don't take
those photos full page and a new site
called together Ville wants to be
facebook for the kiddies it's aimed at
children between 6 and 10 years old
parents will have a lot of control over
what goes on there they can approve or
reject their children's friends
activities and games kids and parents
will have separate login and the site
will look different depending on who is
logged in the parent or the child and of
course it is free those are all your
headlines for now thank you for watching
