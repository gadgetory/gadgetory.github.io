mat turns 30 I'm Jeff Bakalar in for
Bridget Carey this is your Cena update
by now you've probably heard of a widely
circulated Princeton research paper that
concluded Facebook would lose eighty
percent of its users by 2017 well
Facebook didn't find the paper too
amusing and decided to do a little
research of its own the company has
poked Princeton back with a study of its
own releasing a parody report claiming
that princeton university itself would
lose half its students by 2018 and every
single student by 2021 I guess it's a
good thing Harvard didn't put out the
original report but a social network
becoming unpopular why does this ever
happen before so have you ever heard of
the Nintendo game Nintendo World
Championships it was for the original
NES well you probably haven't because
it's apparently the rarest NES game of
all time in fact the company only made
116 copies of the game as a special
promotion so now a listing for a copy of
the game has popped up on ebay even
though the label has been washed away
the seller claims it's an original World
Championships game right now the auction
is at over five thousand dollars but
recently a copy of the game in much
better condition went for 11 grand in a
charity auction 9to5 mac is reporting
that a new version of apple set-top box
apple TV is incoming it's not the actual
TV set that we've been clamoring for but
instead will contain a new operating
system that's more akin to what iOS
looks and feels like it also sounds like
the new Apple TV will support the
downloading of games directly to the box
so if you've recently purchased an Apple
TV what should you do or you obviously
should just throw it away now I'm
kidding the new software will probably
be compatible with all those old boxes
as well sticking with Apple this year
the company's iconic home computer turns
30 which should make everyone watching
this feel very old including myself cnet
has a huge section carved out to
celebrate three decades of the Mac
and a whole lot more so be sure to check
it out have you got some bitcoins
burning a hole in your virtual pocket
well now a major online computer
retailer is accepting the digital
currency as payment tigerdirect is the
latest outlet to accept Bitcoin and a
move that will help the movement that
aims to nudge the platform into
relevancy Bitcoin had an explosive 2013
in terms of popularity and interest
regardless of whether or not people
fully understand it that's your tech
news update but you can find more
details at cnet com / update and always
