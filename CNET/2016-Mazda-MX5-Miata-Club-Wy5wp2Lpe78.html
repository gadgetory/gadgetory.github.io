but this 2016 does it's seriously
updated which always makes Loyalists a
little nervous let's see how Mazda did
as we drive the 16 fourth-generation
mx-5 miata in the club trim check the
tech
now be honest with you I don't care for
the new looks on the face and rump of
the new Miata I think they're trying too
hard they're gonna look very dated in a
few years but that's just my opinion
the important thing on the outside of
this car is now three inches shorter and
150 pounds lighter than the last car
that was already short and light beyond
that the overall volumes and the layout
of a Miata is still a Miata
now the Miata cabin remains this very
clean simple place you really see it in
the instrument panel that's like classic
vintage gauge work and I like it
because we have a mid trim car we've got
this sort of stick up LCD infotainment
system here that has a very I Drive
light controller cluster and that's
touch and you have voice big painted
interior door tops you better love the
color you buy the front console cup
holder is tidy and basically solid the
one in the back of the console is
hateful begging to be bumped by your
elbow as ours was during our shoot even
though we expressly were avoiding that
now Miatas and really any mods there are
not known as cabin tech powerhouses this
is no different what they have under the
promising apps menu is basically a joke
but the navigation systems most
important thing it's clean and crisp as
well as Bluetooth streaming and calling
all the basics the big missing thing
here is integration of apple carplay and
android auto give me that and suddenly
it's transformed technologically you do
however have clean and snappy
integration of a hostage your and
Pandora
under audio sources the top is
completely manual that's a big part of
the weight savings and it's amazing
light and fast the way a power top can
never be on the other hand putting it
back up is guaranteed to earn you
rotator cuff surgery lucky for your
orthopedic surgeon the power retractable
hardtop has been cancelled
not a bunch of DriveMode buttons or
anything like that you handle that
through the clutch and the stick active
high-tech driver assist is available at
the Volvo dealer this is a Miata at the
very most we have some available passive
driver assists a new 2-liter for in the
u.s. Miatas uses their sky active tech
which centers on high compression to get
the most power and efficiency out of
each droplet of fuel horse power is
actually down 7% but torque is up 5% and
peak slower an mpg it's hard to believe
it's a 25% also helped by the 148 pounds
of weight loss is 0 to 60 time which is
now down to 6 rear wheel drive only
6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic you
know what to do it took me about six
blocks to know this car was a winner you
feel the improved torque quantity and
quality overlaid on the reduced weight
all coming through the unguarded direct
handling this is still an engine you'll
use all of and occasionally wish you had
Maura but that's actually an engagement
that branagh your cars just can't
deliver and that new engine is lower and
farther back in the body making handling
even better and someone at mazda may
have heard my constant gripe about a
pillars while they remain massive on the
Miata to meet rollover standards they've
been made more upright and pushed back
for better corner visibility the army
otta is a club trim it's right in the
middle it's 29 4 delivered a club has
infotainment head unit and some other
niceties but doesn't have the driver
assist tech it's a simple way to look at
it we do have one option 3,400 bucks for
the Brembo brakes and BBS wheels for a
car of this power and this weight that
seems like gilding the lily I'd skip
that all day and keep it under 30 grand
that way the Miata still remains what it
is the very best value in the world for
someone who just wants to get out and
drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
