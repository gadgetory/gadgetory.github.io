right now you checking out a few on cnet
TBI yes sir
hey that rich tomorrow with CNN TV
welcoming you to another tech pack
edition of the q let's get right to it
with your format war update forrester
research says the format war will last
another 18 months in 2005 they predicted
that blu-ray would win but now they say
blu-ray is still in a better position
but needs to alter their course the
issues Paramount's recent HD DVD
commitment and HD DVD hardware prices
are now at a consumer sweet spot to stay
in the race Forrester says blu-ray we'll
have to offer a two hundred fifty dollar
player by this Christmas there's
something to display on your big screen
TV in lieu of HD movies color light the
DVD turns your HDTV into an ambient
light source transitioning through the
entire color spectrum in about 20
minutes now of course you can also pause
the DVD on your favorite color a color
light DVD will set you back about 25
bucks but it'll put your party in
awesome mode now that google is offering
20 million bucks to anyone who can land
an unmanned rover on the moon it's only
natural to want to catch a ride on the
publicity wait that's exactly what you
never call is doing the web cell phone
retailer offering a ten-thousand-dollar
prize to anyone who makes the first cell
phone call from the moon surface it can
be made by men or device there are also
smaller prizes 500 bucks to the first
moon to earth text message and 100 bucks
for getting a call on the moon with a
crazy frog ringtone wow I couldn't have
made that stuff up I tried moving
through the queue time for the beta
thank God for social networking instead
of actually communicating with our
friends we have web two point O excuses
for hiding behind sites like Facebook
MySpace text messages and email trump
iya brings them all together the company
apparently the first to realize how
tough it is to get ahold of people when
you don't actually care enough to call
them sign up for the service upload your
address book and their blast tool well
text IM and email all your friends at
once according to the website you can
blast out an event invitation to
coordinate that last-minute meeting
without actually doing any organizing
you know I guess coordinating could be
tough when you have 700 friends on
myspace finally Q on the street as you
saw in today's tech tidbit 51% of IT
pros say workplace computer rules have
no consequences if you break them so
what are folks doing
hey I mark the intern in Times Square
when we're at work we're not always
working whether we're playing solitaire
instant messaging or just browsing the
web but do people think there will be
consequences for playing around at work
I know cousin who's I'll use a work done
allow us to do things like that I can't
go on to like my hotmail or AOL they
block it now some people don't have a
computer at home so work is the only
place where they can no check there on a
house online of course you don't go to
the the bad sighs yeah where you can
download dirty stuff that I never do
that my business computer is for
business and my personal computer is for
my personal stuffs can't get in trouble
if they don't know those like you know
you guys do it on the low when the boss
is coming you switch right back to the
work of page oh but they do know i'm
rich Tamara would see that TV consider
ourselves all chewed up by
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
