language without knowing how to speak
their language I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your CNET update Skype is now
able to do live real-time language
translations for video calls for now the
program can translate to spoken
languages Spanish and English so when
your friend greets you in Spanish hola
como estas you have to wait a moment to
hear the translation in your headset oh
hi how are you and then you see the
transcript on the screen written
messages can be translated for more than
40 languages
it's just spoken that's limited in this
preview phase and unfortunately you
can't just jump in right away you have
to first request access to the preview
Microsoft began taking signup requests
back in November this early preview is
only for Windows 8.1 PCs and tablets
when I grew up this was the sort of
far-out futuristic technology featured
at Epcot so it's pretty cool to see now
it's possible as Microsoft enhances
Skype it's no longer in a relationship
with Facebook the social network broke
off its partnership with Bing so when
you do a search on Facebook you won't
see bings web search results that's
because Facebook is trying to build that
its own search tool as something
stronger just last week Facebook added a
way to search for any word or phrase
posted by your friends going all the way
back to their first posts even though
Bing isn't tied into Facebook Microsoft
still owns a stake in the network
now here's an advancement in technology
that I'm not so eager about virtual
reality exercises runtastic a popular
GPS fitness tracking app has created a
workout program for the oculus rift
headset it's a seven minute leg workout
where a 3d animated avatar is your
personal trainer and you can pick from
different backgrounds maybe you want a
lush hillside an ocean view or you can
stand inside a black hole because why
not it's hard enough to get motivated to
do exercise strapping on a headpiece and
getting motion sick doesn't really make
me excited about doing squats moving on
to another new frontier in technology
you can now buy
3d print address and this isn't some
rigid plastic cage this is a dress that
flows and moves with you the nervous
system design studio created this print
address in partnership with Kim attics
it's created with many hinged triangles
so it's sort of like chainmail
interlinked so you can still move the
computer gets a pattern that's folded up
and that way you can fit print it inside
the machine and then it's flattened out
to where the dress is now on display at
the Museum of Modern Art and you can
order your own dress you just need to
get a 3d body scan that's your tech news
update there's always more at cnet.com
and you can follow me on Twitter to stay
updated from our studios in New York I'm
