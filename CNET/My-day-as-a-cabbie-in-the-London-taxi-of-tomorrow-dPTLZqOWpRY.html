one of those iconic vehicles in the
world and been ferrying passengers
around London's capital since the early
half of the last century but it's now
time for the historical relic to become
a symbol of the future say hello then to
the T X built in England by the London
electric vehicle company now as you may
have guessed and rather obvious company
name the T X is an electrically driven
cab capable of journeying through London
with zero emissions now that's pretty
important for a city that's already
struggling with pollution comes with
other modern features too like plugs for
laptops and phones Wi-Fi and a built in
ramp for disabled access in short it's a
modern car built for the modern city but
the only way for me to get to grips to
the T X is to hit the road and pick up
my first ever passenger I have been
driven all over London in these things
for years but it's the first time
they've actually ever driven one I've
got to say it is pretty exciting it
feels a bit of a bit of a rite of
passage in becoming a real Londoner and
that's despite me having actually lived
in the city for over eight years all I
need now is to get my first passenger
he goes first ever passenger where to so
Windsor as in castle yeah the winds are
there I'm just checking and so that's
sort of like West I guess no no no no I
do I do I do I see - I'm popping in the
city the old sat-nav yeah sorry I'm just
in a bit of a hurry I've got a meeting
there and they do not like to be kept
waiting
ok no problem cool
the route is being calculated
now I have driven various electric cars
before the Tesla Model S for example
with its absolutely ludicrous
acceleration this TX is a bit more
subtle let's say I mean I'm not going to
be smoking anyone off the line at the
lights with this but that slower
smoother acceleration this gut does give
a much more comfortable Drive
particularly for the people sitting in
the back which would allow them to get
on with some work if they needed to
there's you've got power points back
there by the way if you need to plug
your laptop it and there's the Wi-Fi
code I think should be dished up on the
left here if you want to jump on the
Wi-Fi good right you've got a whole
little office going on back there
that steady acceleration does make it
not only comfortable to be in but it
makes it very comfortable to drive as
does sort of the very lightweight easy
handling because of course this cab has
the same famous tight turning circle of
all the black cabs so you can get around
those tiny roundabouts or do a sudden
u-turn in the road sorry wrong road
so did you know that this cab is
electric and so this is probably the
greenest trip you've ever done to
Windsor you also know that London's cabs
have been on the road my cab driver
banter you see the game last night
the sports ball game the
now I know I said this is an electric
car but strictly speaking it is a bit
more of a hybrid because there is a
petrol engine under the hood
well that doesn't drive the car what it
actually does it acts as a generator
giving a bit more juice back to the
batteries so this can do about 80 miles
on electrical loan or 400 miles when it
uses that extra power from the engine
what it does mean though is that if I
want to do this whole journey on
electricity alone I will need to pull
over and give the batteries a bit of a
charge sorry but it's gonna have to
pause for a moment to give the batteries
a bit of a charge be serious yeah won't
take your tick well how long two shakes
of a lamb's tail it's about there you
gonna
okay so it's actually going to take
about 20 minutes to refill the batteries
to about 80% which isn't all that long
but I'm not gonna tell her that because
I'm pretty sure she's gonna kill me so
he said I'm gonna spend the time and go
get a brew
yeah sorry
I'm on my way but the cabbie the cabbies
just stopped three churches car
something no idea he said something
about two shakes of a lamb's tail
whatever hello I'm back told the open
take long what are you talking about
it's been ages I need to be there now
it's not easy being green in order to
become a proper license London cabbie
you've got to do a test called the
knowledge now that is the most difficult
driving test in the entire world and
demands that every single driver learn
around 25,000 roads in London or from
memory now my memory is mostly full of
cat pictures and cake recipes so luckily
I'm relying on the T X is built-in
sat-nav which is particularly handy
because Windsor actually isn't anywhere
where I thought it was and I would have
taken my first ever passenger somewhere
closer to Guildford so got the castle
just upon the right that's close enough
yes finally I guess I'll have to do
what's going on is it no can you just
open the door please
well that went well hang on did you pay
me the thing to remember is that this
isn't a proof of concept or some kind of
trial the TX is here to stay where the
londoners like it or not
new city rules state that from this year
on all new registered cabs must be
capable of zero emission driving up to
300 new fast charges are being installed
across London too to help the cabbies
and of course other electric drivers
recharge on the move now I'm not here to
review this cab what would be the point
it's a service vehicle we like reviewing
and ambulance
when you actually need one and one turns
up you're hardly going to turn it away
because of fuel efficiency or comfort
reasons that said this is a nice place
to be as a driver and of course any step
towards a lower carbon footprint in the
city is a good thing to do and it's good
to see they've remained true to the
iconic design I mean sure the back looks
a bit more like a Hirst of a logo on the
front will trick you into thinking
you're getting into a Bentley but it's
still unquestionably a classic black cab
and when the city eventually bans petrol
cars altogether and it will it's great
to know that these icons will still be
around to get me home from the pub at
four in the morning
where is it taking me
oh god I got to take in me properly the
wrong way here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
