bread-and-butter car it's neither the
high-end nor the low-end but on this one
it's the fast end let's take a run in
the 2013 Audi s6 and check the tech an
s6 takes a standard a6 and adds a whole
lot of very real performance
improvements a much hotter bigger engine
of the hood that we'll visit in a minute
a sports air suspension that's adaptive
around all four corners and as you can
see a lot of different body cues spot
one of these guys by the curling lower
lip in front the bar across the grille
instead of a full depth cowcatcher and
these satin finish mirrors but to my eye
out YZ s cars are a lot less overt than
the M cars of the AMG s there's less
machismo it's kind of an Audi thing okay
now when you have an S car you've got
kind of a gluttonous engine I mean who
does big v8s anymore well midsize v8 4
litre direct injection twin-turbo v8
under the hood of this s6 the numbers
are nice 420 horse 406 foot-pounds of
torque 0 to 60 for this 4,400 pound car
not exactly spelt happens in a trim 4.5
seconds while still delivering pretty
good 17:27 MPG drivetrain one choice
you're going to have a 7-speed
dual-clutch automated manual what they
call a DCT
going out to quadrille all-wheel drive
exactly identical to the Audi s7
the cabin tech in this f6 is virtually
identical to that in the s7 we recently
took a detailed look at let's revisit
that for a moment how DS navigation
system is one of the best out there I
like the way it presents almost
everything in terms of operating still
the same MMI interface for zones here
mapped to four buttons down here around
the controller notice on this car we've
got the Google Earth services built in
so it's got Google Earth satellite
imagery once you get out to let's say
this level here 3/4 mile view along with
that Google Earth imagery you've got
local search to find destinations and
all that's done through this little SIM
card connection right here you don't
need to pair your smartphone to this guy
to get connected now let's talk media
system on this car lots of choices they
start back here into the sneaky door
alongside the sim you've got two SD card
slots I don't find that tremendously
interesting more interesting your
bluetooth streaming for which on my
Android phone I'm getting good meta tag
information that's quite a win on
Android now the one that's grayed out
here that would be your Audi media
interface it lives here in the console
the reason it's not connected is because
as you can see here we've got the
old-style 30-pin dock connector now
getting away from infotainment the cabin
tech really takes off with driver
assistance tech in this car first of all
we have adaptive cruise control which is
where you set the speed and the follow
distance but on top of that it's got
stop-and-go technology if you get into
stop and go traffic the car will come to
a stop and then when traffic starts
again it will automatically resume after
the radar in the front sees that happen
and the camera up here behind the mirror
scans for pedestrians first Lane Assist
technology on this car is active if this
same camera which can read not just
lines but colors of lines detects that
you're drifting and your signals not on
in that direction it uses the electro
hydraulic steering rack to steer you
back and also give you a stick shake on
the wheel if you set it that way that
same camera also looks out there for
speed limit science and can read them
and puts those on the interface of the
car to let you know what the speed limit
is here now I'm really sad our car does
not have the night vision with
pedestrian detection and head-up display
that is something I want to check out in
the real world on these Audi's and
finally we have parking assist
technology we've seen this in a lot
other cars that cost a lot less than
this one for example but it will get you
into a parallel parking spot as long as
it is at least 31 inches longer than the
car is like driving any out in one
respect it's dead-ass smooth the s cars
have an adaptive air suspension unlike
the standard 7 or 6 for example so we've
got a car that can change personalities
dramatically especially with this Audi
Drive select those modes we see on the
screen there are dramatically different
it's not one of those placebos where you
kind of see a difference and kind of
don't here it's like you bought three
cars when you're cutting it up on a nice
little country road like this and
getting into it of course Quattro
basically makes you look like a hero not
to mention all the usual adaptive
controls and the power on this car just
never stops
that 420 horse and deceptively low 406
foot-pounds of torque are actually way
more than you need this thing is like a
locomotive oh by the way this car has
cylinder deactivation which I don't
think we had in our f7 I don't recall
that it'll shut down cylinders two three
five and eight when it's loafing at
cruising speeds I never detected it it
is so perfectly smooth it's wonderful
now all this said you'd think it's the
perfect car right but when I've compared
BMWs and Audi's even the hot versions
head-to-head I often come away feeling
like the BMW has a clear edge as a
street fighter if that's your priority
I feel like this car is more of a
sporting car than it is one to be
absolutely hammered like a Demi track
car I feel like it comes apart a little
bit at the real ragged edge but as a car
I would own I absolutely love the
combination of the power of the smooth
delivery the really useful technology
and the understated lines and elegance
okay let's price our little sporty
friend with the identity crisis you're
gonna start off around seventy two seven
let's call it almost seventy three for
an S six delivered if you want to get
seen that style in a hurry get the
innovation package for around fifty five
hundred bucks
that's gonna roll in the night-vision
detection the head-up display adaptive
cruise the stop-and-go technology you're
gonna get surround cameras blind spot
detection that active lane departure and
a lot more do it all with all those
options you're in about eighty six for a
car that is in the mid ground but I'll
tell you what you'll love driving it
every day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
