plastic I'm pretty carry this is your
CNET update Google a virtual reality
accessible to everyone with its VR
viewer made out of cardboard it of
course is not the most advanced virtual
reality technology it's just made up of
plastic lenses and a rubber band to hold
your smartphone in place and when you
load up a VR app it splits your screen
into two images for a stereoscopic 3d
effect for depth you can find one for a
couple bucks on eBay and the New York
Times even was giving one to every
subscriber last year and Google even
gave up free cardboard sets with Star
Wars designs but since it was first
released in 2014
it seems Google is ready to see the
headset evolve the Financial Times
reports that Google is working on a
plastic casing for your phone to be
released later this year now if you've
been keeping score at home you know it's
gonna be a busy year for VR news several
big gaming headsets are coming out in a
few months like oculus rift Sony's
PlayStation VR and the HTC vive Samsung
is expected to show off a new gear VR
headset at an event less than two weeks
away but the Google cardboard makes more
sense for short term VR moments that you
can dip in and out of since you're not
going to be strapping this to your head
now with all the buzz don't be surprised
if next year Super Bowl is streamed in
virtual reality but as for this past
Sunday's game CBS says a record number
of people stream the game over the
Internet and that's to be expected when
it was easy to pull up with the CBS
sports app on your TV with a Roku and
Xbox one or Apple TV not to mention it
also streams on mobile devices or
computers and there was another app that
saw a massive surge right around the
time when the big game was ending the
app venmo which makes it easy to send
money to friends suddenly was extremely
slow and down for many users what could
cause so many people to overwhelm a
little old payments app right as the
Denver Broncos defeated the Carolina
Panthers perhaps as some suggest it was
time to pay up for anyone that put money
on the game see we are living in the
future just wait until bed
comes to virtual reality that's it for
this technique update but there's always
more at cnet.com from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
