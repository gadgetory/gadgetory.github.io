in Buckinghamshire England
despite its serene appearance this manor
and its surrounding buildings were a
vital part of Allied victory in World
War two when they became the epicenter
of Britain's wartime code-breaking
efforts this country is at war with
Germany by the end of 1944 ants had
fallen to Hitler's invasion forces
Britain was being pummeled by nightly
bombing raids while merchant ships were
hunted in the Atlantic by German u-boats
Allied forces were desperate for any
strategic advantage and that included
decoding Germany's encrypted radio
communications you're standing in the
office of a man who was instrumental in
setting up Bletchley as Britain's
code-breaking HQ and overseeing
operations in the crucial first years of
the war commander Alistair Denniston the
first head of the UK's government code
and cypher school Bletchley offered easy
access to London as well as university
towns Oxford and Cambridge from which
Dennison recruited top minds including
Gordon welchman and Alan Turing
Denniston was unwavering in his
commitment to gathering Nazi
intelligence but having worked in
code-breaking for many years including
throughout World War one he had no
illusions about the scale of the problem
facing the Bletchley team that problem
was enigma a mechanical device used by
the German military to encrypt
communications typing on an Enigma
machine illuminated alternative coded
letters determined by a series of rotors
each of which had a possible 26 settings
adding even more security was the plug
board which swapped letters with another
letter of the operators choice to decode
a message all you needed was to
replicate those settings on your Enigma
machine and the scrambled letters would
become readable text however with over a
hundred and fifty million million
million possible configurations
deciphering enigma was virtually
impossible even if you guess the
settings the Germans were using regular
configuration changes meant your luck
would run out often within a day
and yet at bletchley cryptographers were
able to read enigma communications
throughout most of the war here's how
away from the luxury of the mansion the
heavy lifting of breaking enigma
happened in prefabricated Hut's like
this one built on park grounds
deciphering enigma began with the polish
who'd cracked a machine before the war
and shared their knowledge with France
and Britain in July 1939 on the eve of
conflict when Germany started switching
its cipher systems on a daily basis
however Bletchley task became infinitely
more complex
luckily the Germans made mistakes
predictable messages like weather
reports gave Bletchley cribs best
guesses that helped calculate the days
in it my settings plus enigma had a
fatal design flaw a letter could never
be encoded as itself this fact combined
with cribs gave code breakers of vital
foothold in crunching possible settings
combinations thirdly Bletchley relied on
pinches the capture of German code books
which were a treasure trove of code
cracking information Germany would alter
its Enigma devices though and keeping on
top of decrypt was a constant years long
struggle right at the heart of that
struggle was history's most famous code
breaker you're in the hut eight office
of Alan Turing the London born
mathematician who was instrumental in
cracking the notoriously complex German
naval enigma and developed the Bamber
isthmus technique which leveraged
probabilities to calculate the likely
settings of Enigma machines cheering's
wartime activities saved lives diverting
Allied ships away from the jaws of
u-boat Wolfpack's
but his later contributions also
resonate today cheering spreaded as the
father of computer science and the field
of artificial intelligence and without
his pioneering work modern technology
could look very different although he
was gay in 1941
Turing was briefly engaged to fellow
codebreaker Joan Clarke seven years
after the war Turing was prosecuted for
homosexual acts which at the time was
still a criminal offence in the UK
choosing chemical castration as an
alternative to prison cheering died just
two years later his death ruled suicide
by cyanide poison
the end of Turing's life is a story of
bitter injustice but his legacy endures
in the progress he made during his time
at Bletchley perhaps his most famous
contribution is the bomb machine for
decoding enigma the design of which was
unveiled in 1939 with colleague Gordon
welchman adding the vital diagonal board
refinement a year later cheering new
enigma could be cracked through brute
force testing of potential settings
combinations but the process was far too
lengthy for a human to handle the bomb
named in tribute to the Polish bomba
decryption machine was an
electromagnetic marble sending current
through circular drums corresponding to
sets of enigma rotors crunching the many
thousands of permutations to calculate
enigma settings based on code breakers
cribs the replica bomb that currently
resides in Bletchley Park took 13 years
to complete but it's wartime equivalents
branched out much more quickly
cheering later visited the u.s. to
advise on bombe production while another
code breaking machine developed at
Bletchley Colossus is considered the
world's first programmable electronic
digital computer owing to the secrecy
surrounding wartime code breaking the
full extent of Bletchley zhh role in
world war ii and the pioneering work of
its many cryptographers would only be
revealed decades later but visitors to
Bletchley Park today are finally able to
hear the full story we hope you've
enjoyed this brief look inside one of
history's most fascinating sites</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
