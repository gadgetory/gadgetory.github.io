it in shorthand you would say it's the
Cadillac volt because it has the same
basic idea it runs about 37 miles on
battery only then it's gonna kick over
to its gas engine which just runs a
generator and that gets you about
another 300 miles until you put more gas
in the tank but you can keep going
electric and long as you have gas some
numbers a little less than two and 50
horsepower 295 foot-pounds of torque
will get it on the road here in a minute
charge time is 5 hours from a dead flat
battery more like three three and a half
from your typical 20% left where a lot
of folks are gonna put it remember it's
a range extender so you're never stuck
this is what you used to call a personal
luxury coupe in Detroit parlance but no
one uses that word anymore but it's kind
of the right phrase inside you're gonna
find the Cadillac cue system we've seen
and liked it before
what's added here are some new
instrument panel modes and center
console modes that embrace the
electrification of this vehicle so
giving you some range projections
regeneration profiles and showing you in
kind of a gamified way how greenly
you're driving and of course
connectivity on this vehicle from a web
browser or the app on your phone allows
you to do all the usual sort of
telematics on-the-go things but also to
charge it three ways charge now charge
later or charge when rates are lowest
that's kind of the state of the art for
electric cars that are connected of
course with the kind of torque we're
talking about here pushing 300
foot-pounds gets off the line
beautifully all the torque from one rpm
things that electric cars do natively
you might ask what we've got paddles on
the wheel for a car that doesn't have a
transmission it's only got one gear set
it's a reduction gear not a not a
gearbox well these are actually
regenerative braking on-demand paddles
so when you pull one of these guys back
doesn't matter which one you're putting
this guy into hard regen mode it's
analogous to a lot of compression
braking you'd have on a gasoline engine
and that's a great drivers tool if you
know how to use it it's a great way to
dive in and out of corners instead of
braking which is a different kind of a
dynamic and tends to throw a car off
one more thing I want to show you this
brief quick look here look in the middle
there I've got Tour mode sport mode
those are fairly common it's kind of one
is more relaxed and one tightens up
throttle response adaptive suspension
firmness and activeness and also
steering response but the next one I've
got here is gonna be a mountain mode
where the car is gonna pre generate more
electricity when you're getting into a
lot of hill climbing heading up to ski
or what have you
and the last one here is a hold position
if you want it to run in range extender
only use gas to make electricity and
save the battery for pure Eevee running
when you get to your destination in town
that's what that does so there's a lot
of nuance here between the controls and
the modes and what you can do with your
charging behaviors via an app there's
clearly a learning curve here and it's
part of new modern cars I sometimes feel
bad for the car dealer who's got a
delivery training they've got to do a
little tech conversation not just a car
conversation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
