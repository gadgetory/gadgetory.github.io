Windows RT what's the artiste and for
you asked you wouldn't be wrong to think
restricted hi I'm Seth Rosenblatt and
today we're going to take a quick look
at Windows RT Microsoft's new tablet
only operating system like iOS you can
only get Windows RT pre-installed it
offers much of the best of its bigger
sibling windows 8 you've got snapped
view for running two apps at once no
other tablet can currently do this live
tiles which update information in real
time the powerful search feature allows
you to type while on the Start screen
and instantly searches your apps
settings and files the charms bar gives
you quick access to search share and
connected peripheral devices windows RT
ships with the new Microsoft Office the
only way to get the productivity suite
for free Windows RT is also fueled by
the lower power arm-based chips so you
have longer battery life in general and
Windows RT doesn't have any legacy
windows malware threats although social
engineering will continue to be a
problem so what's wrong with Windows RT
here's a couple of the lowlights apps
older windows programs won't work
desktop mode is restricted to microsoft
made apps browser and media player
choice is also restricted and on top of
all that the Windows Store has a really
thin selection of apps right now flash
only works on pre-approved websites
really that's a step up from iOS not
running flash at all but talk about not
working with the web yikes Windows RT is
being marketed for productivity but the
mail app can't hold a candle to outlook
which doesn't even run on Windows RT to
change some settings you do that in
Metro mode but to change others you go
to desktop mode that's confusing
visually windows 8 and windows RT look
identical and you can't use the hardware
running them to tell them apart since
they run on similar looking devices as
well in the case of the Microsoft
Surface the hardware is in fact
identical Windows RT is in bad but it's
not great either you're still forced
into desktop mode often enough that it's
a jarring experience
although some people who don't like
legacy windows at all may actually like
this the first look at Windows RT I'm
