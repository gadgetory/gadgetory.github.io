your smartphone then here's some
technology that will definitely be of
interest it's company called stor dots
they're showing off a phone battery that
charges completely in a matter of
minutes here at Mobile World Congress
2015 let's take a look so we've seen
store dot super fast charging technology
before but in the last few months it's
been showing off a refined version with
this new design we're seeing it here
running on this modified Samsung Galaxy
s5 so this technology works because
store Docs batteries use a different
chemical makeup than what we're
traditionally used to we've seen this
phone go from 15% charge to 100% charge
in just about two minutes there is a bit
of a trade-off involved though this
thing is a 1,000 milliamp hour battery
at the moment and that's going to last
you roughly four to five hours so it
won't last you all day but the idea is
that once you do run out of battery
you'll just pop your phone back in its
charger and in roughly a few minutes
you're ready to go store dot says that
by the end of the year it's hoping to
get a 1500 milliamp hour battery charged
in just a minute and it's also looking
at ways to put its technology into
electric cars it says it wants to be
able to charge a Tesla in five minutes
so excitingly store dot says we should
see its technology in a phone that we
might actually be able to buy within
roughly a year that's very exciting
because while smart phones can do loads
and those are really cool stuff the
battery is always a pain so we're really
excited to see where this tech can go
right I'm the Westway for much more
