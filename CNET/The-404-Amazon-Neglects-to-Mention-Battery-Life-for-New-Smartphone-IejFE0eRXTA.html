only going to activate when they need to
but you you cannot stand there and tell
me this thing is going to have great
battery life they didn't mention and
like come on that thing went on for 90
minutes you're not mentioning battery
life well you're not proud of it if
you're not bringing that up even in the
least write something suspect about it
there's some fishy elements your battery
life yeah if you're pulling things down
from the cloud you're constantly backing
up your photos that you take I mean
every phone does that but there's
something right that you are you're with
me right there's going to be something
they're not super psyched on and it's a
pretty small phone to it looked really
thin so I have no idea who knows maybe
that's why the the RAM is so low because
everything else just relies on battery
but Ram isn't that bad two gigs of RAM
is in bed man there's only a few phones
that have three yeah I can't just wanted
them to push it I don't know that was I
was expecting a little bit more from the
hardware side of it it seems like there
are concentrating more on what to me
seems like gimmicks at first even the
most powerful phone available right now
as far as I understand it's only a quad
core 2.5 and this is 2.2 I'm 110 no 110
Giga hurt you want an octave ordered coy
whatever yeah I'm gonna push it man
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
