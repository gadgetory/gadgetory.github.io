the top tech news of the day and all the
other crap you want to throw in I'm
Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox Rubin and with
us is the newest cnet news reporter
Alfred Inge hi how are you whoo so
apples big event is tomorrow mm-hmm so
obviously for our obviously we're going
to be talking about that I don't know
and I feel it that you know all the
rumors then the newest iPhone it's just
there's not a lot to get excited about
right I'm excited because it's kind of
like the election you know in that I've
been reading about it for months and
it's finally happening so it's kind of
like all right let's get it out of the
way let's get it let's do this just get
let's just do it already so and I have
this small itch in the back of my head
that's telling me maybe there's a
surprise coming hey it's like software
related or I don't know something it
probably won't happen but hey maybe
they'll maybe they'll come out with
something that we didn't actually know
was gonna happen uh I I hope so too i'm
really hoping there's a surprise there's
a one more thing although Apple has been
very short on one more things it'll be
the car it'll be the car that you like
hey guys you had told you guys this
isn't a phone event car and I need to a
bar Yan TV together it'll just be an
ipad ipod on wheels that's it you can
like scroll it so is it like a
skateboard yeah everyone um hoverboards
are back well look we've talked about
this before but we've got Alfred on to
offer some extra suggestions but you
know what do you want to see in an
iphone what sort of your your dream
feature no I forget all those rumors
what do you really really want to see in
the iphone well i'm hoping that they
finally make one that fits my hand sized
perfectly even the SE they shrunk it and
was still uh till today a little bit
yeah yeah there's like older models that
actually fit yeah I got that what are
you I thought you know what just go with
the ipod yeah get an ipad mini still
using nano yeah bad what about you like
a dream feature don't they not have OLED
displays yet but soon son dies yeah so
that would be
cool really that's such a boring I think
that would be nice that would you know
like I play a lot of games on my phone I
was gonna see something like built-in
laser attachment or something something
crazy Oh are we doing that yeah Oh
Jeannie kind of thing well I would love
it to be able to control in ieder own
bed I don't know that's actually pretty
practice ok not it would work well my
idea earlier I want the car thing if it
turns into a car to sign me up
transforms Wow yes really good yeah that
is about the box Vicki are lastly galaxy
note 7 was the big headline last week
but not phone itself but the risk of it
exploding samsung said that it was
recalling 2.5 million units is so bad
the timing couldn't be worse cuz it's is
so bad for them and they were really
just starting to like get a nice pace
going I felt like it was so it would be
there swaggins I was there for the gear
s3 launched last week in Berlin to
Swagger was back they were feeling
really confident in like a day later
boom recall it's just of all the things
to you know recall for sometimes it's
you know we we have a minor glitch or
anything like that but yeah it explodes
so yeah yeah yeah this isn't just like a
quick success well let me to be fair
they said there were 35 cases out of
whatever the 2.5 million leopard sold so
it's not a huge risk think we don't know
writing um but yeah it's it's kind of a
black eye for samsung right so it'll be
interesting to see how many people that
bought the note 7 that you know get
involved in the recall just decide to go
for something else you know yeah I mean
like the s7 is doing well and like
that's been out for several months now
so I don't know I know it's a pretty
slick phone shame too bad it's too bad
it explodes is explosive alright for
more about that Apple Samsung check us
out on cnet I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox
Rubin &amp;amp; I'm Alfred thanks for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
