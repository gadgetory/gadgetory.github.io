at CES 2013 in Las Vegas this is CES
in-depth I'm Bridget Carey with my
colleague Roger Cheng and for the next
25 minutes or so we'll be diving into
the hottest news of the show so far and
the big trend word here today aside from
TV's always being big as 4k and OLED and
we just heard from Panasonic that
they've combined the two together
they've a 4k OLED this is the one of the
first it's a prototype definition this
is the TV for you yeah it always has one
of the other guy when it comes to TV
that's how it works back I Panasonic's
been doing a lot at this show I mean
we've seen all types of products
everything from headphones that have
bone conduction so you don't actually
stick the music in your ears you stick
it on your cheekbones and hear it that
way some crazy stuff like that they're
taking on roku with a streaming media
box they're all over the place it seems
it's like they're coming out with guns
a-blazing right what it's interesting if
you go to the show if you follow show
look at the show floor and listen to
presentations you'd never know that
Panasonic was actually in deep financial
trouble yeah they're not doing so good
lately I read yeah yeah i mean this this
really could end up being the last straw
for panasonic i mean at one point CEO
even dropped a hint that he might even
drop drop the entire consumer business
because a lot of its not profitable this
is the Consumer Electronics Show sooo
you know they thought that's a big deal
for them have all these things that are
so you so do you think like I guess this
is where big hurrah that if it doesn't
take then we might not see them again it
could very well be yeah that's pretty
crazy well I'll have to guess keep watch
on that another trend we're seeing this
year is NFC and everything just
wirelessly connecting to other devices
by touch we're sharing all of our media
and different ways we've seen once again
Panasonic right they had a phone be able
to just touch to your TV to be able to
send your media that way but Sony had a
lot of devices they they want you have
your phony remote control which makes a
lot more sense if you think about it
yeah you're not gonna walk all the way
over your TV to tap it every time so
nice that's nice thoughtful thing you
know it's interesting when NFC first
came out it was all about mobile payment
it was all about hey you're going to be
able to use this at the register and now
I'm seeing nothing about payments here
yeah well I mean I haven't covered
industry for a while I've heard about
the mobile payment story for last
several years and this year is supposed
to be the year mobile payments is what
I've heard every year love what every
year i think we hear that this so yeah
an NFC is sort been hailed as the
technology that will will bring mobile
payments out there you take your phone
you you tapped by the counter the the
grocery store boom you're done that
hasn't really happened but what we're
seeing at this show a lot of different
other uses for NFC but the biggest one
obviously pairing the devices together
it's it's something that makes complete
sense for consumers right I mean you
just tapping two devices together to
kind of bridge them it's just it's
instinctive it makes sense and I think
we're going away from this whole mobile
payment shifted it seems like their
shift is more towards pairing the
apparent speakers pairing of pairing
other accessories so is it gonna save me
much time you know compared to when I'm
just opening a Bluetooth anyway it's
probably not but it's kind of cool I
think it does actually cuz blue tooth
has always been I mean one of the knocks
it's a little cumbersome you know you've
got up you got login you got our typing
to ID NFC is dead simple you just tap
the phone i'll do a speaker remote
control TV and boom they're connected
you're not to think about it and then
you go to someone's house and roll
tapping each other's speak yes well i
have a party with arose a capping party
will be awesome you know i think i think
it's probably the one the one home
device that you can see people get in
their heads around and wanting to
understand actually wanting to buy
versus you know how payments have been
going nowhere right but that'll be
interesting to see how that picks up in
the consumer space I don't know about
you've seen some a lot of quirky gadgets
this year loving at all the all the
different innovations we've seen and one
that has been written about today is
something like a Rosie the robot for
smokers this is weird it's called the
fami bot and I'm pointed up it's the
concept of a room aware it just kind of
rome's on its own right but it's gonna
it's an air purifier that will sense
when's the air is impure in a certain
corner so if someone's a smoker it's
going to go after you I love it I think
that's the the best passive-aggressive
way of
I smell gonna quit because you have a
little robot following you everywhere
you go but yeah you tried everything
else now you can have just just sick
this robot on someone but it does a
little bit more do it family has a
camera in it so the whole monitor and
I'll let you know if someone is
unexpectedly home and it also plays
music it's another bluetooth device the
first step of robotic Butler yeah
hundred dollars for a robotic Butler
that's them that's what the it'll come
out in March so you know if if if that's
in your price range you know you don't
have to worry about you know holiday
tipping you know for normal housework
yeah yes I guess you could save some
money my studio apartment probably
couldn't use a robot like that but that
would be a pretty pretty much a waste
when it comes to these smart devices I
mean could you use anything that could
help you out in the home I mean I've I
know we've seen pool cleaners even here
smart pool cleaner smart vacuums because
I need to play Angry Birds on my vacuum
cleaner President Reagan cleaner usually
a big hit with the home pets I'm sure
yeah well um you know I mean what else
have you seen and anything else on the
show that you seem no more and more
health devices every year I'm not sure
how do people are actually wanting to
check their blood pressure but it's cool
that you can and there are more choices
for it yeah perhaps that's getting the
price down I don't about you and it
comes to health devices what maybe you
actually want Oh track I mean I care to
know if I have a pulse that's good to
know but you still have a pulse you know
but I check every 15 minutes really but
I kind of get it I mean especially stuff
like the field band and Fitbit I mean
some of these workouts oh yeah I mean it
does it motivate you anymore what I
found is it motivates for a little while
than your natural well my natural a TD
tendencies I just it just sort of
becomes less interesting to me unless
gimmicky and so I stopped using it
basically really yeah although the
FuelBand I loved because because it's on
your wrist whenever I'm drinking beer
I'm actually working out it tells me I'm
burning fuel burning Nike Fuel see there
you go positive reinforced all the room
face you feel good about yourself yeah
you know I would like something to
actually yeah motivate me because you
unless your friends are on
the gamification of all this yes people
are pushing apps for gamification I'm
curious just if I have any friend of
actually would be on it otherwise it's
just one I think that I'm not motivating
myself as it is that's I think the key
is getting your friends on it and I'm
sure that's what Nike wants here with
the field band but it doesn't work as
well unless it there's a social element
there like if you all your friends are
on fifth bitter or the FuelBand you guys
are comparing competing I think it could
work it works really well in it said
there's something I kind of keep you in
the game as opposed to just sort of do
it yourself there's still ultimately I
mean you're still exercising it's all
about self motivation right what about
the laziness factor of now Fitbit put in
on your wrist instead of having to be on
your hip and then taking off to go to
sleep on your wrist and this so maybe
everyone's just going to have a
wristband I mean is that where we're
going you think no seems like it easier
than having the pedometer because
especially as a woman where am I gonna
put on my dress it's also you can't
really look yeah yeah the pedometers are
cheaper though okay we gotta we have to
squeeze in a quick break and be back
with our special guest samsung's david
steele stick around
welcome back to CES in depth I'm Bridget
Carey with Roger Cheng and joining us on
the cnet stage is David steel with
Samsung and you brought some goodies
with us so yeah well goodies so what we
have here okay so this is the first one
this is the samsung galaxy note 10.1 it
launched last year but this brand new
here at CS is with embedded 4G LTE with
verizon wireless oh so for the first
time we're going to get some 4G LTE on
varieties that outside yep so now you
can take it around with you you've got
access through the 4g LTE network
obviously it's a it's a great tablet but
the key feature on this galaxy note 10.1
is the s-pen I think it's hidden back
over here right on cue how would you
snacks right yeah and this is really
coming out of a sense of how do we make
all of our products more intuitive
easier to use so in this case having a
pen where you can enter through the
handwriting it's very easy to manipulate
and it's also a feature that we came out
last year with the Samsung right on cue
samsung galaxy note this is a no 2 and
the same thing about just having this S
Pen pull out so being on different
devices it's yeah I'm a big fan of
having that penny embedded in the actual
device because how many times you know
lose I said that stylist is with you
yeah well just leave it out in the green
room okay now this is definitely a
popular one with the galaxy I love it oh
it's always so so beautiful you guys are
good at that oh and what else do you got
yeah what are you out here so this is
one of a new laptops here at the show
this is a series series 7 ultra so this
one the using Windows 8 so you have all
the advantages of touch screen touch 880
life touch is very important I mean we
see displays now on so many different
devices all the way from
smartphones tablets PCs obviously so I'm
curious though especially smart yes I
need I definitely need to tap my
refrigerator three or four times a day
random just for kicks just for kicks if
I had touched me I probably would but I
want to ask about the touch screen it's
I mean it's it's cool but what do you
hear from consumers about whether or not
they want this and especially I'm
assuming there's an added cost to having
a touch screen a giant touchscreen
display like this what exactly is the
demand for touchscreen so touch screen
we see really becoming very common
across a whole series of devices because
it's so easy for consumers to use I
think so many consumers with smartphones
have got used to touch screen right it's
something they're very familiar with so
on the pc environment again having it
there is something very familiar it's
very comfortable try to make it more
intuitive and that's something we've
done also on a smart TV interface this
year trying to get as we make devices
smarter more complicated put more
functions and features in how do we
still think hard about how to make them
easy to use gotcha and it's a window
it's obviously Windows 8 computer wanted
to ask you ma'am so far and he's early
goings but how is windows 8 doing so for
samsung we're doing very well in the pc
market i mean i can't talk about windows
as a whole really right thank you for
buying 10 so we're doing well we were
the fastest-growing pc brand in the US
last year we think p windows 8 brings a
lot of great features again experience
from smartphones and tablets now into
the pc environment design is becoming
more of a feature of PCs we see the
consumerization of the workplace to
bring your own device obviously
happening on smartphones and tablets but
also could everyone's looking for an
easier experience for the pc at work so
again we can see the benefits of touch
and the windows 8 functionality you know
obviously TVs tend to be the star of CES
and you guys brought a couple whoppers
out for the show on right here though no
not too big little too big to roll out
on the stage but I you know everyone's
talking about Ultra HD 4k
not exactly in your basic consumer price
range you know and I want to know from
from your perspective when it comes to
televisions what do you see as being the
more popular feature that we're going to
be getting sooner and wanting to you
know get in our TVs next year a little
more practical than maybe taking out a
car loan for for our big 4k TV that
we're supplying you a new home to fit
the sense of 110 inch HDTV the new
features are gonna be seen that probably
more of us will be able to be affording
and checking out in the next line of TVs
yeah so suddenly in the short term it's
going to be a lot about smart TVs more
than sixty percent of a large screen TVs
now being internet-connected so the TV
is really an Internet device or
appliance in the home and then we see
all the different applications and
services that come from that we're
showing a new recommendation engine at
this year's show that will help you
what's a watch when I don't know well it
will it will help you find content that
you're interested in for broadcast TV it
will link to all your other devices like
smartphones and tablets so you can get
access to content that store their
videos you've taken or photos that
you've shot and social media because TV
is still a Leanback experience you want
to look at the big screen TV but you
want the lots about social media at the
same time right everyone's always
connected so many people are
multitasking so smart TV is really going
to be the focus I think for the next few
years and then we'll see technologies
like LED will see you HD as well
starting to grow okay it's very cool
very cool and what you were talking
about with with getting content um you
know between the TV be able to search
for that what was that new technology
you guys the software was new focus yeah
I was like a search function with what
yeah how's it explain how that works on
its supposed to cross different devices
beyond district TV right it's called
single search yeah so more and more
consumers are looking for you know one
device to connect to other devices and
you can either do that device to device
or you can do it through the cloud
through a service but what we're putting
in a new Smart TV lineup is a way of
searching content that stored on other
devices that are connected wirelessly to
that TV so it's a way if you do have
like photos you've taken
on your smartphone or you've got images
on your tablet you can connect to those
and very easily view those on the TV so
trying to connect devices that's going
to be a big trend for us in 2013
obviously we've got all of these
different screens how can you link them
together Joe I wanted to ask about that
the phenomenon of this staggie I know
we're trying to turn your toes here it's
not no stacking of the you know watching
a TV and playing with your tablet what
would fund is a lot of people what I do
at least i'm usually searching for stuff
on that TV usually whether it's X Factor
I'm looking at the bio the singer
they're not that I watch X Factor but
what exactly is Samsung doing what's the
thinking therefore for how you sort of
better bridge that the information gap
from the tablet to the TV's you're like
a way to actually get some that
information automatically fed into the
tablet or yes so one example of it is
the remote control I mean we've already
seen lots of apps on smartphones and
tablets that connect as a remote
controlled some of them are quite smart
right meaning you can actually see some
previews things like that we also have
second screen content and increasingly
now working with content producers who
actually want to produce content for
multiple screens so that their
programming to a TV together with a
connected tablet and everybody working
specifically with you guys yeah we
sponsored in the New York television
festival a contest among producers to
actually come up with TV content on
multiple screens oh so as more of these
screens get connected game games are a
fantastic example right you could be
sitting there with your smartphone this
is your your hand of cards and on the TV
is like the dealer's deck or never for
everyone to see so this multi-screen
environment is one that now content
producers can program to and we can
connect the devices you know I know the
big problem a lot of us have is that we
have video that's you know in the cable
box but it's also on netflix and hulu
and searching through that I mean is
this something that you guys are looking
into being the answer i need to news way
to stop opening up a different app each
time i want to search for something
yeah so more and more we're getting
there suddenly as the iap eyes are
opened up and then we work with
third-parties we have a very big program
on our Smart TV platform to partner with
third parties for that most consumers do
have preferred services that they'll
watch video content through but you know
we have that way that you can see you
know here are the different services
that you can use to access that
particular content so really making it
easier taking advantage of touch screens
and then really the smarts in the TV
when we talk about smart TV you should
get some benefit from it I could always
use a little to be a little more smarter
every day right well thank you so much
mr. Steele I appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
