my top five list of major automotive
engineering trends these are big
long-term trends in the industry that I
think will fundamentally change the kind
of car you drive tomorrow let's get
started with number five and here I'm
gonna start off in the cellar admittedly
with electrification of cars now I'm
going to enrage a lot of greenies here I
know but know that I do really like
electric cars I just think they're the
smallest of these five trends because
they remain a sliver of automotive sales
that's a given and we don't yet have
vision into a major breakthrough in
battery tech that will get people over
the hurdles the average driver now that
they have about buying an e V which is
charged time and range of course Tesla
Model S Nissan Leaf Chevy Volt these
have all been home runs within evie
parameters once we get a major
breakthrough in battery or maybe soaring
gas prices again one day
the whole market may change for the
bigger number four is an old chestnut
it's the internal combustion engine now
you're probably thinking what is new
about that just about everything go back
a few years and the hue and cry was oh
the combustion engine is sunsetting we
had soaring gas prices we had the
arrival of electric cars we had
governments willing to throw money at
anything with a battery in it but then
guess what happened internal combustion
engine got massively high tech turbos
direct injection computerized valve
trains four cylinders instead of six or
even eight cylinder deactivation auto
start-stop high compression ratios
Atkinson cycle layouts and I'm leaving a
few out we've got so many hot new
technologies in the combustion engine
it's gonna keep firing on all cylinders
for quite a while number three you
already know in your bones its
connectivity your car is becoming a
mobile connected digital device as well
as a transportation platform whether
it's 4G and Google services phone
interfaces like carplay and android auto
your favorite streaming services
built-in - by the factory or an obd
donggil under the - connectivity is
enabling things in your car that range
from infotainment to remote access to
new ways of ride and car sharing and new
ways of rating pricing and delivering
insurance this is the big future of how
your car is the latest data probe in
your life and if that makes you queasy
you can always Drive a 67 like I do
number 2 is a big one a mega trend this
is going to be autonomy adaptive driving
systems now partial autonomy in the
future and substantial self-driving not
that many years out nothing out there
will so impact the number of fatalities
the number of injuries the logic of how
we use our cars and even the layout and
shape of our cities and suburbs as this
one will it's also the one that most
divides driver opinions makes
Republicans and Democrats look like
they're in love with each other
my number one automotive engineering
trend for today and many ears out might
surprise you it's taking out weight now
that used to mean back in the day just
buying a smaller car not a palatable
choice to most people now it means the
use of amazing new materials aluminum
carbon fiber low weight high strength
steel using CAD design to make
structures that weigh less do more and
are stronger at the same time when a car
is lighter it gets better mpg as a
result spews fewer emissions accelerates
faster breaks more quickly corners more
effortlessly and puts less wear on its
own parts like shocks and brakes and
tires this is the holy grail with every
automotive engineer I talk to less car
is more and we're in a golden era of
really making a difference there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
