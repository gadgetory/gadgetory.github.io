reunited with Nathan Drake for the final
installment of the Uncharted series on
one hand taking control of the dashing
fortune hunter again is a welcome return
to the franchise on the other hand we
are definitely going to miss lines like
this we're good everything's good
uncharted for a thief's end brings
nathan drake out of retirement and back
on to the treasure hunting trail this
time seeking the vast fortunes of a long
dead pirate Nate finds himself really
without much of a choice and he has to
put his holster back on and re-enter the
world of treasure hunters one last time
we spent about 30 minutes playing
through a sequence heading toward a
volcano in Madagascar we took full
control of a jeep which is a franchise
first and used it to traverse the
terrain and solve a few puzzles even
though it's the fourth game in the
series this old dog still got some new
tricks the first thing we notice is how
big the world seems compared to previous
installments it's not quite open world
but it's what developer Naughty Dog is
calling wide linear we wanted to give
the players kind of more opportunity to
go off the beaten path explore find some
side stories that have to do with the
pirate treasure and the oldest pirate
lore that we've built for this adventure
or not as we wandered we found smaller
treasures littered throughout the zone
making exploration key if you are a
completionist there are also some new
combat mechanics including a grappling
hook deeper stealth options and the
ability to mark enemies and see how
aware they are of your presence so you
can take out bad guys silently or you
can still leap in guns a-blazing in
traditional nathan drake fashions
we didn't get a larger sense of how
uncharted 4 story might play out but if
you're a fan of Nathan Drake you might
need to get your tissues ready and I
guess someone could make a prequel or
could do something between the
adventures but what we've been saying is
the first three games have had a certain
kind of story story kind of trajectory
for us we're viewing them as a set up to
the payoff being uncharted 4 and it'd be
pretty hard to do a sequel with nathan
drake after them uncharted 4 hits
PlayStation 4 on may 10 2016</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
