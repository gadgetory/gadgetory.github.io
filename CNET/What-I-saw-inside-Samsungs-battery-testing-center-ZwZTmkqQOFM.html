to see the new Galaxy s8 and to also get
a glimpse into house Samsung has changed
as testing processes
we spent most of our time in a town
called Sioux on this is what Samsung
calls digital city and it's their
headquarters it's actually the size of a
small city there are about 34,000
employees it's about the size of 250
soccer fields so basically it's this
massive campus where they do all of the
research for their new products our
second day we flew to Gumi which was
about an hour on the helicopter and
goomy this is where Samsung's newest
devices are assembled it has eight other
sites around the world including in
Vietnam but this is kind of the heart of
where their products have always been
put together with the Galaxy s8 they're
also doing new testing to make sure that
the battery is safe like puncturing it
with a nail putting it in machines that
simulate really high temperature so over
150 degrees Fahrenheit they also started
some new tests one of the most
interesting ones we saw was what they
call accelerated usage test this is
basically trying to simulate what you
actually do with your phone but at a
much sped up process Samsung also had
these huge shelves set up with different
rows of batteries different phones
plugged in to test to make sure that the
battery charging and discharging works
properly they have the ability to test
60,000 phones in Gumi while we were
there they had 6,000 actually being
tested in terms of charged and
discharged with the accelerated usage
test those tests take five days per
device so it's a really thorough program
I was one of the first people outside
Samsung to actually get to see the
Galaxy s8 so for Samsung this is kind of
the device the codename did the dream to
show employees that technology that they
dream up can actually come in a product
even if it takes five or six years
there's the curved display which they
call the infinity display they got rid
of the physical home button and went
with a digital one they have a new
artificial intelligence assistant called
Bixby show me gallery photos from mother
okay I've got 26 pictures with Bixby
it's not about questions like who's
Martin Luther King jr. or what's the
weather it's a new interface for your
phone so you're not just gonna see Bixby
in phones you're gonna see it in washing
machines refrigerators in the u.s. most
people know samsung for its TVs and it's
phones when you go to Korea it's not
just electronics they manufacture
clothing they build boats they have an
advertising business in Korea Samsung is
makes up more than 20% of the economy so
they're just this huge behemoth that you
run into it every point right now they
have some problems in Korea though
they're vice chairman Jay Wiley who is
actually slated to take over control the
company has been arrested and charged
with bribery and embezzlement Samsung is
still really apologetic for what
happened with the note 7 but I think
they're also very optimistic about the
s8 this is the device for them that this
is going to really show their position
on design on software and they think
that now they finally have a program a
phone that will help their different
devices talk to each other better for
Samsung this is just a huge huge deal
