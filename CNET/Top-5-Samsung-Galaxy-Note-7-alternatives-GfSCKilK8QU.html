its Galaxy Note seven and with no
replacement in sight fans of the
explosive phone will be forced to find
the next best thing so for all of you
out there here are five alternatives to
get you past the morning phase at number
five the samsung galaxy note 5 sure it's
last year's phone but it still holds up
to the competition and it's the only one
on this list with a stylus which is
probably what attracted you to the note
in the first place
physically it's not much different with
the same unibody glass design subtle
curves and qHD display no SD card and no
waterproofing but you can splurge on the
bigger storage option and still spend
less than you would have on the note 7
and at number four the iPhone 7 plus if
you had your sights set on the note
chances are you're in the market for
another Android but if you're willing to
play the field the iPhone 7 plus may be
worth a glance it has a killer dual lens
camera with a new depth effect feature
that will make your porches pop and it's
equipped to handle the elements with
just a slightly lower IP rating than the
note and a matching price tag next up we
have the pixel XL for all you diehard
Android fans out there Google's own
pixel X cell phone we'll give it to you
in its purest form it's got a sleeker
design than previous Nexus devices
brighter qHD display faster quick charge
and just as much power as the note 7
with the same Snapdragon motor under the
hood no SD storage option but unlimited
cloud storage for your pictures and
videos on Google photos and you'll be
first in line to get Android updates and
coming in at number two with the LG V 20
another Android that ships with new get
out of the box the V 20 has a similar
5.7 inch display plus a secondary screen
at the top with similar features to the
edge display on the note it has
impeccable sound quality and a great
dual lens camera like that on the iPhone
7 plus but with expandable storage and a
removable battery that people miss from
previous notes topping off our list the
samsung galaxy s7 edge the closest
alternative to the note 7 slightly
smaller screen but the same vibrant
display sexy curves killer camera SD
card slot and water resistant body you
don't get the stylus USB C port or
Gorilla Glass 5 display but you'll sleep
at
at night knowing you don't have a
ticking time-bomb on your nightstand if
none of these catch your eye you can
always wait for next year's Galaxy s8
which will likely be announced at Mobile
World Congress in February and after
everything Samsung has been through this
year you can bet they'll be trying to
blow us away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
