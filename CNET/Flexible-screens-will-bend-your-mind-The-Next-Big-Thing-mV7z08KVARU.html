comes where's my folding phone right
we're back into another hot rumor season
that we're just on the cusp supposedly
of rollable bendable foldable
electronics let's get out in front of a
hype and see what's really out there
first of all some terminology foldable
and flexible economy in two different
things
flexible typically means a display that
can be flexed in manufacturing and hold
that shape look at something like the
edges of a galaxy edge phone or even an
Apple watch it's not a perfectly flat
display but it doesn't move after it's
manufactured then you've got foldable
and that very clearly promises that you
can take a piece of finished electronics
and you can fold it repeatedly many
times over the course of your ownership
that's dramatic stuff like some of the
prototypes we've seen of recent rollable
full-size screens or a samsung phone
prototype that would fold right down the
middle by you doing it and somewhere in
the middle we might want to categorize
bendable look at something like an LG G
flex phone has a really significant
amount of give but it doesn't fold or a
Samsung television that can go from flat
to gradually curved upon command but
again doesn't fold taken together as a
continuum these various forms are no
longer niche IHS research predicts that
stretchable rollable foldable or
bendable displays taken together will be
51% of all displays shipping by the year
2020 boasting a compound annual growth
rate of 58% from now till 2020 that
means about 180 million units a year by
that year and research firm ID Tech X
projects the majority of those will go
into phones followed by tablets
wearables cars and planes but the real
Wow in the marketplace that will get
consumers attention aggregated is when
we have electronics that can fold and an
acute angle and then be used again the
different form factor when they're flat
now the hurdles for all these
manipulable screens and electronics are
basically in three buckets repeatability
can the flexible part of the electronics
do that many times and not break
thinness most foldable design prototypes
I've seen Sacrifice thin for the folding
part and durability
many of the new flexible displays I've
seen get rid of a glass front and have
one made of plastic instead now beyond
those engineering hurdles what are the
use cases in other words what are you
going to do with these things the idea
of a phone that can be a very handheld
size but then
open up into something more immersive
like a tablet that seems to make some
sense we've also seen prototypes like
what lenovo has been showing where
you've got a wrist wearable that can
snap out into a rigid flat phone on
demand and once all of this use case and
engineering stuff is settled the
question is can it be done economically
so we're not paying a premium for what
could be seen as a gimmick something
called roll-to-roll manufacturing is
becoming very powerful in electronics
manufacturing and that could be a key
way to get scale at low cost for these
new flexible components so a lot of hard
and soft hurdles are lying out there for
the world of flexible electronics and
flexible displays in particular but our
seemingly limitless appetite for
upholstering our lives in displays leave
the door open for some degree of success</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
