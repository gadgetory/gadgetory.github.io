2014 we're at the Samsung stands taking
a look at this it's the Samsung m5
speaker let's have a look so this is
kind of Samsung's take on the Sonos
multi room speaker system so the idea is
you'll have one of these and you can
control what's playing the music using
your app there's loads of support for
different apps you get tuned in Amazon
Pandora it works on Android and iOS and
Samsung tells me the support for pulling
music from your PC to play over the
speakers will be coming very soon as
well this thing's a little bit smaller
than what Samsung's already announced
we've already seen the m7 speaker that's
been out for a while now
this one is a little bit more compact
it's got one base driver it's got one
mid and one tweeter as well because it's
a little smaller though it should be
less expensive so samsung's dream is
that you have one of these in every room
of your house and if you do have that
then you can do quite cool things like
grouping speakers together having to
play different music in different rooms
although if you do want to connect more
than one speaker you're gonna have to
get the hub which cost $50 I quite like
this triangular design it'll stand
upright or you can lay it down flat as
well the one thing that's missing though
is that all-important sound quality
because this is a noisy tradeshow
environment we can't really hear how
good this is so you'll have to wait for
the full review for that there's no
price of released a ESO stay tuned on
that i'm luke west road bussiness at CES
2014 go to CES sorce Netcom for more
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
