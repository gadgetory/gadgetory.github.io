look under the hood of Apple's new iOS 5
hands-on with the new HTC evo and the
new HTC evo find out who's fastest in
our tablet speed test and I've got all
the dirt on what really goes on at area
51 it's all coming up right now
I ever when I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer some unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's start with the good between
all of our coverage from e3 and breaking
down iCloud last week we didn't have
time to tell you about the other big
news coming out of WWDC specifically all
the new features we can look forward to
in iOS 5 as we promised in last week's
show here's kent german to break it down
for you hi I'm Kent chairman senior
editor here at cnet com titters like a
first look at the beta version of Apple
iOS 5 it will run on the iphone 3gs it
will run on the ipad and then i'll run
on the ipod touch as well i'm going to
start off with notifications because
that's one of the more exciting ones
luckily Apple has taken a page from
androids book actually of course Apple
does it differently by a pulldown menu
so you just take the top of the screen
you pull down and you'll see all your
notification just see missed calls you
see missed emails Apple added a couple
new things though you do see whether
current weather you can't see a stock
ticker so really nice to see those
notifications updates it's just
something applets need to do for a while
and great to see it next feature is
newsstand this is very similar to ibooks
looks very much like the iBooks icon you
can go there you can see all your
magazines in one place and then as new
magazine subscriptions come in so as new
issues come out they'll be downloaded
the phone automatically really nice
there do a better Twitter integration on
iOS 5 you can tweet a photo straight
from the photo application so once you
take a photo you can do it all from the
photo so that's really nice you can also
do things like add a location you can
sync Twitter with your contacts list and
you can tweet directly from YouTube
safari and map so nice to see there we
also have a new reminders app now that a
name is due to do is sort of like a
to-do list and you can put them all in
one thing those send you reminders is
you need to the reminders also can be
tied to your locations so that's a neat
feature camera controls a couple things
you'll be able to do is you'll be able
to you can you can see gridlines when
you're taking a photo you can pinch to
zoom and then once you take a photo
you'll get camera editing features not a
real extensive amount of the
but you can do things like crop you can
rotate you can do red-eye reduction so
nice to see there and again that's just
from the photo gallery application I
message this is a brand new feature it's
very similar to blackberry messenger so
it's a free messaging application you
can do group messaging you can send
multimedia messages so you can send
videos or photos and so just another
feature to keep in contact and more for
messaging one of the best things is pc
free this enables you to activate your
iphone and do software updates without
plugging the iphone into your computer
so that's a great thing inside the email
will have few options you'll be able to
flag messages you'll have rich text
format among other things better
indentation and the ability to drag
addresses between your two CC and BCC
line also in the mail application you
can search within the body of emails
rather than just the subject to and from
line so another good addition finally in
the Safari browser you'll be able to add
links to a read later list also have a
reader up breeder feature that will
strip down all the junk on a webpage and
just give it a nice clean format other
things you will see is you'll get a
split keyboard for the iPad you get a
revamped music app for the iPad also in
Game Center you can buy games directly
from Game Center Apple did say that
we'll have 200 new features in iOS 5 so
they only really went through 10 of them
and I mentioned a few of those 10 here
iOS 5 is a smaller update hopefully this
sets us up for something bigger down the
road and such as up for a new hardware
maybe hopefully in the fall up to twenty
eleven i'm kent german you are the first
book at Iowa's fine now as Kent
mentioned apples promised 200 new
features in this latest smaller update
stay tuned for Brian tongs look at more
of those hidden nuggets later in the
show needless to say iOS four running on
an iPad 2 has plenty of good things
going for it already processing speed
being one of them but how does it stack
up against a word the opponent's like
the Galaxy Tab 10.1 leave it to eric
franklin to put them through their paces
hey guys eric franklin here i'm in the
cnet labs and it's casual day apparently
you know i recently called the samsung
galaxy tab 10.1 the ipad 2 of honeycomb
tablets thanks to a stem form factor and
clean design but how does it compare to
the ipad 2 in performance I've come up
with three new tests to find out cue the
on-screen stopwatch first up web speed
loading tests will go to nba.com see how
the Heat are faring and they're off and
the galaxy tab is in the lead ipad 2 is
up looks like the galaxy tab is about
done the ipad 2 comes in right behind it
so there you go website loading see
second speed test downloading an app
we'll see how fast download angry birds
seasons alright and they're off looks
like the samsung galaxy tab is on the
move the ipad is on the move as well
they're both going and they're both
going pretty fast through ipad 2 is
catching up looks like FN 20 very very
close it's gonna be close very close and
the ipad 2 is done same time is solid
and now it's done so samsung galaxy tab
few seconds behind the ipad 2 and app
downloads
now for our final test Facebook photo
upload speed each photo has been taken
with its tablets camera let's go and
they're off and the ipad is done the
galaxy job is now done so a little bit
behind the ipad but didn't really make
much of a difference they both really
really fast and both really really close
very close results it seems a 10.1 is
about on par with the ipad 2 and
performance give or take a couple of
seconds or more detailed test results
check out crave but until next time stay
for us so let me get this straight the
Galaxy Tab 10.1 and the ipad 2 look
alike cost the same and their
performance is basically too close to
call I can't imagine why Apple and
Samsung are accusing each other of
copying and court right now in other
Android news it was like the evo fairy
visited our offices this week HTC grace
us with not one but two new evo models
see if you can tell the difference
between them 3d is a big trend in tech
these days and now it's making its way
into smartphones hey everyone I'm Banita
and I'm here to bring you another look
at the HTC EVO 3d for sprint we first
got a glimpse at this android smartphone
during the ctia spring show and it's
finally hitting store shelves on june
twenty-fourth for 1 99 99 with a 2-year
contract it's the newest addition to the
carrier's evil line and as you might
have guessed from the name it offers 3d
features first it has a glasses-free 3d
display there's something called a
parallax barrier that sits on top of the
4.3 inch qhd super LCD and displays two
different images so you get that 3d
effect without the glasses you can use
it to play 3d videos and games and the
phone actually comes pre-loaded with a
copy of The Green Hornet in 3d and a
trial version of spider-man three DD the
game for some reason we couldn't get the
movie to play on our review in it but we
checked out some 3d videos from youtube
and also played spider-man it's not
going to show up in our video here but
it was pretty neat to see images popping
out from the screen there are also dual
five megapixel cameras on back that
you can use to capture 3d photos and
video and you can shoot 2d as well and
there's actually a convenient little
switch here on the right side to switch
between the two modes 2d photos looked
great but the 3d pictures made my eyes
crossed since it was hard to focus on
them and gave me a bit of a headache
Scott Stein another cnet editor here and
I actually compared it to the Nintendo
3ds which also uses the same technology
and we noticed that the 3d offers more
depth of field so instead of objects
just popping out the image goes deeper
into the background which I thought
provided a better 3d experience it's all
pretty fun in small doses but 3d isn't
the reason why you should get this phone
you should actually get this phone
because it offers good performance and
the solid set of features the EVO 3d
improves on the original evo with
Qualcomm's 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
processor and it also ships with larger
battery definitely noticed an
improvement and battery life and the
phone felt very snappy the smartphone is
also running Android 2.3 Gingerbread and
features the latest version of HTC Sense
which bring some great enhancements like
the new lock screen if it could add some
things to my wish list it would be more
internal memory and slightly better call
quality but overall I think the evo 3d
ranks amongst prints best android
smartphones especially if you're looking
for the latest and greatest features I'm
Bonnie ton this has been your first look
at the HTC EVO 3d for sprint
hey I'm Donald Balan today we're taking
a first look at the HTC evo view 4G this
is a 7-inch tablet running android 2.3
and running on sprint's 4g network it's
going to set you back three hundred
ninety nine dollars plus a two-year
commitment to a data plan which started
thirty four ninety-nine a month but a
tablet contracts give you the
heebie-jeebies there's a Wi-Fi only
version that sells for four hundred
ninety nine dollars called the HTC Flyer
either way I think the price is a little
steep for an Android tablet that's not
running Google's latest honeycomb tablet
OS the evo view is more or less just
like a super-sized HTC android
smartphone and that's not necessarily a
bad thing personally I like the way HTC
skins Android with their own interface
and this 3d design style but I don't
love it enough to pay this much
especially when most of the interest
these days are with 10-inch tablets that
are running Google's honeycomb the thing
that really does make this tablet
special is the magic pen or the HTC
scribe pen usually a stylus is a clue
that a tablet is using a cheap resistive
screen but this one is different you
don't need the pen to use the tablet in
fact you can't even use this pen for
navigation it's really just here for
taking notes and signing documents which
might sound dull but the whole thing is
very well thought-out and includes
integration with Evernote to store your
notes online for a limited time Sprint
is bundling this pen with the tablet but
if you want to replace it it still going
to cost you eighty dollars so expect you
probably will lose it because the round
design here has a tendency to roll off
tables so that's the evo view 4G from
HTC and sprint now with all the great
10-inch honeycomb tablets out there for
under five hundred dollars it's tough to
justify the cost but if you have your
mind set on a 7-inch tablet and the pen
technology and the 4g wireless speed
sound like something you'll really use
the evo view 4g could be the perfect fit
for sina com on Donald Bell
well aren't I guess that wasn't that
hard but there you have it thumbs up for
the phone thumbs kind of sideways for
the tablet let's go ahead and take a
break because we still have a lot more
show to come we'll be right back with
more tech review right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen your at cnet TV
continuing on in the good since Apple
showed it off last week more and more of
the hidden features of iOS 5 have been
emerging brian Tong is up next with some
secrets inside iOS 5 hey guys Brian song
here with cnet com and apple recently
announced some of the new features that
we can expect to see in iOS 5 for
idevices when it's released this fall we
have the developer version so we wanted
to show you some of the hidden features
in iOS 5 you might not know about now
customization has always been one of iOS
is weaker points and they aren't
bringing widgets but there are other
ways to trick out your phone how about
keyboard shortcuts go into general and
your keyboard settings and you can now
create a shortcut you type in that will
display a phrase to make life a whole
lot easier Apple's also improve the
accessibility options that can be
helpful for all of us you can turn on
the LED flash for alerts but you can
also turn on custom vibrations on your
iPhone now it's not what you think so
you guys can stop giggling now go to
sounds and find vibration patterns you
have the ability to enter and use
pre-made ones or create your own custom
vibration by tapping on the screen for a
contact that you know is more important
than others now on the iPad you can also
use a custom gesture to open different
menus on your screen by turning on
assistive touch at the moment you can't
assign it to unlock your screen or
launch any apps but it's probably coming
in the future and the multi-touch
gestures we've seen from previous builds
have returned in iOS 5 the Notification
Center is one of the big revamps and you
can create the alert style if it's more
important the option to view it in your
lock screen and how many notifications
show up at one time you also have the
option to purchase more ringtones or
alert tones in the preferences if you
check out the photo app it allows you to
create albums on your idevice and also
move photos into different albums Safari
the web browser has a nice option that
allows you to open a new page in the
background instead of interrupting the
current window you're viewing and the
weather app has a panel for your local
weather instead of adding a new one for
every city you visit and for all you
sketching
was something to hide you will now be
able to delete individual calls from
your call list plus one of the biggest
ones you can't see right now iOS 5
supports 1080p video playback which sets
them up for better video output directly
to TV sets and higher resolution
displays for future I devices now
there's plenty of other features buried
in here but we wanted to show you a few
of them that you can expect to see in
the fall i'm brian Tong with your first
look at some of the hidden features in
iOS 5 use it wisely that local weather
screen is pretty nice such a drag to
have to manually enter the town's name
whenever you travel to a new location
especially if there isn't like a bank
with a thermometer nearby ask your
parents about that one but first let's
see what's wrong with the world this
week in the bed for many people driving
a hybrid brings with it a feeling of
satisfaction we're doing one's part to
protect the environment and slow down
global warming well I hate to break it
to you but you're driving one of the
cars on our top 5 list this week I
wouldn't be bragging too much
some cars do indeed get much greener in
their hybrid version others are a
different shape I'm Brian Cooley with
top 5 brownest hybrids for 2011 rolling
piles of green wash that get barely
better MPG than their conventional
version and charge you plenty for that
lack of improvement we've ranked these
guys by the skin difference in their
average mpg over the non-hybrid version
and when there was a tie we broke it by
looking at tailpipe emissions and price
penalty so the hybrids that made this
list are sorted dirty piggy and
expensive not what you had in mind is it
let's do it number five is almost a
caricature it's the cadillac escalade
hybrid one of the first cars that
signaled this whole hybrid thing is
going to get a little out of hand it
gets just five mpg better than a
conventional laid but that's at least
good enough for 21 mpg average versus a
hoggish 16 on the straight gas engine
model but you'll pay eight thousand
dollars more for that lift number four
is the BMW x6 activehybrid that kind of
coop utility vehicle average mpg of 18
just for mpg better than a gas v8 and it
sports a huge price bump almost twenty
grand more than the gas engine ride
while delivering the worst emission
numbers of any car in this list talk
about some inconvenient truths number
three brings us another BMW the active
seven hybrid just three mpg average
better than a regular 750 I though to be
fair with this guy lacks in MPG
improvement it makes up in speed it's
really quick like four and a half
seconds 0 to 60 but I'm sorry the
regular gas engine 750 s no slouch
either and for the extra 13 grand you
can easily soothe your ego with a really
nice bottle of some bold losing ye every
time you lose a drag race number two on
our list of the brownest green cars is
the VW touareg hybrid get this just to
em
gee better than a straight-up touareg
without an electric motor and it costs
16 grand more presciently VW calls this
the rare beast in its lineup and with
numbers like these my hunch is it'll
stay that way before I take you to the
number one brownest hybrid for 2011
let's restore your faith in the most
hyped cars on earth here is a list of
some hybrids that do deliver stellar
double-digit MPG gains over their
conventional counterparts those guys
will change your fundamental fuel outlet
okay the number one hybrid car that
makes you mouth the word idiot when its
owner turns away is the lexus LS 600h l
also just to MPG better than a
non-hybrid LS 460 l with a middling 20
MPG average and for that you pay sit
down 37 thousand dollars more I know the
equipment levels will vary between these
models but still you could buy an entire
lincoln MKZ hybrid for the premium it
takes to get a lexus LS hybrid and still
have a couple grand left to go buy some
carbon credits or something okay if this
whole piece is just backfired horribly
and now you want to buy one of these
dubious rides head over to cars cnet com
where we have most of them reviewed and
for more top pods like this go to top
five dot cnet com I'm Brian Cooley
thanks for watching
actually I think the message is pretty
clear there watch all the top fives you
want but do not buy any of those cars I
mean that Lexus thing ought to be a
crime fact while I go call the green
police let's wrap things up with this
week's bottom line now a couple of weeks
ago brian Tong filled in for me while I
went on a secret assignment but now I
can tell you all about it I went with
the CBS early show crew to interview the
author of a controversial new book about
area 51 and I talked to some of the guys
who worked there so let's get straight
to the crazy stuff shall we area 51
wouldn't be area 51 unless there was
controversy and conspiracy and Annie
Jacobson's new book area 51 delivers
both she cites an anonymous source who
told her a surprising story about the
Roswell UFO and it's connection to the
mysterious Nevada military base well you
know what I write in the book has made
some people uncomfortable because it's
not reflective of what they want to
believe the government does or did at
area 51 and in the end of my book I
reveal what someone told me an engineer
who was a source for me what the source
told me was that a flying disc really
did crash in New Mexico it was taken to
wright-patterson and then it did wind up
at area 51 hence the name area 51 it
went there in 1951 and that he was one
of five engineers who reversed that
reverse engineered that craft it did not
come from Mars it came from Russia and
Joseph Stalin apparently engineered this
craft sent it as part of a
disinformation and fear campaign the
craft is believed to have been built by
two former third reich airplane
designers name Walter and Reimer Horten
and they had the blueprints on this
craft and apparently Stalin got a hold
of it and sent this craft as a means of
a hoax allow the War of the Worlds and
her source told her there were little
green men inside the aircraft but not
the kind you think this is the
information that came to me from the
stores who I absolutely believe I stand
by I've spoken with him since the book
has been published and what he said was
that the child sized aviators had been
the byproduct of this horrific human
experimentation program by Stalin in
collaboration with the doctor from
Auschwitz dr. Josef Mengele eventually
my source told me we chose to do the
same thing
and that upsets a lot of people this
idea that the United States government
could have experimented on humans the
allegations have shocked readers and
some of the veterans of area 51 I can't
conceive of it I that was that was not
the atmosphere we weren't that desperate
at that time I can't even picture Stalin
being that desperate but then again
people they do crazy things sometimes in
the interest of you know I just can't
picture it because I would then be
forced to saddle want to be part of it
we don't know we can't you know it's
just personal opinion everybody's got
their own opinion about certain things
and for me it's completely plausible
because I looked at the entire landscape
of area 51 and that need to know and the
compartmentalization of secrets and I
believe that something like this a rogue
program could have happened area 51 says
Annie Jacobson is a story of incredible
feats of technology but also a story
about a place far out in the Nevada
desert with hardly any oversight and
hardly any rules we had no bosses you
might say waiver top was it we were top
of our field and everyone anyone
superior just and we reported to no one
except the customer I rather see it as a
clear progression of what can happen
because one of the themes that I write
about in the book is using the Lord
Acton quote power corrupts and absolute
power corrupts absolutely some of the
men in the book show great moral courage
no matter what and I right about that
these these are America's cold warriors
but what I also write about in the book
is a number of men who experience a
downfall when power sort of overwhelms
them and you have the old archetype of
hubris taking over and they push things
too far and there's very serious
repercussions
remember that area 51 was set up to push
military science and technology faster
and further than any other nation that
is what we did and the rogue program is
an extension of pushing science over the
edge into black science or wicked
science now since we interviewed Annie
Jacobson TD Barnes and Jim Friedman for
this piece controversy about these
allegations has continued to grow the
Roadrunners the group of area 51
veterans that meet to talk about their
experiences there now say they feel
blindsided by the story and they've
emailed us to try to discredit the tale
what would you hope would come out of
this well I would hope that people would
read the whole book and be able to make
that judgment for themselves at the end
because everyone gets to have an opinion
about whether or not they believe the
veracity of my source as I do and if it
is even remotely possible what he said
happened then there are questions to ask
about black operations at area 51 one
thing is clear and probably always will
be very few people will ever know the
whole truth about area 51 the bottom
line this week god I'd love a conspiracy
I got to say there are plenty of people
who are shocked and outraged by the
allegations in Annie Jacobson's book but
I for one and with her read it for
yourself and draw your own conclusions
let me tell you it's a hell of a read
and head over to cnet com for other
videos in our series about how to get to
area 51 or as close as you can get and a
video on all the cool tech and
inventions that came out of the place
all right folks that's our show come
back next week for an all-new cnet tech
review until then there are tons of
great videos available every day at cnet
TV com I'll see you next time and thank
you for watching
