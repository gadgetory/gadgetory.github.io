products the difference between a
djtechtools product and other
controllers out there is that our
products are designed to be fun they're
designed to be powerful and they're
designed to really make things it make
it easy to do amazing things so how did
the MIDI fighter come about well we made
this product here this is actually the
original one this guy called me from LA
after I had taken my vci 100 and had
installed arcade buttons in it and this
guy in LA Jonathan asked me to make one
for him and I did and it was such a hit
that we started making them as a product
for people and we'd make these
customized controllers with arcade
buttons of people's choice it was really
expensive to make but people love them
and we discover hey you know what this
arcade button thing is pretty rad we
should make an arcade button controller
and so the very first controller who
made was the MIDI fighter we wanted to
find a way to actually be able to give
people this customization right in the
product so they can pop the arcade
buttons out put different colors in
there build it themselves and kind of
put it all in a fun DIY kit all right so
here we are in the djtechtools assembly
lab we've got Mitch here building some
circuit boards for the MIDI fighter pro
you've got a whole stack of MIDI
fighters over there waiting to go out
we've gone from one tiny little room in
my apartment literally to this and now
we've outgrown it so we're moving on to
something bigger but this is where all
the controllers come out of right now
those are our new chroma caps over there
you've got six or seven different funky
colors so people can customize their
their MIDI controllers with the color
they want and then on your right is the
assembly station where we put all the
MIDI fighters together the MIDI fighter
has grown up now and we've added the
MIDI fighter 3d to the line and that's
this guy here and the difference is that
this is a lot more scalable we produce
these by hand in the office one by one
and it's really time consuming to do
that we want to be able to give people
the option of changing out there buttons
themselves inside the software so what
we did to make the 3d 3d is we put a
gyroscope and accelerometer and a
compass in it so we're actually able to
predictably determine exactly where in
spaces controller
at any time in all three dimensions so
let's say I i turn on a button and I
button my turn on in effect i can then
modulate that effect when moving the
midi fighter i'm in either direction
let's say i want to reduce the amount we
effect i might tilt it forward and lower
that registers but when you're holding
it you now have the benefit of muscle
memory and gravity so you can actually
use you know the position of your full
body and you start to get into this kind
of more musical muscle memory space
where you've forgotten about the
computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
