is CES 2012 in Las Vegas the reason I'm
shouting is because I've coming at you
from the tao nightclub where i'm getting
a first look at the samsung galaxy nexus
for sprint now this code is pretty much
identical to the phone on verizon it's
got a 4.6 5 inch Super AMOLED HD display
it on screams new 4G LTE network and
it's running android 4.0 ice cream
sandwich which is the most updated
version of Android that you can possibly
get it's got all of this great new
interface going on some updated
applications on inside and support for
near-field communications for NFC play
you do cool things like game information
to another phone and also have to
now what are the major differences
between the syringe version and the
verizon version that was released before
is that there is native the support for
Google Wallet on here that means that
you'll be able to have to pay a
participating location if you've got
either a prepaid phone card or if you
have a city master part that uses paypal
so that's really cool and that's
something that the verizon phone doesn't
have yes in terms of other specs on this
phone
has a 5 megapixel camera on the back and
1.3 megapixel camera on the front it
also has a 1.2 gigahertz a dual-core
processor so it's very speedy and the
design is very thin it's like it's got
this really beautiful textured backing
and silver it's really good to hold in
the hand the screen of course is
beautiful and brilliant overall it's a
really great device and it's one we
absolutely loved on verizon so we've got
high hopes for an odd sprint major
telling different support is going to be
house Prince new 4G LTE network holds up
and that's really going to ring make or
break this code
so I'm Jessica's all sport here in the
tao nightclub in las vegas for CES
you're watching CNN CBS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
