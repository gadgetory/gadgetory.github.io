development Friday Labs finally
introduced it's Friday lock architects
designed this two hundred and forty nine
dollar smart lock that bills itself as
the smallest retrofit smart lock on the
market you can order the locks metal
shell and seven different finishes for a
look that complements your home's
Hardware Friday attaches to your
existing deadbolt replacing only the
thumb lunch portion of your old lock
it's powered by a large rechargeable
battery and comes with the USB charging
dock benissa battery is the motor and a
helpful color-coded faceplate for easy
installation friday uses Bluetooth to
connect to the Friday app where you can
lock and unlock the door view the
activity log and control guests access a
feature called Friday assist unlocks the
door when it's closed and uses
geofencing to unlock when you approach
you can also add friday to apple homekit
and incorporate it into your smart home
scenes there are a few issues with this
lock though first any guests you add are
given unlimited access there's no option
to add timeframes or expiration dates to
remote keys once you no longer need I
guess to have access you'll need to
delete their key in the app second Wi-Fi
is supported but not enabled right now
Friday labs say firmware updates are
coming that will address this but until
then you'll only have remote access to
your lock if you use an iPad or Apple TV
as a home kit hub and have the Friday
labs app on your iPhone Android users
are out of luck here I really love the
looks of this lock and it's Bluetooth
capabilities are solid but until we see
better Wi-Fi connectivity and more
detailed guest access
I'd recommend one of august clunkier but
smarter locks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
