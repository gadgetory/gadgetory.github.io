fancy features and extras but this $600
kenmore 2 5 1 3 2 top load washing
machine is the exact opposite it doesn't
have a transparent lid it doesn't have a
sleek stylish exterior it doesn't have a
large big foot capacity but what it
lacks and features it more than makes up
for with performance so we've tested
dozens of washing machines at this point
and this one got the absolute highest
stain removal score to date add in the
fact that it costs only 600 bucks
currently 450 at Sears so it's on sale
for a lot less and this is an
exceptional value another thing I really
like about this washer is that it
doesn't have a traditional educator so
that's a plastic arm that basically
sticks up from inside the bin and it
takes up precious real estate but the
fact that this only has four point three
cubic feet makes that kind of confusing
because they could probably make those
been larger seats to accommodate more
clothes another thing I wish it had was
a detergent dispenser so it has a liquid
bleach dispenser but you'll have to just
toss your powder or liquid detergent
straight and sub in before you add your
clothes so if you're in the market for a
really inexpensive washer that does an
amazing job removing stains this is a
model for you but just keep in mind that
it doesn't have the largest cubic foot
capacity and you'll have to do a little
extra work adding the detergent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
