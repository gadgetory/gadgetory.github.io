getting caught in a piracy war and is
your phone iced get ready to find out in
the queue hey there I'm rich demuro with
cnet TV and this is the Q helping tech
lovers feel less dorky since 2006 let's
get you started with your must click
moment a-list celebs telling us how to
curb global climate change by recycling
paper lowering a thermostat and
downloading music the public service
announcement is part of a live earth
push that's the 24 hour seven continent
concert raising awareness for global
warming a Russian music site selling
mp3s for a fraction of iTunes prices
shut down this week all of mp3.com
insisted they were legit supposedly
paying royalties according to a Russian
copyright law songs sold for pennies
compared to the 99 cents they fetch from
American sites and while that site is
down there's a new one called mp3 sparks
com but I couldn't get it to load moving
through the queue remember when the
hd-dvd key was revealed on the web and
hackers rejoiced at the cracked code now
the newest offensive from the industry
could mean lots of headaches for you and
I in a nutshell the solution from the
hd-dvd group is to make you upgrade HD
DVD playing programs every time a new
key is cracked that means if you pop in
the latest disc without the updated
software your computer won't even be
able to play it until you download a fix
this could happen many many times as
hackers continually crack the codes and
re-release the keys frustrating but it
won't affect standalone HD DVD players
have you heard of ice this is when you
put an emergency contact number in your
cell phone so first responders can
contact a friend or family member if
something happens to you the concept has
been around for a while but I was a
little surprised when I found an email
from palm saying ice your trio not to
mention i haven't had a trio for a year
but i stands for in case of emergency
palm promoting big red stickers you put
on the back of your phone letting
paramedics and police know there's an
ice contact in your address book to call
the stickers are two bucks but for this
to work your phone has to be unlocked
and easy to use finally the beta while
wireless providers give you a good idea
of coverage only signal map gives you
bar counts and dead spots team
used to be the market leader in terms of
disclosing street level coverage but
other providers have now followed suit
still the absolute best way to really
check coverage is to bring a phone and
see the bars signal map let's average
joe's become the network test guy by
inputting signal info on top of google
maps i love the extra info my friends
always thought i was so weird for
wanting to compare signal strength
