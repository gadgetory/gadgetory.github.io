industry again I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update t-mobile
continues to grab media attention with
more bold changes to its billing
practices in its latest stunt t-mobile
announced that it will not charge
customers and overage fee if they go
over their allotted Voice Minutes data
or text messages of course that only
applies to people without an unlimited
plan but if you have the brand-new
simple starter plan here's how it'll
work forty dollars a month gets you
unlimited talk and text but with data
you're limited to 500 megabytes and when
she hit that monthly limit your data
service is suspended until you choose to
buy more data so you're not surprised
with an overage fee but t-mobile is also
rallying for the other major carriers to
drop their overage fees t-mobile even
started a change.org petition to abolish
fees at AT&amp;amp;T Verizon and Sprint and
that's not all t-mobile is doing to win
over customers just a few days ago the
feisty carrier is leading customers at a
tablet to their existing plans at no
charge and giving away an extra one gig
of data a month for free until the end
of the year and in 2015 it'll cost ten
dollars a month for that tablet data
t-mobile is the fourth place US carrier
right now so it has to be bold to grow
against larger counterparts and speaking
of which verizon made its own small
change in plans if you bring your own
smartphone or your own tablet to verizon
you don't have to pay as much in your
monthly bill as someone who does buy a
new device with a contract it's part of
the more everything planned bringing
your old device could save ten dollars
off the monthly bill all other carriers
have been offering a break to customers
that bring in their own devices but only
now verizon is finally doing the same
it's been long rumored that Amazon is
working on a smartphone and the Wall
Street Journal stirred up the buzz on
this again with a report that Amazon
plans to show off a new phone in June
and
release it in September well we've heard
rumors about an Amazon smartphone since
2011 but this time around there are new
details about the phone it's said to
have several sensors to track your eye
movement and the journal reports that
the screen could have a 3d effect that
doesn't require glasses whatever gimmick
amazon is crafting it will need to focus
on price to compete against apple and
samsung amazon has been successful by
undercutting the competition on its
kindle tablets let's see if it can also
offer low prices on a phone and then of
course make all that money back from us
on all the movies and books we buy
that's your tech news update you can
