appliances right now we're taking a
first look at the dacor renaissance gas
range
now this professional styled range has
as you can see six burners it also has a
very distinctive looks very brushed
metal on the front very large knobs for
controlling the burners
it also has LED feedback here when you
turn on a burner it will turn on the
light so you know if the flame is open
what's also unique about this stove is
it has burners that range all the way up
to 18,000 BTU and go down to as low as
800 BQ you've got heavy-duty grills up
top they're all flat that means they can
take a lot of damage they can take a lot
of abuse you can you know run your pots
all across it and they won't snag on the
surface so below you have two ovens that
are both convection and they also have
very heavy duty handles as well as a
soft clothes as you can see and this
range is going to definitely cost you a
pretty penny it will cost in its most
expensive incarnation $8,100 for the 48
inch model it drops down to 61 hundred
dollars for the 36 inch model and I
believe around 5,000 for the 30-inch
model so if you wanna get your hands on
the dacor renaissance gas range you're
gonna have to wait until June of 2015
I'm Brian Bennett for CNET appliances
