you know you got a lot of pictures
looking up like this but they kept on
telling us don't look at the Sun it's
almost going like this you know it was
fun it felt very post-apocalyptic in a
nice way it was one of those events that
brought a lot of people together science
is cool while it was out on leave I
spent a lot of time with our teams on
the issue of Russian interference in the
US elections so the problem is that fake
news or misinformation has been
circulating around Facebook and people
are sharing it and liking it it is hard
to tell even today more than a year
after the election how big a problem
this was the fake news that I remember
was the Pope supposedly endorsing
presidential candidate Trump at the time
whenever I hear a bur goober oh boy yeah
I was part of delete uber when I hear
the word uber I think of a company that
was really trying to fight its way back
from the depths of hell I don't know oh
yeah you could say hell it's it's from
the depths of hell they had to replace
their CEO lots of sexual harassment
allegations
a very high-profile lawsuit with Wemo it
was ugly I don't even think that was
half of it they revealed they had a big
breach that they had not told the public
about a year ago on some levels I think
it's easy to say that the only place to
go from here is maybe up
it's all out there I've been hacked
you've been hacked person next he's been
hacked over 150 million I think at this
point people had their social security
numbers stolen so my social security
number is the worst part is that we're
learning a lot of the stuff is human
error caused by these companies Equifax
showed us that the first one is supposed
to be the gatekeeper shows that no one
is as smart as you think
oh yeah I'm home ah there we go
something I know nothing else about it -
yeah I know what they are though these
are the snapchat
these are snap spectacles aren't they
Gabi's there's plenty left right don't
look terrible I mean I probably he look
terrible right now but they're whole
stick of selling these things can pop up
locations you know at the spur of the
moment I mean it's certainly got people
to stand in line and create buzz peak
fabric you skirts I serve guy wearing
these iPods and an Apple watch and I
wanted to punch him in the face it is
the biggest leap forward since the
original iPhone iPhone X iPhone
expensive when I'm showing a double chin
it doesn't work every time so I like
that my phone knows my face hi Brian I
always say iPhone X I can't stop myself
that's the problem
you know xx5 in 20 but what about X X X
5 right 30 like xxx huh
you're in it's never gonna be the same
again and it's probably gonna cost you a
whole lot more so net neutrality is the
idea that not at all traffic on the
internet shouldn't be treated equally
I'm gonna give you a few tips on how to
sound smart talking about net neutrality
use these keywords buzzwords information
superhighway toll bridge access happy
New Year to all including to my many
enemies and those who have fought me and
lost so badly that they just don't know
what to do love probably tweeting now as
