welcome to the apple pie for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
and yes we have a bad apple this week
now on to the show the big news comes
directly from apple in response to a
business inside a report that claimed
Apple was planning to launch their own
mobile virtual network operator service
or MVNO for short and said the apple
branded cellular carrier was targeting
to launch both in the US and Europe well
the big a responded with a flat-out
denial then said that it has not
discussed and is not planning to become
its own cellular carrier so papal denied
it then it must be true all right Apple
rarely ever pretty much never responds
directly to rumors but they did this
time to squash the chatter now I was
immediately enamored by the initial
report because just imagine if they
leased enough cell coverage from all the
different carriers and using their own
universal sim card your phone could then
switch off to the service with the best
signal depending on where you are it
sounds too good to be true and for now
according to Apple it is also we're hot
on the heels of the iphone 6s and you
know how you know this leaked images
galore of production parts Mac fixit's
shared pictures of what's believed to be
the display assembly and one of the
photos features a quality-control label
showing a past date of july 29th perfect
timing for a sep tember lunch chinese
repair company geek bar shared three of
its own super spy pics with that grit
that makes them look more sneaky and us
twitch tech showed off what's believed
to be the rendered schematics featuring
the design point two millimeters thicker
than the current iPhone in anticipation
for the rumored force touch panel coming
to the iphone 6s now Business Insider
reports apples also testing a voicemail
service that will allow Siri to answer
your calls and transcribe your messages
now how many of you still have plenty of
voicemails you've never listened to me
right here well with this iCloud
voicemail service you will potentially
never have to listen to your voicemails
again and I love it now Apple employees
are still testing it out and it's
expected to launch in 2016 with iOS 10
and this is just one of those
cool things Apple is working on and
getting right but how about completely
screwing up with their latest back to
school promo in the past with an
educational discount on hardware for
back to school Apple is offered cash
back to customers then over time change
it to an itunes or apple store gift card
but now in the year 2015 the back to
school promo when you buy a new computer
is an instant 199 dollar credit for a
pair of beats solo2 on your headphones
am i completely out of the loop like do
you all really want this seriously Apple
not even a store credit as an option not
even a gift card that could actually be
used to purchase educational apps well
that in angry birds too but the best you
guys could do is a pair of headphones
that become an instant brandy commercial
on your ears this is easily the worst
back to school promo in the history of
Apple and you Apple biters know what's
coming a bad apple I'm sorry I'm so
worked up about this but this is
horrible it's wrong ok guys and gals
let's end the show on a high note with
you know some good warm fuzzy feeling
stories I'm juiced up for dr. Dre's
first album in 16 years inspired by the
NWA biopic Straight Outta Compton the
album titled Compton a soundtrack is
slated for release on August the 7th
this friday on itunes and streaming on
Apple music and you know what is gonna
be fire now there's plenty of Apple
watch accessories on the market but how
about a watch for an Apple watch friends
this is actually real it's the work of
california-based watchmaker Nico Girard
and it's just what you wanted a watch
connected to an Apple watch all in one
piece this makes no sense at all but if
you're interested pre-orders start at an
affordable 9300 dollars their slogan be
uncompromised or absolutely idiotic and
finally in my favorite story of the week
the good people at George Fox
universities IT department figured out
what to do with all their empty imac
boxes and made the I wheel it's 36 empty
imac boxes it weighs 130 pounds and
stands nearly nine feet tall look at
this thing and because it's the internet
you know they went to town with
Photoshop for example here's the running
of the I wheel or the I wheel is right
alright everybody that's going to do it
for this week's show you can always
email us at the apple bite at cnet com
or tweet me at brian Tong they so much
for watching we'll catch you all next
time for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
