this is your cnet update the Nintendo
3ds system is going extra large on sale
August nineteenth the Nintendo 3ds XL
will have a ninety percent larger screen
at four point eight eight inches and a
better battery than the original 3ds if
you ever had your hands on that older d
SXL this will be even larger bigger
screens can be easier on the eyes it
gives you more screen room for drawing
with art applications and it would come
in handy for watching movies with
Netflix and if you're planning on using
it for those tutorial programs like for
working out or for cooking you might
like that larger screen for easier
viewing at a distance it'll come in red
or blue bundles with a four gig SD card
for two hundred bucks so it's thirty
dollars more than the 3ds but it's
including an SD card it's also coming
out the same day as the new super mario
brothers to game the minds at Pixar

Princess Merida the little mermaid was
apparently supposed to have curls but
that was too hard to do back then and
it's only now that someone has taken on
how to do it movie studios can use CGI
to sink the Titanic or build new alien
worlds but curls oh man that's just
that's just too much the first microsoft
surface tablet is said to come with
Wi-Fi only according to a Bloomberg
report but Microsoft is keeping quiet
about those details and we still don't
know price or release date most people

can lend out electronic books according
to a new pew internet poll more than
half of library card owners said they
didn't know you could check out an
e-book only twelve percent of readers
have borrowed an e-book for the library
in the past year google has spilled the
jellybeans the first smartphone to get
