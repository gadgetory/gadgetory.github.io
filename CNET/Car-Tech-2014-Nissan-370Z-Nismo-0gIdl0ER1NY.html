turning your wrench yourself or writing
a check to a tuner a factory track car
an unadulterated simple whiskey from the
barrel let's drive the 2014 Nissan 370z
Nismo and check the tech so what exactly
is an is mosey well first of all it's a
gutsy Jersey car with more power a big
body kit we'll talk about the second
better bigger staggered wheels real
tough sports suspension will oh there we
go
an h-pipe cat-back exhaust system manual
transmission only this whole car speaks
to one thing it's the purity it's kind
of a club racer from the factory with a
factory warranty but it doesn't have a
dramatically different anything in terms
of powertrain this is a handling
statement more than anything else as I
drive this car I feel a little
ridiculous with this extreme body kit
I'm more of a wolf in sheep's clothing
kind of guy but that's just me and most
important is it's not a car for the
faint of heart you don't buy this
because you want an everyday Z you buy
this because you've got another car or
Tuesday your everyday driving in it
would be a waste to poke this thing
around and stop and go traffic for 90%
of its life okay let's pull over take a
look at the outside now spotted mismo Z
pretty easily first of all very
different front bodywork that extends
the car a remarkable 6.2 inches all here
in the name of aerodynamics kind of an
analogue to a Porsche 911 slant nose out
back unmistakable that huge kind of
obnoxious wing and around all four
corners special raised wheels staggered
front to rear and when you get in this Z
first of all things are tight intimate
and sporty the way they should be kind
of a high beltline so it's a little bit
claustrophobic and sight lines on the
back let's not talk about that there
aren't any
speaking of there aren't any there's
almost no technology in this car
available optionally or standard here's
your media rake AM and FM no HD radio
satellite radio is an option single disc
six disc is an option auxilary Jack
right there that's it no bluetooth
streaming no USB port no special iPod
connection
Oh SD cards this is a fairly primitive
cabin it says do one thing drive the
damn car here's where you think I might
be showing you a little peekaboo nav
screen but no it's just a little flocked
storage box
you can't even option nav on a Nismo the
seats are grippy they're in a special
fabric for Nismo cards but I don't
believe they're different than a
standard Z they're a good sports seat
but they're not unique to this car in
terms of drive controls there's very
little because this car is 6-speed
manual only you do have one interesting
needle do to add attached to that though
the S mode a synchro mode when you
enable this and get an S alongside your
gear selector the car will automatically
blip throttle when you downshift it will
do it faster than you can although the
purist who buys this car may not need
the help the remaining cabin tech is
instrumentation it looks like you've got
a lot of it right in classic Z style but
as I absorb the car for a couple days I
realize it's largely gauge theater first
of all over here on the left it's what I
think is the ugliest gauge in Auto dump
this little multi LED bar graph for fuel
and temperature looks like something out
of a stripped murano but then while
you've got that dumb gauge for
temperature you've got a very precise
gauge for oil temperature well that's
weird why don't they both get a
numerical dial gauge voltmeter to the
right is real stupid all things gonna do
almost its entire life is read 14.2 and
that's a waster real estate for that
clock that pod should be oil pressure
the clock could go anywhere and there's
no oil pressure readout anywhere else in
this car big tasty red trimmed tack in
the middle digital readouts for your
gear position even though it's a manual
as well as the S mode indicator and the
speedometer is analog only I'm not big
on having to have a digital speedo but
when you have one that compressed where
every five miles is just a tiny fraction
of an inch I would actually like a
digital readout so I can figure out my
speed at a glance this is not an easy
speedo to read I don't need more tickets
on the steering wheel of course because
there's not a lot of tech there's not a
lot of tech controls we do have a voice
command button over here but notice that
Bluetooth that it drives is also
optional with a Bose audio upgrade
that's right get this car without
options and you'll be using a headset
rear camera also optional what there is
of it having no LCD in the dash it shows
up in a portion of the rear view mirror
small but essential for backing up this
cocoon on wheels
when the engine bay is where you learned
that the Nismo z is truly a drivers card
how do we know that because they don't
kill you
with a ton of extra power on this model
in fact they barely up it at all this
3.7 liter v6 is very similar to the one
in the standard Z it picks up a few
horsepower 18 more to get to 350 also
note this v6 does not have direct
injection which is taking over the
industry these days it's kind of
old-school in that respect foot-pounds
of torque are 276 that's a mere six more
than on a base Z this car is much more
about a little freer breathing engine
and great handling how finessed and
nuanced is that zero to sixty for this
3,300 pound vehicle is about five
seconds flat maybe a little quicker than
that in the right hand rear wheel drive
only there's no all-wheel drive various
limited slip differential in the rear is
the old-school viscous couple not
electronically controlled mpg on this
car is 18 City 26 highway not bad
actually given the fact that this car
has a roll that is anything but sipping
fuel in fact let's go find out what it
really is everything in this car is raw
and direct and hard the suspension is a
wonder of audacity but they actually
think people are going to drive this
thing on an everyday basis this is the
worst riding car I have ever reviewed
for CNET over 1200 guards and this one
is actually unlivable as your daily
driver so make sure you have it as your
second or third car
it is so punishing I wish you could see
with this wide-angle lens you can't see
the amount of of rattling that this car
punishes you with but it's amazing of
course that's because it's a rigid
stiffly sprung very flattening track
suspension without any adaptive tricks
it's done the old-fashioned way with
high spring rates and a lot of beef
underneath the next thing you feel is
this very meaty mechanical tough feeling
gearshift it's a very hard gate you got
to push it through the different slots
but it's not hard to find them you know
interesting about this car is it's not
overwhelmingly power
it's linearly powerful which I love
really evenly powerful let's put it
through a couple of tight turns here
under power it just rotates beautifully
that's that front mid-engine stuff
they're not kidding the engines flooring
them back on this rear wheel setup that
it just pivots right around the middle
that's a great driver's car
it just gets around a corner right there
snap that rear end right where you need
it it's just a fun little car to drive
for that s mode it works spot-on matches
revs for a downshift as soon as you
notch into the lower gear I don't think
I could ever do it faster but I still
feel guilty about using it that's the
most comfortable again the ride is
beastly the cabins kind of tight the
sight lines are a disaster just keep
looking forward it's a hoot I'll give
you that point you maybe point sips
let's price our Nismo Z starts off at
about forty three eight now to get it
seen that style you got to do a couple
things at thirteen fifty for the Bose
audio package which is more than just
the extra Bose speakers and amps it also
gets you six CD satellite radio and
that's how you get Bluetooth hands-free
so it's a definite must and a pretty
good value 790 gets you the rear view
camera which although it's tiny in that
mirror and very high dollars per square
inch is a must on a car with
non-existent rear sight lines like this
all in about forty six thousand I like
this car a lot it's got a raw unique in
your face earnest that doesn't make any
apologies and it's much grittier than an
MS or AMG car from Germany on the other
hand because it's so raw and under
stilled if it's your daily driver you're
gonna feel it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
