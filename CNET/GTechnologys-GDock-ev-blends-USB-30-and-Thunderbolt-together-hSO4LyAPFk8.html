serious about storage for a change now
this is a brand new G Drive Eevee from G
technology this is a very nice rugged
portable drive that offer one terabyte
of storage space and over here it has a
USB 3.0 port that work with this
included cable right here that's all you
need to hook it to a computer and when
you do it works pretty fast and pretty
well but that's not serious because most
Drive of the same time works the same
way that brings us to something quite
different about this one and that is the
little door right here let's open it
here we go on the inside you see there's
an SATA port which exactly the same as
that of a regular internal drive right
here at the Turner house this drive
right here apart from being an external
drive you can also work as an internal
drive of another store device which is
this G dock evie right here now it gets
serious
now this docking station can host two of
the G Drive V's area time and in fact it
comes with two of them included the dock
it's our connect to a computer using a
thunderbolt connection which is twice
the speed of USB 3.0 the device come
with to a thunderbolt port here you can
see so that you can connect more
Thunderbolt devices to it in a
daisy-chain setup once inserted into
this GTV the two dry can work at two
separate volumes in this case you can
take them out freely and use them with
other computers that don't support
Thunderball this offers great
flexibility in case you want to share or
collect data with or from other sources
the two can also be planted together in
a red one or red zero configuration to
offer data protection or super fast
speed but in this case watch out this
release button right here because you do
not want to accidentally release a drive
in a rate setup like that
that said the g-dub evie here when
working with two G Drive V's offer you
three options great flexibility data
protection or great performance now in
my testing that g-dub Eevee and the G
Drive Eevee indeed offer very fast
performance up to 225 megabyte per
second when you
honorable or 133 megabyte per second
when it was USB 3.0 note that these are
sustained will won't speak
now the gwv speed obviously changes
depending on how you set up the drives
on the inside you know I found the G
duct
evie totally worth is comprised of four
hundred and twenty dollars that includes
to drive here and the cables you can
also get just the drive itself 120
dollars which is not bad for a very good
and rugged you used to be through paying
out drive for now remember the GTA V
here only text the G Drive Evie and not
the regular into a drive like this one
right here
you sure can put in like this but
nothing gonna happen until you start
shaking it and what do you do if you're
lucky it might just hit the spot but
then it's not about starts anymore I'm
serious that's because I'm don't know
and this has been the first look at the
G Doug Evie and the G Drive Evie from G
technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
