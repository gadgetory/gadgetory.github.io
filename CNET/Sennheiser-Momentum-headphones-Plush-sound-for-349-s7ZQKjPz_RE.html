com and I'm here with the Sennheiser
momentum headphones these are a premium
set of headphones that cost 350 dollars
but they are among the best 300 to 350
dollar headphones we've heard they don't
have as much bass is something like some
of the beats models these are really
designed for audio files they have a
balanced profile they're very clean and
clear sounding a very accurate headphone
they're also designed for mobile use
that you come with two headphone cords
one with a built-in microphone and
remote as well as a straight cord for
audio purists that court is detachable
from the ear cup and as you can see
these are very nicely designed
headphones they have some metal in them
they have some leather and they do have
plush ear cups we can't say they're the
most comfortable headphones we've tried
they do feel very comfortable when you
first put them on but after longer
listening sessions you will have to
adjust them a bit they rest a little bit
on the top of the ear and you can feel
the headband on your head as far as
headphone fit it does come down to the
shape your head so these will be a
little bit more comfortable for some
people than others but they do have very
nicely padded ear cups all in all we
really like these headphones for their
sound and build quality as i said the
intro these are among the best
headphones at least for audio files in
the 300 to 350 dollar price range i'm
david carr lane and those are these
Sennheiser momentum headphones thanks
