and we've got issues I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your scene at update the
largest magazine publisher in the United
States Time Inc has had a change of
heart with apple and will now begin
selling magazine subscriptions through
iPads newsstand app now obviously there
were already apps for Times magazines
like sports illustrated and people but
you can only buy them as single issues
and if you subscribe to the print
edition you got free access last year
the publisher opposed how Apple wanted a
thirty percent cut for subscriptions and
Apple got a lot of criticism by
publishers for not releasing data on
subscribers if there's anything
important for a magazine it's being able
to know your subscribers but Apple has
eased up a bit and lets readers opt in
to share their subscription data and
time got a new chief executive who
pushed to make peace with apple and make
subscriptions happen it's a sign that
being on the iPad is necessary to grow
even if that means handing over a chunk
of sales to Apple but despite apples
dominance publishers have worked to be
innovative in delivering subscriptions
on their own terms take for example the
app called next issue time is one of
five publishers involved in that app and
it's a Netflix model for magazines pay a
monthly price and get unlimited access
to dozens of titles it's now on android
but promises to be coming soon to the
iPad in other news we're watching if you
use skype to make calls for free on a
Windows computer then you'll start to
see advertisements in the call window
but it's just for audio not for video
chats on Twitter you'll start to get a
preview of some story links when you
click to expand a tweet some tweets will
show the first few lines in a story as
well as images cell phone maker nokia is
in trouble it has to cut 10,000 jobs by
the end of next year and visio which is
known for its televisions is unveiling
details about its dive into computers
with a new line of all-in-one desktops
and laptops and when you're not using it
as a computer you could use it as a
television we got a first look at the
devices from the Consumer Electronics
Show in January
the xbox live app for Apple devices just
got a new twist you can use the app as a
remote use it to pull up recent games on
your console and play pause skip through
video and music files or just poke
around and navigate through content and
like before you could still use it to
check out what your friends are up to
it's like a baby step toward the
Microsoft SmartGlass platform which is
like Apple's AirPlay and will eventually
let you beam content from your mobile
device to be played through the xbox 360
