these are the three reasons you would
want to get Lenovo ThinkPad T for 20
this big thousand dollar range business
laptop is pretty bulky but you may want
to get it for these features one the
TrackPoint yes I said TrackPoint
why not if you're going to buy one of
these laptops you might as well live
with and desire this read rubberized nub
that's been on ThinkPads forever it's
actually pretty accurate if you're in
close quarters but it has none of the
multi-gesture capabilities that you're
used to on a large trackpad and in
accessing it gets a little tricky with
the letters but if you are TrackPoint
fetishist there you go
two ports this laptop comes stacked with
the type of legacy ports you don't
normally get another laptops we're
talking eSATA we're talking firewire and
we're talking Express card we don't have
USB 3.0 or HDMI on here so if you want
something more modern you're going to be
up the creek three battery life with a
nine cell battery this thing lasted over
seven hours on our test that's
tremendous and it lasted longer than a
15-inch MacBook Pro it's a beast as far
as usability and durability but it is
thick now the two reasons not to get it
one you like a sexy-looking laptop this
thing is fugly looking I mean no offense
this is the sort of thing you would find
from the IT department it's not designed
to look attractive it's designed to be a
business laptop it's also be comfortable
like an orthotic shoe now you've seen
this design for years so let's not
pretend that it's something new and
interesting but under the hood it does
have the specs to hold up and to you
like big trackpads
let's face it this is not a very big
trackpad it's really comfortable and
very exact in its responsiveness but
it's smaller than others and it's
cramped by not just those two buttons on
the bottom but these two huge buttons on
the top that work for the track point
your being wedged in by buttons
everywhere on the other hand if you're
looking for a business laptop and you
love thang pads well this is that
mainstream down the middle line type of
laptop for you I'm Scott Stein and this
is the Lenovo ThinkPad T for 20 boring
perhaps but effective</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
