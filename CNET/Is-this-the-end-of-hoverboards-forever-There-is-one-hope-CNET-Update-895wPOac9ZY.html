hope for their survival I'm Bridget
Carey this is your CNET update the
hoverboard was the hottest holiday gift
in 2015 until it became the hottest
holiday gift for Catching Fire
you've seen the YouTube videos and
reports of these self-balancing scooters
combusting sometimes the fire breaks out
when it's just sitting in a room
charging there was no safety standard
for this sort of product and many cheap
knockoffs started flooding the market
adding to the concerns last week the US
Consumer Product Safety Commission sent
out a letter deeming all hoverboards
unsafe for posing an unreasonable risk
of fire the federal regulatory agency
received reports of 52 hoverboard fires
since December and advised retailers to
only some models that meet the safety
standards by Underwriters Laboratories
most commonly known as ul you've likely
seen the ul certification logos on many
electronics you purchase so now major
retailers including Amazon Toys R Us
Target and Walmart have pulled
hoverboards and amazon is offering
refunds several major airlines already
banned the devices and in New York City
there are now signs up telling writers
that hoverboards are banned from public
transit the folks at ul started testing
these things this month and sc√©nic got
a behind-the-scenes look at the
independent labs where they are being
examined and they're not testing how
easy it is to ride this is about the
safety of the battery and the charger
and overall electrical system inside
lithium ion batteries can dish out some
serious damage when they explode there
are various stress tests and torture
tests including holding the wheel and a
vise for 7 hours to see if it overheats
no hoverboard has been certified safe
yet but when one does will any retailer
be okay with selling it again when
there's such a bad reputation now and
when you see signs all over public
transit and airlines are banning it
I doubt authorities are going to be
keeping up to speed on which models are
deemed safe by ul to just allow one or
two hoverboards could be doomed
they can escape the bad image by
evolving into a new type of product
maybe that won't actually be until they
hover what do you think about the
hoverboard issue do you have one you
still ride or will you try it if there's
a model deemed safe by ul reach out by
emailing update at cnet.com or you can
find me on twitter from our studios in
New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
