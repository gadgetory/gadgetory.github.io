for your pc hopefully later this year if
it reaches its indiegogo funding goal
it's coming by way of strange Panther
games ever heard of that I have indie
game distributor and maker they're
coming up with an idea for a game called
rock simulator 2014 that's kind of nice
to me it's like a video game I would
play yeah the latest in rocks simulation
technology it invites you to experience
the deeply rich diverse life of a rock
ah there you go rocks have seen it all
man if rocks could talk they'd tell us
the history of the world you will tumble
through the world and for the most part
not really doing it's a very calm game
it and you know most of us enjoy either
sitting on rocks or you know even
throwing rocks if you're feeling
extremely crazy but to get the full
experience you really need to become the
rock be the wrong you need to be the
rock and you can try your hand at sort
of different environments like grass
Plains or salt flats and different
beaches and things it's not a very
active game and unfortunately there's no
multiplayer to be had here you can't go
online or anything and interact with
other rocks man I mean I don't go around
telling people i'm making a rock
simulation game i'm really into it
that's cool i didn't get like animals to
come up and nudge you every once in a
while so amazing yeah very good
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
