the fifth-generation iPad it's the
biggest refresh to the iPad since the
second generation came out in fact it's
such a big change to the design that
they've gone ahead and changed the name
so meet the ipad air it still has the
same 9.7 inch Retina Display up front
that you've seen in the fourth
generation and earlier generation is of
the iPad but this generation is
critically twenty percent thinner and
forty percent lighter that may not sound
like big numbers but actually it is a
very noticeable difference when you pick
up and hold this tablet it's incredibly
light and incredibly thin much more so
than before it really feels great much
more close to the ipad mini than indeed
to the fourth generation and the
previous generation ipads that came
before it has the a7 processor which we
just saw introduced in the iphone 5s
which is a 64-bit chip which gives
really great performance we've actually
seen noticeable improvements over the
fourth-generation ipad which itself was
quite a performer games will run really
well especially new releases like the
latest infinity blade and applications
will load more quickly and web pages
will launch more quickly as well however
it's not a huge difference from the
previous generation interestingly this
is the same cpu is found in the iPhone
5s previous versions of the iPad have
had upgraded versions of the chips but
this is the same version benchmarks
prove it to be about the same speed as
the iPhone 5s that's not a bad thing by
any means the 5s is indeed a very quick
phone but if you're hoping for something
even quicker you're not going to see
that here now we've got the same
selection of ports as before which is
basically just one port the Lightning
port on the bottom of the device we do
now have stereo speakers which is great
however they're both still located on
the bottom of the tablet we would have
liked to see one of the speakers
situated on the top so that when you
hold it sideways and watch a movie
you'll get proper stereo separation the
other thing that we would have liked to
see would be touch ID that's something
that Apple introduced with the iphone 5s
so that you can just hold your finger on
the home button and unlock the phone
without having to type in your PIN code
unfortunately that's not present here on
the iPad air you'll still need to type
in your PIN code to unlock the tablet
now of course most iPads never leave the
home so security isn't such a big deal
but certainly when you're buying
application is it does get a little bit
annoying to have to type in your
password especially if you've gotten
used to doing things on the
phone 5s with just a fingerprint overall
we're really big fans of the new iPad
air it's nothing really that drastically
different over the fourth generation but
the thinness and lightness do make it
much more of a portable tablet than
before you barely will even notice it in
your bag in terms of the competition it
certainly does stack up pretty well in
terms of specs and performance however
it's still a fairly expensive tablet
starting at 499 for the 16 gigabyte
version and going up one hundred dollars
each as you go to 32 64 and 128
gigabytes if you like the 3G or LTE
versions of the tablet you can give
those for an additional one hundred
thirty dollars each again pricing very
similar to the fourth-generation iPad
there are quite a few lower-cost tablets
on the market but none offer the sort of
quality of design that the ipad air has
however there is some new competition
for the ipad air and that is the ipad
mini retina which apple also introduced
the ipad mini retina doesn't come to the
market until a little bit after the ipad
air but with the retina display and also
the a7 processor inside we think that
apple's got more competition on the
inside than it does on the outside of
the market right now overall again we're
really happy with the iPad air we think
it's a great tablet if you've been
waiting for an upgrade I think now is
probably the time to do so but if you've
got a fourth-generation iPad the
performance difference isn't all that
drastic unless you're really looking for
something thinner and lighter we think
you'll probably be happy to stick with
that for at least another year again
this is tim stevens and this is the
apple ipad air
