a look at the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 carbon
touch edition that is important because
we've previously looked at the ThinkPad
x1 carbon which was lenovo's really thin
14-inch pretty much full power laptop
from up mid 2012 it was sort of their
businesslike answer to something like an
ultrabook or a MacBook Air a very nice
system but it came out right before
Windows 8 hit and of course with Windows
8 you had touchscreens and pretty much
every laptop we saw after that point so
lenovo has gone back and updated the x1
carbon with both windows 8 as you can
see here and more importantly a touch
screen because frankly Windows 8 on a
laptop it is pretty difficult to
navigate without a touch screen if you
try doing it just with a mouse or just
with the touchpad you know it can get
pretty frustrating other than that this
is essentially the same x1 carbon we
looked at before adding the touch screen
does make the lid just a hair thicker
frankly compared to some of the really
thin touchscreen Windows 8 systems that
we've seen it's actually fairly
noticeable that this is a pretty chunky
lid now relatively speaking although
it's still quite thin the whole package
is still about three and a half pounds
and for a fairly full powerful feature
14-inch business-oriented laptop with
Windows 8 and a touchscreen
still highly portable although it's not
the thinnest or lightest laptop you're
going to see in kind of this first round
of Windows 8 systems you do get some
things that are very unique to Lenovo
like they're excellent custom keyboard
with the keys that are curved just a
tiny bit at the bottom to make them
easier to hit little calls it kind of a
forgiveness zone where if you just brush
the bottom of the key you're more likely
to hit it it has got the traditional
Lenovo track point here with these extra
mouse buttons but a larger glass
trackpad
I found this trackpad to be a little bit
on the finicky side actually I had to go
in and mess with the settings still not
100% happy with it but the keyboard is
so good it kind of makes me forgive that
this is $14.99 which means that they've
added $100 for the touch screen on top
of these
starting price for the original
non-touch version last year we're seeing
a lot of touchscreen Windows 8 laptops
for $600 even less so it is a hefty
investment but you do get that excellent
Lenovo build quality and all those
business friendly features with it I'm
Dan Ackerman and that is the Lenovo
ThinkPad x1 carbon touch edition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
