buddy of ours and you've only been with
the company for what it's been three
months yeah you're enjoying your time
you don't enjoy my time yeah even though
you work under our good friend stupid
Andy stupid and he's not stupid he
pretends to be stupid but I think he's
actually the smartest guy at this come
you could be honest in here he's like no
I'm being honest te he plays it off like
he's dumb and he has no idea what's
going on but he's got a hidden agenda
yeah which we don't know about yet we're
he's gonna come out sooner or later I
want people to who are listening maybe
they recognize your voice in some
capacity ah little Easter Egg little
hidden secret about the 404 a good buddy
Zach was actually the voice behind none
other than tuna Tuesday were you
necessary I was you were that was a
while look it was man we should start
that up again yeah well thank you tuning
it well maybe tuna maybe tuna past but
she has a friend that's still around
okay we could do something done alright
alright I'm looking forward to the the
possibilities are endless all right do
it I forgot that you were the voice of
tuna teasing we haven't heard her like a
little like taste of what she used to
sound like if people remember tuna
Friday hello boy it's a wonderful
tuesday it's tina Schwartz's yes
mysterious wars
this morning I had a tuna melt and for
lunch I'm gonna make myself some tuna ha
ha I'm gonna wrap it up for dinner we're
gonna have tuna casserole a lot of tuna
man she thrived that's why there's a
shortage of tuna right and that's why
she's got so much mercury yeah she has
the edge she's pure mercury she's not
even human at this point even even your
facial expression kind of transforms
into like an older woman well I grew up
with a lot of older Jewish women so it's
clearly so it's easy to just take on the
face yeah understandable which is I
guess may the schwartz be with me thats
Sarah busy oh there is a specific reason
we brought you on for the first heaven
show wasn't just a hangout wasn't just
the Hangout we don't we see you enough
around the office fair enough I wanted
to bring up something that Justin and I
have covered a while ago a little cycled
grouper all right now I want to sort of
refresh everyone's memory a little bit
you were involved personally with a
grouper event last night I was yeah and
so sort of like catch us up what exactly
is grouper is a it's a it's a new way of
date it's a dating service but it's not
really a service because you know you
have the connotation of service with a
monthly fee right something that you pay
this is a one-time thing you can do it
multiple times but you pay as you go
basic okay so I live with two other guys
and one of them signed up for it one
let's say that one of them is my brother
one of them is your brother it wasn't
him that did the signing up for towards
our other roommate that signs up for it
so what happens is you sign up for it
and they do all the correspondence so
you got grouper then you got the guy and
then on the other side of grouper
there's a random girl who we've never
met before so completely blind
completely blind so how it works is
grouper basically takes you know they
talked to one guy and he talked to one
girl and they they don't let them
communicate at all and they basically
give them a time in place mmm to me that
works for everybody and they say all
right guy and girl you guys are going to
meet at Point a Thursday night nine
o'clock this bar in New York City right
now each of you bring two friends and it
basically turns into a three on three
blind date yeah so it's not like they
kind of market it as it's a blind date
one-on-one
you just so happen to bring your two
friends along that you seem so soundly
that what are you ready to go well I
because they have more yeah or gtalk
hahaha that's how they market it but
really it's just a three-on-three
blinded it's not like just because a and
B you know the one guy one girl let's
set it up they're gonna just sit and
talk and the other four people are just
going to watch them right it's really a
you know it's an intermingling of six
people three guys three so it's like hey
we're going on a date you bring two
friends operating to come well it's kind
of like you see where the night and
we'll see where it goes it's kind of
like it's almost a trip to the urologist
you want to be in and out you know
whether the results are good or bad just
you look like Lex Genesis posse was as
possible you don't know what you're
walking into let's just get it in and
out no pictures or I don't want to know
where you're from we want you so I say
you know nothing about the person right
but I feel like most people I know you
like the joke but most people are
searching for a potential relationship
here of course I think ver selling point
is is that forget about all the nonsense
involved with stalking somebody and
seeing who they are friends with or what
your circle is let's just put you
together and there's no games involved
let's just see what happens it will take
it from that what sounds cool about this
site is that with most the online dating
websites like match.com or okay keep you
gotta fill out a bunch of really
annoying surveys and they match you up
based on some kooky algorithm doesn't
work properly concur with grouper it
sounds a little different they extract
information from your facebook profile
yeah and that's how they match up with
people which is really cool because I
feel like most people are a little more
honest on their facebook because there's
actually people they know um yeah but
Jack explains because I was sort of
blown away about this fact the grouper
finds the venue if they set it up for
you so that guys each pay 20 bucks each
yeah all right so that's 60 bucks right
okay anything the girls pay 20 bucks
each as well all right yeah their pain
which is kind of cool because that's 120
bucks now okay so that's 120 bucks and
now grouper will take half of it and the
other half will go to the bar your first
drink is on the house that's how they
partner with the exactly so basically
the bar is walking away with the first
you know their first round of drinks is
on them not really though cuz you paid
for it and the other 60 bucks is going
to grouper so the venue doesn't get a
cut no then you don't get it cut
getting half of it basically all right
you're paying for the drinks in advance
right obviously gonna have no amount to
a hundred and twenty dollars sure then
you take 16 grouper take 60 that's a
fifty percent profit margin I mean the
one thing that was at longevity behind
it like how many times can you really go
on the a serial group right and once you
go on the first date you don't have to
use grouper to keep setting up of course
not because guess what you could grab
those personal phone numbers unless the
deals that they offer on the website if
they partner with like a you know a
group hollin type yeah on service oh my
god I much current too much group going
but this is what I want to know if you
do the other two friends that both
parties bring along have to be on
grouper as well or can you know they
know that's why you just have that's
what's kind of cool about to say there's
the technicalities behind it are very
it's very seamless okay you've just got
one guy that sets it up on on behalf of
his buddies one girl that sets it up on
behalf of her forgot and grouper
baguettes in the middle of it and says
all right fight let's just do this brown
dwarfs that's really interesting because
you have no idea what kind of friends
they're gonna bring well they could be
all right so the one we met up with
these three girls last rites and eliana
now first off let's hear it me and my
roommates we all live together so the
three of us grab a cab we go downtown we
go to this undisclosed location we walk
in there and they hype it up as being
you know of course grouper their emails
like all this place is ultra hip and
it's um lounge and all this nonsense
okay there was four people in the bar
well here's what's funny we walk in the
bar and we just look around we don't see
a group of three girls cuz that would be
you know too obvious that there's sure
and we're there first okay we walk in
there all of a sudden the bartender
comes like running around from the other
side of the bar and me and the guys oh
my god he comes running out the other
side of the bar it was kind of like you
know the UM the music just stopped in
the bar everybody voted us and he was
just like are you guys here for the
grouper hey online dating guys right
well guys gonna like some bad when
you're going to the supermarket to get
tampons for your girl way of ice check
price check for it and we're just we
just look at each other and my one
roommate goes and just does a complete
180 it just storms out no I like it but
uh I grabbed a buy that I can like
you're coming in and the guy she's like
you
guys are here for group right we're like
yeah yeah yeah totally grouper did you
know what the girl look like nah no no
they don't give me the picture at no
name oh my god i'm not sure you hadn't
specify what kind of girl you're looking
for here's ok but yeah like you said
before with facebook so they looked up
my one roommate on facebook they had the
other golfing i think what they do is
they say there's an algorithm behind it
that's nonsense i think what they do is
they just match people that aren't
friends on facebook right you know
because if you're already four they look
at mutual friends they said maybe if
they sell you see that you share
interests on stuff that you like yeah
but who really i mean guys in their mid
20 s we're not fourteen-year-old girls
right at least on the outside we aren't
yeah I think that I like Tabasco sauce
yeah yeah you know I like Led Zeppelin
on my facebook right you know I think
they keep it very simple they're like
all right this guy in this girl they
have no mutual friends born in 8585 went
to a Big Ten school went to a party
school they're just like screw it let's
go whatever you share your guy all right
go ahead and pass the test so yes we sit
down we the first round of drinks
obviously is on them drinks come to us
well you've missed a crucial part of the
story so the girls come up to you okay
the poison yeah yeah we're sitting at
this huge table this huge wooden table
that has first off it has a reserved
thing on oh but like the place needs a
reserve there was no that's no fault of
group of course oh that quickly went
right off the table of course that's not
going there so we all first was strategy
where do you want to sit right you know
I'm also interested to see what your
criteria for bringing these wingmen are
you don't mean like are they single is
just convenient okay cuz we all live
with you don't live together there were
all safely singles but they're uglier
than you right you purposely chose
uglier friends I didn't even look more
attractive well that's how they always
do yeah John looks like me my brother
looks like me so come on what he turns
out I everybody was good-looking long
but uh so we all we know we think we're
being strategic here we all sit at
different places you know i'm on i'm
over here Jones over here Ryan's over
here girls finally come in like 15
minutes later because I like oh we
apologize we're sorry and it's the first
initial reaction that we saw
I know one of them no because that's
that's the thing is that since they
didn't use my facebook information thank
you because you're most freaking popular
person on the internet if we got totally
sure but um no but he's right that use
ryans in Romania so I guess Ryan's not
friends with the girl on Facebook but
I'm friends with her and facies so they
were just like babies so they were so I
guess they assume you know nothing of it
I didn't know her like we're buddies and
we chat all the time I met her at a
party so there were mutual that's your
relationship with her that you just knew
who she was Freya might be kind of
better actually did you have a launch
pad yeah caught you know it took away
from your moment at first year just like
oh we know each other right I'm like
yeah I so nice right to hit on us
tomorrow so you knew one hoop on girl or
one of the friends it's just so happy to
you was the grouper girl ok ok and so
we'll sit down we get to talking so they
all squeezed next to each other and sit
on the couch so it's 123 right next to
each other squeezed up Ryan shifts over
towards me in John since this table is
huge now he's like five feet away from
everybody he's like he's got to lean up
and be you know he's gotta throw a paper
airplane across the table just the age
question sure ok so we go around the
room and it's just like all right what
do you do Oh like that they were cool
girls they were good-looking I don't
know what they were looking maybe they
were just looking for love in all the
wrong places but the one girl said she
did this last week huh and they went out
with these guys that were new to New
York whatever that means it may be some
Southern gentleman right sure and they
went out and lets it tequila and they
were partying like three in the morning
I just kind of let me typically write
these girls are fun but at the same time
she's back on group big to fit you know
and then the other girl as she said they
found out the next morning not because
one of them woke up next to them but
because they went on Facebook they got
their last names one of the guys I was
on the date was actually engaged ok ya
know but on the website they say you
don't have you don't have to be single
fine yeah that's such a major kind cuz
it's not supposed to be a dating website
explicitly it's just to meet people to
plan what
a friend that's cut through the crap
everyone say it's kind of crappy ones
trying to get banged out let's be honest
I'm just saying you're not it was unites
us all but you're not on grouper because
you want to have a platonic relationship
with I yeah yeah you know what you
wanted you want to do make things happen
but that's how they market themselves
they don't want any pressure on you
they're basically you know like before
him we were saying you what types of
groups of girls can we bring or can end
up showing you can have the two sisters
and the one disgusting friend has it you
know grenade who hasn't gotten it in
like eight years and they're just
bringing her along you get the three
crazy girls you're royalty guys you're
right dice literally get anything you
can get three dudes that show up you
know dressed as women I don't see the
possibilities are endless right um but
we show up we ended up talking it yeah
we were forcing conversation they
weren't into it was it was a loss now
why don't you think so why didn't work
out because you guys it's fashionable
you guys are you guys are you have your
corks but you guys are fun to hang out
with what why didn't it register i chi
said you could just tell no I'm not
gonna disclose you know we knew where
they were from but their pet you know
what daddy did it was obvious one of
them didn't work and still lived in
Manhattan right in a penthouse later
they shouldn't be on groupon if they
wanted to get what a grouper these
should be you know down on Wall Street
those I think but those guys can do
better you know any these are not
typically girls that you would walk up
to in a bar no I wouldn't but I get
rejected right away by one item at a bar
right this was just a long stretched out
rejection just like oh my gradual reject
we were talking you know John held his
own Ryan was doing well we were talking
TV were to another problem was the bar
was cool it looked cool there was no
liquor there was beer and wine that's it
so usually you need that social
lubricant of tequila you need vodka you
need something to spice up even if it's
not going well you say to the waitress
like all right sweetheart bring over
here shots of tequila it's just it's
getting shots of tequila yeah let's get
the ball rolling here um but then one of
them you know i can i'm good with
signals one of them was like leaning
back in the chair
her hands might as well have just been
down her pants like al bano she just
didn't care she not giving up his cash
loosened her pan yeah she's burping and
she's like oh you know she's scratching
her bag she was bored not burping up as
she might is it sounds like she was
bored she wasn't my god they were on
their cell phone I looked over to bring
about cell phones I looked over at them
and I was just like you guys textin each
other but were you also making non
verbal agreements with your buddies to
like sort of pair off you don't I mean
like that's what you tried like yeah you
know John was talking to one and then
you know me and Ryan and the other two
girls like at each other we're like oh
looks like they're talking but that
ended 30 seconds later right let's get
back you know it's that's why I feel bad
it feels awkward no look listen not
everything is gonna be a line drive
single to left you you need though you
need those strikeouts every now and it's
less awkward because you have tube of
your good friends there right well
here--here's no unbeliever secretly is
it's a way to sort of uh lessen the
shock and awe of a blind date sort of
just like a load of you can handle
rejection better right all right but
it's funny right now grouper um because
the guy that signed up my room in that
signed up for it got an email the next
day and was basically like we have so
many females on this website we're doing
three two one dates right now we're
three girls and one guy York yeah
there's so many girls that are on that's
unbelievable wait three girls would be
willing to meet up with one guy amazing
if those girls at that point they're
just trying to throw anything against
you just see what sticks you don't mean
I think so right Jesus three on one
question is do I go on a three on one I
think yeah dogpile doubt i'll tell you
what Zach yeah I think you do and then
you come back and tell us about this
because I love hearing this story
knee-deep in squid it's pretty fantastic
ya know so it ended it ended and you
know it was that awkward silence at the
end we're about an hour in work how late
did you stay out well we were out with
them for about an hour but I got to the
point where they had just finished their
wine we finished our drinks I look at
Ryan Ryan looks at John I look at the
painting at the wall i watch um the
girls look at each other kind of like
whispering I look at them and I'm like
look let me just put it out there yeah
and their eyes were like oh no oh my god
what is this guy gonna say and I look at
them and I'm just like here's the deal
the three of us are gonna go get
hammered right now all right we're just
going out your inner you out yeah it's
the deal like you know what I mean you
want to come cuz we could have been like
look is this going anywhere that's you
don't have to dance around answer we're
just like look we're going out we're
gonna get obliterated it's a thursday
night it's nice out you coming yes or no
hmm pointed at the first girl she's like
no was out till four no poor yeah the
previous fun girl I know this wasn't the
trust one girl this was a different one
but she wasn't even now till four it was
a complete and utter lie next girl goes
I'm like okay you're a know what about
you she goes no love there is no excuse
yeah there's about the river but just
John and Ron or they're just sitting
there like this like come on we can gala
one we could get one and I'm like what
about you she goes no okay oh poor guys
gonna miss it's all right all right you
struck out but you know we went to a
dirty bar afterwards they did it was
good no way tell us where that's a good
evocative oh yeah that's you're no worse
for the wear you guys seem uh you know
in good shape after not where I'm I'm
alive everybody good are you gonna do it
again I mean it sounds like there's
plenty of girls that's the question
because I'll be there again this set up
there was cool you know it was easy it
was it was very seamless it just you
know and we want it worked so when I
give it another shot yeah I'd wait a
couple of weeks and then you know and
they won't set us up with the same girls
obviously because you know our point guy
the first time will be our point man the
second time gotcha it sounds like the
lack of details that are provided for
each participant that might it's cool
but then it also also hurts you yeah it
also hurts you in there very interesting
sort of this plan they got there it'll
be around for three more months and then
has it been around as anyone no I don't
know okay Mon 2011 ya know it's been
around for about a year or so but it'll
end up getting huge like right now it's
different you would you think it's gonna
want me to a little peek and then it'll
Hey look there's there's chicks on there
three two one they're offering out
eventually they'll just have 320 they
just send you to a bar yeah
like pay us money were cigarette just
tell you which bar you should go to you
but I like the concept of this service
because you can also tell people if you
do meet someone that you become
romantically involved later on you can
tell people oh we met at a bar and
that's not a lie you know like you can
tell a story you have to be embarrassed
about saying you met online good point
good point I remember that I like that
well thank you for coming on and tell us
about your grouper story please promise
promise us you'll be back and tell us
about your next online dating yeah if
you continue doing this we I would love
to talk to you more about amla sure we
can do I mean I think that would just be
awesome we can roll the tech world into
the trying to get labor I should still
should go on and we should go on a
gripper all right let's no let's cross
that bridge when we get there seem to be
married yeah it's okay it's okay you're
not breaking the terms is you literally
bring your wife and kids with you not
bad we'll take a break thanks to Zach
for joining us for the first half more
404 right after this stick around this
is the 404 emer effers the show where we
all sing songs
alright welcome back to the 404 show man
Zacks not bad I love Zach I wanted to be
our official online dating correspondent
that's uh seems like a painful reality
not kidding for sure I mean Zach's great
we'll definitely I'm back armed men nice
to know that we have that sort of in our
back pocket little dating course
definitely you know feels good the idea
of grouper sounds really interesting
it's kind of like um like a wingman
meets like group me yeah meats like grub
with us member we talked about that
other startup where it's kind of the
same idea except it's like meal partners
right right like you meet at a
restaurant sure you they bring two
friends you guys all eat together I have
you know I feel like only sites it's
just people you know some of them it's
just a lot of VC money it's just like I
got an idea yeah why don't we get people
to come in and podcast together very
decadent right sure oh we have all these
expensive restaurants which people that
want to eat there look I might as well
exploit the hell out of that you know
strange story though all those chicks
were just like is that are they like
group like group or junkies it sounds
like think I mean if there's a lot of
girls on the site Gooper it should be
called goober chat room says agreed Nick
Jack I need to like that like you know I
wanted to expand a little bit on the
criteria for choosing the friends that
you want to deal with writers like I
feel like each of your friends kind of
brings a different thing to the table be
like a Voltron type deal Brian like you
want to bring one friend that maybe is
like really funny hmm but maybe not
funnier than the other two the delicate
balance it's a delicate balance to weave
in and out of your friend right you know
what I mean it's like having that
conversation we were talking about
earlier regarding zombies and who you
would want in your zombie camp yeah
right like each man brings his own
talents to the table you know everyone
is good at something Cooper Cooper
everyone's good at something you gotta
pick and choose your teammates yeah
accordingly um all right let's uh what
we're gonna do now we have a video
voicemail okay let's let's maybe do
calls from the public first cool and
then we'll play our C a bit like I'm
literally need octopus tentacles right
yeah yeah I'm switching with three
people I got things up you know what's
going on over there oh no we're all set
now okay I have the
youtube video voicemail if you want to
do that first play that would first
alright let's play that for as I believe
it's from our good friend Patrick yeah
it's talking about spectators in video
games kind of continuing that
conversation he's talking about call of
duty in this one I believe so let's
check this okay Patrick from st. Louis /
LA and he hasn't been talking about
lately you know people who like to watch
video games that apply them and that's
pretty much me I just rather sit there
and just you know watch somebody play I
kind of suck at video games but I'm
really good at talking crap and so
that's what I would rather do I think
for people like me the best games out
there though or like the tiger woods
games because all you have to do is do
this I can I can do that you can do that
finger yeah and then the entire time you
can just sit there and drive stock which
you know is really the main the main
appeal to the game so yeah that's my two
cents keep all right dude yes agree
thanks for the thanks for the video
voicemail please we encourage that
because you send one in you got a 99.5
percent chance of making it on there
whereas opposed to voicemails you maybe
have a sixty percent chance he makes
good point too if you're really good at
talking crap the online multiplayer ask
that's like fifty percent all the
experience was totally for you yeah yeah
so I guess he didn't talk about call of
duty in the video voicemail itself but
in the email he's like I'd rather watch
someone else play call of duty and laugh
at them when they die instead of getting
shot in the face myself course which is
why his roommates kind of hate him right
now yeah i mean look some people born
from some one thing born for the other
this guy's born to hate kind of like
someone else I know yeah I measure of
like minds we are very very good thanks
for the video voicemail sir let's get to
voicemails proper it's calls from the
public on time to show the love
horsy net so yesterday we asked you are
amazing internet viewing and listening
audience come up with some things in
your day-to-day lives that would be
improved by the advent of better
technology yes I thought the entire
checking and banking system needs an
overhaul right so you said something
about showering yeah if it was going to
take them you don't you don't want to
take them you just want to be able to
maybe perhaps take a pill that keeps you
clean a month keep dreaming but anyway
here's a here's a request for something
in terms of showering let's do this hey
guys security guys are talking about
what technology do you like to see
improved now you know at the store at
costco they had at spice and blades that
to dry your hands off your bathrooms be
great when you got out of the shower if
there's a life-size well body size dice
and blade yeah just walk through that
would it dry you want more mer how cool
is that i would like a personal car wash
dry yeah yeah i mean come on how many
times have you been in a crappy
restaurant and you you know you push the
button and it's just like it's it really
that's what I'm supposed to dry my hands
yeah yeah you know it never works
properly never works the way it's
intended to but even more irritating is
the actual toweling experience when I
shadowed I like you try to get that spun
on your back you do like the zest for me
oh yeah it's weird i don't like that i
mean i don't know i feel like i'm
drawing 45 seconds well you have extra
dry skin an evil ocean well that's true
too but I feel like I really
accomplished everything very quick
really yeah yeah like a set thing that
you do every time I guarantee you if you
were to compile all the drying off they
would look very similar right yeah you
always do such with no money yeah I feel
like everyone has their own ritual when
it comes to trying to oh yeah I like to
do the left on the right yeah back I did
I bet if like you were to just replace
that with paint and you would see the
same like paint marks all over your but
you know me yeah interesting it's also
best not to think about these kinds of
things but like it's kind of gross to
him
yourself like you know maybe wiping your
face with the same part of the body that
you just used to dry your armpit or
other discussed whether you're clean and
this is what i don't understand people
who are anal about washing towels right
when you are drying yourself off your
the cleanest you can be yeah okay okay
it'll get me wrong I not everyone washes
parts of their body that they should be
washing maybe you're drying clothes for
the slits for the sake of the argument
say that you have your own shower one
hundred percent perfect job in scrubbing
scrubbing every last solitary nook and
cranny of your disgusting body right
right you're perfectly clean you start
talent off that towel you could eat off
it it's just as clean you're the you're
the epitome of clear are fine I know
it's hypothetical right people who like
change their town all the time yeah I
don't understand that I changed my
towels all the time and uh I'm about to
have different towels for different
parts of the body like quadrant out my
body you know I mean you're out of your
freaking waterstone to receive your q3
towel could use a good refresh I
understand if you're chicken you got
like long hair if your head taken a
chick okay if your guy or girl with long
hair you need a separate L for that yeah
I guess so get that you know I mean or
you know I only have one towel too so
when it comes time to watch that thing
and I don't have other laundry did you
just don't show no I'll just use you
know like washcloth to drive but a
series of 30 watch guns that I've needed
together haha we're just t-shirts he's
disgusting Frank how often do you wash
it out um I try to wash my towel is
pretty frequently maybe like once every
two weeks yeah that's what I do yeah so
all right so you're also equally
important to wash your pillow cases this
has become a very boring conversation
has but I feel like there's
entertainment to be found in there all
right let's go move on to the topic at
hand improving your day to day with
technology here's a guy who thinks the
mail system needs an update hey guys
from Joe and I'm thinking of the mail
system needs technological update yeah I
understand we have email but a lot of
companies and businesses and enterprises
don't understand and don't take email or
or stuff like that there's very asleep
seriously yeah say they like to they
like to think that it's official
because it comes to their mail we had a
fax or scan or an image aren't those
things are not as official I don't yeah
I get the point is trying to make um and
I agree i think there's it's just a I'm
not sure it's like a Bridget Renaissance
trying to say that I think what he's
trying to say is that mail like the
actual snail mail snail mail paper the
documents that are sent through the mail
as opposed to mail that scanned when you
email somebody for example I know this
comes up a lot we brought up a bunch of
times just did my taxes right right I
had a donated a car last year and you
need like a 1098 dash C okay to get that
done I call up my accountant I go hey
can I bet I can i fax it or I say I'm
sorry can i scan this and email it to
you right the Secretary was like oh
you're going to bring that up yet
secretary was like uh I'm not sure we do
that okay okay and I said why he said
because it's not the same I said well
why is it any different it's the same
exact thing it's just ones and zeros I
didn't say all this but it's ones and
zeros just getting sent through the air
over to your thing if anything is
probably safer more reliable and better
quality right after conversation fine
they agreed to do it all right but he
this guy and you bring your insult on me
up in a sec thank you this guy you know
like he's trying to say like look some
there's like that old school mentality
like if it's in the mail and so far more
official right no there's no difference
well if I mean look in original document
you're talking about like a like a stock
certificate something that cannot be
Xerox or scan right knee like seals crap
notre knows if there's still a notary
involved in yeah that is more official
right but for the most part for the vast
majority of business that gets conducted
in this country scan or an email it's
fine right you know I'm saying so I
think that's what he thinks needs to be
updated maybe I think that will improve
as we age as we get more more user will
be official seals just like the party
verified Twitter again and there's
verified PDFs or and other stuff like
that right make fun of me haha speaking
of professionalism uh
here's a little anecdote anecdotal story
yesterday you know Jeff and I sit really
close to each other in in relation to
the office right yeah like one cube away
from each other we're neighbors mmm and
uh you know jeff has like usually a very
gruff voice that you hear on the podcast
right it's always like kind of a like
sardonic you know maybe how would you
describe your voice I don't know as I
kind of gruff gruff I like it may be a
little bit yeah I dog as well you know
and uh jeff has a little not a lot of
people know this but jeff has a phone
voice that he uses uh very very rarely
do I whippin don't know it I hear it a
lot it's when you talk to like PR people
really any time that you need to be a
little more positive right and you
normally feels I'm always just by
default right is the dark everyone while
you gotta blow that black cloud away
yeah like though that out right and so
yesterday I hear these guys talking to
who what must have been his tax account
and he's like um hi uh can I get via
form faxed over here i have a 1099 it
sounded like it's that it like Dave
Chappelle's white god I have like I
would love for you to do a little bit
right now because I'm not doing a proper
in price that tough to really hey I love
it and I was listening and literally
laughing out loud in my queue I know and
then he just wallow on the phone with
this woman Justin's writing to me he's
like dude what the f are you talking
like that I'm like what it knows it's
not like a combination of white guy
voice and like girlfriend phone voice
you know where you're just like hey oh
hey what are you doing mmm oh yeah okay
I'll be home soon alright we're just so
we I mean normally it wouldn't be a big
deal but your guest voice usually sounds
so different and I'm like polar I know
and look if when you bring up like the
PR people job interview voices right of
course when I want to PR person that I'm
comfortable with and been friends with
ya gruff right when it's someone broke
or was like I'm talking to like an
executive maybe
that's over the age of 50 yes do you
know what I mean I was like um hi oh I
was wondering if I could get this form
over to you guys how's that gonna work
yeah my like my voice goes up a few
octaves so I don't sound as aggressive
it's a very nice to talk like my voice
becomes non regionalized yeah you know
what I mean this guy could be from
anywhere right when you're hearing me
speak normally you're like oh this guy's
an East Coast right guys an asshole guys
a read as oh um yeah I was wondering if
I could just send that over to you guys
is that is that ok now it's even it
shouldn't matter them even nicer yeah
very sweet I love it thank Jeff with the
charity you'll never hear it you'll
never hear it in its genuine organic
form ever just learned that you son of a
hi thank you let's get back to the
voicemails can we please please get back
to voicemail here's a question that I am
certainly not qualified to speak to I
don't know what this guy's thinking but
here we go maybe Justin's more qualified
they had don't gotta question for Gil I
am currently a first year of college and
I'm a non-traditional experiment and
after all these years I'm going back my
question is it's College really worth
the price tuition costs are
extraordinarily so hard yeah and I just
wanted to know if in the long run he's
actually gonna pay off Wow okay there's
a lot of details and jeans in here how
much time do you have sir can't just
give up that's the most blanket
statement to be like college ain't worth
it don't go to college yeah I mean first
of all so by non-traditional I think he
means that he's not 18 years old um so
he said he's going back to school a
little bit later in life to get his
degree I didn't even I couldn't decide
for that that's what he's wondering
about is is it worth it to go to college
later in life sir we don't know what you
can be majoring and we don't know what
college you're going to so if it's like
a State College more than maybe he does
ain't gonna be a lot of different prices
then maybe he doesn't know this non
secret okay okay the way it works in
this country just out of the gate you
have a college degree even
if you barely paid it doesn't matter
however you acquired a college degree
and yes for certain fields it does
matter about the the reputation of the
school you went to yeah people with
college degrees get jobs more easily
than people who don't it's that simple
that's true and also people with college
degrees traditionally earn double the
amount right salary that and don't and
believe it or not I've read some stuff
that's very shocking it like people with
college degrees tend to live longer as
well which is amazing that might be
because the social related to the right
having whatever I'm just saying you that
there's a treatise there's that an
infinite amount of variables and you
know if you can afford it I mean if you
think it's gonna put you in debt for the
rest of your life I don't know I know
Jill will probably speak to that next
week she has very opinionated thoughts
about where the student loan crisis is
headed right that's the next one versus
housing now is gonna be that chair arm I
don't know I mean you know I talked to
someone who's skilled in that I just we
can only give you practical advice that
we've had experience with else without
knowing what degree he's trying to get
to I would say if you're trying to get a
lot some of the general studies away
then you know maybe go a little cheaper
on that stuff go to a community college
right and then you want to major in
something later on you do that that's
good advice maybe if you just want to do
your your prerequisite stuff yeah get
that otherwise you have to pay for that
I know there's a lot of online classes
there are discount right well do that
yeah so that's that that's seriously the
we just tried as hard as we could answer
that as seriously as we use or get a
janitor's costume and go and pretend
that you're sweeping something up in the
back of the classroom you're gonna do a
free audit excuse me scientists have
faked hello janitor um yeah so good luck
with that sir all the best to you and
your higher education finally some
thoughts on google glass project hey
guys is Evan yo guys are talking about
the google glasses rajat I don't know
you guys were saying I heard you
mentioned this a little bit about like
privacy and stuff like that as a I'm a
cheap teacher incredibly scary to
someone like
myself I know Jeff you were saying that
said earlier you got friends that are
teachers and ask them how they feel
about this because honestly like I don't
want somebody taking a video me at all
times if that's what they are in fact
able to do with these classes yeah I'd
rather remain anonymous so you know my
employer doesn't if they check up on
kneeling they won't see a video of me
just enjoy a beer or something like that
and freak out right anyways guys put on
a great show as always and uh take care
so uh very very valid point being raised
right if we live in a world nothing
about this is a world where it wouldn't
look like this but try and visualize
everybody with a lens on their face and
that's that's what we're talking about
right yeah I mean we've already seen a
lot of controversy over people filming
the police uh you know with regards to
occupy wall street right that stuff so
this might make it easier for protesting
but for the general population I'd be a
little freaked out if I'd realize him
was filming me yeah actually I was
reading about this story earlier too so
sergey brin the co-founder of google was
spotted kairana CLE at the foundation
Fighting Blindness wearing these project
glass glasses um and they I don't know
if it's because they're your brain is in
the cool lookin dude ever but the
glasses aren't exactly fashionable
either person who's a couple photos one
photo of him prototypes what do you
think which is this something you would
wear this looks like it would belong in
like a chemistry class or something or
they look like those tinted lenses that
mark words at his desk so that his
precious eyes don't get hurt by the
monitor yeah I I don't know I feel like
we're gonna get to the point where it's
like you know they're just gonna have to
get a socially acceptable yeah you know
what you mean yeah it's not going to be
right from the get-go just how 3d
glasses are sort of people are still
hands off ish with them right dude I
mean I would prefer for Google to just
come out with a clip like an ad on
wireless club that you could you know
throw into any pool right you know that
would be cool or attached to your
eyebrow or something we'll see let us
know what you guys think um we gotta
