enthusiastically on board with is a
recent run-in ultra ultra thin laptops
ones that get down to 10 millimeters or
even less the acer Swift 7 is a new king
of that very slender hill coming in just
a hair thinner than its main competition
this 13 inch Windows laptop is just nine
point nine eight millimeters thick while
the very similar HP Spectre is ten point
four millimeters although you be
hard-pressed to really see a difference
between them the 13-inch Swift seven is
actually thinner than some of the new
12.5 inch screen laptops the acer
zenbook three is eleven point nine
millimeters even the 12 inch macbook is
13.1 millimeters it's far from the
thinnest out there and what about the
granddaddy of thin laptops the macbook
air what's a monster compared with these
that a whopping 18 millimeters thick all
of these super slim Windows laptops get
that way in part because of what they
leave out all are locked to relatively
unimpressive 1920 x 1080 resolution
displays and all lack of touchscreen
which allows their bodies to be thinner
the Swift seven looks great and every
time I pulled it out people wanted to
see what it was the touchpad is extra
wide which is nice but keep in mind like
most super slim laptops the only port
you get our USB seaports now I can live
without a touch screen or high
resolution but two things bugged me
about this otherwise impressive laptop
the tiny keyboard keys didn't really
have that tight premium film looking for
and the new processor a low Power Core
i5 from Intel's latest 7th generation of
core series chips what's been on the
pokey side although it's certainly fast
enough for everyday computing streaming
and web surfing
