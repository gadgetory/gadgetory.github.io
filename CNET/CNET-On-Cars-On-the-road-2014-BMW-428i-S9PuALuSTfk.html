their lineup there's been a lot of
changes and the most interesting outcome
I think is this guy the new 4 Series
let's drive this 420 a tie and check the
tech the 50/50 weight balance that's a
wonderful thing in this car you don't
need to push it really hard to feel it
compared to the three coupe that it
replaces this car is longer lower wider
and pushes the wheels out to the end of
the car the biggest difference is that
wheelbase a full two-inch difference but
also the height losing three quarters of
an inch that's dramatic in automotive
design terms in spite of that roof
coming down though Headroom in the front
went up almost an inch and a half
spotting a four is easy just look for
what you think is a three coupe driving
by and realize it looks like it's been
melted and pulled from end to end front
to back you've also got much more of a
gentle fastback than a three coupe ever
had and this little filigree up here is
unique to more modern BMWs threes don't
have those now inside the four it looks
a lot like a three no dramatic Ryoka
texture going on here this is kind of
the fashion these days this kind of
toaster slot screen where the LCD sticks
up I think they're doing it because it
kind of says I'm like a tablet but it
also does free up a lot of area here it
would otherwise be taken up by the head
unit gives you some nice vent registers
and in this case we have a more basic
sort of a radio audio layout right here
with our optical disc right below it
even though we don't have nav though
this LCD is part of it it's what they
call a display radio and auto jargon
which gets you to most of your basic
infotainment and communication functions
now it's not a touchscreen of course the
German car don't touch so instead they
use the I drive even for this basic head
unit but this is the simpler version of
the iDrive controller if you were to get
the nav head unit you get I Drive for
point two which includes a bigger
controller with a touchpad on the top of
the knob four finger input now in
typical BMW fashion lots of stuff is
optional you do have bluetooth base
thank you
but enhanced Bluetooth is an extra cost
option rear view cameras an extra cost
option as I believe are the all-around
sensors surround sound is ala carte and
you can get a head-up display which BMW
is just about the best at the best in
terms of
caller information presentation and good
tight resolution now controls that
relate to actual drivetrain well our
cars got the 8-speed automatic top two
gears are overdrive by the way this is
how most of these guys are going to ship
but you still can get a six-speed manual
if you want to I would do so quickly I
don't know how much longer they'll be
offering that along ciders from drive
mode profiles you had this Eco Pro and
Sport and Sport Plus Sport Plus cancels
the stability control you're not going
to use that too often but I find sports
a good mode we'll get on the road with
it momentarily paddle shifters go with
the automatic obviously not on the
manual and over here at the start/stop
button
you've got the auto start/stop defeat
hit that once in the car will not down
itself when you come to a red light will
see how smoothly it operates when we get
on the road and unlike a lot of its
competition BMW doesn't put any
Augmented LCD screen between the gauges
and unfortunately instead of that they
offer what I think is kind of a dumb MPG
gauge a swinging needle that kind of
flies in the wind did you drive around
and doesn't tell you much of anything
it's a BMW thing I don't know why they
still have it now because we have a 428
I that means we have the kirbo
four-cylinder this is kind of a new
thing for BMW they've gotten rid of the
non turbo six in this class of car it's
a 2 litre so it's not even a big 4 and
it's very compact and almost sits
entirely behind the front axle line that
makes for great weight distribution in
fact this car is almost exactly 50/50
weight spread and that's really quite an
achievement how about some numbers 240
horsepower out of this guide 255
foot-pounds of torque 0 to 60 with is
thirty four hundred and seventy pound
beast comes up in 5.7 seconds your mpg
will be twenty to thirty five unless you
get the six-speed manual and then you
give up one mpg on the highway it's
basically a pic and of course rear-wheel
drive is your base configuration
all-wheel drive is available all the
modern tech is here direct injection a
two-stage twin-scroll single
turbocharger there's not much missing
from the sheet let's go for a ride
there's one thing that remains a truism
in automotive technology and that is a
four with a turbo feels different than
let's say a bigger six without one it
has a lot of power it just doesn't come
on the way a bigger engine would not in
my recollection the outgoing inline non
turbo six of this replaced had less
power and yet somehow I recall it
feeling a little more satisfying
nonetheless this is the smart motor to
go with its higher technology better
efficiency lighter weight smaller
packaging it's a very neutral handling
car you never feel like you're plowing a
big heavy nose around in turns it's a
little doughy on the road you can you
can hot up the suspension more we've
noticed that in 3-series lately that
they've lost a certain road going edge
in favor of more ride quality some
people like that some people dump
I suspect the majority do that's why BMW
did it they want to sell more cars not
necessarily more cars to the Buffs
okay let's price our 428 I starting off
just a little below 41 5 2 liter turbo
for rear wheel drive if you want
all-wheel drive you got to add 2 grand
on top of that adaptive LED front
headlights with automatic high beams
nearly 2 grand more tech package with
apps real-time traffic navigation the
touchpad and head-up display it's chunky
at 30 150 if you want the park sonar and
rear cam like we have 950 more adds
surround cameras lane departure adaptive
cruise and stop and go control and
that's going to be almost 2 grand more
semi self parking is a surprisingly
cheap 500 bucks that's one little bone
they throw us all in CNET style this car
is pushing 53 thousand dollars you buy
one because a 2 Series is just too
little and a 6 Series is biting off too
much for your paycheck it fits nicely
and is very distinct in the BMW line and
I bet they're going to sell as many as
they can make very quickly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
