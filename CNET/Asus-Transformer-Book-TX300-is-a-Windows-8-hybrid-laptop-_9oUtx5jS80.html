CES 2013 with the asuste transformer
book TX 300 now we've seen this tablet
laptop high road machine before in
concept form but this is the first time
we get a peek of the finished article so
let's take a look at what's going on so
first let's talk about the display
because it's something that's quite
impressive this is a 13.3 inch panel and
it has a 1080p resolution it's looking
very crisp and clear I think I've seen
brighter panels before in my life but
I'm quite impressed at the clarity and
generally is looking very colorful I
think your movies photos it's all going
to look quite good on this screen take
it as a whole list of nice feels quite
like it's not too heavy and if I close
it and spin on its side you can see it's
not really that big either I don't think
you'll have any trouble logging this
around with you all day there's solid
state storage inside the tablet section
and that gets combined with a mechanical
hard drive that sits inside the laptop
when you plug it back in the keyboard is
backlit and the touchpad has this nice
large area so hopefully it's going to be
quite comfortable to use or of course
you can use the touchscreen on the top
taking a look around the sides as a
healthy number of ports on show here
you've got two USB to you got mini
display there's a fold-out Ethernet port
while over on the other side you've got
an SD card slot Louis Zoo stels me this
is a final product it can't tell me
anything about pricing or availability
at the moment so in terms of actually
getting hold of this thing we're just
going to have to stay tuned windows 8
certainly has a lot of potential but I'm
yet to see one of these hybrid machines
that really blows my socks off as soon
as has formed when it comes to making
this kind of device on Android so let's
hope that this could be the one to make
my dreams come true I'm the rest away
for cnet and this is the asus
transformer book TX 300</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
