it worth it
I'm Scott Stein and I need to get
healthier a lot of people do and the new
Fitbit charge HR has heart rate built-in
which is new for Fitbit and new in a lot
of wearables moving beyond pedometers
that count steps this uses green LEDs to
track your heart rate on your wrist now
for resting heart rate it does a pretty
good job and it's comparable to things
like the basis peak that I'm wearing
here that also uses green LEDs if you're
doing active exercise the Fitbit does
targeted sessions of that too now people
who have used it at the gym at the
office and when I've been trying it it's
a little variable there that's because
this type of heart rate monitor isn't as
good as the one that you wear on your
chest at the moment so if you're really
looking for super exact heartrate this
is not it but if you want to find out
your resting heart rate or how are you
doing at night when you're sleeping this
does it and the app allows you to track
that in a little chart that's on all the
time this does 24-hour heartrate for a
month five days of battery life charge
but what's that for you know if you're
using the pedometer and using Fitbit
you're counting 10,000 steps a day is
your metric there's no real metric for
heart rate in terms of telling you well
you got to do this and then you'll be
healthy you'll see your heart rate and
you'll know that you're in different
activities zones but my heart rate ran
higher sometimes because I was having
coffee and it counted it as fat burn so
it gets confusing and there's no easy
guide I would love to see that in Fitbit
sap I'd love to see that in heart rate
monitoring apps because until that
happens it's a confusing area for people
to dive into but if you have wanted to
add a little bit of heart rate to a
fitness band this is $20 more than the
previous Fitbit and feels pretty similar
not a bad deal I'm Scott Stein this is
the Fitbit charge HR available now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
