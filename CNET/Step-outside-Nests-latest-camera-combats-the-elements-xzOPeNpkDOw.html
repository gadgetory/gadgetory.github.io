today taking a look at the $200 nest cam
outdoor that may sound familiar because
we've actually reviewed the nest cam
indoor previously this is just the
outdoor rated version basically it just
has a protective outdoor casing so that
the rain and other stuff won't bother it
and it looks a little different than
before one thing you'll notice right off
the bat is this magnetic backing on the
bottom that makes it really simple to
install but it isn't a great theft
deterrent so you'll need to be creative
about where you install this thing it
also is power adapter enabled so it'll
have to be pretty close to a power
outlet but it does have a really long
about 25 foot cord so you do have some
leeway other than that it's really
similar to the indoor rated version it
has 1080p it has a 130 degree diagonal
field of view and it has great optics
but they have updated the software to
give you a lot more options for both
this model and the indoor model and the
original Dropcam models so instead of
having to pay $10 or $30 a month for
storage you actually have three hours of
storage that come with this thing that
makes it a lot simpler a lot cheaper to
get the security features you're looking
for without having to pay for that nest
to wear but if you do want nest to wear
that's the monthly subscription you do
get a couple more options you get 10 or
30 days of continuous recording and you
also get personal Ertz basically it
won't be able to tell who it's looking
at but it will be able to say that it
thinks it saw a person or that it's sure
it saw a person as long as you're able
to get past some of the install
limitations of this thing I think nest
cam outdoor is a really solid camera
especially if you've already bought into
some of the other nest products like the
thermostat or the indoor camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
