the Cadillac cts-v wagon the CTS parts
popular the V parts popular but the
wagon thing no it doesn't really work
let's find out the story behind this car
as we drive this 2013 cts-v wagon last
of its generation check the temp
trivia to start with this is Cadillacs
first and so far only station wagon that
wasn't designed to carry dead people
although the way it sells they simply
welcome a couple of corpses coming into
Shova they persist with this model
because Europeans love this style of
highly sort of chamfered urban wagon
form Americans don't the Cadillac has
big ambitions on Europe so it persists
now inside our CTS again an outgoing
generation it's kind of like a flashback
a few years in car tech once you get
over this toaster slice pop up 8-inch
screen which it's something is kind of
cool I like to have it down when I'm not
using the map you realize it's missing a
lot of things that navigation interface
while perfectly functional it doesn't
offer a lot of interesting stuff there's
no satellite view certainly no Google
Earth no Google search no search to nab
it's just an old-school kind of map it
is touch based primarily you can get on
this thing and move things fairly easily
let's get into our audio sources you can
do a.m. or FM but not HD radio not on
this car that dates it satellite radio
is there we have our iPod connector in
here and I mean an iPod connector a 30
pin which goes into one of these double
harness things but notice the console is
so small and a modern iPhone requires an
adapter because that's 30 pin you end up
having really nowhere to put this thing
once it's connected again it's feeling a
little dated 10 gigabytes of hard drive
space to rip CDs and such - and under
the auxilary tab here is where I'm gonna
bring up my iPod as you can see there's
the USB connection you could also put a
thumb drive in there now the Bluetooth
system is interesting you do have
bluetooth calling on this guy but you
either don't or don't simultaneously
have bluetooth streaming depends on what
part of the manual you read I couldn't
get it to pair as a media player at all
and the manual says you certainly can't
use it as a media player and a phone at
the same time now we have general motors
rather curious audio TiVo in here that's
not their name for it that's mine but
it's pause and play of radio like it's a
one-hour buffer and this pause play
button is what activates it so you got a
radio station on satellite or broadcast
you push this thing here and see what it
does it starts to buffer up to a
60-minute max now notice what we're
missing as we go through audio or
navigation or our configuration screens
or any of this this is not Cadillacs cue
system which we've seen it's still
fairly early in its deployment we like
it a lot this is the old outgoing rig
you're not gonna see this on any other
Cadillac product so this is where we're
coming from q is where we're going to
now quit looking through the other
controls in this car you got really
two ways to influence this cars person
Natalie you can pull it back in the
drive on this automatic and then either
go over here to the sport mode well you
can also shift for the suspension you
got one button here with two positions
you're either in touring mode or sport
mode and that's it it's very clean and
simple paddles up here on the wheel for
when you are shifting again this car is
available with a 6-speed manual the
automatic is a no choice pick the only
unusual doohickeys on the main
instrument panel are a boost gauge for
the supercharger there is 0 to 15 psi
and if you roll up here on one of these
little information screens you're gonna
find a g-force gauge for lateral
acceleration and we have the optional
sunroof in this guy it doesn't come
standard even on the CTSV which is
little unusual but I guess some folks
are gonna want to sort of lighten up
their vehicle or keep it more pure yeah
but this one is got a nice big opening
to it the front half moves the back half
does it but it really opens up this
relatively small cabin a lot alright
this is why you really buy a CTS with a
V at the end of it to get this big
engine 6.2 liter supercharged v8 that's
how they used to do it kids it's a lot
of displacement it's also a lot of
blower pressure coming off this eaton
supercharger and that's gonna give you
556 horsepower 551 foot-pounds of torque
those are big numbers now this car is
not exactly a lightweight 4,400 pounds
or so it still gets to 60 and 4 seconds
flat
thank you big motor here is the downside
you're gonna be stopping at every gas
station 12 18 mpg there's almost no car
left to get such ghastly gas mileage in
fact this car has the dubious honor of
being the worst MPG station wagon sold
in America period rear wheel drive only
and as I mentioned your choice of
transmissions for no cost you can get
that automatic but you'd be a fool get
the 6-speed because that kind of
transmission and this kind of power are
seldom seen in the wild certainly at
this price
is how great a supercharger is no lag no
delay no vagueness or spool eNOS it just
gets right down to it we've had other
five hundred some-odd horsepower cars in
recently and a lot of them get stuck in
committee when you step on it this is
not one of them power is pretty much
right now what is getting in my way is
this automatic which is really a tragedy
if you're gonna buy one of these get it
with a stick it's gonna so dramatically
unfilter the power coming out of this
engine and there's gobs of it by the way
even with its limited slip differential
magnetic ride control active suspension
just about all the modern technologies
it does suffer from being rear-wheel
drive in this case because there's just
too much power to get put out to those
two wheels I'm able to get this thing
loose and hopping and slightly airborne
over anything but the very smoothest of
pavement it could use a little more
compliance to keep the button down and
keep the power gain to the road there's
a little bit of hop and squirrely this
back there certainly under full throttle
the ride on this is also a bit of a
miracle this is one of the nice
comfortable sort of cars that are out
there today it doesn't lose its CTS ride
quality even as it gains its v venom and
that's I think largely attributable to
that magnetic ride control that is able
to really modify things although if I go
to the sport mode up here I'm not
feeling a huge difference to be honest
not in not in road driving maybe it
might show up on the track and of course
similar thing goes for shifting over
here into the sport gate of the shifter
it's not night and day difference
getting on the manual paddles of course
and that is where you really get a
difference and keeping this guy hot
keeping yourself around 2500 on up is
where the boost is really nice and
really available of course the
interesting thing is if you look at your
supercharger gauge you know you're not
into it all the time much of the time
you're getting tremendous power out of
this guy just because it's a 6.2 liter
v8 the displacement alone gets you out
of trouble all the time then once in a
while you'll see that booth need
kick in but that's not running most of
the time this is a barnburner of an
engine with a blower on top of that and
yet very civilized in general I don't
consider this car to be a wagon but I
think it should just exist on its own as
a as a bigger sedan it'll carry one or
two more suitcases and if you think the
look of a body style that's wagon ask is
cool that's all the reason it needs to
exist but don't buy it cuz you're gonna
bring home sheets of plywood not unless
you're gonna put them on the roof all
right let's price our little black
beauty 60 for one out the door is a
cts-v wagon delivered not a lot to add
to go seen that style as I told you it's
all in there such as it is you do want
to spend 1150 for that nice big spacious
sunroof that's money well spent
1,300 bucks on a gas guzzler tax that's
money not well spent about 66 for out
the door here's the thing this thing
makes no sense at all however as an
interesting almost future collectable a
6.2 supercharged v8 with the available
6-speed manual in a wagon shape you kind
of got a like
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
