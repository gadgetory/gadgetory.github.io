brands proline appliances now with the
proline Kenmore wants to make appliances
that can compete with upper end read
expensive appliances but I find that
this range along with another range from
this line that I've tested fall short
first let's start on a high note let's
talk about some of the good qualities
that this range has first of all this
electric cooktop can boil water fast I'm
talking under nine minutes for about one
hundred and twelve ounces of water and
the oven does a great job at cooking
multiple racks of biscuits at once
thanks to the dual convection fans that
are located in the back of the oven
unfortunately that's where the good news
ends for this kid more this range has a
tendency to start to burn foods when you
use the excel a key feature which is an
oven setting that allows you to cook
food super fast but it's almost a little
too powerful for its own good
overall Kenmore is a really good brand
and I've tested ranges that I really
liked but the proline still needs some
work I definitely recommend going back
to some of the less expensive and more
reliable Kenmore models until the
proline gets itself together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
