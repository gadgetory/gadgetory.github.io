coming so let's run down the top five
reasons to pick up a Google home along
with a few reasons to pass at number
five it's cheaper than the echo one a
smart speaker the Amazon echo costs of
$180 Google home plus 130 bucks there
you just saved $50 at number four
chromecast video Google home works with
chromecast so you'll be able to say
something like ok Google Play comics
explained on my TV and then a video
should play on your TV through your
chromecast that sounds pretty cool at
number three multi-room audio if you get
multiple Google home devices you can
have music play throughout your house if
you get multiple Amazon echos you can't
do that for some reason additionally
home can send music to chromecast audio
devices at number 2 smart home control
Google's listed several smart home
partners at launch smart things nest
Philip to you and if Amazon has a huge
jump on Google in this field but expect
Google to catch up pretty rapidly whoa
wait a second here are three reasons why
you should not get a Google home you can
get similar functionality from the $50
Amazon echo dot also Google does not
have a ton of partners at launch and
Google home is a first generation
hardware products so good luck with that
and the number one reason to pick up a
Google home is Google assistance from
the demos the Google assistant seems
like it's gonna be really really useful
the Amazon echo can't compete when it
comes to handling questions that Google
can plus if Google doesn't have an
answer it will find something for you
we work top 5 check out top 5 do Netcom
Amaya's act hard I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
