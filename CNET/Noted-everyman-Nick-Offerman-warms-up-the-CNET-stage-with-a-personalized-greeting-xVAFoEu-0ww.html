coverage of CES 2017 right now we've got
a very special guest you likely know him
from his roles on Parks and Recreation
and Fargo please help me welcome ladies
and gentlemen Nick Offerman round of
applause for Nick Offerman thank you for
being here sir
pleasure thank you that is a firm
handshake I appreciate it I've had a lot
of practice have you now you know I I
heard you were gonna be here and I said
well that that doesn't make any sense
when I think of mr. Offerman I think of
someone drinking scotch or whiskey at
whittling wood or something like that
that's a fine compliment yeah so so what
exactly are you doing here well the fine
folks at American Greetings brought me
on board to deliver the message of this
incredible original piece of technology
the greeting card I've heard about this
I thought was very clever at a tech
conference to say you know technology is
amazing it allows us to exchange a great
deal of information very quickly but
it's a little cold it's a little bit
personal and with this original
technology that has never really been
improved upon you can deliver a more
heartfelt sentiment so you you you want
to choose the right technology for the
right occasion absolutely and this is
something that's been around for ages it
has it was in fact the company has been
around since the 19th century really
yeah there really are old-school and
it's something that speaks dearly to me
my mom and dad are incredible card users
okay and my wife and I use cards ink to
the paper that experience you know when
you use a card it says to the recipient
I took the time instead of like to whip
off some emoji right which is totally
cute I get it that's a safe word to use
for that
but that I took the time to choose yeah
a sentiment and hand it to you and then
you have an experience where instead of
like whipping through your emails like
Oh somebody thanked me for parking well
instead you have this moment where you
say holy cow somebody thank you a to me
there's love there's love it's an
envelope of love I love I love how
American Greetings sort of debuted this
campaign we have a clip that we're going
to roll kind of parroting product debuts
check it out
since the last
take that electricity right it's it's
compatible across all devices can't be
hacked lefties and righties virus proof
of course and it's slimmer than your
your tiniest tablet I could I can fit a
dozen of these things in the space that
some one of those Palm Pilots would take
up pomp I that's a throwback I
appreciate it
I play the field appreciate you reaching
back there so I you know I I do enjoy
kind of poking fun at the modern
conveniences that we call good
technology what is there something that
kind of irks you for me it's it's kind
of the what we've fallen in love with
with emojis I think it's important to be
you know technology is amazing it really
is going to help us hopefully save the
planet and you know they create a world
where we're decent to everyone and and
that's very important but we have to be
very selective about when and where we
use technology right or we'll become
those fat baby like adults in the movie
wall-e does everyone go there for that I
think I just think that was a genius
representation of where we're headed
yeah 15 years ago I would have
referenced Terry Gilliam's Brazil
yes but excellent it's it's the great
sci-fi mentality of if we only keep
using emojis then we turn into fat
babies right and I feel like why it
seems like we're chasing those sci-fi
movies in a weird way
well it's human nature that's that's
what that's the double-edged sword you
know we always want to make the most
comfortable choice sure which is like oh
it takes some effort so they like choose
a card and send it to somebody but it's
worth it that's it's it's maintaining a
relationship of love you know people
here today at this big conference are
trying to like do deals and like present
their new products and that's great and
they're using technology like hey Beth
get over to the booth somebody's gonna
buy our cool new
rage is a tech item but if that sale
gets made
then it's gonna be appropriate to bust
out a card be like Beth you react
crazy-ass you really pulled through
please enjoy this car so these are like
limited-edition kind of cards here for
CES yeah we have we have cool limited
edition ones this is you create your own
hashtag on that one that's like blank
space yeah I like the hashtag Beth kicks
ass right open it up we did it just a
reminder and I also love you please
don't tell my wife this one says I got
you the thinnest most powerful messaging
device at CES and you thought this was
just a card and then you drop your
microphone leave the room and the
statement has been made and not only
that but we have we have this these
great products you know there's gonna be
an unveiling at noon okay make sure
you're there the American Greetings
pronto three view right look at this
it's the greeting card and there's no
there's no charger below there's no
charger it's it's compatible across all
interfaces you don't need to carry a
shammy with you to keep the screen clean
comes with a custom stylus a number two
stylus I preferred the sleek designing
equipped for mistakes should they occur
that's right yeah that's for that's for
others so is what what it's amazing cuz
like greeting cards of like we said
survived the test of time what what else
do you think is sort of like a lost art
that we are rapidly losing our grasp on
that's the thing about technology I run
a furniture shop called Offerman wood
shop in Los Angeles where our thing is
we make you things out of wood by hand
right
imagine that yeah and it's you know
there's an artisanal quality to it but
it bleeds into the rest of our lives I
mean I we're much more likely to be able
to change a tire or a doorknob or if
there's an electrical problem
we know where to look sure and so
hands-on skills are also very important
now if I find a question I can't answer
when I'm dealing with a plumbing issue
then I have my technology and that's
amazing I can find a video of a guy
teaching me about the wax ring below my
toilet sure and those videos are amazing
Google wax ring and you'll have hours of
pleasure the phone never has a lot of
personality I'm sure there is it's a
different kind of YouTube channel for a
different day
but this I mean it ties into for me
that's what my wood shop is all about is
that instead of making up trying to make
a profit or sell as many shelves as we
can we want to make you something that
costs a little more but will last your
family 300 years and you can see that we
love what we do you can feel it and and
so that's an expression of love to our
clientele and this is a small version of
that it's simply saying and every
occasion
you know if somebody passes away or
somebody gives birth or if or if
somebody makes a terrible mistake where
you can also give a card of admonishment
right and those are a lot of fun they
are a lot of fun and and there's the
right kind of occasion that this will
always find a useful place for right
yeah there's there's no occasion you
know texting and e-mailing are great and
fast from more businesslike disposal the
most practical though them the most
heartfelt or like you said the most love
it's not if you if you want to say to
somebody happy birthday
nice going thank you I love you will you
have oral sex with me any of those
centimeter that's worth a card if you if
you give them that document then they
have that forever right and there
there's more Thunder like well maybe on
that maybe a text I would have
not gone all the way through but the
time the effort was made there yeah when
I want to hear about people dating
they're like breaking up or getting
together by text I think that that can
never work because you haven't begun
things on a substantial firm foothold
there's a lot of people out there who
think this generation that's growing up
without the human interaction going
through doing the time of like getting
to meet somebody having a drink with
somebody it's kind of like ruining our
relationship sort of psychology personal
ability yeah I mean I think there's
something to it at the same time I mean
it's it happened with our generation too
I mean first you used to have to shake
hands and talk to Peter
then then you had a telegraph then you
had a telephone and when you remove
these these moments yeah you're allowed
to become less sincere sure your word is
no longer your bond then we see it even
on all levels of politics I don't know
if you've read the news lately but heard
about it there there's some suspected
insincerity happening and you don't
think in world politics but if the the
cool thing about young people is even
though they're crazy on their phones and
and with texting they still generally
are being taught to use cars for
thank-yous right and things like this
which I think not only is that important
as a an established delivery system for
sentiments but also for maintaining the
ability to use handwrite a share because
that's no longer being taught in school
it's pretty scary the the greeting card
business which by the way that in my
briefing in my vetting for this occasion
right I was amazed to discover that the
GCA the greeting card Association
estimates that Americans buy 6.5 billion
greeting cards a year that's intense
it's not going anyplace
no and young people are still being
taught this which I think gives me hope
so in 50 years that'll just be the only
remnants of actual handwriting
Caty with our sign links for special
occasions we're still gonna be like you
know what it was show up in the mailbox
what's your address
well this has been great thank you so
much for being here round of applause
