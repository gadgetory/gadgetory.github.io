that settled yeah yeah no we uh we and
by we I mean all of us yeah everyone
welcomes you guys let's say you know
they're there sorry Steve sorry yeah

has to do a lot of podcasts here in the
studio whatever purdue stuff i'd only
excuses Steven we we get to sneak out
and visit some makers making stuff that
we like that's right Bonnie would you
like to tell me about these makers yes
well we all got to go like Donald said
to me Brian duxbury and Adam Ellsworth
and they make this 8-bit question block
lamp which super mario band
bro fan should recognize as kind of the
coin block that my Oh smashes to get
coins and I was in love mushrooms for
the record he doesn't head but he
actually he punches but slow physically
yeah it's kind of a weird kind of
uppercut I was kind of hammer fist
uppercut thing but yes they'll hit his
head people now it's it's always been
his fist and that's how you write on the
lamp yeah you know it's a capacitive
activated lamp or a touch lamp and it
makes the sound and on and on eight
every eighth hit you get the one up
sound yeah which we were telling us at
Super Mario Brothers purist where it
kind of upset because it is not every
eighth every hundred yeah stinks up the
window she's like chuck it through a
glass window um but no he's a cool story
like brian has a day job and he just
likes to do these kind of DIY projects
on the weekends but he has two kids and
he's like I'm never gonna have time / do
this but as he sent himself another
thing do this one day right he was
talking with Adam is that all it takes
to sing yourself a note yes what I was
doing wrong okay never 77 you Mia future
me is doing so many cool things oh my
god to me is it's awesome and I think
you are present day eric franklin know
yeah but anyway he he met up with brian
and or with adam and they've been making
these Liam yeah they're cool guys yeah
they were it was a cool story young
young guys thank you buddy
embarrassingly young for me nursing for
us yeah exactly like I've done nothing
exactly you've created super mario
blocks that people can punch and make
sounds that's more than I've done in my
entire 38 years of existence yeah yeah
so you can pick them up on etsy yep or
if you're me you pick them up after the
meeting you have to hay makers help them
they found preassembled or you can buy a
DIY kit which is what Donald have you
know the spot that you do that did you
put it yeah yeah I it's almost done okay
not long story but it says you have like
a workshop in your garage or something
like that on the tube did you can go
into an
and kind of work in the kind of stuff no
I just put a tarp over my head and then
I get soldering and I get kind of buzz
on the fumes and then and then these
magical visions start happening yeah and
I think that I've made them right but
it's it really I just have a bunch of
unassembled kits in the back of my house
right basically you just on the floor
drooling your kid comes in he has a see
that every time yeah it's but it's a is
better than the actual work involved in
trying to learn how to actually do this
stuff yeah well I mean there's some well
I mean is it better it's probably yes
it's a yes a path of keeps your life
simple yeah yeah fun yeah it's a good
way to spend an afternoon yeah except
when your kids crying over you and
you're under the tarp and yeah happy was
doing all the soldering iron Bernie's on
my fingers from when I pass out to is
it's all we've been waiting again I
should probably just really learn how to
do this stuff where is panza that's Eric
Franklin alright so that's cool and you
should check out the article that Bonnie
wrote up on these guys and the the the ?
lamp not the Mario Brothers lamb pending
litigation but the ? lamp block lamp
lamp yeah it's cool also techshop the
place where did the interview go I want
to go back there again yeah be crafty
the mp3 DJ doorbell is my next topic of
conversation nice transition well
actually these two go together well
because the Mario lamp is this thing
where you touch it and then it makes
that special Mario block sound right
this is another one where you have this
touch device and you can program it to
ring whatever sound you want you load up
your own mp3's up to 10,000 different
songs and when people ring your doorbell
you can be delighted to hear any number
of these 10,000 songs that you program
into it for just one like a ring tongue
forward doorbell yeah yeah what would
your doorbell be um well I think it
would probably be best if it was
like who let the dogs out and then I
automatically triggered Doberman
Pinschers to come and inhabit the person
would actual release the hell yes just
uh like blood stain yeah keep human
Marines human Marines sounds like it
sounds great one of those donors love it
so much yes that's a new flavoring I
like that I know that should be like
that the remake of our sterling green
that was a movie whatever yeah yeah it's
made from people perfect how are we
feeding this exploding population with
tasty desserts secret uh no this is cool
i think especially i have kind of a dumb
old doorbell that I've broken
accidentally so it just goes I can tell
from that weird broken not quite
connecting to the chime sound that
someone's ringing my doorbell either
someone's ringing your doorbell or
there's like a creepy old man outside
yeah plus it's only fifty bucks fifty
dollars you can upgrade to this mp3
doorbell technology not too shabby I
like the way it looks yeah so go get it
I'm craving it you crave them yep for
these next two stories I'm bundling
these up under the Thank You Japan
tagline very nice okay first one is a
Japanese hand-cranked vending machine
that takes a long time to charge up but
once you crank it for about like five
solid minutes and your arms about to
fall off in and wanting why you're doing
it you then have enough charge in the
vending machine to dispense at least a
dozen drinks do you have to pay for them
yes oh well this is designed for
emergency situations so like an
earthquake or something in need so
there's no electricity yeah Ukraine well
you still got to pay for it even an
earthquake or something that's half well
well oh yeah yeah it goes it goes for a
while wow that's ministry to work here
water huh well here's the thing right as
soon ami or earthquake knocks out
electricity and then you've got these
streets in Japan they're just lined with
vending machines that you can actually
use because the power is gone yeah down
just break them open well maybe they're
too hard to break open or the Japanese
are too polite to do that sure so on so
this is a way you can get it up and
running on its own power and then get
the delicious be rule out of it and and
you know me globally it's about your
post-apocalyptic day yeah what you're
here right zombie apocalypse would be
bad because all the hand crank sound
would probably track the zombies yeah
yeah and then you get bitten in the neck
from beyond Anderson yeah alright well
we'll have to find a better way to
zombie pretty patties technology yeah
but uh pretty neat I just love hand
crank anything you know sounded really
you're having hey yeah just the jokes is
writing hey Megan so making the hole
digging silent yeah oh man would you dig
in the whole one it's a simple question
Donald and I'm making this dirt digging
machine your problem is Oh Terry mine I
don't know there's no there's no dirty
angle on this next one this is I'm going
to build myself out all right the
Panasonic rice cooker now responds to
your smartphone oh you can wave your
smartphone over your certain kind of
rfid compatible smartphone over this
panasonic rice cooker and it will
automatically start cooking your rice to
your preferred you know specifications
and and it will also apparently beam up
a number of rice recipes apparently
there's over a hundred or it will
download up to a hundred rice recipes to
your phone we have to wave it over the
rice cooker can you just like is it like
a remote control no apparently have to
wave it that's what I was hoping for it
was like you be on the bus or something
by extra my rights act ly be home
between waving it no you just text your
wife that usually cook my rice Emma
lemon meringue you know this is me right
I'm not gonna start cooking myself
Donnell it's it doesn't work this looks
like a printer I don't know it like so
what's what's the convenience again you
have to still have to put the rice in
you to your rice cooker right like it
doesn't actually the phone doesn't it's
not some kind of automated it's saving
you a couple steps instead of you having
to press the button and put in the
selected time and duration all the
different you just an settings on the
street is kind of a dangerous yet I over
it yeah but now I'm I mean how it is
very Japanese for this to be a rice
cooker but this could trickle over into
the American markets right for our more
Americanized George Foreman grill e-type
appliances right Eric deep fat fryers
sure barbecue I loved affairs um donut
makers do not yeah yeah sure I guess
yeah yeah yeah I i know i don't think
that those things what is it was like
complexes right well I don't really
agree that needs to be like our fate
especially since they're really not a
lot of phones yet to have RFID yeah
little things own you said RF it I know
dude what you're talking about I didn't
know that there was RFID yeah yeah yeah
but you could have like an airplay
enabled a toaster or something right for
your iphone sure
like you in this world I like your idea
what he with the beam on the bus yeah
yeah yeah instead of being rude to your
wife you yeah yeah i mean that's that
seems like that will be well they have
those commercials now were like you can
make sure your garage door is closed on
when you're on vacation in Hawaii
somewhere like oh my god we left the
garage door open at least we know yeah
should we leave the vacation or did was
to see no but then you can remotely
close it oh yeah close it ok well the
you know the the scum have already
interviewed your your house I'm sure at
that point right it's too late you know
because soon as you maybe but you could
trap them yeah you chop them in then
becomes like home alone shot the man
with your 10 year old son I don't I'm
just reaching here you know it is I'm
just spare ya know this is a region
O'Donnell let it go but the hand cream
oh alright but I just I think this is
kind of name the connected appliance
deal I like I like where it's going
alright like weird I know agree but its
trajectory is it's on the right son
right path yeah funny I feel same much
what is over thinking everything was I'm
sure it's not perverted I can't be
dogged him paralyzed oh yes um yeah so
so well that was the job that was the
Japanese segment that I had organized
woman um we have a follow-up to last
week when we were looking for craves
most most dedicated Star Wars fan that's
right we have a winner we found one did

of his body covered in Star Wars tattoos

say the that back tattoo yeah other than
the Darth Vader there I don't know that
space doesn't look very Star Wars II to
me like that let the big planet with the
Rings with it and the nebula that
doesn't look very Star Wars II to me
Star Wars is always just like when I
imagine Star Wars yeah it looks like
oasis it looks like a Star Trek space
yeah it does it does looks something
more akin to you know the Milky Way
galaxy or something I when I think of
Star Wars I think of just stars and I
know it like the new movies you seem a
little bit more variety but the new
movie sucks oh I don't care about those
but do you know how much black ink had
to be put into this guy's skin to make
Darth Vader like is the inside of that
Cape alone hey can what do you guys drop
the link and in the rundown cuz I don't
have his back tattoo oh I put in the run

put it in the rundown though um yes I
see I see your point yeah and then dude
I hope you're doing regular checks on
your liver cuz um that ink is well
there's like you know that's not me
poisonous we put too much stuff in there
I especially the black ink is like so
thick and the your kills our guys have
problems with this is what I'm saying
this visit like there's it's like
they're ruining their livers by putting
these like giant tattoos in our backs
I know I'm telling prick now cuz we owe
you one well here is the other side of
that you got your liver yeah exactly

tattoo of Darth Vader on you know yeah
way to bring it down yeah thanks i mean
i don't know you don't just you just
come down here with me enjoy me well on
that downer tip here I've got daya I've
got the do not crave segment of grave
right this one is a iphone charger
that's powered by your breath
specifically harnessed by this horrible
looking mask you wear on your face hmm
the air mass it looks like a hairy mask
it looks like the League of Shadows mass
from Batman Begins it kind of to me it
looks like um like an original
Battlestar Galactica Oh Cylons island
yeah yeah I get that so you start saying
that I get that on the why I guess they
have like that right there yeah I guess
I do have that they have that original
kind of yeah um so yeah you can get this
and just breathe your way to recharging
your iPhone yeah but yeah it's actually
just a concept so you can't get this oh
oh you can ok well the concept yeah I
think then this this is not I don't

funding for this particular concept yeah
I don't know that thing that mass is
look too comfortable now no and I like
the idea yeah that renewable energy sure
the idea is great yes again again on the
right path yeah well we have tons of
great ideas in you know in this world
but it doesn't like sector inside that's
more coming alright we have some fan
mail yay play the fam and music not well
oh yeah Kevin no
it's like a little herb alpert kind of a
melon trail Donald social today we're no
I herb alpert makes me happy this is
from Joseph you'll see it's like Joseph
but with the c.e.o he says hello great
podcast crew and almost every single one
of your episodes you guys always say
that you barely getting emails where I'm
writing you guys to get the word out
that you guys are making a freshman in
college in Las Vegas Nevada very happy
when watching the crave podcast I wonder
who this / the stretch Minh is in Las
Vegas yeah okapi makes probably Joseph
that make sense Joseph ok I love love
love crave I believe is a good
complement to the create blog which
which is where I learn and find out many
interesting things week by week and get
to hear you got your guys thoughts about
the highlights of the week that was
posted on the blog and when I found out
that Bonnie cha would be leaving dialed
in for the Craig podcast I was thrilled
but Donald and Eric should be proud of
themselves for representing the geeky
individuals such as myself on the
podcast he loves Eric's geek news
segment he's been pleased with the
recent episodes that have been longer
and that we fill his day with craves
geeky jokes laughter and lucky funny
perverted comments keep up the good work
well we definitely got you covered on
perversion yet this particular episode
so Donald Donald that is the well Donna
has himself covered human boomerang with
his tarp and his crank crank crank good
Thank You Joseph that was a very nice
yes yeah thank you for that and also to
our star wars a winner you know yeah
exactly them definitely no i'm not back
on i mean i think they think is great
that he did that I just I wonder I
worried about his safety that's all this
is hell turned yeah well concern fire
that's all anyway he knows what he's
doing he's a grown man all right I know
what you talk some more in our favorite
segments called
meanwhile o came back really I expected
was just about pick my nose um I mean
you can it is not you before yeah it has
no stops make the campers okay what are
you talking about um you should speaking
of being picky yeah yeah there is a
growing group on the internet that are
dissatisfied with the ending to Mass
Effect 3 mass victory is the latest game
in Mass Effect series and um there are a
few people on the internet who play
through the game and didn't like where
their Shepherd ended up I guess I
haven't played through the whole game so
far and I'm trying to avoid spoilers I
don't want to spoil for me I got a
little small piece of a spoiler research
in this today now massive factory isn't
that the game we were just talking about
it a few weeks ago where like we you
have so many different paths that you
can rate yes so I would it would make
sense that you have a lot of different
endings given all the way from path
supposedly there there are a lot of
different endings depending on your your
your Galaxy at War readiness you're
trying to get like this whole huge group
together to fight you know the main
enemy and based on that and base how
much resources you guys have gathered is
going to affect the ending but I'm that
is but people i think i feel like people
have different problems with the ending
like some people have problems with the
story some people have problems with the
execution some people have problems with
you know it just it is not what they
would have picked for their character
they've been playing through three games
with and i can feel that I can feel like
people have problems you have problems
but I really have a hard time with
Bioware the company made the game
considering changing the ending to
appease fans
I have a problem with that I don't know
what the Indians and I guess if it's it
some mechanical jess is in another
castle yes exactly right now sorry
Shepherd but um our miranda is in
another castle no I'm so you think my I
should just stick to their I think they
should stick to their guns i like i said
i don't know what the ending is but
doesn't really matter I I feel like like
like succumbing to this kind of pressure
um from fans who like this one guy filed
a filed an FFT possibly with FTC saying
like I pay for this game is not
satisfied it's like come on man really
this this this reeks of just like just
uh out of control ego huh in my opinion
like someone's is like well I I won't
stand for this bioware I paid sixty
dollars game and I expect the ending
that Ike's expected you know is this
yeah I'm gonna fly if it I hate anything
I wouldn't be like I do understand like
when you invest that much of your life
in these games now where it's like
months of your life go into playing them
then getting developing your character
in getting to the end you want the
payoff to be something yes yes
surprising and worthy of your time yes
you want it to be worthwhile you want to
be satisfying right I agree complete
with that and I and I everyone is
entitled to their own opinion I don't
even know what the ending is so if
you're dissatisfied with the ending yes
more power to you but asking the company
to change the ending that just seems
like it's going a step too far do you
guys like planted you I mean is that
something that you would support like
change I'd be like okay that is anything
it sucked but yeah I wouldn't change it
for me right i don't like that's the way
it is that's not my expectation yeah
manas i don't feel like that's why
people got so annoyed with lucas it was
like look man I know today you have kids
and stuff and back then you didn't have
kids he you wanted to change it make it
more kid friendly and whatever but you
shot the movie that you shot in 1977 or
whatever was for
reason it's that it's the way it is
because of who you were when you shot
that movie and because of who you were
and because the way it is it's affected
me in a certain way so if you're gonna
go and change it now then it it changes
my perspective on that movie like it if
I don't have you know hon shooting first
is it's as a feel I would say to both to
in both cases the the punishment for
having a crappy ending for something
you've built up so much is that people
just aren't going to buy the next one
you know or like you're going to lose
the hardcore fans that supported you all
all this way sure I think in George
Lucas's case there's it was just there's
so much momentum of Star Wars fandom
damn like life's and tattoos that been
built up into a Star Wars identity that
you can probably afford to disappoint
them a little bit without getting sued
but in the case of mass effect i can see
that i mean i'm sure they want a mass
effect 4 and if they disappoint fans and
get people thinking like well if you're
going to screw me over this bad i'm not
gonna stop investing in this mass of
that franchise do you think that'll
happen isn't is math isn't that a really
popular gaming level it is a very
popular game series they've said that
the mass effect this is the end of the
trilogy this is the end of the trilogy
doesn't necessarily mean this is the
last mass effect game right like with
the character even using Shepard this is
probably that characters last game maybe
um but I think the franchise will
continue in the years to come because
it's a popular fange franchise so they
do have to protect that that IP you know
and if you look like metacritic and sub
like that this guy it's got really low
ratings from users but really high
ratings from critics um because of just
sticking points i think when something
gets really really popular it's kind of
easy to kind of pick at it you know I I
and I think it's almost expected these
days when something's really anticipated
comes out and maybe it's not the and
nothing can ever live up to everyone's
expectations and when we have really
high expectations you're bound to be
disappointed um and when that happens
people you know people react people
react emotionally because they're like
he said they're mostly they've been
playing these characters for a long time
they're mostly connected to the universe
and the character so I understand I
understand being upset about it I don't
support trying to make Bioware change
anything all right there you go um I
agree that okay yeah yeah sure okay yeah
in Bonnie well I don't know Danny I mean
I would never have that expectation if
the ending is like suddenly you know
rainbow bright pops out of a space
capsule and tells you that the universe
is meaningless in you should you know
you shouldn't have wasted all your time
playing this game then I'd be a little
bit upset and I would sue them but at
the same time I would love that I would
I be upset people I'm like that is the
ball like this boom nyan cat if it's
just like half hour of like Mankad could
then I feel like that's going too far
you're definitely toying with me at that
point yeah no I see what you're saying
but if that's their choice in this which
was at the apt live with it it's the art
yeah yeah yeah it's live with the
consequences all right what else do we
have um what else we have a speaking of
consequences the characters of the new
Prometheus trailer have to deal with
some really really dire consequences of
their curiosity and their kind of
assumptions about the universe here's
the new trailer we're gonna check it out
right here right now
King has his reign and then he dies
it's inevitable
we Thea says that
these are ancient civilization that were
separated by centuries and yet this same
Victor gran was discovered in every one
of them you're smiling I think they want
us to go to fight we're all here because
of Matthew two kids found in a cave not
summer an invitation from
please tell me you can read them
prometheus are you saying this
whatever that probe is picking up it's
reading laughs for what do you mean like
me oh the head changing changing into
what ship they're leaving to go where
this he was so wrong home
you go back to you
I
big things have small beginnings I want
to panic attack god damn hands I I think
that trailers really well done has a
requisite Brown fine inception you like
those are the two instruments I want to
take up now is like the bassoon trumpet
or whatever that is like power and then
the whatever that screaming tiny baby
bird call yeah really well done like I
don't know if that's in the soundtrack
oh that's from smaller property or
something but yeah that looks that looks
awesome I like like I like all those
actors that are in it and it just looks
with all your the effects look great
from you know the things we've seen and
we don't have enough for science fiction
movies and space or movies like event
horizon and alien and stuff like that
and aliens was great but not really a
horror movie you know so aliens is not a
little aliens is an action movie come on
that is it what does an action movie
alien is a horribly aliens is an active
say aliens did I I said alien you did
yeah but then I said alien yeah and then
get back to your hand all right Oh human
meringues anyway that's it for guidance
alright that's it for the great podcast
then thank you for joining us we'll be
back next week until then you can read
more of the stories will be talking
about on cnet scrape blog you can email
