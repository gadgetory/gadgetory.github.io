these are Samsung's answer to the iPhone
10
they're beautiful phones and they're all
about the camera both of them do
something really novel with the 12
megapixel lens that automatically snaps
between two settings when that's best
for low-light and one for all your other
shots also the s 9 plus has a bonus lens
this is Samsung's second phone to
include two cameras on the back so you
can take those artistic portrait photos
that's 9 on the other hand sticks to
just one camera look there is even
better slow motion video on here it
captures video at a rate of 960 frames
per second and all that means is that
your slow motion videos will stretch
time you know what they say slow motion
is emotion then there's the 8 megapixel
front-facing camera which in addition to
taking selfies can scan your face to
convert it into an animated emoji called
AR emoji this is a clear copy of the
iPhone tends an emoji feature big
differences between the galaxy s 9 and s
9 plus obviously the size dual cameras
on the back and the battery for this guy
is a little bit bigger let's talk about
design from the front the Galaxy S 9
phones look almost identical to last
year's galaxy as 8 they're all screen
beauties with very slightly slimmer
bezels and enormous screen to body ratio
you get a headphone jack which is a
rarity these days and the return of the
button for Samsung's Bixby voice
software you have micro SD card storage
and a second speaker to your music and
your audio is gonna sound a lot louder
and richer I'm also loving these bold
new colors lilac purple and coral blue
they're beautiful in person and they
give the phone's an immediate edge of
your basic boring black but the best
change is on the back remember how you
had to awkwardly stretch your finger
across the camera to unlock the galaxy s
8 and Note 8 Samsung has sensibly moved
the fingerprint reader to the center of
the back panel beneath the camera and I
couldn't be happier
well well maybe I could be
a little bit happier if the reader were
actually built into the display like on
this vivo phone that was one rumor that
just didn't pan out from asinine as for
unlocking the phones with your face you
won't get a map of infrared dots like
you do with the iPhone 10 but there is a
new feature called intelligent scan it
tries to unlock your phone through an
iris scan first but it automatically
falls back on phase unlock if the iris
scan fails it's meant for speed and
convenience but Samsung admits that face
unlock isn't secure so I really don't
see the point of using face unlock alone
or as part of intelligence scan that
were me I would just stick to the
fingerprint reader and the iris scanner
on the inside the galaxy s nine phones
are the first to use Qualcomm snooze
Snapdragon 845 chip which promises a
heap of speed battery life and security
improvements plus the phones bump up
external storage support for 400
gigabyte cards for software s9s run on
top of android 8.0 Oreo so they're all
up to date there's plenty that the s9
and s 9 plus borrow from last year's S
eights screen size at five point eight
and six point two inches they've got
very high resolution displays there are
three storage options they vary by
region so you may not have your choice
depending on where you live there are
also the same battery capacities at last
year's models but we're hoping that
they'll be even more efficient this year
for longer battery life you've got the
same water resistance rating at ip68
wireless charging built right in and
support for gigabit 4G LTE when those
networks are ready and now for the
million dollar question now that we know
everything that's in the galaxy s 9 and
s 9 plus how do they actually compare to
the iPhone 10 Google pixel two phones
and others well we don't know yet
but we can't wait to test them out
