home can do that Alexa can't these
features could change with the magic of
a software update but as of right now
this list is accurate at number five a
bunch of little things there are some
minor features that Google home has that
no Alexa product does the base of the
device can be switched for another
speaker cover the top of the device is a
touch panel you can activate home to
listen to you by saying either hey
Google or ok Google it's the little
things guys at number 4 access Google
Play Music directly maybe one of those
human beings who uses google play music
if you want to listen to that music
service on an Amazon device you can do
it but you'll have to use a Bluetooth
connection with Google home you get
direct google play music access without
needing a separate device boom at number
three send video to a chromecast Alexa
has some home theater skills but nothing
like this one if you've got a chromecast
device Google home can send audio or
video to it
just by asking right now the video
selection is limited to just YouTube but
google says netflix support is coming at
number two multi-room audio this one is
kind of mind-boggling Amazon smart
speakers don't support multi-room audio
Google home does so if you have multiple
Google home devices you can have the
audio synched up or just send audio to
another room and that number one Google
assistant Alexa is pretty bright but if
you ask complex things you'll be
disappointed Google home has a version
of Google assistant to fake right in
when you ask a question you will likely
get an answer the answers aren't always
perfect but it's better than hearing
this sorry I didn't understand the
question I heard be sure to check out
the top five things that Alexa can do
that Google home can't at top 5 cnet.com
let me hear your opinions I'm at is on
Twitter and I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
