York studios on Tuesday August 15th it's
a late addition of the 3:59 podcast my
name is bebe G and in the house we got
the full team today Ben Fox Ruben
Roger Chang and sorry what new guy new
guy hey new guy couldn't help myself
what's up guys sorry we're starting so
late today everybody thanks regardless
it's Brian's fault it's my fault I got
recruited to do a pilot for another show
we're doing I thought we just wanted to
do like a late-night edition kind of
thing you know
for our like sensual viewers god oh god
I'll follow you into the dark is yours
your call then alright so what are we
talking about look obviously next week
we've got a big sampling event going on
we all believe is going to be the note 8
Jessica dole corn is a nice piece today
sort of advocating that Samsung you know
throwing something for no7 owners who
endure so much they have been through a
lot
yeah so we'll talk about that we're
going to talk about a new Amazon program
called it's pickup that Ben will fills
all the details because I had read the
story and lastly we'll talk a woman of
the walking dead because we've got
Norman Reedus Daryl himself as the cover
Q&amp;amp;A for our latest edition of scenic
magazine ooh yeah
so give any questions on these topics
leave us a comment Brian will pick out
the best and we'll get to them in three
minutes 59 seconds from 3:00 to welcome
to the 359 I'm Roger Trang I'm Ben Fox
Ruben I'm Alfred Aang Samsung is hoping
to erase the memory of burning Galaxy
Note sevens with the debut of the note 8
next week but our own Jessica Delacorte
argues that loyal customers who purchase
the previous model should get some sort
of break for their troubles Apple after
all did it during antenna gate offering
free rubber bumpers so why not stand
some yeah no they only offered them what
it was it like a $15 in my kind of
crappy yeah and like a phone case well
know that are you talking on Apple
you're talking so Apple did yeah I'm
talking about samsung here though where
they did make an offer if you turn in
your note 7
and you can get discounts on all these
other phones but there were a lot of
people saying no I want like an oak ache
or something oh yeah here's the problem
is they didn't know yes far away Devon
was the most advanced one at the time so
when you're turning your phone to get a
credit like the only thing you'd get a
credit for was for a worse yeah right so
do you think that Samsung wouldn't want
to reference the note 7 in the note 8
announced they'd go like they want to
take another but they can't know much I
mean like it would be hard to fault them
for you know they've gone out of their
way a lot to apologize about this
they've set it a handful of staged
events to actually go out of the way and
say look if you're with us for the note
7 we want to give you this this like
$100 credited or something like that
right I kind of feel like they're you
know I mean cow dung all over it me I
don't know I don't know what's up again
I think they're still in it yeah I feel
like that would be a nice little gesture
jet so Jessica suggested not just well
it's not a hundred dollar rebate either
a hundred dollars in ten some pink
credit free wireless charger or free
enrollment in Samsung's care premium
warranty program this is a year-long
warranty it just seems like one of those
things where they got the short end of
the stick because they couldn't trade it
for something better and more equal and
there were people that I were I spoke to
that you know we're holding on to their
notes Evans who were saying you know I'm
going to wait until I can get a better
deal trading this in and some of them
were even saying I'm going to wait until
the the note 8 to do that these are
Jessica does mention that these are
generally Samsung's most loyal customers
also you know like these are the folks
that shell out the most money to get the
very best the Samsung has to offer
so I mean would you argue that it'd be
smart for Samson to make sure these
customers remain loyal by offering them
a little extra incentive I think so but
at some point they do have to like you
know put this in the rear view mirror
and maybe I know I said whatever they've
reached that point yet maybe by that
time the note 9 that like happens ok
alright so next up we want to talk about
Amazon's new program instant pickup Bend
what is this Oh instant pickup they
basically have about 22 college pickup
locations 5 of them they're converting
into this thing called instant pickup
where you can pick up like hundreds of
different items like must-haves
we need to have it now types of items
like snack or a cold drink or whatever
basically they just added an inventory
in the back where you can go on the app
order something and then pick it up at
one of these locations what are these
five locations within like two minutes
or less like really really quick the
only way I can see this being useful on
a college campus is if it's 24 hours
like because a lot of convenient
solution is and then you know you're in
some scenario where you can't buy like
things at like 3 a.m. yeah what about
the afternoon like could you just go to
a convenience store like is it that more
yeah and you it would be more convenient
you don't even app well don't even wait
2 minutes you just get it well no here's
my argument though is that when you're
in college a lot of times you're in
class right and then it's one of the
things I've been when you go to the
convenience oh you don't want to have to
look for where it is and all this stuff
where if I know that I need like I don't
know a charger or something like that
but I'm stuck in class right now I can
order it on my phone go and pick it up
and I don't have to walk around off to
wait on online which like can get
ridiculously long after classes happened
because like that's when everyone else
is going to the store - yeah you also
avoid the out-of-stock problem that you
like you go into the store and you know
you you don't actually find it afterward
and that being said I think this is
probably one of the less innovative
efforts from Amazon this is like adding
study the process I've tried making
arguments for this but at the end of the
day I still this is really dumb alright
so lastly we want please check out the
latest issue of seen a magazine or a
cover Q&amp;amp;A with Norman Reedus aka a fan
favorite Darryl from The Walking Dead
not guys still watch that show no I'd
never watched it not recently you guys
just gave me like a pretty heavy I'm so
pretty caught up and yeah there was
fairly significant death over the last
season that had me torn about whether or
not to keep like powered through a still
watched it though yeah alright so for
these stories and more check valentina
I'm Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
alpha ring thanks for listening well
look at him in that motorcycle
commentary that's the kind of insight
our viewers come to expect from I don't
know my mic was off I think we I think
we lost our audience
great shooter
so wait who most of us aren't walking
dead
viewers in this rising lately it's I
watched those in America but as they
watch the show before I don't watch
anything yeah
no no it's Tran you know a lot of people
kind of dropped off after that last
season it got kind of slow got weird and
you know be answering it just gets
tedious after a while they keep
introducing a new bad guy and I keep
losing what's the number bounty they're
supposed to be on six or so I think
we're going into seven I watch like at
least five seats I drop most shows after
five days and that's why the wire was
like the perfect length
I like after five seasons I belong oh
wow that's that's a really that you went
on and a limb they're saying something
nice about the wire yeah I know it's not
it's not really it's a very
controversial show oh yeah that's also
the only show that I can remember is
exactly five season that's yeah I'm
gonna say Breaking Bad words I forgot
how many scenes I feel like it was six
but sixteen I have a finished Breaking
Bad at it hi I'm so that's your leg you
keep up with the walking dead and not
watch Breaking Bad huh like Breaking Bad
to show i watch with my wife and getting
us together to watch yeah seriously I
stopped watching shows of my girlfriend
yeah The Walking Dead I just watched my
own so I could I could binge that pretty
easily
all right post Showtime let's jump into
the chat yeah comments and questions
Damon T says they did right by their
owners in Korea they took a dump on the
users in the USA that's some strong
opinion I first wanted have an exchange
not gonna dump on this channel live Wow
wait what was the difference in Korea in
Korea they had a much signal
yeah much more significant discount I
don't remember if it was Y fact me if
I'm wrong and I think the discount might
be even applied towards the feature
phone but like it I think you got like
half off or something like it was
something that's not easy
yeah like they did a really good job in
South Korea I guess they live there they
want to make sure that like people don't
like egg their house or some you know
thank you so are you you cannot reveal
your very easiest by the status of
building a stroke again I can finish I
don't know what that would have to make
sure those of you
are very happy so we got an opinion from
ridge line H they need to do much more
as many people got stuck between a rock
and a hard place meaning you gave up
your phone when meaning you gave up your
phone when you purchase the note seven I
think there might have been an accident
on the copy base there and I've reread
that wrong but yeah you gave up your
phone when you purchase the note seven
issues guaranteed here I bought
something to give it up yeah where you
trade in for phone theoretically I have
a phone that you're stuck with smoke
another two years as a note a rolls
around you like a year into the contract
or whatever a year into your obligations
to it and yeah they should do something
if nothing else they should make it
easier for note 7 owners with like a
different phone to trade up to a no date
did we lose your need to what were the
most popular trade phones
it was the s7 and usually the s7 if
anything they should just accept it as
like a trade-in like option you know how
I just fully trade like give us your s7
and we'll give you a no date or no you
know how like whenever there's a new
iPhone coming that comes out you know
you can trade in like a certain like
number not number but like a certain
like brand of phones or like if you
can't trade in like an iPhone like to
and like they'll take it as like that's
because iPhone - does it exist that's my
point
whatever my point is I feel like the the
note 7 should be like one of those yeah
some say like trade indigo CS 7 last
year's phone and will give you and will
give you a no date maybe I don't know
that's it's in the cards I don't think
that it's completely unlikely to happen
so we'll see if they actually I'll be
interested to see what the carrier's do
because a lot of these decisions the US
are made by the carriers right like you
know Sampson always says like pricing is
is determined by us is determined by you
know Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T so a lot of the
onus will be on those guys to either you
know introduce programs or offer a more
aggressive trade in and they're gonna
know that you were a note 7 customer in
the past but I mean though the carrier
should know I don't know if Samsung
necessarily contract Italy technically
could with in terms of like registering
the phone that's the other thing that I
was worried about like the scam value
right like what if I just went on
Craigslist and looked up like no sevens
and Baldwin for like 20 bucks and then
and got like I don't know $200 discount
off of like the gallon
like no eight I guess the argument there
is is that Samsung can afford it and
they should be providing some sort of
like give me your coupon to people for
putting yeah a tree stuff so yeah my
people are going to abuse the system I
guess but at the tradition of reminder
they were posting pretty much record
profits the last couple quarters because
one of the accounts ESA has done really
well and also they make a lot of money
selling components to both samson itself
and other companies like apple so
they've got the money yeah and i thinkin
forward it i think they're still in
there like we need to win back our like
we need to win back when people back on
this thing you know what I kind of agree
disagree there because you know the
Galaxy s8 has done really well and I
think if there was that whole issue of
like winning people back like I don't
know the Sun were soul as well as it has
yes been there was a successful that
argument was pretty heavy going into the
SAE and they definitely hit it really
well I mean like that wasn't that was a
very successful launch for them and it
had to be come in as a solid tone for
sure and it was definitely a step up in
design alright shout out to the batch
for playing hooky to watch us today ya
know a Matthew respect scorpion havoc
says why doesn't Samsung and the phone
carriers do something for the customers
that had to get rid of their note 7 to
get a phone they didn't want it was more
like downsizing to get the note 8 and
that's unfair yeah I mean I think that's
sort of a yeah crock so Jessica's
argument here is that yeah you're you're
stuck downgrading your phone with no
choice so yeah some people like we're
like literally had to get it like clawed
out of their hands yep like even after
they mean you you talk to both of you
that like we're loyal I didn't want him
to keep him close friend of mine kept it
for up until when did it visit the
recall in like October ish right ye the
second one yeah the first one there was
one the first one was I thought the
first was like a temporary yeah yeah no
ii was October II he kept his phone up
until March Wow and then he traded it
for a GSA know he came over for the s7
edge
which is again a downgrade and I yeah I
feel for him you know I was just one of
the things where he should have gone a
better phone they should have at least
extended the period where you could
trade it for a phone right right until
like there were better options out there
so I have a theory or a question how do
you think the reviews for the note eight
are going to shake out the reviews for
the note seven before they're on the
problem are they were also working lower
because this phone specs wise outside of
the you know all the problems was a
really impressive phone very
forward-looking all these new features
really exciting whatever don't you think
that like reviewers that are like within
CNET and a bunch of other places are
going to be like alright let's hold off
for now this looks okay but at my little
I wouldn't agree with that I mean I've
seen reviews for other phones come out
after the note seven and there's still
all you know whose phone is amazing and
the new look I look I wrote about the
sis it was just yeah we've reviewed the
essays fairly and magic Jessica's could
review the go date will do it fairly as
well like I don't think that baggage
effects the review right because
ultimately she's looking at the phone
for what it is it's a good good point
Damon T did clarify that there was a
greater rebate for Korea there was yeah
remember those I was not aware of that
yeah I knew they did a little bit more
than home market and then he goes on to
say the the phone was by far not perfect
it lagged the network drop it was a
beautiful phone but damn Samsung owes
more to its customers all I received
with a fast-charging stand for a phone
yeah that's better than nothing
I don't know I was not in your shoes so
I can't really say yeah I think that
people that bought the no7 and loved it
are probably going to like or was rabid
and yeah goodbye the other way even if
they were God I'm sorry for doing this
even if they were burned I do I was I
going to do
what was I going to do even if they got
they were in a terrible position
alright that I don't know thank God is
correct let me say screwed but I don't
get it
Amazon I'm kind of curious about this
Amazon thing yeah I have not been in
school in a minute but well that's
Alfred actually yeah I offered some very
you know student perspectives on this I
find I came in here ready to rip this
thing and then like as you were
explained as I quite no there's actually
like several uses like dr. Selvidge is
not that in every situation like certain
things could be useful in you know
specific scenarios for sure I just think
about all the frustrating experiences
that I've had going to like a Duane
Reade or like a Walgreens or CVS in
between classes and it'll be like I
don't have enough time to get this thing
because this one super long because all
these other people that are also trying
to get stuff in between sizes are here
yeah and they're making this line super
long I'm not going to make it to my
other class damn it and then I like yeah
so what but stuff rebind between classes
um gotta get Cheetos yeah chair to get
your lunch on I mean I'm not going I
don't know that you don't eat you're
glad no dude I'm not I'm not going to
the head you're not going to the place
like every day in between classes
what'll be like that's what I'm imagine
it between every like mega chips
Cheetos to niggers it'll be like if I
need like chapstick or something or if
like you know it's like we got a
birthday and I get online and then for
like my 3 o'clock example I'm like ok
well if it was open out like super late
at night and you were like out of
condoms or something that would be the
perfect scenario
don't you think convenience stores are
like in those areas are set up to be
around colleges where their open any
depends depends of the Pennsylvanian
store near his Mattoon the convenience
store near my apartment was like closed
after like 11 it was like then that
convenience store stinks
yes and that's why Amazon has been
eating everybody I know because it was
like a town words like if you needed
somewhere that was open 24 hours you
drive to it and I'm like I'm not gonna
drive at 3 a.m. just yet condoms I'm
just not going to like to get it can we
do it here with your baby chef yeah I
can we get away talk about cheese
finding a chapstick right so now you
made chapstick dirty and for talking
about
one more question would be useful to
pick it up from a nap right all right
all right dude we got it we got it did
chapstick support I got it
one more to go back to the Samsung yes
story Andy what's the chance Samsung
will not call it the no 8 and give it a
new name that we haven't written i
actually suggested that last year right
after the event like right after Dawn's
event right after their Mahal recalls
yeah it's like that the brands pretty
tainted like you whenever you're on a
plane have you heard those morning
messages like you cannot have a node 7 a
Samsung Note 7 on the plane right
so I argued that it'll I yield
definitely called no date at this point
yeah I honestly think their brand name
from Note one through six is still
stronger than this yeah XS you're right
there's no no 6 not at 1:00 I don't know
numbers ok ok I've been corrected on
time or it's constantly life is
difficult bogus semper fidelis says they
should call the chapstick 800 if you get
it from the store girl Bulgaria too many
other people in line at launch have fake
entire conversation is completely like
if you really need a chapstick in
between classes like yo like and I miss
the language every Chapman is so dry and
in the bad guys oh this is why we never
named in the morning I know I know alert
and still feeling kind of serious now
we're all going to be most lunch yeah
you're so pretty lunch for me Damon P
says I need to be on the show and yes
you do hey yeah yeah more than any of us
if you're in New York just I don't know
like tweet to one of us maybe we'll have
somebody on the show is that a terrible
idea I don't think it's a terrible idea
but we got to be you know cautious and
selective because we right they'll take
me off the street I think I'm fine with
Matthew - Matthew if you want to come on
the show I had an open invite now given
in DC I think so
you know we'd be happy to have you on
listen I'm going know some of these
folks which is really cool yeah
literally every part about the show
we got like the loyals and then always
welcoming the news - but do we have like
a name for our fan base Niners I think
their name that's a football fan base is
named Matthew Dodger my god Michael
Brown imagine saggy I think I'm done
don't forget about Danny Green there's
no damn Maury could never forget anyway
is it be just okay see this is what
happens I swear to God we're never doing
a show after 12 ever again now there's
just a lot of fun my fault recaps are
ours no okay do we have any other
questions no it's wrong we got to
probably wrap it up for the day okay
