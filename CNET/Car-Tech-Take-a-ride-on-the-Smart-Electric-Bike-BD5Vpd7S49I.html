cnet.com at the Frankfurt Motor Show
taking a break from cars to take a look
at a bike now this is no standard
regular bike this is the smart electric
bike it's a pedal assist electric
bicycle and what that means is that
we've got a lithium-ion battery pack
that's gonna send electricity to a 250
watt electric motor in the back that's a
brushless hub motor in the rear wheel
and when I turn these pedals they're
sensors that are gonna detect how much
effort I want to put in and basically
add a little bit of electric assist to
that making me feel like I'm a stronger
rider and allowing me to go a little bit
further with less effort now there's no
twist throttle I can't just you know
turn a throttle and let the bike go for
it I have to be turning the pedals or
this bike is it going to move but I do
have some controls here I've got my
brakes like I would with any other bike
I've got the three gear selector for the
internal three gear hub and I've also
got a little rocker switch here that
lets me determine the amount of
electricity that I want I can go to the
first level of electric assist that just
gives me a little bit of an extra push I
could bump all the way up to the fourth
level it's gonna give me the full beans
and really make this bike fly you've
also got a couple of regenerative
braking modes like any good electric
vehicle so when I step on the brakes or
rather pull the brake lever it'll
actually turn that motor into a small
generator adding a little bit of drag
slowing the bike down and slightly
recharging this electric bike now of
course that's not going to charge the
battery all the way up you're gonna want
to plug it in every now and then and
this battery is removable with a key so
that you can take it inside or actually
just plug the bike up itself it's gonna
take you about anywhere between three to
five hours to get an 80 to 100% charge
that's gonna get you about 62 miles of
assisted range after that you're on your
own with pedal power the top speed on
this bike is gonna be about 15 and a
half miles per hour on assist but if
you've got strong legs and you get up in
that top gear you can actually push it
further with muscle power so I guess
that kind of tech
makes this smarts only hybrid vehicle
where instead of a gasoline vehicle
you've got me
still got the electric powertrain
they're adding assist now this is
available now in Europe and it's going
to be available in North America coming
soon pricing in the North American
markets gonna be about three thousand
dollars and some change I'm Anna Swan

electric bike at the 2013 Frankfurt Auto
