quite simple but rather fun gadget here
it's called the mix dick it's designed
to help you make cocktails let's see
what it can do now this stick connects
to your phone via bluetooth there are
recipes inside the app and then
ingredients are color-coded so you know
what you need to pour and in what order
when you've added any given ingredient
you just swipe on to the next page and
add a little bit more so there aren't
really any sensors in this stick it
can't tell what you're pouring or when
you just sort of have to use your eyes
you'll be able to add up to five sticks
to one phone and ultimately it'll also
tell you not just what to add any more
thought oh but it will give you more
detailed instructions as well I also
like that on the underside this is
slightly textured so you can use it for
modeling it has an internal battery and
when that battery dies you pull off the
top here and then you can plug it into a
computer to charge so we're looking at
this running on an iPhone but the
company says that by the time it ships
it will also be running on Android and
we've seen an Apple watch version being
demoed as well so when can you actually
get hold of this thing well
unfortunately it's not yet a product you
can actually buy this is going to be
funded through Kickstarter later this
month it's going to cost thirty nine
dollars to buy one so if you're really
interested I guess you just have to find
them and back them so as a fun idea is a
simple concept personally I'd be tempted
to leave the stick in once the drink is
finished so that my booze flashes disco
colors but let me know what you think
and check out cnet com / e / for much
more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
