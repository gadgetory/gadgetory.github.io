chevy and GM have dumped a whole lot of
money into developing this electric
vehicle and probably a lot more
advertising and getting the word about
what exactly it is so why is it that no
one I've run into this week knows that
you could actually run it on gasoline if
you need to I'm man Swan goon with
cnet.com let's take a look under the
hood of this 2012 model and see what
makes it tick just remember don't call
it a hybrid now the Volt is actually a
very interesting potentially very
efficient powertrain wrapped in a what's
in my opinion kind of lackluster vehicle
this instrument cluster is kind of a
cluttered mess I mean there's just a lot
of text and images and it's kind of
tossed around here with what seems like
little regard for readability or
usability I mean heck even the Prius is
monochrome eyebrow is better-looking
than this thing you'll be lucky if you
don't crash this car on the first time
out when you spend five minutes looking
for the navigation button fortunately
you've got a couple of actual physical
buttons here in there and at the top of
the display you've got a nice touch
sensitive display
now this 7-inch display is actually kind
of nice because it's good to be able to
have that touch sensitivity when you
need to for example quickly input in a
dress or select a song you've got your
energy info screen here that shows you
how green you're driving you've also got
a nice break out that lets you know how
much electric energy you've used versus
how much gas now audio sources for this
cars optional seven speaker Bose audio
system include a USB port an auxilary
jack in the thinner console here you've
also got Bluetooth hands-free calling
Sirius XM satellite radio and of course
a CD am/fm radio sort of receiver there
curiously you don't have Bluetooth audio
streaming and that's me this Android
user very frustrated this week now the
navigation system includes traffic data
and it's passable but it's not exactly
what I'd call good let's go into the
point of interest
database here and look
for fuel for this car now it shows gas
shows biodiesel diesel hydrogen
compressed natural gas things that this
car doesn't actually use nowhere in here
will it actually show you charging
stations you think that GM would want
that in this car if they want you to get
the best possible fuel economy but sorry
it's not here now under the volts hood
is a 1.4 liter gasoline engine now that
may seem like a pretty low displacement
for a car this size I mean things about
the size of a Camry but don't worry
that's not actually turning the wheels
the wheels are actually turned by a 111
kilowatt electric motor now that's
actually twisting those front wheels to
the tune of about 273 pound-feet of
torque that's a lot more like it that
amount of torque gives you pretty good
pick up from a vehicle this size and all
of that torque is available from about
zero rpm now the electric motor gets his
juice from a sixteen kilowatt-hour
lithium-ion battery pack that's a
t-shape battery pack that actually runs
the spine of the vehicle it's actually
the reason why you have two bucket seats
in the back instead of a conventional
bench but don't call it a hybrid in
front of a Chevrolet engineer that kind
of talk will get you wrapped across the
knuckles with a ruler this is a range
extender electric vehicle that's
basically because the gasoline engine
isn't physically connected to the wheels
under most circumstances that allows the
gasoline engine to run at an RPM that is
independent of the vehicle's road speed
so that it can get the best possible
energy out of every gallon of gasoline
this is the volts electrical charging
port and this is the charger comes with
the car the gasoline port is actually on
the other side so you don't get confused
now plug this thing up to 240 volts of
electricity and you'll get about thirty
five miles of range in about four hours
now if you drop down to standard
110-volt power you can pretty much
double that charging time
now one of the first things you're gonna
notice about the Volt when you hop into
it and you've got a good battery charge
going is that it is quiet
that's what electric cars get you I mean
just go ahead take a second to listen to
that I think this car as I mentioned
earlier it's got torque for days I mean
even when you're in just a standard mode
you actually have three different modes
of mountain mode a standard mode and a
sport mode haha sport mode in a Volt the
sport mode actually gives you really
good pickup now one thing that I did
notice is that once you run out of your
electric power and that gasoline engine
kicks on it does seem a little bit loud
just I mean you can hear it you can feel
it through the pedal it's not a really
good sounding engine and because it sits
at one rpm the entire time it tend to
kind of drone on now one thing that I do
not like about the bowl do not like is
the brakes and they've been more than a
couple of situations where I thought oh
yeah I'm giving it enough brakes but the
car just doesn't slow and it leads to
hair-raising what clinching moments
where you think you're gonna rear-end
somebody the bolt starts set 39 thousand
one hundred and forty-five dollars but
you can probably knock about 75 hundred
dollars off of that price if you qualify
for the full federal evey tax credit now
let's get into those tech options
navigation is one thousand nine hundred
and ninety five dollars go ahead and add
four hundred ninety five dollars for the
premium Bose audio system because these
options can't actually be separated all
in our s tested price comes to forty
four thousand one hundred seventy
dollars before any sort of tax
incentives ultimately the Volt's value
will depend on whether you have a home
charging station installed which you
most definitely should because without
daily recharges the Volt only pretty
much gives you about Prius fuel economy
for what seems like a lot of extra money
