this morning about the App Store the App
Store is turning nine years old and it
is going so well there is one that is
incredibly gigantic and that is we're
going to do something that we've never
done before in the nine years of the app
store we're going to completely redesign
it a brand new app store it is
absolutely beautiful open the store and
I'll and right here on the Today tab the
new front of the app store that updates
every day the first thing I see is our
top story the world premiere of Monument
Valley - is finally here
let's check it out by tapping on the
card this opens a story of you where we
can learn more about the game and what
makes it so great looks like this is
going to be even more beautiful than the
first
I can watch videos that show me what the
gameplay is like and here's a cool quote
from Dan gray at us two games about what
inspired them I can share the story with
a friend and what's incredible is that
we can actually all download this today
only on the App Store if I only want to
see games now I can go to the new games
tab this is huge let's check it out up
at the top I can see the biggest new
releases or just what the game editors
are playing this week if I scroll down I
can watch a whole bunch of game videos
and it's not just previews but also tips
and gameplay videos by editors too if I
scroll down I can see charts that only
feature games so it's really easy to see
what the most popular games are separate
from apps this page is just packed full
of recommendations this artsy game looks
fun let's check it out I'm going to tap
on the icon and it opens up a redesigned
app page it's more beautiful and more
useful I can watch more videos that show
me how fun this is
and this badge at the top tells me it
was named editor's choice for all the
incredible apps on the store there's a
new tab to the apps tab
let's go there it shares the same great
design as the games tab but with a focus
just on apps so that was just the first
day on the new App Store now you can see
why we're so excited to have a beautiful
new place to share apps and games we
love with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
