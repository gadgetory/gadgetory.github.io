a dangerous place out here some 300
people a year are killed and back over
accident
another 18,000 or so are injured you
don't have eyes in the back of your head
but it sure helps to have one on the
back of your car our partners at State
Farm point out the tragic reality that
44% of backover fatalities involved kids
under five who can be impossible to see
by the cars mirrors or even looking out
the back and people over 70 are at the
next greatest risk accounting for a full
third of backover fatalities that's why
federal authorities are moving to soon
require a basic backup camera in every
car over a multi-year phased-in period
now since you're watching this show I
know you're interested in what the
technologies are that are available both
on the car you buy from the factory or
the camera you add to the car you have
already all but the most basic backup
cams today display both trajectory lines
and distance lines
they may also combine with sonar sensors
to give you an audible or even visual
indication of proximity we've seen more
cars come with variable view rear cam
since about the 2012 model year they let
you magnify or change the angle of view
of the backup camera if you want more
than a rear view there are front cam
repairs mounted on the front bumper
corners and they let you nose out of a
tight spot for example and there are
bird's-eye view camera systems that use
front rear and side mirror cams to give
you a look at the car's perimeter
night-vision cameras are still quite
exotic but found in some high-end cars
they display what's out there based on
infrared technology and some will even
call out what appears to be a pedestrian
or animal based on its heat signature
with so many cars coming from the
factory with an LCD screen and the dash
displaying the view may be no issue then
what if you got an older car you drive a
2000 Sentra how do you get rear view
camera into this guy there's not even a
screen here just fence well a couple
ways you can get an aftermarket camera
kit that will give you the rear view in
a portion of the rear view mirror hook
that up to a camera you can add to the
back or that same camera you add in the
back can feed a screen that pops up here
a motorized one out of a single din
aftermarket stereo it's a little slower
to invoke if it's not already up but it
gets you there I'd like to tell you
these cameras are a perfect solution but
in my experience the key is to not rely
on them too much
they show you a lot but they also edit
out much and they can really distort the
distance and rate at which you're
approaching an object oh by the way
here's a favorite low tech tip for high
tech cars which are almost soundproof
these days drop the window as well as
the radio when you're backing up it
might just buy you the reaction time
between whoa and crunch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
