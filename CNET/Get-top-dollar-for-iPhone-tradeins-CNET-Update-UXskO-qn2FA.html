the more gadgets we can buy I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your CNET update the
new iPhone is said to come out next
month analysts are predicting that Apple
could sell as many as 10 million iPhones
and there have been all sorts of leaked
reports that it'll hit stores September
21st so if you're the kind of person
that plans your vacation days around an
iPhone release that also means you
should be planning on getting trading
money for that older model sites like
eBay next Worth and gazelle are
reporting that they're already seen a
huge increase and people trying to sell
now to get the most money but you don't
want to go around for a month without a
phone so what do you do besides sticking
a SIM card in an old phone here's a buy
back tip that may help because L will
honor a price for 30 days after you get
a quote you just have to get it in the
mail by the 30th day so if you grab the
price offered a month ahead by say
around August 23rd it's a good bet you
could hold on to your iPhone until the
last minute before shipping it I spoke
with gazelles chief gadget officer and
he's been suggesting people lack in the
price as soon as they can an iPhone 4s
16 gig will pay two hundred and seventy
seven dollars now but on iPhone launch
day it's likely that that offer could
drop to one hundred bucks
as more people want to ditch the old
model so keep that in mind - for trading
and other gadgets if you get a 30 day
guarantee
just get a quote as soon as possible but
no need to wait for top-rated tablets
Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet goes on
sale Thursday and prices start at $500
for 16 gigs of storage the big feature
here is its pressure sensitive S Pen
Stylus and compatible apps it might be a
tablet students should consider if a
stylus is your preferred method of
taking notes
CNET editors called it the best Samsung
tablet yet get ready for more
advertisements on Facebook sponsored
stories are showing up in your news feed
both on the desktop and from mobile more
people are viewing Facebook from their
phones but there wasn't a way to serve
ads and make money off mobile users
until now the Curiosity rover could
start driving around Mars in the next
week it's a slow process to test all the
moving parts of the rover they
don't even give the arms stretch until
after they test driving but they've got
time this is a two-year mission and
today we're keeping an eye on the app
called rap it's a relatively new app
that lets you send free gift cards to
your Facebook friends well it's been
busy adding more gift card options it
just announced deals with Dockers Office
Depot Zappos and roots it's also
featuring gift cards for an angry bird
shop test it out first on close friends
and family to see how it works I'm sure
they won't mind getting 5 or $10 for
free that's your tech news update from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
