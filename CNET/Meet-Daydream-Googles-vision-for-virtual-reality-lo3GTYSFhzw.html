virtual reality at Google daydream is
about enabling very high quality mobile
VR at the core of daydream are what we
call daydream ready phones and so we've
actually worked with smartphone
manufacturers to really understand what
sensors and displays and processors you
need to have to make a smart phone
amazing for mobile virtual reality and
then we've been working with the Android
team and as part of their newest release
Android n to build what we call VR mode
into the core of Android we've also been
working on building a very comfortable V
our viewer your headset and paired with
that we'll have a controller that is
really powerful really expressive but
also really intuitive something that any
normal person can pick up and a music
and immediately get how to use and
daydream is really the experience across
all these things great phones a
comfortable VR viewer and a controller
that lets you take really high
performance really high quality mobile
VR and have it with you anywhere across
Google teams have been making
investments in VR and so one of the
biggest has been from the YouTube team
and they've been working on from the
ground up envisioning what would the
YouTube experience look like in VR just
with the off-the-shelf cloud mode under
your smartphone and the combination
takes you into a very very immersive
experience we're so proud of cardboard
and cardboard is going to stick around
you get a glimpse of the VR experience
and of course it is just made of
cardboard so it's extremely affordable
daydream is something very different
we focused at maintaining a very high
quality bar across the hardware the
viewer input device and the experiences
what we announced at i/o is really the
core of the daydream platform daydream
itself the experiences the VR
applications that we've been working on
like you to be our Play Movies VR and
the first phones and the viewer that
will all roll out in the fall and time
you know next year you after that our
hope and our expectation is that Italy
most smartphones that you're going to
buy are going to be daydream ready
they're going to be able to not only be
a great smartphone but be the core of a
really really great mobile VR experience
that's where this goes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
