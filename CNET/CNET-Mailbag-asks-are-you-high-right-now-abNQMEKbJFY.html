to the cnet mailbag the show where we
let you in on the wacky wild and
wonderful email that we get from viewers
like you and we also try to answer some
questions about cnet or other stuff
let's dive on in Laine and others were
sad as I predicted about the passing of
today in tech history Lane said while I
was excited to learn that you will now
be doing mailbag once a week as a
history teacher I was saddened to learn
that you will no longer be doing today
in tech history could you tell me where
you got all your tech history tidbits so
that I can continue to follow them well
lane we mostly used wikipedia for that
show it has a very cool feature that
shows you historic events by date so if
you go to wikipedia org and just search
for a date let's say you type in August
twelfth you'll see that that's the date
Cleopatra committed suicide the patent
for the sewing machine was issued and
the first communication satellite
launched it's a lot of fun and I think
you just tricked me into doing a little
mini episode hmm ok moving on a helpful
tip for MRE 617 who asks hi Molly and
everyone else at cnet com I was
wondering why I cannot get aim on my
blackberry curve from verizon is there
anything I can do to get around this
well MRE 617 the internet says that
verizon charges you to use AOL instant
messenger but they also recommend
downloading beejive which combines all
your instant messenger clients into one
and works on your blackberry while we're
being helpful Jerry had this question
about Cena TV many cnet TV videos
contain important and helpful
information and would serve as a great
reference for later review is there a
way to download certain how-to videos
good question Jerry for newer videos you
can download them if you're watching
them at cnet TV com you'll see that
there's a little download link right
there click it and it keeps our helpful
tips forever glad you like them alright
a couple of comments for me Cletus says
here's a question that I've always had
how do you keep the fake smile at the
end of a vid do you think about
raindrops on roses and whiskers on
kittens brown paper packages tied up in
strings just saying every time I try to
do this I end up looking like a complete
moron what makes you think it's fake
Cletus I love my job
he and Eric rights in about last week's
show mollywood looked amazing nowadays
she looks very young she could pass in
her early 30s Eric remember when we
talked about Wikipedia a minute ago well
I'm in there and my birthday is correct
so maybe next time before you send an
email like this you could check it and
discover that I am in fact in my early
30s and then your email could be
construed as a compliment and not like a
poisonous dagger that's inserted right
into my heart thank you and finally a
return of one of my favorite segments
are you high right now dear cnet why the
hell in prizefight gates vs jobs brain
