is the parrot zeke 2.0 wireless
bluetooth headphone with active noise
cancellation it costs the same as the
original Zeke $400 and parrot a French
company once again worked with French
designer Philippe Starck to create this
new model which comes in a variety of
colors most immediate difference you'll
notice between the two models is a
weight loss thanks to a move from iron
to aluminum and some other design
alterations the headphone is now seventy
percent lighter going from 325 grams to
270 grams the finish on the head vote
has also been changed from soft to the
touch plastic to a swanky faux leather
finish the original Zeke was one of the
most high-tech headphones and so is the
Zeke 2.0 it has touch controls on the
right earpiece that allow you to adjust
volume pause your music answer calls and
skip tracks forward and back with a
swipe of your finger and there's a
companion app that allows you to tweak
your EQ settings import custom settings
and raise and lower the intensity of the
noise cancellation which proved to be
quite effective in my test in the New
York City Subway the headphone is
equipped with eight microphones and
there's a bone conduction sensor in the
right earpiece that's supposed to help
pick up low frequencies of your voice
better for phone calls
you also get NFC tap tap air technology
and a sensor in the right earpiece
there's a text when the headphones
aren't on your head and automatically
pauses the music when you rest them on
your neck alas one of the things that
hasn't improved is the battery life is
still around 6 hours with both bluetooth
and noise cancelling activated which
just isn't all that good on longer
flights you can listen to the headphone
in Wired mode with the Bluetooth off and
noise cancelling on and get up to 18
hours of battery life the battery dies
you can also continue using the
headphone as a wired headphone that will
sound a little stunted one big plus is
the battery the powers the headphone is
replaceable though I haven't seen a
replacement battery for sale anywhere
yet as far as sound goes it's quite good
for a bluetooth headphone and
improvement over the original sound but
at the same time compared
have also improved the sound quality of
their Bluetooth headphones I compared it
to the Beats Studio 2.0 which cost
slightly less and also features noise
canceling because you can tweak the
sound of the Zeke 2.0 it's very hard to
compare it to another headphone there's
this fixed sound profile but what I did
find is that the Z to point O sounded
better with some tracks while the beats
with superior with others in the end
this is an impressively engineered
strikingly designed headphone that's
loaded with features and is an
improvement over the original Zeke both
in terms of design and performance over
as good as I think it is I can also see
how it might not appeal to everyone
particularly those who want to keep
things simple and not bother with an
add-on app and tweaking their EQ
settings I'm David Carr joy that's the
parrot Zeke 2.0 thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
