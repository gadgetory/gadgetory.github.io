be 7-inch HDX great adds a larger higher
resolution screen this one is 2560 by
1600 and at 0.8 2 pounds it's the
lightest quote-unquote large tablet on
the market I say quote because while an
8.9 inch tablet is definitely not small
it is almost an inch smaller than the
ipad air and more than an inch smaller
than 10.1 inch tablets like the Asus
Transformer tf700 one and it's not just
a screen it's the body to the tablet is
noticeably smaller than you 2012 fire HD
8.9 and thinner too unfortunately the
power button and volume rocker are still
located on the back and while it's fine
when you're already holding the tablet
in your hand if the tablets lying down
its back and you want to say turn the
volume down it takes a couple of
annoying steps to do so there's a
microUSB on the left edge for charging
and a headphone jack on the right on the
top bezel sits an HD front-facing camera
down the back and 8 megapixel back
facing camera with LED flash gaming
performance is fast smooth and at the
tablets high screen resolution
incredibly sharp of course the real
appeal of any kindle fire tablet lies
within amazon's impressive media
ecosystem if you're having trouble with
any aspect of your kindle fire HDX
there's always made a which is near
instant personal live video support and
made a rep can't see you luckily for
them but you can see them and they can
answer pretty much any question you may
have about the fire they can also take
control of your tablet as well as draw
on your screen to point you in the right
direction check out the first look at
the kindle fire HDX 7 for more info on
what makes the Amazon interface and
ecosystem so effective
the kindle fire HDX 8.9 starts at three
hundred and seventy nine dollars for 16
gigabytes of storage and the price
increases by fifty bucks at both 32
gigabytes and 64 gigabytes you'll also
have to pay an extra fifteen dollars you
want to get rid of the ads on the lock
screen the 7 inch version of the fire
HDX is great but if you're looking for
something that's a little larger with a
sharper screen that still maintains a
lightweight same great fast performance
the HDX 8.9 is an excellent choice i'm
