welcome to tomorrow daily the best speak
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley skele and i'm jeff cannata it is
a new week that means it's time you hit
some headlines you are about to enter
into a new dimension and if the reboots
any indicator it's going to be
futuristic I'm excited the rap is
reporting one of our favorite sci-fi
shows of all time will be getting a
reboot the twilight zone the report says
the show will get a makeover that
includes an interactive element that
will change the story based on your
choices kind of like a super creepy
choose your own adventure they'll be
working on that part with interlude
which is a company that makes really
cool interactive videos they're also
saying CBS has reached across the
creative spectrum for gaming talent
tapping bioshock creator ken levine to
write and direct the pilot full
disclosure CBS is in fact the parent
company of cnet and CBS Interactive but
it doesn't matter because i love
twilight zone and i'm really excited
about this yeah we got the creator of
her story is involved in this company
one of the former creators of heads of
Xbox entertainment studios so there's a
lot of good talent I'm excited to talk
about more about this one me too there's
a lot of talk this weekend about a skin
so you know we had to weigh in to
engineering students at the university
of tokyo's Graduate School of
Engineering created this skin which
contains a flexible OLED embedded
display it's very thin and very flexible
plus a protective film means it can last
days instead of hours so what's the use
here well medical use is the most
obvious including blood oxygen and pulse
monitoring but if we think forward it's
possible tech like this could be used to
manage other health concerns offer
information if the where is unconscious
or even act as tiny video screens are
you ready to have robo skin Robo skin
I'm ready sign me up it looks a little
like when I was a kid and I used to put
glitter glue on my hands sealed off yet
yeah I would not be surprised if that
the actual skin was not made of Elmer's
glue that would be cool I was way out of
my time at six oh yeah whew very future
think
um so what do you want to talk about on
thursday i mean twilight zone come on
think we're gonna talk about interactive
TV we could talk more about what
interlude does we can look into other
mediums I mean obviously VR is getting
really into interactive content for
entertainment not just gaming so I think
that's really a conversation that I
would be excited to have let's do it
will be back on Thursday to talk about
that and some more of these stories that
we talked about this week you can
