Toronto concept this way before I show
you the outside which is kind of
interesting because it's a big deal that
Peter Schreyer designed this he's the
new design chief at Hyundai who already
was the design chief at kia who before
that was the design chief at Audi but
before we get to his stylings look at
the structure of this an interesting
sort of a carbon fiber backbone and
shell upon which they say they can hang
almost any kind of material of body
panel because this thing is so rigid
whatever is on the outside is kind of
just a dress if you will obviously it's
a hydrogen fuel cell car you see your
two hydrogen tanks in the back notice
the thing about hydrogen tanks to get
the strength to hold that pressure they
still pretty much have to be these sort
of capsule pale shapes no one's figured
out a way to make them sort of irregular
shapes and retain their strength though
people are trying because that would
help packaging quite a bit beyond that
pretty conventional stuff we're doing
conversion of hydrogen into basically
just water vapor and running an electric
battery up at the front here here's what
it looks like dressed as you can see
it's a pretty fresh design for Hyundai
now as I mentioned because they've got
this frame envision that is so strong
and rigid they think you could hang any
kind of a panel on your it's kind of
like the body panels on a smart fortwo
to be honest which are also
interchangeable in kind of irrelevant
now look inside the cabin and I can do a
quick off the cuff top five for you
first of all head up display it's coming
down from the expensive cars second LCD
instrument panel gauges are going away
third the pop-up toaster slice style of
central disc light a lot of car makers
are doing that these days for you got
this high wide backbone for the center
console Porsche got on that a few years
ago and five you've got instead of side
view mirrors side view rear facing
cameras this isn't coming to market of
course the entrado is strictly a design
exercise but hopefully one that shows a
lot of truth and where Hyundai is going
and by the way they've already got a
fuel cell vehicle out in limited
production so this isn't that much pie
in the sky
