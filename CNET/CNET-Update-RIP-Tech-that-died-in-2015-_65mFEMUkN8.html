lost in 2015 I'm Bridget Carey this is
your CNET update this is usually the
time when everyone looks back at the
tech triumphs of the past year but we
also have to look back at the duds the
failures and the flops in this special
episode of update we pay our respects to
the gadgets and apps that we lost in
2015 some were gone too soon others not
soon enough and one product didn't even
last a week before it was killed off but
let's start with an unstable category
streaming at the start of the year sony
said goodbye to Sony Music Unlimited
yeah I never heard of it either but it
was replaced by PlayStation Music which
was powered by Spotify samsung also
mercy-killed milk video in November it
was a year after its release the
horribly named app was a collection of
hot videos from YouTube and other
publications beats music is on its
deathbed Apple said it will shut down
the service in January as it pushes
subscribers to convert to Apple music
now those who love streaming books had
to say goodbye to oyster the service was
like a Netflix for ebooks costing $10 a
month it was launched in 2013 but it was
acquired by Google in September
all subscriptions will be shut down by
January now another area of casualties
is in messaging apps Samsung tried to
take on whatsapp with something called
chat on it launched in 2011 and it
worked in more than 120 countries and 62
languages but it was killed off in March
Facebook kept trying to take away the
Thunder from snapchat
there was slingshot in June last year
which also had disappearing messages
that you can do tool on Facebook's riff
app came out this year on April 1st no
joke and it was a way to make weird
videos with friends like a vine but you
passed the baton on to a friend to keep
the silly going and Facebook's Rooms app
was an anonymous way to talk about any
topic you wanted to anonymous apps grew
in popularity this year but the door was
permanently shut on rooms in December
along with slingshot and riff now also
the controversial anonymous app secret
was shut down also in April as far as
gadgets go Amazon finally put out the
fire phone in September Amazon announced
that it's no longer going to manufacture
its first and
the smartphone it launched in July of
2014 but it didn't do very well it was
expensive and I had a focus around
shopping some say there will come a day
when it will rise from the ashes and a
great rebirth but I doubt it and then
there's the gadget that died before it
even arrived LG's latest SmartWatch the
LG watch urbane tube it was taking
pre-orders in November for only six days
before the company pulled it because of
some hardware issue and there's no word
if it'll ever be sold again this was
supposed to be the first android-powered
SmartWatch to have its own LTE cellular
connection
goodbye urbane - you were gone before we
even knew you that's it for this tech
news update we'll be sure to stay tuned
to our CES coverage starting January 4th
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
