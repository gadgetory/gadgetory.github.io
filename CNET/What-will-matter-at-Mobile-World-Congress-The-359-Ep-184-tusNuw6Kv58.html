about all sorts of cooking tech because
Sharon's been focusing a lot on that
recently been doing some really cool
videos called counter space so check
this out on cnet and also youtube if you
like yes and we'll get all that's I'm
already hungry yes yeah yeah I should
have had breakfast before I never have
breakfast before the show that's a
problem well no I it's that's why it's
so good breakfast is an overriding as
you bring any gadgets so the weekend
hikes are you doing intermittent fasting
what is that I don't I just know I'm
doing I don't have money yeah the
original intermittent fasting it's where
you only eat between like 12 and eight
that's that's kind of what i do i mean
that's already what I yeah all right all
right let's get this party rolling let's
get two man bun World Congress and
Congress may be all right we'll be back
to joining the chat hit us with your
questions and comments about that and
other things and we'll see you in
exactly three minutes and 59 seconds
from 32
welcome to the 359 where we talk about
about the top tech news of the day and
all the other crap we want to throw it
I'm Alfred Aang I'm Ben Fox Rubin &amp;amp; I'm
Sharon Profis Sharon is joining us all
the way from San Francisco as she gets
ready to head out to Mobile World
Congress next week it's gonna be the
Royal Rumble of phones with all stars
like LG Nokia and blackberry battling to
be the top device next week samsung
actually decided to save its galaxy SI
for a separate event which is kind of
making things interesting because now
there's a vacuum for top dog but still
if the galaxy s 8 is not there why
should people care what I'm kind of sad
about related to this is that modular
phones were really interesting last year
and granted they didn't take off they
were kind of a failure particularly the
LG g5 I think what is it the Moto
there's moto Z was also a modular phone
but we're probably going to see a lot of
like more of the same phones don't you
think oh yeah we're going to see a lot
more unibody phones phones that don't
let you replace the battery and we may
even see fewer phones that let you have
an SD card slot there it was interesting
last year there were a lot of modular
phones like you said and I think that a
lot of companies were just trying to do
something interesting and different yeah
and it turns out that people don't
really want that yeah they basically
want some version of you know whatever
those flagship phones are even if there
are a little bit cheaper you know you've
got like the slim body iPhone or the s8
and I mean how people don't want to mess
with that design I remember seeing the
modular phone so it just seemed like too
much work i like i want to buy something
and then hat it's like magic owner or a
restaurant whether i are you cook the
food and there's more stuff to lose to
one thing though that could be
interesting is nokia might be coming
back with like a candy bar phone i'm so
excited for that what's it gonna look is
it gonna be like a smartphone or they're
gonna be like a dumb phone with more
features no I want it to look exactly
like the one I had in middle school I
just had like to do the exact same job
no LTE just play snake game yeah it's
just that's all it does you know I don't
have to be on a 24-hour news cycle
anymore I can ignore emails right on
that is all sorry my phone wasn't
connected oh my god this actually sounds
like the perfect phone yeah I really
hope they do this I mean all these
companies that are banking on nostalgia
at mwc like
why is that actually a selling factor or
I think it could be I think that there
is a lot of competition we found
ourselves in a market where there are
two main phone makers and everybody else
is kind of just like trying to grasp at
something that they think consumers will
like and nostalgia especially in the
past year think about Pokemon go has
been a big selling point so maybe
something like a candy bar phone will
help set them apart now jumping away
from Mobile World Congress I understand
Sharon that you are a cooking tech
connoisseur I am neither a cooking or a
tech connoisseur sure if you can tell me
you know what having devices actually
make me suck less at cooking yeah so
that's that was one of the focuses of
counter space is there are more and more
devices that kind of bridge the gap
between people who suck at cooking but
still want to cook at home don't want to
spend all their money in restaurants so
for example there's the pan telligent
pan that connects to a nap and gives you
step-by-step instructions based on the
sensors in the pan so it knows if you're
burning your salmon for example and will
tell you to flip it over right that
sounds is helpful but it's a hundred and
thirty dollars for a pan I I don't
really see myself like spending that
kind of money on something like that
that's true and right now I see it as
more of a gift so put that on your gift
list okay but it's still too expensive
like you said right so it's still the
early days of the smart kitchen and we
will eventually see that price go down
where components like Bluetooth might be
a standard in smart kitchen device does
that mean I'm gonna have to like charge
my frying pan yes oh that's gonna be
movable yeah what about um I want to get
really quickly to a multi cooker do you
think people are gonna buy multi cookers
oh yeah i think the multicooker is
probably the new version of the slow
cooker so it's a pressure cooker slow
cooker sous vide machine yogurt maker
oatmeal maker all-in-one oh yes and it
makes cookie easy well if you want to
read more about these check us out at
cnet I'm out birding I'm Ben Fox Rubin &amp;amp;
I'm Sharon Profis
and welcome back best comment in the
chat so far Sharon's the best oh sorry
guys we've done 184 episodes and no one
said that about any of you guys good
reason for good reignite the best it can
only be one best the YouTube commenters
are always right soon charron is the
best and thank you for joining us of
course all the way from SF guys three
minutes and 59 seconds is like crazy
fans nothing yeah we were just
complaining about yesterday we should
never it's time luck inviting Scots dine
on the show is usually a problem because
I can talk and he does a lot of stuff
and three minutes and 59 seconds is not
enough time for him to just whatever get
whatever is in his brain out into the
microphone to explain things about VR
different things like that fun fact
before I got hired and I was doing
research on the 359 at first I thought
it was a podcast that came out at three
fifty nine o'clock that would have been
much easier when I just do that now
that's what we meant all along this is
the way the air no contest people people
want things fast if you want like the
slow-cooked version you can be on like
the youtube thing that's what we're here
for so yeah apologies to our neighbors
Giant Bomb who are apparently having a
ball right now you can probably hear him
in the background right yeah they have
maybe we should make extremely loud
noises too we're also having fun here
funding you if you guys cross subscribe
to the Giant Bomb podcast look for us
screaming in the background someday
right Jacob in the chat has a good
question do you guys think innovation
for mobile is dead it's been a very long
time since there has been a feature that
has really been that exciting and I'm
sure there are plenty of people out
there who has that notion but he's got a
valid point we have been struggling
especially with people like Apple we're
like what you guys doing everyone we've
definitely talked about that on the past
and that's that's a very well noted
comment we've answered this like
multiple times but the thing just
because something is slow doesn't mean
that it's dead can't you know I mean
it's not like mobile phones are going
away yeah i'm talking about aviation
right innovation of the phone does
somebody will have a newton moments
sometime in the near future i would
expect well i think that right for
long time there you can easily tackle in
a vision geez I know right keep it down
over there get the broom to not like
having siblings next to her um I think
that for a long time innovation just
meant that the next year the specs on
the phone would be a whole lot better
and that is actually very easy to
accomplish we now know and so the next
thing it seems is basically innovating
around your own ecosystem right I mean
it's I think it's frustrating for a lot
of people because you get things like a
lack of a headphone jack we're like Oh
surprise we now have a new Bluetooth
chip that solves that problem that we
created and now you need to buy the air
pub and I spend more money right I still
never thought headphone jacks or a
problem I my argument with this is that
it's possible that innovation with the
phone may never come back while tech
companies go and move into new in
different directions related to software
like you mentioned with ecosystems
things like that I've been writing a lot
about voice assistance and hey I it'll
be interesting to see how those power
the phone and like that's where the
innovation is going to be where it
starts to predict what you need more
often different things like that and
yeah wow it's very hard to maintain a
thud while I'm hearing yelling in the
background I'm gonna stop right now only
one know what they're playing today Oh
God uh iphone 8 or samsung s 8 what do
you think is going to be the best buy
and that's from Andrew Oh what boys bah
come be your head androids I've what's
coming to the best buy showroom right
right I mean like you basically that's
that's almost a troll comment trying to
like get us in trouble yeah which-which
ecosystem we have to say impartial we
are impartial however I am certainly
very curious to see what the newest
iPhone is gonna be because it's gonna be
the 10 year anniversary of being curious
I really can't make that call until I've
seen both those phones that's kind of a
weird question to ask I think I don't
but like there's a lot of anticipation
for both good question exactly that
they're both like iphone has completely
slumped in their innovation samsung just
had the controversies prob they're both
really under the microscope right now so
this will be a good race I think that is
I tend to people who win are the
consumers right right yeah what Alyssa
yeah a lot of people are speculating
that iphones gonna go you know all out
on the 8th because it's their 10th
anniversary on this one right yeah what
would we say iphone X where the terrible
names came up with I think mostly just X
X is good I pull of windows and just
skip right from seven to ten yeah but
like seriously we were talking about
this on the podcast and like do we
really think that like one of these
other phone makers is gonna break
through like do you really think that
like LG is gonna go very traditional
unibody with the g6 yep cheran do you
think that like this is gonna be LG's
year probably not right Samsung and
Apple are still gonna win it out I think
we're in a place where not the best LG
can do but the most likely scenario in
my mind is that LG is able to keep its
stake in the market like not let that
piece of the pie shrink more than it has
so but as far as like 0 LG is the new
Samsung I think that will take a while
oh yeah that's not good and I really
liked how they were experimenting that
was a great way to try to win market
share but it didn't work you know people
did not want modular phones and good for
them for trying something different and
sometimes it just doesn't work it was a
good idea on paper for sure I would have
liked to play with that yeah I mean I
think at this point the the real race is
to see who can have the best phone at
it's like cheapest value only because
it's you know a lot of people don't want
to shell out all that money for
Samsung's phone or you know apples foam
but they still want like a top quality
phone I know like the cost is like the
first thing I look for when I'm like
shopping for a cell phone and that will
that's what was so disappointing about
the pixel was that I think people were
expecting that perfect you know high
quality phone at a decent price cheaper
than iphone or samsung phones and so I
got amazon fire all over again to a
certain extent the fire while this phone
is actually good yeah Amazon's done a
lot of things right and mobile phones
not necessary right but people were
expecting I guess I mentioned it because
people expected a lower price point but
yeah yeah the Google pixel is clearly a
much better phone than the
fire phone yeah that one's still got my
attention for my next upgrade as of now
we'll see I personally love that phone i
think you know if you want the latest
android software and a phone that kind
of looks like the iphone then um then
it's a great choice i mean and then we
also have huawei which is probably the
most likely company to release a premium
phone at a lower price which will see
you yeah hopefully mobile world brent in
the chat is a man after my own heart the
next innovation has to be around
batteries are charging low battery
levels cause many people anxiety he
ain't lyin we actually just did I has
put up a great count down the top-5 of
the best batteries and what was it the
moto oh shoot help me here probably J or
one of the one of the models oh it was a
moto x yeah i forgot i'm gonna have to
check with him sorry everybody I'm not
well rehearsed enough in my own content
ok I'd like 23 hours or something like
that yeah which is which is really
impressive but I think oh how 23 hours
ago how much use though like right like
that's and that's a in us like a
standard I don't know whatever our
testings the circumstances were I'm not
sure who did that one so I would be
interested to see if like let's say like
there's a big iphone event tim cook is
standing up on stage and he claims that
like the iphone is going to last for two
days I think people's heads would
explode in the theater they would just
be like that's amazing like weather so I
agree with Brent that's that's a good
innovation if it were to happen for the
record in that top 5 episode people were
contesting where's the iphone where's
the iphone 7 iphone 7 lasted for like 60
weeks so I asked got mad and he went did
research so he's texting me iphone 7
plus 12 hours 6 minutes why use to prove
him wrong yes well that was that was the
one of the most disappointing things
about the last iphone announcement was
that there was no improvement in battery
among other thing and that were
disappointing yeah i should agree with
friend here i mean i think that's why
everyone has all that nostalgia for the
nokia like cuz it lived forever they're
still on today good throw to grata more
of a reservoir and they're still active
yeah but the battery life on those were
incredible i remember charging mine like
what like once a month right because
it's almost like an e-reader so it
doesn't use that
in high school playing snake when the
teacher was it looking because my last a
few days either you even still a few
days is incredible oh yeah yeah it's
become so normal that you have to carry
around extra power and chargers with you
it's like I always it's a renaissance
for battery may fit like mobile battery
manufacturers I'm sure carry an extra
battery around it just like that's not
the point of me having a phone well if
I'm abandoned in the middle of the
street looks like I'm screwed you know I
just for that just have two phones dildo
come on ya have to pose just have two
phones what's the what's wrong and again
the manufacturers have played you well
yes played you like a violin i have i
have an android phone and my iphone so
you know i love both my kids equally
right you're not the kind of guy who
leaves that android off until the iphone
dies you're screwin with both of them
all day there's the defeats the purpose
oh my god tell me I'm wrong side of the
Giant Bomb guys died what I I'm starting
to get worried video are you okay Benny
Benny scream loudly at the TV if you're
all right hey before we wrap it up
Joshua wants to know who's anyone used a
new blackberry detect 50 he says it's
ridiculously cheap on amazon we haven't
guy if Roger were here Roger is getting
ready to go to mobile world congress and
he is one of our many awesome mobile
experts and I'm sure he's had his hands
on it have you tried adjourned nope yeah
I haven't touched a blackberry sins yeah
I was gonna say considering it is not
2007 I have not used a blackberry yeah I
mean like I I'm more excited for the
nokia phone because it's gonna be an
awesome throwback but i don't know maybe
BlackBerry's gonna come out with
something interesting to people love the
qwerty keyboard man they want they gotta
stick with that I mean to be fair i had
a like really outdated samsung phone
that had the keyboard on it um maybe
open till like 2013 like because it was
just like i wanted that keyboard so bad
the best feature of it was being more
like text people without like looking
down it yes right yeah i would cross the
street and just like do that though it
was it was American innovation how to
bring back tactile response even if you
don't have a physical keyboard it's
getting there they're getting there yeah
that's that's in process with haptic
with haptic feedback engine so it's it's
not
as exact as you would want it to be for
a keyboard but that is something that
that would be coming on that's that I
think that's a word for it is coming but
then by that point we'll all be
dictating everything all true and also
like you know dicked like speech-to-text
technologies getting a lot better i'm
wandering off like there's gonna be a
lot of like alexa play on all these
phones oh yeah yeah i mean a lot away
the pipe screen sorry Huawei is adding
Alexa into one of its phone so yeah
that's at least one of them all right
well I think that's probably a pretty
good place to leave it off for the day
that is alive Vinnie as I thank God
justice for Vinnie alright let's wrap it
