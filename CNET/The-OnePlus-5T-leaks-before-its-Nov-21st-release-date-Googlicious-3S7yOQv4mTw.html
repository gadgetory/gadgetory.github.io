welcome to Google issues for everything
Google you can think of this week's
Android phone that should be getting
your attention is the official reveal of
the 1 + 5 t at a special event in
Brooklyn New York on November the 16th
now they teased it with our own little
trailer with pre-orders starting on the
16th while the phone will actually go on
sale on Tuesday the 21st but you don't
have to wait to see what it looks like
after youtuber Karl posted in early
unboxing to which he then took down but
come on once it's on the Internet you
know it lives forever now he chose the 5
T side-by-side with the 1 plus 5 and you
can see its design that brings it
six-inch screen to the edges and catches
up with the current trend in phone
design with an 18 by 9 aspect ratio and
a face unlock feature while still
keeping the fingerprint sensor on the
back it's pretty much a 1 plus 5 with a
new design something that owners of the
5 can't be too thrilled about since they
released that phone in June 5 months ago
now the pixel buds also just started
shipping out and first impressions are
starting to circulate yes they do have a
wire connecting them but on top of their
awesome translation feature early
reports agree that they sound better
than any of the wireless earbuds out
there like the air pods or the j-bird
freedoms they may not be as easy to set
up but they do sound great the fit
really comes down to your ear but I
can't wait to get a hold of them and try
them out for myself now we do have seen
its full review that will be dropping by
the time that you see this and of course
I'm on the waiting list because I have
to match them with my panda pixel 2 XL
which I did get by the way now every
major phone has its issues on launch we
know the pixel 2 XL is no different and
even with issues that don't affect
everyone it's still a fantastic phone
like I'm really enjoying it and it's a
pure Android experience but the latest
issue getting media coverage right now
is that a handful of users on Google's
product forums are complaining about
unresponsive touch screen edges that
were shown off by Brandon Jones right
here now it's most likely Google's
software being a little over-aggressive
and deciding not to register accidental
touches on the edges Google has
responded that the issue will be fixed
in a future over-the-air update so stay
tuned for that now another issue has
popped up this time
the pixel to camera specifically it
shows flickering darker or lighter bands
moving over recorded video like this
example what the pixel community forum
has narrowed it down to LED lights
possibly being the culprit because of
flicker at the frequency of alternating
current at 50 Hertz or 60 Hertz now it's
unclear if every pixel to camera is
experiencing this but we'll have to wait
and see if it can also be fixed by
Google and software or not and for your
information we bring up these issues not
to bash on products but to really let
you know what's going on and if you're
seeing the same stuff all right the
Google home is getting some love the new
broadcast feature that was announced at
their keynote is rolling out right now
and will allow you to broadcast your
voice to all other google voice
assistant enable devices like phones and
speakers on the same network now you can
say something like hey Google broadcast
it's dinnertime and it will send a
dinner bell sound to every speaker in
the home now you can also use other
words like shout tell and announce
instead of broadcast as well right now
works on phones and speakers set to
English in the US Australia Canada and
the UK with more languages coming soon
and you know what it's great to see more
functionality coming after they had to
completely disable the Google home minis
touch functionality that's because on
touch it would accidentally activate the
assistant and record all the sound
around it sending it to Google servers
now Google called it an accident or at
least they did once it was discovered by
users and the Google rounded redesign
continues to roll out to different
platforms like Google search and your
feet on Android last week it started
with the rounded UI design for its
mobile website and now it's the Google
app that's getting it with rounded
corners on cards also the Google
assistant is getting the new look rolled
out with its white background and
rounded corner cards as well really
shifting away from the hard corner edges
of Google's material design and moving
towards a more apple ish aesthetic now
it's subtle I think it looks nice but
some of you purists may not be the
biggest fans of the changes so what do
you think all right that's gonna do for
this week you can email me at Google
it's just at cnet.com or tweet me at
brian tom thanks so much for watching
we'll catch you all next time for some
more of that Google issues
