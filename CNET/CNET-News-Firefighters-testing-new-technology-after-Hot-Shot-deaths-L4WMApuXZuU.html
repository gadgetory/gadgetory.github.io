lives of 19 Granite Mountain hotshots
from Prescott Arizona when the
firefighters exact location couldn't be
pinpointed they were quickly being
overrun by fire and again some of the
last words practice and perishing in the
fire or where are you now technology
originally developed for the military by
new york-based persistent systems aims
to drastically improve two-way
communications between fire crews and
wildfire command centers please task
your sensor that area and see if you can
establish communication wave really is
mobile ad hoc networking it allows every
radio to repeat through every other
radio no matter how they move no matter
how dynamic the situation becomes in
Prescott Arizona firefighters are
putting wave relayed to the test comes
as a harness and if it gets a fix to
your chest and it's got a little flip
down tablet as you can see right here
then it's got a radio system here the
radio service personal cell towers for
firefighters enabling command centers to
better track what's happening in the
field we've got a fire crew we've got a
couple of different firefighter elements
and firefighters to know more about the
lay of the land by drawing on a tablet
an operation supervisor can remotely
guide a fireman to a safer location
pictures and live video can also be
shared cruise not only receive
information via wave relay they can use
an android tablet to send crucial
information back to the command center I
can grab an icon that's like a little
water supply icon and I can drag it and
drop it exactly where that water supply
is and everybody else can see that you
can actually look at an area pull a
helicopter over and it will tell you if
the area you're standing in is an
adequate landing zone for that specific
style of helicopter wave relay relies on
line of sight for communication but
there are ways to extend the range of
the network one way is to put a radio up
on an airplane no one gets to cheat the
laws of physics but wave relay hops
around it Mountain repeaters help
knowles hop over ridges drones are also
used to connect radios wave relay also
has a lot of applications with unmanned
vehicles be it quadcopters or unmanned
airplanes that you throw up very small
airplanes from 4 to 10 pounds that go up
and become a comms relay or provide
their video feed down to the ground
while the wave relay system shows
promise it does need further refining
Teddy as compared to a standard wildland
firefighting radio so this might be
something that would you take off your
chest and put in your backpack cost is
also a concern for fire departments
you're looking at here in its prototype
is about ten thousand dollars persistent
systems and the Prescott Fire Department
planned to continue the testing under
that fireman went out with an eye
towards using wave relay during next
year's fire season in minden Nevada I'm
