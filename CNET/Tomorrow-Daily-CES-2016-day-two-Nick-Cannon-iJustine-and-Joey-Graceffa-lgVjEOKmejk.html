technology investor all-around good guy
and RadioShack's newest chief creative
officer Nick Cannon joining us on the
show we also have the 2016 CES
entertainment matters ambassadors
iJustine and joey graceffa it is day two
of CES we're still alive amiracle barely
but this is tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the Internet and
and attendees of CES 2016 welcome to
tomorrow daily the best geek talk show
in the known universe I'm Ashley ask
Evan and I'm Jeff ca√±ada and we are in
day two of CES we got think we got
awesome guests come in we have tons of
tech to talk about we've seen some
really cool stuff already today this
morning indeed I actually saw a drone
right over here in South Hall that seats
a person it is a huge drone this is
called an airplane no it's got four it's
got four copter it's a quadcopter it's a
person in a pod and they can take off
and fly I want it is it a person that is
is a willing participant or do you just
capture people and take them with you it
would be pretty amazing it you know
we're not quite there on tractor beam
technology but I really like the idea of
getting that all together and and and
just just taking people from the sky and
picking them up but our guest is here
would not waste any more time I'm very
excited everybody please welcome
technology he is the chief creative
officer at RadioShack you might know him
from America's Got Talent you might know
him from his music career he's acting
he's in shock
he's also a tech investor and a geek
please welcome Nick Cannon to the stage
everybody thank you so much you're so
you're such a tech enthusiast you come
with your own microphone I do I just
come in inhale this is how we do it I
feel like I'm hosting America's Got
Talent right now well you have any
Talent I hope so yeah man have you seen
anything great so far the show man you
know what I have I saw some really cool
stuff I mean I love coming here every
single year but it feels like this year
it feels like everybody's all about I
think they're calling them because they
don't want to call them televisions but
they're more like like they went beyond
the television technology beyond
television yes so they're calling them
like hubs or they're calling the portals
or their color and all these things
because they do so much more than just
being a television because it's your
it's your device it's your computer it's
we're on
refrigerator washes your clothes so it's
like these device these giant screen
devices that really control your whole
office of your whole home I really love
about you this is your I think seventh
year seven year here as he is you were
you are a bonafide geek I'm a nerd you
know what I've always been a guy who's
been in a technology I mean even hence
the the job at RadioShack and everything
it's it's really just something that's
in me because I've loved gadgets I love
music and I started off in electronic
music not in the sense of like EDM but
in that sense of like synthesizers
keyboards drum machines that was
actually where I first learned to play
the drums is on actual electric drum set
so all that stuff was always interesting
to me as a kid and then obviously video
games and stuff and now that I've become
an entrepreneur I've had the opportunity
to invest in a lot of things software
hardware all of those different things
so it's working out so do you come to
CES as a potential investor you come as
a fan or a little bit of both I mean
usually I'm always coming because I have
a product or something that I'm
launching myself but I get the
opportunity I mean I've made so many
great business deals here over the years
so I look forward to it each and every
year because I get that opportunity to
actually find new products find new
things to invest in and find just
different partnerships really yeah yeah
it's cool one of the things that I
always really enjoy reading about when
you talk about stem and getting its
really excited about stem and so my I'm
really curious as to how you might bring
that into your your new role at Radio
Shack well that's the thing I mean when
you think about what Radio Shack is and
stem technology I mean really is
education but it's fun education there's
electronic education and uh I personally
you know because I was one of those kids
I was diagnosed with ADHD and it was
always really difficult for me to focus
but then when you think about the stem
stuff that actually is stuff that kids
are actually already innately are doing
when it comes to video games and drones
and coding like this is stuff that like
I have a four-year-old that works you
know all the gadgets better than I do so
so it's just it's something that's
innately in them and then
it actually helps with mathematics and
science and stuff like that so here what
we're trying to do our Radio Shack is
just encourage people yeah this has
always been the core place where you
could come and get your remote-control
cars and stuff but it's also a way to
learn everything from coding to how to
put conductors together and all that
stuff so it's really fun because it
brings that idea of what toys we're all
about - education yeah there's a lot of
stuff like that on the show floor
robotics that are geared toward very
very young children stuff that we always
wanted to have when we were kids like
we've got a drone and robot build your
own robot come on the future is here
it's not the little Robby robot anymore
like it's the robots that actually do
things yeah are you ready for the
internet of things are you ready to
connect your refrigerator to your TV to
your car I'm trying to figure it out
that's what I said like bees and bees up
portals or whatever they call it oh it's
like I'm a little taken back from like I
don't know if I want to be you know
watching my refrigerator that takes a
picture every day I don't know if I'm
ready but yeah I'm up for it on a
personal front with your social media
you're really digitally savvy yes I try
to be that is such a world that I mean I
love it I mean I'm actually casting a
lot of my television shows now I'm
casting a while.i now through I've been
casting it through the internet and
through social media for the last few
years and where he actually haven't even
have my app that I'm casting yeah my
incredible app and its really a social
media platform that allows people who
are artists entertainers filmmakers
creatives to kind of load up their
content and create this community where
it's not you know or even those days of
MySpace really who I want myself to be
heard this is actually a place where you
can actually really be heard now
actually casting shows through that and
I've created some great relationships
with some incredible youtubers bynars
even digging into snapchat right now
figuring out some really talented people
to put them on a television platform is
there an app or service that you think
is kind of really up-and-coming in terms
of content creation and sharing
man there's so many like I said if
anything I would say my incredible act
that's the one we want everybody to
start to focus on but you know like I
said it's I've actually been amazed on
how snapchat is actually turned into a
place where people are being discovered
and actually could communicate and
people are making some great content I
mean it it feels like that same way that
vine was a couple of years ago that you
know people are actually really doing
some really cool things in that space
yeah and the cars you know the cars that
are showing this year at CES I think are
pretty exciting too right yeah I think
in a car in a couple of hours I'm taking
the test-drive in the self-driving car
so I'm a little nervous because I don't
know if this is the last time we talked
to you yeah exactly so hopefully doesn't
drive me off too far I'm looking forward
to it because last year I took the I
guess it was probably just the the
virtual tour and it was nice you know
because I didn't move I was actually
planted but but now I'm actually going
in the car so let's see how that it's
going to be actually I think safer than
human beings driving you around so it's
like some weird I robot stuff and he
just takes perfect thank you so much for
coming and talking to you is there I
mean obviously incredible you want to
definitely check that out
yes definitely check out the incredible
app spell with the capital letter in
incredible after that for my initials in
a yeah more than anything we're just
pushing forward and continuing to make
content and continue to make some great
consumer products I love it I think it's
great what you're doing to get kids
involved who that's really cool that's
what it's all about
thank you everybody
we are going to take a very quick break
we will be right back with entertainment
mater our ambassadors they they picked
up the torch from you yes sir just me
and Joey grassville will be with us but
until then stick around smart Daly
so we have returned and we have two new
guests on the stage the CNET stage it's
the ambassador's yes entertainment
matters yes okay I just seen Joey
why does entertainment matter well do
you not like to be entertained first of
all of course it matters but I mean this
is the place where you know
entertainment pop culture tech
everything sort of is combined in one
and it's incredible so do you as
ambassadors have to physically greet
everybody who comes in as that you have
to entertain everyone individually we do
we give high fives that's great so you
guys the reason you were chosen is
obviously you both have huge subscriber
bases on YouTube you are pretty my mean
you guys are everywhere kind of a little
bit you guys have really blown up and
are examples of this sort of self
content creation becoming a brand which
is really inspiring to a lot of people
out there who love to watch who you are
what you do and what you're into so here
at CES what are some of the trends that
you feel you're really excited about did
you preorder your oculus yes no I just
found out that that's out and you can
preorder it I actually had a Developer
Kit like a couple years ago so it's cool
to go to their booth and see how far
it's coming it's not like a huge brick
on your face now but I think sleek and
looks cute they're all getting lighter
they're all getting more comfortable I
just was all the way across town at the
HTC booth and looking at the vive and
check out isn't it great with the
front-facing camera yeah well it's
really cool to does a lot of the things
is you kind of lose your sense of space
so with these other newer devices you
actually have controllers you can have
tactile feedback and interacting with
things in this fake world and you can
feel free to walk around because you're
blocked off in the real space and
virtual space so you know having that
sense of perception it definitely helps
yeah and the new controller has a
dedicated camera button so you push it
and it's like your hand has a photograph
on it that's a moving picture of what
you're seeing and you can just hold it
up it's so cool so so cool okay
so virtual reality you're really excited
about I I agree I think it's pretty
amazing and I'm excited it's also odd
how it's such a crowded space and
nothing is actually available in retail
yet none of the headsets what about you
what are you excited about what have you
seen that's really been like oh gosh
besides you mentioned meeting bb-8 I did
meet bb-8 I don't know if it's the bb-8
but it was a bb-8 there's only one BBA
just like santa claus
i think there's actually four or five
that they use on the film you know
spoiler alert but i mean there's so many
things at CES you know I know you have
dogs as well so the pet tech is
incredible there's so many things that
they're they're coming out to make your
pets life easier and you know the pet
parents life easier I think we're
demoing with potentially a dog video
game console I know I think I know
exactly what you're talking about that
they have a really cool time-lapse video
of it and they show like the dog going
out throughout their whole day of like
playing with the game it's so awesome
it's so great that not only are like
actual human baby moms excited about
tech but dog parents are like oh my god
my baby needs this technology explain
this to me a dog video game console I
don't remember what it's called it I'm
blanking on it but it's like sort of his
little device and there's different
lights that light up and the dog will
hit them and I think yeah you read it oh
you're a good dog yeah there's also
another thing that I saw it wasn't here
but I think it's already out it's like
this little pet monitor where you can
talk to your pet and be like hey sit and
you can give it a treat what I mean
thank you yeah and then so I think
petcube also has a little laser that
even might play with them Burchard like
away from yeah I may even have I think
last year they were doing a promo where
you were able to play with a whole group
of rescued cats in San Francisco there
was like a cat rescue and you're able to
like use the laser pointer and the
control instead it was adorable
but yeah yeah drone tech I mean there's
drones are so huge and I think the
problem that we're gonna be facing
obviously is now you're have to register
your drones and where do you fly your
drones and drone regulations and don't
be a a mean person with your drone and
go do crazy things but there's so many
things and people if you're not good at
piloting a drone that's potentially
dangerous to a lot of people so
using intel's realsense technology
they're able to sort of sense that depth
perception so basically you really can't
crash it and also so we've talked about
on tomorrow daily a lot of anti drone
technology and it always amazes me that
I was really surprised we didn't see a
lot of this at CES this year but I think
next year we might see some so law
enforcement agencies so for example in
Japan a drone landed on the roof of the
Prime Minister's house with radioactive
material last year and so the the
Japanese police were like we have to
figure out how to get these drones out
of the sky without being dangerous so
they actually put together a huge drone
with a net underneath it and it chases
after drones that are in illegal
airspace and it captures them the dog
video game controls it so they have dogs
contra now it's controlling and then
there's there's another one here that
was developed here in the States held
drone defender and it looks like a giant
anti-aircraft gun but instead of
actually shooting a projectile at a gun
it shoots a radio signal that interferes
with the drones flight confuses it makes
it think oh I'm out of range I should
return to my master and then it either
land safely or returns so you can get it
out of spaces that you know law
enforcement might need to like fight
fires in California we have problems
with drones and fires yeah and they're
know like with a DJ I think they have
sort of like the no-fly zone so they
make it easy to know I can't actually
fly here so I think it's just the
awareness and knowledge of what you can
do and what you can't do with the drones
is super important have you seen the
drone that is able to carry a person yes
take this picture here on this camera
this is crazy it's like the size it's a
huge hot it's basically a tiny one
person Halleck drone copters I got four
it took hold of me as a pilot inside it
right that's maybe your Emmy it's right
savants are see I guess it's like an
unmanned here it's a mobile aerial
vehicle they actually I'm gonna hop in
the drones take me for a ride and you
control me on the ground oh my god there
might be awesome
I would not be terrified I would be like
this is exciting because I don't know
how to fly but I mean you have a friend
fly you that knows how to fly true but I
think it's actually just might be a
helicopter that's shaped
I always show up at your house and you
like just hop in drink tonight I'm just
gonna happen the thing fly me home
listen you're sober chopper if you open
up over in Las Vegas they have you know
uberx black car all that stuff and at
the end there's a Wi-Fi car so some of
the car services have Wi-Fi in them and
then the last one is uber chopper where
a helicopter can come pick you up and
fly you over the strip for a little
while well here at CES the traffic is
terrible so basically I'm like can I get
the quickest car in the quickest
location but it is I mean I'm so glad
that you Burres in Vegas now I mean it
really is life changing
so as entertainment ambassadors what do
you guys think as entertainers as people
who are consuming and creating
entertainment what is the stuff that's
happening here at CES that's most
interesting to you from that perspective
like handheld it's very small like
almost the Osmo which is actually made
by DJI I keep I always blur those
letters together they just do not fit
and flow off the tongue very well but
yeah it's made by them for vloggers
would be great because it's really
really great for creators such as
yourselves who are out and about doing
things all the time
right um in the sense of what you guys
are doing outside of CES I know that
previously you guys work together on a
kind of a web series that you've made
fight-fight of living-dead right and but
you're right now working on a series for
YouTube red yeah
I'm cute eyes are you allowed to tell us
okay so essentially it's like a murder
mystery so it's gonna be like kind of
like clue meet survivor with a bunch of
youtubers thrown into a murder mystery
scenario similar to fight a Living Dead
actually where they're not the
contestants aren't going to know
anything about what they're going into
and they have to essentially live to the
end
I agreed to do okay well you know there
was some talk about I was like hey man
is this the same thing so I'm not gonna
know what long as you're not the victim
that's the only embed no I think that'll
be really fun I mean doing the fun but
living-dead was sort of this really
surreal experience because it was like a
living video game I mean you work in
this everyone thought it was sort of
scripted I was like that was not
scripted we were actually genuinely
terrified yeah it was I just seen in the
conservatory with we've been Osmos
that's all the time we have we're gonna
let you go enjoy more of the show and
and see everybody else who wants to talk
to you guys obviously super popular
where can we find you on the internet
because obviously we want everybody
subscribe if they haven't already
yeah I'm just I just seen everywhere
online perfect thanks guys Jesse and
Joey thank you so much for hanging out
with us actually that is it for today's
show
we are all done it was all yes all the
time lots more coming up there on CNET
though yeah we have a lot of great stuff
stay tuned for all of our coverage we're
right in the thick of CES day two and
we'll have more content right here on
the CNET stage live from Las Vegas thank
you so much guys be good dear moon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
