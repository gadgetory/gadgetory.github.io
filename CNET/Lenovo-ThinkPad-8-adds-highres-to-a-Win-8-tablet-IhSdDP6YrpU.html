year is an eight inch Windows 8 tablet
hi Windows 8 tablet you're very small
this is a Lenovo ThinkPad eight why do
you have to make a Windows 8 tablet this
small well because ipad and android
tablets and all that stuff because there
are little small tablets you want to
carry in your pocket and maybe you want
to do that with a windows tablet be
really cute but 8 inch windows 8 tablets
are not the perfect fit first of all
yeah sure you have the all the apps and
the tiles but you also have the desktop
mode because this is full windows 8 and
you really want to connect a keyboard
and you want to connect a trackpad and
make this feel like a computer and this
doesn't have an included keyboard or
trackpad so you're going to be fumbling
around like you're floating in space and
wishing that you had that and going to
have to pair one that you have sitting
in a drawer the point being that there's
the microsoft surface tablet there are
things like the Asus Transformer book
t100 things that come with keyboards and
our computers but still have a little
pop-out tablets and feel like a little
bit of both this really feels more like
an iPad Mini it's got a nice bright 8.3
inch 1920 x 1200 display very pretty and
it feels nice it looks nice 399 you're
also getting 64 gigs of SSD storage
which is good but there are things out
there like the dell venue pro 8 if
you're following this landscape or the
toshiba encore 8 these are 8 inch
tablets that cost less 299 maybe down to
270 with 32 gigs of storage but if you
bump up to 64 maybe it gets you to 349
so this is more expensive but you're
getting a better display a better quad
core atom processor that narrowly
outperforms and tests this cover by the
way does not come with it this is
thirty-five dollars extra consider that
so you're just getting this so if you
want the best screen and you want the
best performing 8 inch Windows 8 tablet
this might be it but do you really want
an 8 inch Windows 8 tablet think again
and think again one more time on that
or get this I'm Scott Stein and this is
the Lenovo ThinkPad eight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
