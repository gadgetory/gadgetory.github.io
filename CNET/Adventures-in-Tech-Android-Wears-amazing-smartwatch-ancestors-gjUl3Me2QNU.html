to thrust the SmartWatch into the
limelight but the concept isn't as new
as you'd think
join us as we take a look at Android
where's amazing SmartWatch ancestors
companion computers that live on your
hand have been a long-running sci-fi
dream from cartoons and TV shows to the
us-born book of the future which
predicted with all one day be wearing
wrist o's which incidentally is a way
better name than SmartWatch it's not
just pop culture those smartwatches have
existed in real life tech for decades
from psychos early high-tech timepieces
to the Linux powered IBM watch pad or
fossils wrist PDA the history books are
littered with attempts at making the
sci-fi dream a reality despite repeated
attempts smartwatches have never really
taken off which is a shame because some
of them are really quite clever without
further ado here are our three favorite
attempts at SmartWatch success we begin
in the mid-90s an era that saw Microsoft
partner with watch maker Timex to create
the datalink series of smartwatches
Bill Gates and chumps cooked up a novel
interface for uploading information to
the data link whereby data was beamed by
flashing lines on a CRT monitor picked
up by a sensor on the face of the watch
using this method the data link could
store phone numbers to-do lists or
anniversary reminders I do worry though
what other information Microsoft could
have stored in that flashing code
it looks like you're writing and that's
the data link was well-received
and made it to space but was eventually
overshadowed by another kind of device
that was also pretty good at storing
phone numbers Microsoft wouldn't let the
SmartWatch dream die however and in 2003
would unveil the most ambitious
SmartWatch project ever attempted
smart personal objects technology or
spot was Microsoft's plan to take over
all manner of household objects that
began with a series of timepieces the
first spot watches were built by
partners fossil and Suunto and receive
data from MSN direct an FM radio based
service that initially costs $60 a year
to access using MSN Direct the spot
watches could receive data wirelessly
but only if you were in a region that
had access to its FM signals it was also
limited in what you could do you could
see news headlines but not for stories
and you could get messages through MSN
Messenger but you couldn't reply more
spot watches were built but to no avail
and in 2008 Microsoft confirmed its
SmartWatch was dead just one year later
however we were confronted with another
attempt and this one packed all modern
conveniences as well as a 1.3 inch color
capacitive touchscreen LG's watch phone
could make voice calls removing the need
to even carry a phone it had 3G
capabilities and even packed a
front-facing camera to do video chat
something not even modern gadgets like
Samsung's Galaxy gear can manage sadly
though the watch phone was flawed it
cost as much as a smartphone but could
perform a fraction of the tasks and
required you to wear a Bluetooth headset
unless you were happy to shout at your
wrist in public
go home and if Tokyo doesn't like it
sorry Dave understand the lift I might
lose you Dave Dave Dave Dave the watch
phone was yet another in a long string
of smartwatches that had us briefly
excited but quickly sank into obscurity
failing to win over the wider world
today Android wear has captured our
attention but now faces the same problem
as it's often forgotten for fathers
convincing the public that a computer on
their wrist is more than just a science
fiction dream well Android wear succeed
or will its name be added to the list of
failed SmartWatch experiments let me
know and check back next time for
another adventure in tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
