report the show about the tech news that
everyone is talking about this week it's
texting help to Haiti the iPhone saving
lives literally fun with office 2007 and
oh for pete's sake
the Apple tablet again but let's begin
with the gadget of the week the gadget
of the week is the iPhone see this
American filmmaker named Dan Wooley was
trapped in the rubble of his hotel in
Haiti after the earthquake there on
January 12th and he used an iPhone first
aid app to treat his broken leg and his
head wound and to keep himself from
slipping into shock and then after 65
hours he was rescued and now he's back
at home with his family
so really his iPhone and of course the
rescue team that found him saved his
life and that is pretty freaking
phenomenal also do we believe this
because whose battery last 65 hours and
now for the news speaking of Haiti
technology is saving lives in other ways
as you've probably heard this week
text-based fundraising campaigns raised
more than 27 million dollars in relief
aid for that country and the carrier's
after a few stumbles started waving text
fees for donations and forwarding money
directly to Haiti without waiting for
billing red tape so that's all a lot
better use of your texting time than
like voting for American Idol and we
have posted a list of websites and ways
that you can help if you haven't already
at blog dot seen at tv.com do what you
can okay moving on to tech news and
stupid jokes Apple finally sent out
invitations to its tablet or whatever
event saying only come see our latest
creation and then the invitation is
covered with paint spatters so I'm
thinking it's obviously gonna be some
sort of a screen easel that lets you
paint doing multi-touch gestures and
then you upload your creations to the
newly created AI canvas social network
right Oh fine I guess it's just probably
good to be the tablet but I'm actually
so bored with those rumors that I'm
hoping that it's something totally
different really mostly more than
anything that would just announce the
darn thing already so I can start
talking about how silly it is instead of
talking about how silly it's going to be
just kidding I'm sure it's gonna be
awesome
speaking of Apple there were fairly
unfounded reports this week that
Microsoft and Apple might be in talks to
make Bing the default search engine on
the iPhone like Microsoft and Apple
would team up against Google and then
you would end up banging on your iPhone
that just does not feel right rumour
Microsoft did say this week that it has
created a new game to make the
frustrating and often baffling task of
using office 2007 a little more fun they
introduced a game called ribbon hero
that rewards you for figuring out how to
do things in office seriously
Microsoft's program manager for office
said the idea came from quote watching
office users take ten steps to do
something that could be done more easily
in one or two but maybe I mean I was
just thinking instead of like a funny
game that you make just get rid of eight
to nine steps and then let people get
some freaking work done moving on Bill
Gates is now on Twitter and I for one am
thrilled it's about time we got some
real celebrities up in this joint and
finally let's have a look at what's
clogging the tubes this has never
happened on buzz report before it's
clogging the tubes the sequel that's
right everyone the shiba inu puppy cam
is back with the new batch of puppies
and the productivity of a nation is once
again at a standstill
so but if I like the puppies and I want
there to be more and I like supporting
an Internet puppy mill because this
could really start to feel wrong in a
hurry and that's the buzz report for
this week everyone I'm Molly wood and
thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
