sensors on anything even on a toothbrush
I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update amazon could be exploring new
ways to deliver grocery goods to your
door but these would be items that you
would find at a warehouse club store
like Costco or Sam's Club it's called
pantry and sources tell us a today that
it is set to launch sometime next year
pantry will be for amazon prime
subscribers and it'll offer a selection
of about 2,000 products like cleaning
supplies canned and dry goods drinks
things that can handle being mailed the
pantry program will let you fill up on
one pre sized box of stuff and you can
order as much as you can fit into the
box provided that it's not overly heavy
it'll ship for a small fee so that's
something to keep watch for in 2014 and
now that the Consumer Electronics Show
is approaching we start to hear about
some interesting new gadgets being
developed and a very unique product is
coming from a company in France called
sense and the product is the mother
she's about six inches tall and comes
with many sensors that you can put on
anything or anywhere even backpacks and
toothbrushes these sensors can be
programmed to detect different things
like motion and temperature you can get
alerts when someone's brushing their
teeth or when they took their pills you
can measure your workout run or tell you
when your kid came home and the data it
collects is sent back to the mother and
you can see all the data on a nap the
sense mother comes with a pack of four
sensors for about two hundred and twenty
dollars and it'll begin shipping in the
spring of 2014 we'll be able to take a
look at her in person at the CES show
next month Netflix shared new details on
the viewing habits of its subscribers
and most people surveyed our binge
watching shows every few weeks that
means they're watching between two and
six episodes of the same TV show in a
single sitting but half of the people
surveyed said if they're going on a
binge they want someone to watch with
them moving on to the world of apps if
you have an Android device check out an
update to swiftkey it's our favorite
Android
keyboard and now it added a numbers bar
and emoticons also known as emoji now
the same icons of food smiley faces and
other random objects that are also in
android kitkat are in swiftkey and as a
shortcut it'll suggest icons when you
start typing in a relevant word so if
you type pizza you'll see a slice you
type kiss you'll see a pair of smoochy
lips but the color icons are only for
KitKat users right now if your phone has
jellybean you'll see black and white
icons that's your tech news update and
you get more details at cnet com /
update from our studios in New York I'm
