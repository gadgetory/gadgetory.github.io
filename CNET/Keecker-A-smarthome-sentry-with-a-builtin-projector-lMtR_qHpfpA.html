home you can send it to a room it will
alert you if it spots any motion and

control it with Alexa and it responds to
your voice commands right here in the
bot itself it's got four speakers in a
subwoofer it has two cams one that is a
360 degree can that helps it see
anywhere so if you're out and about and
you need to check on the oven you can
say hey ki GERD go to the kitchen pull
up your phone and look at your oven to
make sure you didn't leave it on it has
Android TV built-in so you can watch
Netflix and Hulu or whatever other
streaming service you want and because
it knows your home you can say hey Keiko
go to the bedroom and play Netflix on
the ceiling and it'll know where your
bedroom is it'll roam there it'll point
up and it'll start playing your content
of choice it also has sensors for temp
and humidity to help it as a smart home
security bot kicker is announcing its
launch in the United States right here
at CES it's actually available right now
