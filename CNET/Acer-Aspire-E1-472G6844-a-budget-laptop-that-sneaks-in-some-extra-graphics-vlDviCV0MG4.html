that doesn't have touch pull you then
you've come to the right place if you're
looking to not spend a lot of money I
don't think you'd want a Windows laptop
without the touch but the Acer Aspire
II one for 72g is there for you at a low
price it does happen to have some pretty
good specs and this particular
configuration which costs $5.99 does
have something that's a little special
which are newer Nvidia graphics and
videos got graphics all over the place
but these entry-level 820 m graphics do
provide a bump over the Intel integrated
graphics that you use to play games
these provide about twice the
performance which means that you can
play games like left 4 dead 2 or even a
little BioShock Infinite at levels that
are okay now if you're really into
playing games I wouldn't say that this
laptop is gonna do it for you which
raises the question $5.99 which is an OK
price do you want to pay a little bit
more to play games well maybe you do or
maybe you want to shave some money off
and just give up that dream of playing
games on a laptop and just go for
something that's a little more
bare-bones
you can get save $100 on this laptop go
with a $4.99 model and go with one that
has almost the same specs a Core i5
processor that's as well it has four
gigs of RAM instead of eight gigs so
that's different but they both have 500
gig hard drives and the rest of the
specs here in terms of the body are
pretty basic 1366 by 768 14 inch screen
which is not good and the viewing angles
are not great and there is no touch on
the screen so you're gonna have to use
this trackpad which feels wonky and
almost makes you feel like you're using
mittens when you're using it the
keyboard is not that great either but
you are getting all the rest of the
specs in their basic bare-bones good
performing laptop at that price well
then come write a board just befor
warned that your design wise you're
gonna get what you pay for here and
that's the story of the Acer Aspire II
one for 72 G this particular
configuration goes with the additional
four numbers six
844 if you want those Nvidia graphics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
