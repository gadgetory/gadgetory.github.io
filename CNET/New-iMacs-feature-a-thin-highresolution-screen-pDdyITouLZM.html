all new imac with Retina display there
has never been a desktop display like
this it is simply stunning it's a 27
inch display that has 5,000 120 pixels
by 2880 pixels if you're really fast
with math you know that is an insane
14.7 million pixels on one display it is
the world's highest resolution display
there's an incredible feat of
engineering we call it the retina 5k
display so to put it in context we all
look at HD TVs all day they're 1920 x
1080 that's overlay those pixels on top
of the retina 5k display there are seven
times more pixels on the retina 5k
display than on your HDTV
let's compare that to the new standard
4k digital cinema and there it is 496 x
2160 the retina display still has
sixty-seven percent more pixels than
that it is stunning what's more
remarkable is that work the engineering
team to fit those 14.7 million pixels
into our beautiful imac design it's just
five millimeters thin there's an
incredible feat of engineering it took a
lot of invention so if you look inside
it it has the fastest chips we've ever
put in an iMac it starts with a three
and a half gigahertz intel quad core i5
but upgradable to 4 gigahertz i 7 the
fastest ever in an imac the graphics but
radeon r9 290x upgradable to a 295 x so
how fast is that the previous fastest
ship in an imac was 2.4 teraflops of
compute power not bad this is 3.5
teraflops for forty-five percent faster
than the previous version io is faster
as well it is now Thunderbolt 2 20
megabit per second bandwidth per port is
faster storage standard terabyte fusion
drive and it's all built together like
all of our products the most
environmentally friendly manner
including supporting the latest Energy
Star 6.1 so it's a very efficient
desktop product so what does this
amazing state-of-the-art new iMac cost
well let's let's make a comparison if
you've ever tried to buy a high-end
display for example a new 4k IPS TFT
display not quite as many pixels as the
imac not quite as beautiful display but
still not bad you know that these range
in the price of three thousand dollars
or more so that's why we're really
excited to tell you the new imac with
retina 5k display it's gonna cost 2490</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
