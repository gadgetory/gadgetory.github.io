Barcelona at Mobile World Congress 2015
we're taking a look at three brand new
lenovo tablets first up is this its name
is the mix 300 it's a Windows 8.1 tablet
that starts at just one hundred and
forty nine dollars so for that you get
an eight inch screen it's got an Intel
processor on the inside if you spin it
around that's a five megapixel camera
and the Novo saying you'll get up to
seven hours of battery life sticking
with the size but changing operating
systems we have this is the tab to a
eight so this is an 8 inch tablet is
running Android 5.0 lollipop which is
the very latest version of Google's
mobile operating system so it's got
quite a portable size if I spin it
around that's a 5 megapixel camera
meanwhile there's a 2 megapixel camera
on the front for selfies or for video
calling so this tablet's pretty
affordable too it's going to start at
one hundred and twenty nine dollars and
it's going on sale in June this time
we're sticking with the operating system
but with beefing up the size this is a
10.1 inch tablet it's the tab to a 10 so
let's talk hardware this thing has an
8-megapixel camera it's also got Dolby
sound on board which should give the
speaker's a little bit of extra kick
it's got 16 gigabytes of on-board
storage if that's not enough for you you
can beef it up using a microSD card it's
running android 4.4 which isn't the very
latest version but lenovo says an update
is coming to android 5.0 in the summer
this one is going on sale in april and
it's going to start at a hundred and
ninety-nine dollars so those are the
novos 3 News tablets let us know which
