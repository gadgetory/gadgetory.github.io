toyota to feature their new Entune
system this is one of the most ambitious
of the in-car app platforms the way it
works is you install the end to Napa
master app if you will on your
smartphone android iphone i believe
blackberry as well and all you see there
is the Entune screen that low means you
are connected and then from the cloud
this car pulls through your phone five
popular apps you've got bang which of
the courses microsoft search engine
notice that when i get a result it's
going to be oriented toward navigation
and very simplified so i can go to it if
i want to and while being does have
voice command that little icon on the
top of the screen i find that it's about
half as good as what I've got on my
android phone now google's voice command
on their phones is the best but this
isn't really even close in fact let's
compare these two head-to-head for
experience results and speed just to see
how they go i'm going to try and start
both the voice commands of google on
android and bang on in tune at the same
time and you can see how they come back
and what they bring us i'll use the same
search term for both i'll speak
simultaneously CBS interactive ok i got
the result on the Toyota Entune system
significantly later and I haven't even
gotten to navigation yet you saw how
much faster it was and i'll tell you
about half the time the Entune system
knows what I'm talking about about
ninety percent of the time or more the
Google system knows what I'm talking
about so there's a bit of a gap in the
performance here for voice based search
to nav or search to call but they're on
the right path iHeartRadio is the
streaming version of the stations that
are run by clear channel the biggest
group of radio stations in the country
so you can tune around and listen to
stations in other markets wherever
you're driving I find the buffering and
the load time on that app in particular
is very slow when I'm changing stations
looking for stations launching the app
it takes forever once it starts
streaming though I found the quality was
robust but it also seemed to be taking a
lot of headroom on my phone as you might
imagine so other things like email and
texts seem to be slower to come in or
occasionally cause this to hiccup note
that when I'm on iheartradio I do not
have any way to drive that via voice
this is coming
to a lot of these into naps and the
voice button here on the wheel does not
get you there this is only for the old
legacy voice commands so a lot of times
you'll be driving along that will lock
out a lot of the features so you don't
get distracted and you're kind of stuck
just letting it play or turning it off
that's a design flaw movietickets.com is
like Fandango you can look for movies
and even buy tickets when there's a
little gold ticket displayed alongside
the film you can look by location
nearest theaters or hit the movies
button one thing I don't have is a
search for title there's nothing like
that here where I can type in the name
of a movie that makes us a little bit
laborious to drag through and try and
find what I'm looking for opentable you
know look for restaurants make a
reservation see some ratings when I'm
moving these buttons blank out so this
becomes useless unless you have a
history of restaurants this all gets
locked out and there's no voice command
on this one either and Pandora needs the
least introduction and you can also send
and sync destinations to the car which
is a nice feature as well now note this
notice these arrows on the left and
right clearly Toyota's built in the
ability to move two additional panels in
the future of more apps but I believe
their strategy is going to be always
curating the apps so that you can't drop
what you want in there from let's see
the Android or iOS market they're going
to come in through this master app on
the smartphone so overall this is a very
ambitious system the key goodness in it
the cloud brings down a basket of five
managed and curated apps and they've
chosen good ones and the fact that it's
a very well done interface is also very
solid the installation of this app was
very robust I put this in I set up an
account on a total website and I entered
my vehicles VIN number I did have to
screw around with a bunch of bluetooth
on bluetooth off monkey business so that
part's all solid on the downside too
much is locked out when the car is
moving from both physical control or
even voice control and finally some
optimization of the cloud back in to
make things load and snap a little
faster I'm pretty sure that's coming
this is a general release improvement
because this is a one point out so look
for this in various toyota vehicles this
one has great potential i'm looking
forward to seeing the two point
