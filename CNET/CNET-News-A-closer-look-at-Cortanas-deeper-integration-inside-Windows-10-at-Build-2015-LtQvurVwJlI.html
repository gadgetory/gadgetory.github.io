2015 and I brought a friend of mine
Brian Roper with product marketing here
at Microsoft mr. Roper in the house I
like that cool man yet happy to be here
excellent so we're here to see kind of
some of the tweaks and the latest things
you guys will be showing off here at
Build 2015 with Windows 10 obviously
there's going to be some improvements or
some new things that we may not have
seen yet and we kind of wanted to do to
show us some of things that you really
wanted to showcase a feature here
awesome for sure one of the coolest
things that I'm excited about is all the
work that we've done based on the
feedback from our windows insiders so
they're giving us tips and tricks like
hey we love this tweak this 3 million
people doing that so you're going to see
just a lot of things first off in the
shell things we just evolved in become a
lot cleaner we've done some stuff like
move the power button right next to the
start menu so you don't have to move
your mouse super far to get there when
you maximize this to have a full screen
start experience if you want to do that
you totally can and it's senator looking
good also in the task switcher view
which i'm going to show you Spartan here
in a second are multiple desktops yes
that whole switching experience is a lot
smoother now we've done some tweaks
there to be able to easily move between
those desktops the UI is looking good
another thing that folks asked for is to
be able to actually move things around
between different desktops so if i have
this file explorer here i just want to
grab this and move it to another desktop
i could or i could actually make a brand
new desktop with it and that's all based
off of feedback from that insiders
program so you guys looking smooth we've
acted on some things that folks
recommended Cortana's popping up really
good if you type stuff like whether
she'll pop right down if you have either
certain bar Yeah right there certain
Bing answers she'll come right up and
let you know so she's and she's sitting
there in Spartan real nice have you seen
her integrate with websites and stuff I
would like you to show I'll should I
check it I have not seen that so here's
like a sample restaurant right actual
it's a real restaurant but it's a good
example of this Cortana can pop up and
let you know hey I know some stuff about
this page and if you click her she will
let you know like hey here's where it is
the phone number the hours the menu all
this kind of good stuff this is a lot of
integration with Cortana when we first
saw the demo I'm at 121 like we we saw
how Joe interacted with Cortana but now
you're showing me Cortana really
integrated on different levels within
windows
more than what we've seen before right
absolutely yeah and the really cool
thing too is when you think about
Cortana being this personal assistant
who knows the stuff that is going to
help you do stuff that you want to do it
makes sense that she's kind of
integrated throughout the platform and
what you'll see today some super new
stuff with Cortana is her helping you
find things that she'll probably be into
doing and also helping you with your
piece about PC so imagine the day when
you're stuck you forget a keyboard
shortcut or something and literally you
can just come down here and ask for
something like how do i project my
screen the keyboard shortcut to project
is Windows key + P so she can tell you
just like that how many times have
somebody been stalker is there a better
way to do this and you can just ask her
and in addition to all of other fun
being answers the fun one I like to do
is ask for something just crazy like how
many centimeters in a light year here's
your answer like that's crazy there you
go but but but it's there like stuff
like that she can do device searches so
you'll see her pop-up a lot what we're
super excited about here at build is
getting our developers excited and one
thing we're going to announce today is
the fact that this Cortana platform the
way that she is an extensive bility
platform on phone and has been for a
while that functionality is now on PC so
you can you can actually use her as a
platform to build your app to integrate
so for example we've done that with
viber so you can say something really
natural to her like start a chat with
Terry Myerson using viber starting a
chat with Terry Myerson so with that
natural language you can actually
connect to the app you know I spoke
really i didn't say viber do the pitch
just told her you're gone with your flow
yeah totally between stuff like this
email dictation there's a lot that she
could do to make a real natural personal
experience it's cortana really kind of
the rock star of Windows 10 I mean now
we're seeing it integrated on a whole
new level within apps third-party apps
right in the browser on the fly what you
know where is she kind of one of those
centerpieces or temples and windows I
think she's definitely super important
but I mean when you think of this notion
of more personal computing she's
definitely a core part of that
experience to light things up across all
the different platforms windows is going
to offer I mean really a lot of stuff
for doing man the two-in-one story
continuum stuff Jeff there's a lot of
rock stars but she's definitely up there
I
I will Brian oh we can't wait to get our
hands on this and really build 2015 to
showcase all this to the developers for
