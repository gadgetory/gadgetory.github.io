based on Android and now several have
come along at once this is the Nokia XL
let's investigate as the name implies
the XL is larger than Nokia's ex phone
it has a 5-inch display and around the
back there's a 5 megapixel camera as
well on the front meanwhile there's a 2
megapixel camera for Skype or taking the
odd selfie and the whole design of this
phone is extremely reminiscent of
Nokia's Lumia line including the
external design and the look of the
actual software so this is Android but
not as we know it
nokia has heavily customised Google's
operating system to make the excel so
let's see what you can do this is your
home screen where all your apps are
unlike raw Android there's no specific
app tray so to see all of the apps
you've got you have to keep scrolling
down here if you move over to the right
you get what Nokia calls Fastlane which
shows you recent apps that you've used
and notifications if you're not happy
with the way your home screen looks you
can rearrange these icons like this just
hold down on one of the tiles and you'll
get the option to resize them and change
where abouts they are on the screen so
the big advantage of Android is that it
has loads and loads of apps but
unfortunately the XL won't grant you
access to Google's Play Store instead
you'll have to use Nokia's own App Store
and third-party ones as well and there's
a question over whether they'll have
enough to really tempt people the really
good news though is that this thing is
not going to be too expensive it's only
going to cost 109 euros when it goes on
sale in the next few months so we're not
completely convinced yet by Nokia's take
on Android but we are pleased with that
low cost and it could mean that this
phone is really good value wait for the
