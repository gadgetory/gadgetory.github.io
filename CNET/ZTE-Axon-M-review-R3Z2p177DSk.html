know that's because it has two 5.2 inch
displays that fold out and work together
in different ways it kind of looks like
a Nintendo 3s but it's a phone you could
mirror both screens so they display the
same content which is handy when you
want to share a video with someone
sitting across from you you can also use
both screens as a single mega display
stretched across a six point eight inch
diagonal
it's like viewing a tablet except you
have a black hinge that goes down the
middle
both screens can display stuff
independently of one another - which is
ideal for multitasking for instance you
can keep an email open on one side while
penciling a calendar event on the other
lastly you can use it like a regular
phone with only one screen it feels so
much smaller than when it folds out but
hey at least the blank side can double
as a kickstand with the extra display
knowing when to switch between all the
screen options in certain use cases
takes time to learn the X on em can also
be uncomfortable to use again you'll
always have a black line in the middle
of your display and the phone is very
thick and heavy overall at 8.1 ounces
then again if you want to screen that
kind of just goes with the territory
the X on em only has one 20 megapixel
camera so if you want to use it like a
point-and-shoot you'll have to flip the
phone over first which again takes some
getting used to firing up the selfie cam
though is a breeze and it's a great
phone to prop up for all those wide
group shots just remember to set your
timer right during our battery drain
test the phone lasted a little over 10
hours that's enough to last you through
the workday no problem but keep in mind
that other phones in the Exxon m/s price
class usually lasts about 13 hours or
more in the US the X on em is an 18 t
exclusive and there's pre-loaded
bloatware from the carrier at about
seven hundred and twenty-five dollars it
also costs about the same as other
flagships
like the pixel 2 iPhone 8 in galaxy s 8
in general those phones outperform the X
on em in
missing power at camera and battery but
if you see yourself getting a lot of use
out of a dual display phone the exo-m
isn't just your only choice but a pretty
solid choice overall
