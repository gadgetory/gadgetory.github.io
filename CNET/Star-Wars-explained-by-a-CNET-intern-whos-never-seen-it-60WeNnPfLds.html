Star Wars before I've seen like posters
of Star Wars I've seen like you know
lightsabers and stuff at the store when
I go to Disneyland I've been on some few
Disney rides and Tomorrowland I'm gonna
answer a few questions ha ha and see
what I know pew pew
there's a robot and they lead you
through a galaxy where there's a dark
side
there's Darth Vader who is against the
light side the dark side refers to the
Dark Side of the Moon Pink Floyd is a
band that I listened to sometimes the
dark side and the light side are on the
same moon and there's one on the light
side and one on the dark side of it the
people who practice with the force are
the Jedi's I know Luke Skywalker is a
Jedi they're fighting on the light side
against our theater they're protecting
the force Darth is like the all-time bad
guy Darth Vader is Luke's father and he
has like a kind of voice he is the
leader of the dark side
he has a mask on his face that changes
his voice because he's Luke's father so
he's trying to be like You Don't Know
Who I am the Death Star
what Darth Vader is protecting I have no
idea what the death it's for death it
kills people maybe it's like a black
hole kind of thing
wait I think the Death Star is maybe
Darth Vader's like ship that I think is
Luke Skywalker and he's a Jedi and he is
like the main protagonist of the light
side and he's fighting for the good of
the world it's a robot that's friends
with Luke Skywalker and he does a lot of
things I know who he sounds he's like
beep beep he looks like wall-e he's not
and I'm not really sure who made him or
what his name is but he's a friendly
little robot that's Princess Leia I've
seen her hair everywhere I'm pretty sure
I was Leia for Halloween Shh
like married to Darth Vader and then
falls in love with Luke Skywalker but
that would be weird cuz that'd be like
his mom marrying him
she turns to the light sighs I think she
was on the dark side I have no idea what
his name is he's kind of like the robot
like I automatically know who that like
that that guy is in Star Wars and he is
definitely on the good side and he's
kind of like the robot in the sense that
he helps the robot but I don't know his
name han Solo he's on the dark side and
he helps Darth Vader to kill people I
feel like he's kind of like the comedic
relief
that's what I'm looking at was um looks
kind of like that snail and Monsters Inc
like the that woman snail thing so like
she's kind of funny so I imagine him
being kind of like a horse snail mix no
I've never heard his voice before
where am I Luke Skywalker like kind of
like the little annoying high-pitched
voice that doesn't even look like it's
from Star Wars I'm he's like probably a
funny character um
plays some comedic relief but other than
that I have no idea he's probably on the
good side too because he looks pretty
like a good guy I have no idea who that
is
here is that the guy in Indiana Jones
I've been on the Indiana Jones ride in
Disneyland
she's I've never seen that guy before he
looks like the comedian George Lopez
he's probably a bad character because of
those eyebrows and that like really deep
furrow between his like that but it like
stretches all the way up like I couldn't
take this guy seriously but he looks
like he'd be on the dark side I think
Star Wars fans are totally justified
there it's a really intense movie I know
that Star Wars is major in pop culture
and there's a lot of sequels and movies
I know that I would have to take at
least a full day if not like to to watch
all those movies and I would like to do
that soon pure may the force be with you
can we not include that last bit about
Pink Floyd or because that just makes me
seem ignorant I was no no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
