need to create the necessary condition
to live our mission by working on our
culture you join here not to be cool but
to make others cool that's kind of how I
say it so one of the things that happens
when you're super successful is you sort
of sometimes lose touch with what made
you successful in the first place
I felt like you know we may have sort of
confused maybe marketing slogans for our
mission so that's why I wanted to get
back to that sense of purpose
spend five years now that you've done
this it's called the one week which is
in some sense the metaphor for the one
week that then informs the rest of the
year in terms of really getting in touch
with the core of this company around
innovation but that innovation being
driven by a sense of purpose and
reinforcing a culture that we aspired to
okay but the implication from your book
is that Microsoft I won't say the word
broken but that there was some serious
problems here and that's what I'm trying
to get at what was it that was so
concerning to you so anything I wanted
to not sort of talk about what is broken
I wanted to go back to the very genesis
of this company what was that sense of
purpose and drive that made it
successful what was the culture that may
be have been there in the very beginning
or in the times when we were able to
achieve that success how do we recapture
it so that's why I think about it as you
know it's the Renaissance as much as
about sort of just fixing something
that's broken so the there was a sense
of culture I mean sense of purpose that
was lost or missing to you I felt in 92
we used to talk about even our mission
for example as having a PC in every home
in every desk any concrete in something
that was able to galvanize the entire
company except by the end of the decade
itself we more or less it achieved it
bill had been working on that for a long
time and Steve and others had worked on
it for a long time I joined much later
since their beginning and then he
reiative dit then what what's next we're
at a time in 2018 when technology is so
pervasive in our lives in our economies
in our societies and I think time has
come quite frankly for us to really have
the dialogue and the core and the
question to be asked as well as answered
as to what is the real benefits of
technology broadly equitably spread not
only in our country in our society but
all over the world you were quoted as
saying that you're a hololens user that
you get up every morning and use it and
to check your schedule can you talked a
little bit about the promise of AR
there's a lot of hype around AR n VR has
not gotten the uptake in the market
what is the promise of a are to you and
there's multiple forms for example we
are na are to me is one continuum it's
like a dial for whether you've got it's
fully opaque and it's fully immersive or
you can see the world and you can see
the objects which is digit are digital
objects and artifacts on top of it
that's they are hololens for example is
really gotten traction in a lot of
enterprise in industrial settings remote
work so remote assistant so you say
you're a factory worker and you're
trying to fix something hands-free but
you need the expert to come tell you
what to do like hololens is the perfect
form factor training it's a perfect form
factor for doing simulation but the most
interesting thing is data visualization
the ability to spin around data to be
able to learn about the patterns and in
fact in with all the big data I always
say it's the ability to recognize small
patterns that's still uniquely human and
I think that there's a real use case
that I think gaming will also have use
cases when you took over and you wrote
this in your book you said that culture
and fixing the culture was your top
priority and I was curious and I believe
you even said that the scene CEO should
stand for culture you've been at
Microsoft for more than two decades why
was that your number one priority why
was it so concerning and that was the
first thing you found out it in fact it
would I would say County two things one
is the sense of purpose and mission and
culture to me are the two pillars which
I think for any institution any
organization are the enduring pillars
and then of course you have to express
yourself with changing technology in our
case technology paradigms every year
because that's constantly changing you
were very candid in your book talking
about how you miss answered a question
at the Grace Hopper Institute and the
question was by Maria asking you what
advice do you give to a woman who wants
to ask for race it's not really about
asking for the raise but knowing and
having faith that the system will
actually give you the
raises as you go along so I'd like to do
a reset let's rewind the tape Sasha what
advice - you're giving woman today yeah
I mean I mean it's sort of what I said
what my big learning from there was
which I wrote in the book and obviously
Maria helped me and many other women
subsequently have helped me understand
because the answer a game was absolutely
nonsensical because it really did not
get to the core context but I'm asking
what's your advice to women
I think they should first of all
advocate for themselves they should find
other allies male or female who can
advocate for them and make sure that
they don't accept status quo and I think
that that's definitely the first
response and then the responsibility of
people like me who are leaders of
organizations is to be able to listen to
women who are advocating for themselves
or their allies and make sure we don't
have to even put them in that situation
so what what is the vibe or image of
Microsoft that you want the world to
know because there's a very specific
vibe out there is that right it's it's
in our mission like I you know it's
empowering
so I warned Microsoft stand the any
association with this company should be
they put some tool they put some
platform they gave me the opportunity to
really do something so not cool well
that to me you want to be cool by doing
that empowerment but not just to be able
to sort of associate yourself with cool
technology it's the result that matters
