appliances and today we're gonna talk
about the Frigidaire Professional F PEF
3077 Q F this range is an electric model
with a smooth glass top with some nice
stainless steel finishes if you notice
it has a pretty simple digital display
on the back panel of this oven in return
for that simplicity we have knobs lots
and lots of knobs four on each side a
total of eight and while they looked
really nice being very symmetrical it
can kind of get cluttered especially if
you're doing a lot of cooking on the
stovetop and in the oven with these
knobs Frigidaire has opted to put the
settings on the actual knob and white
print which makes it really hard to see
under direct overhead kitchen lighting
now the cooktop on this range was a
little disappointing to me specifically
this nice little feature called a bridge
feature now how this works is you can
connect the two left burners and create
kind of a larger cooking area however
what we noticed in testing was that the
front burner really really hot so high
we've burned a pan and a lot of pancakes
as well now this can be a problem if you
want to cook something over a large area
but you want to cook it at the same
temperature however if you want to cook
maybe paint takes on one side of a
griddle baking on another this would
work but you really have to get to know
how to set each burner so you get the
temperature that you want now I was
impressed with the oven on this
Frigidaire model it has a nice big 6.1
cubic foot capacity which could make
really nice space for roasting a chicken
and speaking of roasting this oven has a
convection roast feature which provides
a fan to circulate all this hot air so
you get nice even cooking the chicken
that we tested in this oven came out a
perfect golden brown and was actually
pretty moist and tasty too even though
this oven worked really really great it
wasn't enough to really impress me
especially with the stovetop teachers
that I really wasn't a fan of now with
the fridge feature going back to that I
did have a chance to test a recent
Samsung Flex duo model that we have in
house and it also has a bridge feature
that actually cooked a lot more evenly
than this one so I was a little
disappointed and I can't say that this
oven especially for $15.99 is the best
value for your money thanks for watching
