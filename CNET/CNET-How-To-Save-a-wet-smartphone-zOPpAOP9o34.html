I'll show you my go-to solution for
drying out a wet cell phone plus how to
prevent these accidents from happening
in the future so say you're out enjoying
lunch in the Sun when suddenly fill a
big glass of iced water all over before
you do anything turn your phone off
immediately before the water has had a
chance to come in contact with the
circuit boards and short-circuit when it
comes to drying out a wet device I've
heard plenty of non solutions you've got
the hairdryer the oven the bag of rice
and even the microwave well let me set
the record straight by telling you that
none of those solutions are reliable the
first thing you want to do is remove any
parts you can such as the back cover the
battery and the SIM card and dry them
off with a towel then do the same thing
with the outside of the phone now here
comes the secret ingredient silica gel
packets they're desiccants so they're
designed to absorb moisture very
efficiently collect these as you find
them in your packaged products because
they'll come in handy for times like
these and if you don't have any on hand
order some online they're cheap or buy a
dedicated product like the beasty bag
which is essentially the same thing what
these magical packets will do is absorb
all of the moisture trapped in your
phone without damaging it so grab a
handful and put them in a zipper top bag
then grab your phone and any other parts
like the battery and Nestle it among all
of the packets seal the bag and then
wait about 72 hours for the phone and
any parts to completely dry
when you're 72 hours are up grab your
phone put it all back together and try
to turn it on hopefully if you did
everything right it'll be back in
working condition but remember two
things first your warranty is probably
void most phones have a water indicator
that let the manufacturer know if your
phone came in contact with any liquid on
the iPhone 5s for example it's here in
the SIM card slot the second thing is
that even if your phone goes back to
working condition there were parts that
were exposed to water and they can
corrode over time so if your phone is
dying a slow and painful death you know
exactly why so that's what you should do
if your phone gets wet but if you want
to make sure this doesn't happen in the
future you have a few options my
favorite for the klutzes out there is
the lifeproof case it's waterproof
shockproof freeze proof you name it it
works by fully enclosing your phone so
that if you drop it it's safe this is my
real phone by the way and that's how
much I trust this case a more temporary
solution is a waterproof pouch this is
something you would use while swimming
or doing water sports so that your phone
is safe from any splashes plus you can
take underwater photos finally keep an
eye out for phones that are waterproof
and water resistant the Sony Xperia z1s
is just one example but there are plenty
more to come so just remember that if
your phone takes a dip it's not the end
of the world and if you know that you're
prone to these kinds of accidents now
you know how to keep your phone safe if
you have any questions or tips of your
own hit me up on Twitter and check out
how to see Netcom for the written
