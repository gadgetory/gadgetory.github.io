an assistive technology consultant at
Vision Australia about 10 years ago I
used to carry about eight different
devices around such things as light
detection till the lights are on and off
nowadays I've got all those different
products in one device that I can use
every day the best thing about the
iPhone and the watch that makes them
work is they've got accessibility built
into them particularly for voiceover
because I can touch the screen or I can
flick my finger left and right you move
Island by iTunes and then once I've
heard the item that I want to use I can
do it one finger double tap anywhere on
the screen and I'll activate the last
item that just spoke to me one of the
main things to do with travel
particularly of trains is binding out
what platform
the trains leaving off and rather than
trying to find somebody to ask if I use
an app like trip view I can find out
what time the train is and what platform
it's leaving off
what platform the trains just arrived on
I know the station I can tell where the
stairs though and get off the station
properly when you go shopping where you
want to go and grab a cup of coffee and
you've got a couple of notes in your
pocket being able to just quickly get at
your iPhone run an app like the money
reader identification app find out where
your denominations are on your pocket
before you go and buy a coffee make
things a lot more streamlined technology
in general allows me to be more
independent because the apps that I use
allow me to do everyday things everybody
else for do it's just that I use
technology to do it soon as you say to
somebody its accessibility it's like I
don't I don't need that I'm not one of
those people type things
why build in accessibility to any
product at any time anybody's life
Suffolk will cause you to have some
issues getting around or getting access
to information the same for somebody who
has has got that particular condition if
you want to put it that way all the time
universal access from Universal Design
is a better way of saying accessibility
because the accessibility sounds like
it's for a small minority of people
where'd you say it's universally
designed for everybody to go on it's
fantastic what does it do
