capture all those holiday memories on
camera and to make it even more fun I'm
going to show you two ways on how to
make your own DIY photobooth the first
method is using a tablet as your camera
and the second method is for better
quality photos using a DSLR and then
sending those photos wirelessly to a
tablet make sure that there's a good
Christmassy backdrop you have some fun
props and your scene has plenty of
lights first let's set up the tablet
option you'll need a tablet tripod and
photobooth app
secure surface facing the backdrop for
iPad I'm using the studio proper tripod
mount which attaches easily to the back
of the dedicated case depending on your
operating system choose an app to run
your photobooth I'm going to use pocket
briefs for this demo and it runs on both
iOS and Android like a real photobooth
it takes four photos in a row and
arranges them in a strip after they've
been taken this method is quick and fun
but using the front-facing camera
doesn't always produce the best quality
shots so for the best photos you can get
I'm going to show you a DSLR method grab
your camera and an eye-fi mobi card it's
got built-in Wi-Fi so it can transfer
images to a tablet or smartphone
automatically it's also compatible with
the majority of cameras on the market
even older models insert the card into
your camera and then download the iPhone
mobi app for iOS or Android on your
tablet launch the app and enter the
10-digit activation code on the IFI case
now all the photos you take on your
camera will automatically transfer to
your tablet on your camera we're going
to shoot JPEG images only for speed and
disable the auto power off options so we
don't lose our Wi-Fi connection if your
camera has an eye-fi setting in the
menus make sure to enable the card like
this start taking photos by getting your
subjects to press a remote shutter
release or set up your camera's self
timer option you can either have your
tablet near the camera so people can see
their photos immediately or have it a
short distance away so passers-by can
see those photos too once you've taken
all your photos it's really easy to send
them to a printer straight from the app
or save them to your gallery
then send to a printer using AirPrint or
Google Cloud Print so there you have a
DIY photo booth two ways happy holidays
