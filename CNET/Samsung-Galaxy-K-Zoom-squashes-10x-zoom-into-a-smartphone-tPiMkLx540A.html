shiny new phone or a brand new camera
but why not combine the two with
Samsung's Galaxy K zoom it's a four
point eight inch Android phone with a 20
megapixel camera under whopping 10 times
optical zoom from the front the K zoom
looks like any other galaxy phone it has
a crisp white body metallic edging
physical home button and the chrome
speaker grille turn it around though and
a huge camera lens and xenon flash make
it indistinguishable from a regular
compact digital camera it's lost the
awkward battery hum from its predecessor
the s4 zoom although it's still a very
chunky Beast
it's 20 mil thick and it weighs 200
grams making it far more cumbersome and
the Galaxy s5 may not be the ideal
device for everyday use the Galaxy s5
has one of the best cameras available on
a phone so the K zoom has some very big
shoes to fill
even with its physically larger sensor
and higher megapixel account I still
found the K zoom shots to be less
impressive from the s5s
this was mostly due to its auto white
balance which aired on the cold side
more often than not and a less even
exposure and the s5 was able to achieve
its trump card comes in the form of a 10
times optical zoom however which lets
you focus in on distant objects without
losing quality
unlike the digital zoom on the s5 which
essentially just drops into the picture
heavily reducing the quality if you're
heading out to sea lions in Africa and
don't want to risk losing a limb an
optical zoom like this will come in very
handy indeed there's a range of scenes
and features like panorama and burst
shooting while the proteg√© mode will
recommend what it thinks will give the
best results for your shot although in
my time I didn't find this particularly
useful camera stuff aside the K zoom
acts just like any other galaxy phone it
runs Android 4.4.2 kitkat it's powered
by a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core chip with a
lower-powered dual-core chip as well to
use for less demanding tasks in theory
helping save battery the Galaxy K zoom
may seem like the photography
enthusiasts dream device but it's far
from perfect
this chunky size makes it very awkward
for everyday use and its images are
generally less impressive than the
Galaxy s5s unless having an optical zoom
in your phone is of the utmost
importance for some reason you'd be
better sticking to a regular phone for
your snaps and just taking a good
compact camera away when you go on
holiday
