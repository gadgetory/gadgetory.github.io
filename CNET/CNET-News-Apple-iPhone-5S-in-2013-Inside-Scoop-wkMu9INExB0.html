Sumi does and joining me is Josh
Levinson staff writer for cnet.com Josh
thanks for being with us my pleasure
especially just hours after you got up a
plane coming from vacation true how
better to start your week back than to
talk about Apple and these new rumors
about the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5s going
into production in early 2013 which
really isn't that far away
didn't we just hear about the iPhone 5
and wasn't it just released that's the
crazy thing about myself I've just came
out in September I mean it's not even
out in some countries they're still
planning launch yeah yeah people are
still lining up for this thing well not
letting up but you have to line up on
line basically it's a couple weeks to
get one right but keep in mind that this
is a device that actually got finished
up last year it went into production
early in the year they were building
them up and and that's how it happens I
mean these things take months to make in
the scale that we're talking which is
millions of units okay so let's first
talk about the rumor where did it
originate from a Chinese publication
tell us about that and whether or not
this is a reliable source historically
sure so it did come from China times and
they were actually the interesting thing
about this is that sometimes they've
been wrong about things but they nailed
this rumor about the iPhone 5 going to
early production last year and so the
time tables let me go back it really
does kind of work out the really
unexcited part about this rumor is that
it's a iPhone 5s when you're talking
about iterations the S models we thought
the 3GS we had the 4s it's safe to say
we're gonna get the 5s too this is
technically not an exciting product it's
an iteration the usually you know speed
it up a little bit the lad a better
camera maybe some improved Wireless
that's not sexy right I mean it's just
it obviously doesn't have the excitement
around it that the thought I've had
around it right I think the key thing to
think about these kind of rumors is when
we're talking cell phones you get people
around contract so they get a new phone
every typically two years so you get
these groups of people these waves so
we've seen it with the 4 and the 4s and
now with the 5 these people who buying
these cycles and something like the 5s
would you know be just in point with
that whole iterative process the iPad 4
when it was announced along with the
iPad Mini that kind of took people by
surprise
and a lot of people were angry because
they had just bought the iPad 3 so
what's due to customers I mean what kind
of message is Apple sending I mean if if
I'm thinking about buying a phone and
there's a new one every six months I
feel like I'm never gonna buy a phone
because I'm always gonna feel like I'm
gonna get the phone and then within a
matter of months it's already gonna be
out of date
sure and this is really something that
people on the Android are used to I mean
you have a new flagship phone every
couple months and at some points it was
almost every couple of weeks you got
this new benchmark device it was just
the latest and greatest that everything
Android Apple fans get their knickers in
a twist once you get off the product
cycle you know what I mean they do and
that's what complicates it with
something like this this whole S Class
of device that people are really looking
for that big jump don't get it but the
people who need a new device and want
something it's a little bit better you
know that's right there it's right on
time for them so if it does indeed go
into production in early 2013 then we
won't see it for six months after that
is that presumably that means would be a
summer release and that's what we use
have with the iPhone 4 and then it moved
to the fall with 4s and obviously with
the 5 - the big potential thing that I
see with this rumor actually being true
is that Apple really needs something
that changes up when they're releasing
their products they really pushed
everything towards the end of the year
and that complicates our financials when
you when you're comparing
quarter-over-quarter and you don't have
that growth
to compare it to they might change it up
just to make those numbers look better
and really catch some of those people
were on that older cycle and really get
that people want to buy the phones for
summer and have enough for the holidays
something that might be a problem with
the five all right Josh if these rumors
start to percolate more you'll keep us
honest and let us know right definitely
