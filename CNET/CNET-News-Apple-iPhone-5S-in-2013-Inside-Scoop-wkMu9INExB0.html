Sumi das and joining me is Josh
Lowensohn staff writer for cnet.com Josh
thanks for being with us pleasure
especially just hours after you got off
a plane coming from vacation true how
better to start your week back than to
talk about Apple and these new rumors
about the iphone 5s and iphone 5s going
into production in early 2013 which
really isn't that far away didn't we
just hear about the iphone 5 and wasn't
it just released that's the crazy thing
about the iphone 5 just came out in
September I mean it's not even out in
some countries they're still planning
launch a few months yeah yeah people are
still lining up for this thing well not
letting up but you have to line up
online basically it's a couple weeks to
get one right but keep in mind that this
is a divisive actually got finished up
last year it went into production early
in the year they were building them up
and and that's how it happens I mean
these things take months to make in the
scale that we're talking which is
millions of units okay so let's first
talk about the rumor where did it
originate from a Chinese publication
tell us about that and whether or not
this is a reliable sources so quickly
sure so it did come from China times and
they were actually the interesting thing
about this is that sometimes they've
been wrong about things but they nailed
this rumor about the iphone 5 going to
early production last year okay and so
the timetables we go back it really does
kind of work out the really unexcited
part about this rumor is that is the
iphone 5s when you're talking about
iterations the S models we've had the
3gs we have the 4s it's safe to say
we're going to get the 5s to this is
technically not an exciting product it's
an iteration the usually you know speed
it up a little bit the lad a better
camera maybe some improved wireless
that's not sexy right i mean i just you
it's it obviously doesn't have the
excitement around it that'd be fun i've
had around it right i think the key
thing to think about these kind of
rumors is when we're talking cellphones
you get people rock on track
so they get a new phone every typically
two years so you get these groups of
people these waves so we've seen it was
before and the 4s and now with the five
these people who buy in these cycles and
something like the 5s would you know be
just in point with that whole iterative
process the ipad for when it was
announced along with the ipad mini that
kind of took people by surprise and a
lot of people were angry because they
had just bought the ipad 3 so what is
due to customers I mean what kind of
message is Apple sending i mean if if
i'm thinking about buying a phone and
there's a new one every six months I
feel like I'm never going to buy a phone
because I'm always going to feel like
I'm gonna get the phone and then within
a matter of months it's already gonna be
out of date sure and this is really
something that people on the Android are
used to I mean you have a new flagship
phone every couple months and at some
points it was almost every couple of
weeks you got this new benchmark device
it was just the latest and greatest of
everything android apple fans get their
knickers in a twist once you get off the
product cycle you know what I mean they
do and that's what complicates it with
something like this this whole s class
of device the people are really looking
for that big jump don't get it but the
people need a new device and one
something it's a little bit better you
know that's right there it's right on
time for them so if it does indeed go
into production in early 2013 then we
won't see it for six months after that
is that presumably that means would be a
summer release that's what we use have
with the iphone 4 and then it moved to
the fall with 4s and obviously with the
five to the big potential thing that I
see with this room are actually being
true is that Apple really needs
something that changes up when they're
releasing their products they really
pushed everything towards the end of the
year and that complicates our financials
when you when you're comparing
quarter-over-quarter and you don't have
that growth to compare it to they might
change it up just to make those numbers
look better and really catch some of
those people were on that older cycle
and really get that people want to buy
the phones for summer and have enough
for the holidays something that might be
a problem with the five all right Josh
if these rumors start to percolate more
you'll keep us honest
let us know right definitely for inside
