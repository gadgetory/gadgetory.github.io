it is not it is actually the rappy L by
Annie effect rap yell in Latin means God
heals the people and what this does this
glove fits every hand and helps you do
rehabilitation exercises there's both a
clinical and home version the
differences really come down to the
software you don't actually buy this
what you do is you rent it or you'd rent
it for $99 a month you also get the apps
and the apps are designed by doctors who
help rehabilitate you through different
activities whether it's throwing darts
or playing billiards or ping-pong the
hardware is actually pretty neat it has
9xs movement a position sensor as well
as 32-bit microcontrollers to help keep
track of movements those
microcontrollers talk to the app through
bluetooth and as you get better with
your hand over time two different
algorithms the companies develop it
helps strengthen your muscles by making
the games more and more challenging
they're a PL well not as cool as the
power glove it probably will help a lot
more people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
