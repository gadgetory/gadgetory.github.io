that matter right now the reviews are in
and Google's pixel and pixel XL phones
are receiving widespread acclaim nearly
across the board here at cnet we love
the phone's design excellent camera and
the pixels evolved personal assistant
the phone is expensive though and it
lacks the kind of waterproof rating that
a lot of devices in its class already
have Apple might be getting ready to
refresh its Mac line of computers
according to recode the company is set
to unveil new machines on october 27th
it's been quite some time since we've
seen updated products in that department
word is will see a new imac macbook pro
and macbook air rumors about the new
laptops have been circling for months
including the suggestion they'll each
feature an oled touch strip near the
screen and finally instagram is allowing
users to see stories from those they
don't follow simply by browsing to the
explore tab the new stories feature
already has 100 million daily viewers
which is likely to go way up thanks to
this new addition you can stay up to
date with the latest by downloading the
cnet tech today app in the Apple App
Store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
