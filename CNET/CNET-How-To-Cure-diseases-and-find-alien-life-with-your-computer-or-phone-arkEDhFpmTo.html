you how you can save the world by doing
very little actually you've probably got
a computer or phone because it's 2015
and there's a chance you care about
technology because you're at seeing that
any way you can volunteer some of that
spare processing power for the greater
good first up download bow ink manager
oboe ink stands for berkeley open
infrastructure for networked computing
the app is available on windows mac
linux and android it's an open source
software for volunteer computing and
many different projects are built on it
you open up BOINC manager you'll see
this window where you can add a project
the first one I want to spotlight is the
Rosetta at home project it's run by the
University of Washington and it models
new proteins to take on diseases like
Alzheimer's cancer HIV and malaria
select Rosetta at home for the manager
and then set up an account the next time
you're not using your computer Rosetta
at home will run and help a great cause
what happens is thousands of computers
are working as one by aggregating the
power of these separate machines
progress can be made on these projects a
lot faster what about your machine will
it get slowed down by Boeing projects no
on a computer BOINC is installed as a
screensaver so when your machine's not
busy it will run ball weights
requirements are also pretty low you can
use a Windows machine with a 500
megahertz processor max only need to be
a powerpc g3 or higher you can also run
some of these projects on an Android
device to set up similar installed the
boinc app and select a project this time
let's search for extraterrestrial life
with steady at home it searches through
data from a radio telescope to find
signs of life millions of people are a
part of steady at home right now maybe
your machine is the tipping point to
finding aliens these are just two of the
projects you can contribute to here's
some more that use BOINC check out mine
modeling at home which tries to make
sense of the human mind a world
community grid where you can take on a
number of sub projects including mapping
cancer markers making solar technology
more efficient and decoding genomes from
a wide variety of organisms there you
have it how to make your world a better
place by being generous with your
processor for more how to's like this
check out how to tune a calm Amaya's
after and i'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
