9th
it's episode 314 of the 359 podcast I'm
BVG and I'm sick which means you get
treated to a severe case a sexy voice
which is appropriate because today
Alfred and Roger Chang are talking about
nudes yeah this is my sexy voice there
we go come on I'm gonna handle my sexy
I'm not trying for that I just have a
severe case of the plug yeah so we'd be
talking about Facebook's odd request for
your nudes and why there's a noble
reason behind it we're gonna talk about
Equifax and yahoo obviously obviously
Equifax and yahoo appearing before
Congress
Alfred listened in on the hearing give
us all the details and lastly 18 tees
deal to by Time Warner may be in
jeopardy the DOJ is asking for a
specific specific divestiture to get the
deal closed as always to give any
questions on the topics leave it in the
comments section Brian will get to the
best I will try to answer them in 3
minutes and 59 seconds well not much
ends I want to correct your semantics on
that when you say we're gonna answer
them in 355 podcasts we will get to them
in time in 59 and we will spend a
greater amount of time answering them
than that maybe I don't know hopefully
it will just stop anyways thanks for
sticking around we're gonna record the
podcast and we will be back and see in
the chat and 3 minutes and 59 seconds
from 3:00 to welcome to the 359 I'll run
darshan I'm Alfred Aang facebook wants
or needs but wait wait hear me out on
this one the social network wants to
make sure your nude photos won't be used
for revenge porn so it's asking people
to proactively send them in via
messenger the company will then convert
convert those photos into lines of code
so it'll block the image from ever
appearing on the site Alfred are you
gonna be sending your nudes to Facebook
I mean I send my notes to Facebook
anyway just get him to look at you guys
think you know where can I improve this
is cut I feel like this is very much a
Silicon Valley solution to this problem
send us your nudes so we could create a
vast database it's very robust very
robotic like
did where it just yeah we'll just get
rid of nude photos with you just give us
the nude photos and one person will look
at them and reportedly
I mean the at Facebook someone will have
to look at these nude photos to verify
that they are indeed nudes that need to
be included in so if you think that you
know oh no one's gonna see my nude
photos know someone at Facebook is still
going to see them which means that
there's a paying job out there for
somebody to just look at naked photos
yeah just I have to wonder how you even
request or how you even apply for that
yeah I do think what are your
qualification you know I've seen so many
nude photos in my time I do think it's a
noble cause I think you know revenge
porn is clearly a major issue for them
for sure but you know Facebook already
has you know algorithms that search for
things like nipples or right you know
penis is on there like being uploaded in
general right so I don't think they need
your photo specifically to blog yeah I
can't imagine this being very popular
just clear this is a trial in Australia
yes yep so it's not it's not national
like here in the US we're not sending
our nudes to Facebook yet unless you're
into it yeah all right so exactly this
from Yahoo and Equifax appeared before
Congress yesterday to again answer for
their respective hacks and as a reminder
Yahoo suffered the largest attack in
history losing three billion accounts
and Equifax arguably topped Yahoo by
losing 143 million Social Security
numbers so Alberti listen to hearing
what what went on I think the biggest
takeaway was you know they really still
don't know what had hit them to be fair
this was Marissa Mayer's first public
appearance to Congress like after it
have been revealed the three billion
number had been right all right and she
started off you know apologizing saying
you know I'm really sorry I want to
personally apologize to all of our users
effective which is all three billion of
them right that's a lot of sorry's
you're gonna have to hand out but you
know she said we still don't know how
the hack was caused the same thing can
be said for Equifax when they're talking
about you know a lot of the names and
Social Security numbers weren't
encrypted in the first place because
they thought that their firewalls were
enough spoiler they weren't but when
they asked the current CEO
he basically said I don't know if
there's encrypted now so it could still
be on encrypted so it's basically we're
sorry but we actually haven't done
anything to kind of get at the root of
this problem yeah that's very very
disconcerting the ad Time Warner deal
may be in jeopardy Justice Department
reportedly wants a teen teach advice to
divest CNN and possibly the broader
Turner Broadcasting properties to close
the time warner acquisition now this
comes after a president donald trump is
railed against CNN calling it fake news
leaving many to wonder whether he's got
some sort of influence over the DOJ with
this I mean it definitely does seem to
be something coming from the White House
on this because I've not heard of the
DOJ commenting on deals like this
usually it comes up with something of
Congress right well DOJ will come out
with a request for divestiture actually
that's pretty normal but the fact that
this is so specific mm-hmm
has people watching the heads wasn't it
wasn't was it CNN specifically or was it
Turner Broadcasting which also there are
some conflicting reports there there
there was a request to 418 T's either
divest DirecTV or the Turner
Broadcasting company's CN CNN was a
major part then but as far as I can tell
18 T's said no but there's a lot there's
still a lot of questions that Justice
Department still hasn't commented on
this officially you know 18 t did talk
about this yesterday said they never
offer CNN up as a an asset for
divestiture nor would they but that
could just be tough talk all right so
that's all the time we have for the
stories and more check us on SEANET I'm
Roger Cheng I'm out for dang thanks for
listening I love that song all right
thanks everybody for joining us the
podcast is concluded I'm gonna go in the
head and start digging through the
comments section for some good questions
and fodder for us to continue to discuss
and right out the gate Lost legacy as
the elephant in the room what's to stop
someone from hacking Facebook and
leaking everyone's news yeah the million
dollar question here Facebook does have
a very robust security team there I
think there's a reason why after being
such a massive target you know with all
these people on Facebook that
it still hasn't really you know there
hasn't been any kind of major leak or
anything like that from like Facebook's
database itself that being said so these
nudes they're not storing these nudes in
their database as like the photos
themselves so they're converting it into
basically code and then if somebody else
tries to upload that image that code can
match up against that image and then
like block it from being uploaded in the
first place right
theoretically couldn't you take that
code in reverse engineer I would have to
assume that space Facebook is a smart
company when it comes to security and
these codes would be encrypted mm-hmm
that somebody only on Facebook would be
able to access it that being said though
that's me assuming that they are a smart
company encrypts there because Equifax
had all this important data and it
wasn't it was okay so they were a pretty
competent company that's the company you
go to when you lose all your data
because they credit and yeah yeah from
no you know what would be crazy though
if you're like because this this whole
thing is stopped revenge porn right yeah
like image is that only the people you
sent it to are supposed to see what if
somebody at Facebook wanted to have
revenge on Facebook and then we know
that as a revenge on revenge now think
about it terrible last day right that's
not too far off considering what that
Twitter
absolutely trump account absolutely it's
like the revenge porn and all revenge
porn yeah just awesome and really this
only effects photos that you have it
doesn't you know you have no control
over yeah so yeah there are a lot of
holes in this like I said this seems
like a very like tech solution a Silicon
Valley driven solution to a a real
problem a legitimate problem I'm sure
there are other ways that we can do this
without having to offer up our nudes
let's talk a little bit about these
court dealings we've been encountering
as of late yeah I have thoroughly
enjoyed watching Congress truly put the
screws to some of these I'm gonna go
ahead and say irresponsible corporations
and their in their practices now do I
know how to run a giant media company no
obviously not I'm here
the buttons for another one but as far
as the responsibility at hand there's a
lot of people that should be held
accountable and should be punished
frankly with all of these massive
security leaks and social security
issues and I'm sitting here with my
popcorn and watching these court cases
unfold and I'm loving every second of it
well they're not they're not Court cases
ya know what I mean no but that's the
thing like it is cathartic to watch
these companies get grilled but
ultimately nothing really ever gets ya a
lot of times these hearings are really
just public spankings they're for
showing the politicians gonna say hey
it's like the monitor and feathering
it's a modern-day equivalent of that
people being locked up in the thing and
he was thrown to me at the gallows yes
yes that's still entertaining it's a
little satisfying but it just it is
frustrating because it seems like these
companies are really facing consequences
yeah there was a point during the
hearing yesterday where one of the
senators said you know we're gonna be
having even more of these hearings in
the future because there are gonna be
responsible companies out there and
unless we put in legislation that like
imposes a fine or some kind of
punishment for not having proper
security in place all we're going to get
is an apology and more hearings right
that's a great point there is no
enforcement mechanism so yeah but to be
fair though I mean Oh in their defense a
lot of these companies make a good point
where it's basically why are we being
punished for being victims of a crime
kind of thing but to be fair the other
argument is why you shouldn't have been
more secure in the first place right I
guess the argument is all right you know
it doesn't matter how secure your
company is at one point or another it's
going to be hacked yeah yeah I think it
comes down more to if if the if the
argument can ever be ignorant is no
excuse again the law is no excuses yeah
absolutely apply I think your
egregiously irresponsible like if you
don't at least put certain you know
protections in place particularly yeah
egregious yeah like like encrypting your
you know files or have updating patches
when you were told to
there should be stipulations in like
tracts with the executives like yeah he
owes the CEO who departed right Smith
yeah left with a huge paper yeah he
should forfeit some of them yeah
incompetence should be a factor in yeah
this job right that's clearly I think I
think of you if you've shown that like
you've made an effort to protect your
assets then sure you know you shouldn't
be punished for being the victim but
baby I'm but in that scenario when you
haven't then yeah that makes a lot of
sense
yeah one correction Leviathan points out
that it was the stocks not the gas oh I
don't want to call me I don't they do
hanging all right so devil's advocate we
talk about these these proceedings and
hearings and let's let's be honest this
is kind of the first where ever getting
into this this is a new field for a lack
of a better term I guess and maybe
that's why these folks aren't getting
immediately punished and there's no
direct consequence because we don't know
why what to do about it what do we think
is possibly the course of action in
future cuz now that we've kind of
learned how to set these standards in
the and and and the concept itself
starting to solidify what could come in
later years what inevitably happen again
I think it's about imposing security
standards to begin with not yeah
imposing security standards after the
fact like punishments for being hit by a
crime you look at how like ATMs now or
all have the chips on them right it's
not this magnetic stripes yep anymore
nearly all of them yet yeah but that's
because there was like a federal mandate
where it was basically if your store
like doesn't have the chip feature for
your 488 for you know credit cards or
anything I don't have the protection
necessary I got their info stolen like
you're the ones that have to pay for it
right yeah and then you know once that
legislation was put in place overnight
like all these you saw a bunch of like
check it like the point-of-sale
terminals also yeah it's over to chip
terms cuz all of a sudden I don't want
to be yeah and that's that's setting a
security standard to begin with not you
know oh they got stolen you're
responsible well you don't have this
like security feature in and then I got
I compared to come with the auto
industry
you know we have certain rules like
inclusion of seatbelts air bags these
are all these are all perks and features
and the government turned them into
mandates and like there should be some
sort of security best practice mandate
that all companies respect right well
unfortunately you have to kind of learn
the hard way and a lot of these things
though those until people started dying
in car accidents that they said sure
probably have seatbelts and airbags
that's not until somebody's entire
fortune gets liquidated out of the bank
that somebody can say hmm maybe we
should actually start putting up some
walls around the face but the thing of
it is is and this is just me that being
skeptical is companies hate regulations
and they've got lots and lots of
lobbyists why this process is so slow
right that's why having regulation like
this is tough to pull off we've got you
know there are deep pockets they're
arguing against it Oh America making it
great well we're working on it slowly
but surely it get it better hopefully
one day its collective effort its kind
of swing America is a great country the
USA any any questions there is a thought
on the table from Karen Jones that says
mobile devices should replace credit
cards to be honest oh now I don't know
how I feel about that now I'm it's I'm
completely torn what if your mobile
device goes dead that's my biggest
awesome how do batteries like they're
going out of style so if I'm at a bar
how do I keep my Bible on tab do I give
them my phone they will probably just
get my account leg accounting there's
got to be like a to our system you can
put in place it and that's done it's a
good point I mean the reason why Apple
pay why Apple was so late to mobile
payments was because they were waiting
for the chip technology that kind of
makes so it is actually as or if not
more secure than a credit card
totally but yeah there are some
practical limitations for just switching
wholesale to just your phone your
trading convenience for convenience
because yeah it's less crap in your
pocket but it's one more thing to still
maintain and consider like if you get
rid of your wallet great night carrying
a battery
yeah ready carrying a battery though
truth yeah I don't know I'm totally torn
on that one until they actually prefer
until they improve the performance and
longevity of a mobile device I mean I
owe that tirely that's a real name and
tech breakthrough I wanna seize and
batteries battery tech man you everyone
else yeah but the the longer they they
milk the crap batteries though the more
likely or to keep replacing them that's
true so we should just be able to
convert ourselves into batteries like
the matrix yeah yeah I want to do I'm a
battery all right that's the those are
some low aspirations
here we go here's a question from Watson
do you guys think a challenge may be
implementing security regulations
presumably it depends on the company
small business website wouldn't need to
have a high security of a yahoo for
instance yeah that's definitely the case
but we're right yeah as far as the
security concerns go we still don't know
exactly where all the fault lines are
don't even address that yeah and and
especially for small businesses
Security's like very hard for them to
handle and yeah in the past you know
something like ransomware wouldn't be
that much of an issue just because it be
we really only have like one computer
anyway but now it's getting to a point
where ransomware basically like a small
business like their whole like
operations could be on a computer and
like if that goes down it there it's
kind of like so they would pay there
they're like losing a lot of money on it
sure I mean I think it's tough because
particularly for small businesses
because yeah I'm savvy right yeah some
mom-and-pop shops not gonna but yeah
Yahoo ever brought up Bri ah who and
Equifax I brought up an interesting
point where so yesterday they Congress
is basically asking you know what should
like Congress do to you know prevent
these kind of breaches in the future and
things like that
yeah and instead of you know saying oh
there should be legislation to you know
require security standards or anything
like that they kind of went with we
should work together to find the
criminals like after the fact
okay maybe don't get hacked in the first
a lot like what Facebook Google and
Twitter said yeah it's almost not
regulations we should also work together
yeah it should be more kumbaya moments
really yeah which is like I feel like
it's easy athlete because it's they
don't want to bring up regulation now if
we don't wanna bring up regulation so
something to talk about you know working
together cooperation those are all good
word they're all BFFs yeah they're all
one they're all positive sounding words
so you know be constructive send us your
social security numbers and we'll
protect it a lot of code and nudes we
send them along together really that's
what we call though that was kind of
back with faxes you know operate
operations where it was they had your
social security number without your
permission and if like right like credit
monitor yeah yeah where if it was used
somewhere else they'd they'd warn yeah
right so you know just take that into
note Facebook sometimes that doesn't
work yeah and it all starts here with
Alfred calling out Facebook this is
where the change begins all right the
revolution begins with one person the
revolution begins with Alfred mad about
things yes you are sir as a true
millennial should be yep all right and
then that note we are just about out of
time and I think it's a good place for
us to end on a revolutionary uplifting
and no yeah for the week yeah change
