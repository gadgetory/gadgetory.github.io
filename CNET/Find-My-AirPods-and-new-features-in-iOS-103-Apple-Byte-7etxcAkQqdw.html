Apple buy for everything good and bad
inside the world of Apple this week it's
all about the software after Apple
released the fine my ear pods feature
for locating your lost earbuds in the
iOS 10.3 developer beta release now to
show you how it works I'll hand it off
to my extremely good-looking friend
Brian Tom thanks Brian all right check
this out in the iOS 10.3 developer beta
Apple is finally added the find my ear
pods feature everyone kind of joked
about it when they were first announced
but I'm gonna show you how you use it so
the first thing that you'll want to do
is go into the Find My iPhone app and
open it up we're gonna assume that
you've already synced your air pods but
let's say you've used them and like you
don't know where they are like like
where where are they oh yeah they're
here okay so let's just say you took
them out you put them down now on the
Find My iPhone app you'll see a list of
devices your air pods will show up if
you want to find them you want to click
on your actual air pods it'll show them
on a map and then it gives you the
general approximation of what area they
are again they connect through Bluetooth
and not the cellular connection so you
can't be very super specific but what
helps is if you click on the actions you
have the option to play a sound so I'm
gonna play a sound it's gonna start off
soft but get a little louder as time
goes on all right so there's that sound
you can then stop playing them I located
my air pods and there you go
the other caveat about this is if you
have the air pods in the case and
they're closed it actually closes off
that Bluetooth connection so you won't
be able to see it it will just show you
the last known spot that you left your
ear pods in the case but that's kind of
a really a quick way to show you how to
find your ear pods using the developer
beta again this is not available to the
public just yet but it will be soon
and there's your sneak peek for iOS 10.3
and find my ear pods back to you Brian
thanks Brian
all right the 10.3 beta also includes a
few new tweaks there's a new Apple ID
profile option that's at the top of the
settings that shows all the devices
you're signed into and links to services
like iCloud the app store and family
sharing in the iCloud section you know
get a breakdown of how the storage is
being used in maps there's an icon you
can use to 3d touch and expand the
weather forecast and push and pop into
the weather app and iOS my 3 beta has
been updated using Apple's file system
it's their new modern file system that's
optimized for flash and solid-state
drive storage and features stronger
encryption space sharing and more
it replaces the over two decades old
hfs+ file system now this is only
available for developers right now and
will likely get a public beta release in
the near future and the latest Mac OS
ten point twelve point for developer
build finally brings nightshift to the
Mac I've been using flux for at least a
year now and it's done a great job but
nice ship first appeared in iOS 9.3 and
changes your screen from that cooler
blue tint to a more yellow tint now at
night staring into the blue tinted light
of a screen really confuses your brain
to think it's still sunlight out it can
actually disrupt your natural sleep
cycle making it harder to fall asleep
and stay asleep
and you know right now a few you just
thought I didn't know that no kidding I
didn't know that well thank you Brian
see I told you now you can use Siri to
turn night shift on or off it can be
toggled in the Notification Center or
found in the System Preferences in the
display section and the rumored theater
mode for the Apple watch looks to
finally be coming in watch OS 3.2 it
hasn't been released yet but apples
notes indicate it will be part of the
update theater mode will mute the sound
of the watch and disable the raise to
wake feature that turns on the Apple
watch screen with an arm movement see I
already have the theater mode active
right now so you check it out I call it
the I haven't charged my Apple watch
because I don't always use it mode and a
more Apple watch news patents granted to
the big a describe how they could use a
modular watch bracelet to bring more
functionality to the wearable it could
range from anything to health sensors
additional power or cameras similar to
that camera watch band that I arrived
about but you know what let me just take
a moment to talk about the camera watch
band I was all about it you saw it I
told you to get on board
but I reached out directly to the camera
team and found out that it will
only handle video messages not a live
video chat similar to FaceTime or Skype
I want to be real with you all so I
cancel my order until they bring that
real Dick Tracy type functionality
because that's what I wanted in that's
what we'll take the Apple watch to
another level also in a correction from
last week many of you pointed out that I
continue to call Intel's processor line
cabbie Lake instead of pronouncing it
correctly as kV Lake and for that yes I
deserve a bad apple hi little boy what's
your name hey Tyler you really liked
that didn't you
all right last week I asked for some of
your thoughts with the new MacBook Pros
because I want to include some of your
real experiences on this show for others
now Kent hurt says he's very happy with
it his 7 an hour a battery life is great
and he replaced a 2012 MacBook Pro with
the new one but opted not to get the
touch bar Venis Patel loves the larger
trackpad and it does everything as well
as far as the student life is concerned
but Venus admits it comes with a pricey
tag Venus also asked to be featured on
this episode by asking please so hey
Venus it worked now Ron cron event sent
a detailed email but some of his
highlights include a disappointing
battery life on his 13-inch MacBook Pro
wit touch bar that's only about five or
six hours and Ron says it feels no
faster than his 2015 MacBook Pro Ron
also said the touch bar seems really
cool at first but its usefulness is
limited so that's really a mix of
responses and I think a lot of you also
depend on what laptop you had before you
got the new one okay let's end this on a
high note I like to feature the Apple by
nation I received this picture from yang
santamar√≠a who says tell me I look bad
with these yang you look bad with those
but did you really take a picture of
yourself inside the restroom at work
Brooke come on all right that's gonna do
it for this week's show you can email us
at the Apple bite at cnet.com or to me
at brian tom thanks so much for watching
we'll catch you all next time for
another bite of the</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
