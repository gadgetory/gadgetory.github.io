gate but this ain't no SUV BMW 328i is
one of only a handful of wagons you can
buy in the US today Americans just don't
seem to like wagons even more so than
hatchbacks but let me tell you why
wagons are great so following the wagon
tradition this BMW sports wagon is built
on the 3-series platform and that's the
same thing they build them m3 on which
adds legendary performance so of course
this car is gonna benefit from that it's
gonna have great hand boys so now at the
same time we've got all this cargo space
back here this is a gun with the rear
seats down can hold 53 cubic feet so
wagons are a great blend of practicality
and performance
now BMW only sells this sports wagon as
the 328i or the 328d which is the diesel
model now that means both only come with
four-cylinder engines and xDrive is also
standard on this model that means it's
got all-wheel-drive now let's go take a
look under the hood now under the hood
here we have the latest example of BMWs
2-liter four-cylinder engine they use
this engine and everything from the 1
Series Coupe to the x3 SUV all the way
up to the 5 series sedan now this engine
have some great technologies in it it's
got a twin-scroll turbocharger which
cuts down on turbo lag by having the
exhaust gases from Soler's one through
three spin one scroll and the exhaust
gases from syllabus two through four
spin the other scroll all that gives it
more power to BMW also uses direct
injection on this so that sprays fuel
directly into the cylinders give it a
more complete burn that contributes to
efficiency
all this technology helps decisions
without 240 horsepower 255 pounds of
torque for efficiency this engine does
22 miles per gallon city 33 miles per
gallon EPA rating now let's check the
cabin test
BMW has all sorts of great tech features
for the 328i you can get adaptive cruise
control automatic parallel parking
even a head-up display which I'll show
your speed and some navigation
information on the windshield right in
front of your eyes this car doesn't have
any of that BMW sent us a totally
stripped-down version no cabin tech
options at all so this is as base as you
get even as bases you get though you do
get this screen here this LCD up here
which without the navigation option
shows you the stereo stuff and the
telephone and all that so but use this
iDrive controller down here and go to
the telephone menu got an iphone paired
up to this thing so I can see my my
phone book and I can dial numbers using
this iDrive controller go back to the
main menu and I've got my radio item
here and that will give me am/fm HD but
it won't give me satellite radio because
and that's an option in the console here
I've also got this Y adapter it's got a
30 pin iphone connector on the side and
then also an aux input in a USB port
here it's kind of old-style I hate these
things because they don't work with the
newer iOS devices they don't have the
lightning connector so you actually have
to use another adapter on top of that
and the sound quality really starts to
suffer with that so I'm really surprised
BMW still uses this on a 2014 model now
I could also get some app integration
here play online sources like Pandora
and MOG and stuff like that and even see
Facebook and Twitter updates on this
screen here but that's an option not in
this car see a trend here
I'm console I've got the shifter this is
a standard BMW shifter for their
automatic transmission this is an
8-speed automatic it's got the standard
I push forward for reverse pull back for
drive push it to the side for manual
mode and sport gate and next to it I've
got this rocker switch which takes me
through the different drive modes
I've got Eco Pro Comfort Sport and Sport
Plus now if I move it down to Eco Pro
that's going to get me the best mileage
I can actually set some of the
parameters for that on the screen here
now climate control is going to be a big
shock on your fuel economy so this will
actually detune the climate control a
bit if you can get away with it it's a
nice way to get yourself a few more
miles per gallon this car actually has
the dynamic handling package so that
means it's got an adaptive suspension so
I can choose whether to have the chassis
go into sport mode and the drivetrain go
into sport mode or have them both of
course I'm gonna have them go onto both
sport mode for drivetrain and chassis so
right now I'm in Eco Pro Mode and I
pulled up to a stop put the brakes on
foot brake on stop and the engine shut
down that's the idle stop feature that
they have on this car to save you gas in
the city so as soon as I lift off the
brake pedal the engine got a coughs and
picks up again but now I flip the rocker
switch to sport mode and suddenly the
throttle gets a lot more sensitive
even just holding the throttle steady
and switching at the sport mode I
suddenly feel this little burst of power
here because the car is letting me get
away with more with this throttle
letting let me do more with it so yeah I
really like that adaptive suspension
because this I feel makes the car become
more like what I expect of BMW also of
course got the 8-speed automatic
transmission and to complete the whole
sport mode settings I might want to
throw this over into the sport gate it's
not a super aggressive sport mode I
found it's okay it'll let me keep the
engine speed up a little more especially
when you drive it hard you really press
down and of course I've also got the
transmission in its sport mode right now
but I can also use the paddles to on the
wheel here to shift it manually there's
a little bit of automatic transmission
torque converter lag but generally it's
pretty good the best thing I found about
this car that I like this has
electrically boosted power steering and
I really like the heft of the wheel the
wheels got really good weight and really
good response I like that part of it and
they think you know that's gonna be your
sort of rubber meets the road part of
the car when you're driving it you're
really gonna feel that and notice that
is the central BMW ness
of the car
now obviously I like wagons and I've
been a BMW fan for years but I'm not
crazy about some of the stuff the
company's been doing lately they've kind
of instituted sort of a a pay-to-play
model now with this 2014 328i sports
wagon its base price is forty one
thousand four hundred fifty dollars
fortunate this one came with that $1000
dynamic handling package that gets you
the adaptive suspension and also the
sport steering system that helps the
handling quite a bit too
this car also has an M sports package
that's $3,850 that adds a few handling
features a few sports stuff but also a
lot of cosmetic stuff I don't know if
I'd get that so let's start over with
this car to do it up CNET style well I
first would definitely still have the
dynamic handling package I'd also add
the technology package that's three
thousand one hundred fifty dollars and
that gets you the voice command the app
integration even the navigation system
so that'll give you a lot of the cabin
tech that you want I'd also add the
driver assistance package which gets you
a rear-view camera that's nine hundred
fifty dollars kind of pricey but good to
have and on top of that I'll also add
the Harman Kardon audio system $850
that's gonna make the stereo sound quite
a bit better and finally for those long
highway trips I'd add adaptive cruise
control that's $1,200 option so all-in
were just over 51,000 dollars still kind
of pricey but this car is going to feel
like a BMW and it's going to have seen
that style technology
