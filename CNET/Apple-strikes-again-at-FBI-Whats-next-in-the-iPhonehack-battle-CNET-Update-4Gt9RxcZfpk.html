just getting started I'm Bridget Carey
this is your scene that update a
historic legal fight between Apple and
law enforcement is heating up it all
started over one eye phone but the
impact of this case goes way beyond one
phone it could shape the future of all
computer security determining if
corporations can be ordered to do
hacking and computer forensics at the
government's request apple filed a
formal legal response to the court order
that it needed to help the FBI unlock an
iPhone that belonged to one of the San
Bernardino shooters the 65 page filing
opposed the order with Apple arguing
that the court is violating its
constitutional rights under the first
and Fifth Amendment's apple says what
the government is asking it to do is too
dangerous unprecedented and is a
boundless interpretation of the law
Apple's lawyers argue that this would
not be a one-time situation this isn't
about giving the government a secret
master passcode that it had all along
you see Apple was asked to have its own
engineers write a new type of software
to put on the phone to break in and
Apple argues that writing computer code
is as protected as free speech since
this code would be destroying the secure
product that Apple originally created
Silicon Valley is coming together to
support apple on this Microsoft's chief
legal officer has said Microsoft
wholeheartedly backs Apple in the fight
and it's going to file an amicus brief
to the court in support facebook twitter
and google also said they would do the
same at an annual investor being held on
apple's campus friday CEO Tim Cook told
shareholders in attendance that he's not
afraid of a fight with the feds and the
five hundred or so shareholders in the
room were giving standing ovations to
Tim Cook showing support to Apple so
what is next the government can respond
to apples objections by March 10th and
Apple could have the last word with
another statement by March fifteenth but
everyone is coming to court on march
twenty seconds so that's the data watch
a federal magistrate judge will hear
both sides
and make a ruling that's it for this
tech news update and you can stay
up-to-date on all the developments as
