in your kitchen but rest assured that's
just this Sultan Harley Pasternak
blender it was developed by a fitness
guru to compete with high-end models
like Vitamix and Blendtec at a much
lower price and the specs stack up well
it has 1500 watts of power and a 67
ounce jar both of those are roughly the
same as Vitamix and Blendtec models we
tested but those models cost four or
five hundred dollars this is two hundred
and fifty so that's a really appealing
price but here's the bad news this
blender is much slower than the
high-powered competition you'll also
have to help it out with tougher tasks
by stirring shifting the speeds around
to get the tougher ingredients down
towards the blades and its really a pain
to get thick ingredients out from the
bottom of the jar and like I said really
loud if you have the patience to wait it
can do everything Vitamix and Blendtec
can it made a nice creamy pesto it even
turned whole almonds into almond butter
and pulverize the whole block of cheese
it does ship with this tamper if you
need help keeping ingredients moving and
rounding out a nice feature list it also
comes with this to-go cup so given the
price I'd lean towards this model over
Vitamix or Blendtec but I wouldn't pick
it over the ninja Ultima which also
makes high-powered blending affordable
and outperforms this guy still the
sultan Harley Pasternak blender is
confident enough to be worth your
consideration just spend a few extra
bucks on ear plugs to go along with them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
