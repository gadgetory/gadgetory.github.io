Sentra seems to have picked up some
lines it also lost a lot of weight shed
a little power and picked up some Google
tech that's a pretty good set of
headlines for 2013 let's drive this 13
Sentra SL and check the tech now if
you're wondering why the central looks
more upscale but can't put your finger
on it it's basically one word Infiniti
DNA Nissan's been bringing a lot of
these styling cues it's a basic look of
infinities inside a mount down into the
Nissan line from the Infiniti brand and
this car has shown a dramatic change
because of that now inside the Infiniti
touches continued not a ton of them in
this price class but the gauges are more
infinity like everything's much more
grown-up in here than you typically saw
in a Nissan and check this out they must
be watching my videos they finally did
something to improve the maps by the way
the navigation rig as you can see is SD
card based lots of car makers are doing
that now I think Ford was the first but
now everyone's getting on board now to
have navigation that means we have this
six inch nissanconnect head unit this is
optional you won't have this for sure
you'll have a 4.3 smaller LCD if you
really go bass on one of these cars this
is let's start off with that navigation
system and one of the things I like
about the way this thing operates is
it's very quick partly because that SD
card partly because they've obviously
got enough processing power behind it
now where this units really cool and
really dopey is here when you go to
these Google functions we have Google
send to car and more interestingly
Google POS points of interest let's do a
search let's just say I'm gonna go
something generic like a pizza joint and
I start my search what's gonna happen is
a phone call is gonna initiate on my
connected paired device this thing does
not use the data connection per se as
much as it does what's basically a modem
connection over the voice network as a
result it's slower than hell
I've sat here and watch this thing take
literally minutes to go out do the
search pull some results and then
ask the rest of them and worse than that
once you get to a result you're
interested in it doesn't have that nice
rich contextual stuff that Google's
known for where are the ratings where's
street view I can see a map but where's
all that stuff a couple of their gripes
on this you cannot enter anything in
that Pio I google window while the car
is moving that means the passenger can't
either that's a fail and voice command
does not tie into the Google services
everything else but not that so it's
basically a pull over and use it
experience for results that I find not
worth it now on to our media sources all
the big boys are here with the exception
of HD radio we've got satellite radio AM
and FM single slot CD above it right
there and under aux you rotate through
several modern sources including your
iPod or USB device I've got an iPod in
now tagging looks fine you've also got
Pandora support though it will not work
on my Android phone for whatever reason
and you have bluetooth streaming as well
and the meta tag support on that is also
quite good oh by the way the Bluetooth
support on this guy also includes text
message handling and you can type in a
handful of custom text message replies
so you can actually send something back
that makes sense in your words a lot of
cars give you can replies that are so
generic you'd never actually send one
now one choice on the gearbox this
controller right here is for your CVT
gearbox which is the only way to go in
this vehicle no gate notice that no
shifter paddles but you do have a sport
mode button over here which is going to
change some powertrain performance and
shift points and throttle response we'll
check that on a road in a minute back up
camera is part of a package that we'll
talk about momentarily and it's pretty
straightforward you've got the ability
to turn on and off some guidelines
there's no multi-view there's no
trajectory it's basically distance on or
distance off but at least it's in there
that mentions the top the Sentra's
actually lost a few horsepower since
last model we had a pretty petite motor
here a 1.8 litre inline-four with
nothing real tricky about it no turbo
charging no direct injection just a good
old modern inline 4 but at 130 horse and
128 foot-pounds of torque those numbers
are pretty modest which yields great mpg
30 39 while getting this twenty eight
hundred and fifty pound car it's about a
hundred and fifty less than the outgoing
model up to 60 in little under 10
seconds not sprightly but not a slug
either we'll see how it actually drives
on the road and as you can imagine it's
front-wheel drive only no all-wheel
drive option or anything like that let's
go see how that transmission that sport
mode in that eco mode all work on the
road
now on the road and right off the bat
you're clearly aware this car is tuned
for economy and not any kind of
performance even though it's got a sport
mode and we'll try that out in a moment
a Nissan generally does CVT as well this
one does well although CVTs sometimes
can get caught on their own flat-footed
nests that doesn't happen often with
this it's still about as good as they
get in the industry so Eco mode you hit
that and you feel a noticeable deadening
of the powertrain response it's as if
the pedal wants to think for a minute
and let you think for a minute do you
really want to use that gasoline to
accelerate right now well you stay on it
and eventually will deliver same thing
goes for deceleration it starts to
really kind of become a non decelerating
engine very little compression braking
switch over to sports and use have a
real difference in the throttle
responsiveness how it holds higher rpms
there aren't really shifts on a CVT the
way there are in a geared gearbox but
it's still the same engine there's not a
lot of SAP in there so that's kind of a
silly mode to me what you should
appreciate about this car that's
understated interior good sight lines
better than most all the way around nice
hyeri greenhouse a very well balanced
ride it's not a sloppy ride at all even
though it's not a sporting undercarriage
and it's built real solidly at least off
the factory line like this
look this entrance it's a nice place to
sit while you're doing your commute and
that's 80% of what 80% of cars have to
do
okay let's place this 13 central we have
an S sale here the top trim to start
with 20,000 for delivered two packages
to go see net style first add in premium
1200 bucks that get you a glass moonroof
and the upgraded Bose audio I would do
that's a fair price here is the one you
have to get the navigation package it
gets you navigation obviously a six inch
that touch LCD that we saw they had such
great response the Google services for
better or for worse bluetooth streaming
text message support Pandora support
backup camera for 650 bucks what I
thought it was a typo put me left off a
one or even a two and it wouldn't be a
bad value but it's 650 bucks this Sentra
is a nice car all-around nothing about
it stands out in particular but it's a
very little everyday car it's a
tremendous refresh and when you get it
with that navigation package you feel
like you stole some tech legally</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
