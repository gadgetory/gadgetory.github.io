to the apple pie for all the good and
bad inside the world of Apple now I
first wanted to congratulate my producer
Jamie and I'm sorry guys but she is
officially off the market and is now
married to her awesome husband Philip
lie and you know I'm so happy for them
Jamie I'll always be the fish that got
away gross I just didn't want to reel
you in okay that's fine I get it onto
the show and Apple held their 2013
shareholders meeting which is normally
uneventful but a few nuggets of info
came out of the meeting CEO Tim Cook
addressed the company's future saying
that he's disappointed in the falling
stock price but Apple is committed to
their long-term strategy which is what
he's supposed to say now cook also said
they're obviously looking at new
categories they don't talk about them
publicly but they're looking I'm Apple
TV and I watch now the other news nugget
Apple's spaceship campus plans have been
slightly delayed with a move-in date
still targeted for around 2016 it
appears building a tractor beam is the
cause for the delay also in iPad 5 news
and we tend to follow the Chinese case
manufacturers lead Chinese market
Alibaba has ipad 5 cases available to
order featuring similar design cues from
the ipad mini with holes at the bottom
edge for the Lightning port and speaker
grills now one unknown feature is the
hole in the top center area which is
different than the microphone hole at
the top edge and I actually think it
could be a breathing hole now Ali Baba
has a reputation for releasing case
designs early that were accurate in the
past and the surrounding rumor mill is
evidence that it's pretty clear will see
a new design well that and the fact that
everyone knew it would be the new design
right after the mini came out now in the
iWatch watch a patent discovered by
apple insider revealed that apple is not
only looking into a wearable device that
has a flexible touchscreen but it would
also have the ability to conform to a
user's body through the use
of a slap bracelet mechanism guys that's
not thinking different that's thinking
90s the patent also describes it as a
wearable accessory device that can be
easily worn on a user's wrist or other
body part and I know where I'd put mine
on my wrist now let's check out a few
apps of the week we've got two for you
we're checking out first up you want to
check out the new photoshop touch app
for iphone and android it's a little
pricier at 499 but it has a lot of
photoshop score features like support
for layers advanced selection tools
adjustments and filters now it's easier
to use on a tablet but it's pretty
feature-rich here for mobile phones and
it's worth checking out now the other
RAB you guys should look at is Amazon's
Cloud Player app and it's free I'm a big
fan of purchasing my music through
Amazon with DRM free mp3s and now they
have an app that allows you to access
that library on your iPhone easily so
all you have to do is buy your music
from Amazon's website sign in and voila
all your music is there well except for
the Backstreet Boys that was just
downloaded for the purposes of this demo
alright let's check out the quick fights
according to NPD data imac sales in
january surged up thirty one percent
year-over-year as orders have picked up
steam even with multi-week weights
through their online stores also Major
League Baseball is increasing its iOS
passbook support from for stadiums to
almost half of all MLB stadiums in 2013
which is good for passbook and sports
fans plus samsung also announced their
own version of pass book called samsung
wallet for event tickets boarding passes
and membership cards as well so this
space should heat up a little this year
and the leap motion controller it's the
3d motion tracking device that's
compatible with macs and pcs will go on
sale for 79 99 with a mid-may delivery
date so it will also be interesting to
see how that product develops over time
but really this technology is pretty
sweet and finally guys let's do a little
giveaway because we've got nothing but
