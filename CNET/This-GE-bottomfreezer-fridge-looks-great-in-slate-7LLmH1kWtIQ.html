appliances in their home but GE offers
appliances in this slate finish here
this is the GE GE two one e MK es and
it's a slate finished bottom freezer
that offers twenty point nine cubic feet
of interior storage space
now the appeal of a slate finished
appliance like this one is that you get
that slightly higher end look better
than white or black but it's not quite
as shiny or as fingerprint prone as
stainless steel so if I put my hand down
here and rub it around you see it's not
leaving many marks it's a lot better
than a lot of stainless steel appliances
that we test on the inside you've got a
good deal of space but not as much as
you might get with competing fridges
from names like LG whirlpool and Kenmore
but we still have plenty of room for
groceries and room for five out of six
of our large stress test items I
especially like these indoor shelves
have nice and deep and they have plenty
of room for tall items like two-liter
bottles and the six pack of beer lots of
storage space in the door I also like
how well this fridge performs if you
take a look at our heat map you can see
a lot of blue a lot of good accurate
temperatures with the sole exception of
that bottom door shelf not a big deal to
have a warm spot in the door like that
and then at the coldest temperature
setting no hot spots at all very very
good performance this slate bottom
freezer retails for 1650 we found it
marked down to closer to 1450 so you
might be able get a discount that's
about middle the road for bottom
freezers you might be able to find a
better deal on other competing models so
shop around but if you like this fridge
and it's slate finish its worth
consideration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
