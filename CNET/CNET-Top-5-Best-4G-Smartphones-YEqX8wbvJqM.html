smartphone is going to be 4G but the
question is which one sides meant not
being Apple that's not even possible
right now there's a whole lot to choose
from
I'm Brian Cooley here to help with the
top 5 4G smartphones according to see
net editors ratings number 5 is the LG
spectrum it's got the formula LTE 4G
dual-core processor four-and-a-half inch
display and HD video in and out you can
just about take that entire menu for
granted with all the phones on this list
and the spectrum hits them all part of
what makes it on the bottom rung of this
ladder though is the somewhat
inconsistent quality of calls and photos
and we found the way that LG skins
Android to be interesting number four
the HTC Rezound
aside from those usual smartphone super
phone features here we've got an 8
megapixel camera pretty cool and
built-in Beats Audio technology along
with an included pair of Beats earbuds
on the other hand this phones a chunky
piece of work and call quality isn't its
best quality still it's a strong phone
for Verizon subs and for those who want
to hear music more than folks calling
them number three the Samsung Galaxy S 2
skyrocket four and a half inch screen
the skyrockets got great technology
behind it it's a Super AMOLED plus
that's code for relatively incredible
it's also one of the very few phones out
there that has an NFC or near field
communications chip so it's ready for
those coming swipe to pay services
everyone's gaga about now this being an
AT&amp;amp;T phone we're a little concerned
about the pace of their 4G rollout so
check that in your area first because
nothing will make you look dumber than
having a 4G phone with 3G service number
two the Samsung Galaxy Nexus on Verizon
this phone almost needs no introduction
to phone geeks it's the first in the
u.s. to run the red-hot Android 4.0 Ice
Cream Sandwich and does so on Verizon's
well-regarded network that's a pretty
serious one-two punch other phones we'll
get to 4.0 soon
even by the time you see this but we're
also a little puzzled by the lack of
Google Wallet Wireless payments support
in a phone so loved and favored by
Google okay the number one 4G smartphone
we love and remember iPhone not
available as 4G yet is the Droid RAZR
MAXX
you'll want to make friends with the
brawny towel guy if you buy this one
because it takes hands that big to grip
this scene that editors choice but
that's because it's unique and its
passion for battery life it's got a huge
battery built-in we got around 20 hours
of call time and about an equal amount
of non-stop video playback on a single
charge
that's coast-to-coast three times
without plugging in call quality was so
good some folks told us they didn't
believe we were on a cell phone or
couldn't even tell when we switched to
its speakerphone no worried battery life
and great call quality to things you
gave up on years ago they're back ok for
all the reviews on these great 4G phones
many others that come out all the time
and eventually 4g iphone check out the
cell phone section at cnet.com i'm brian
