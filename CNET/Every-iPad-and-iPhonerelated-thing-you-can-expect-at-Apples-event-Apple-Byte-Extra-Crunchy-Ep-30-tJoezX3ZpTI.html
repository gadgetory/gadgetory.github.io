apple byte extra crunchy thank you so
much everyone for coming in and
listening a lot of people are starting
to watch us live as well as actually
watching the video version which we just
decided to put up as a complementary
piece yeah it was just kind of a thing
that we were like we can do this easily
so why not just give it to them video
and audio again this show is all about
you and you'll see that call us at one
eight hundred 61 62 63 eight that is our

and yes we accept bad apples as well yes
because we know there's a whole lot of
them try to keep your call around 30
seconds you'll be part of the show and
you can find us on tunein soundcloud
youtube live stream we're just come over
here San Francisco maybe we'll let you
in the studio maybe holler alright let's
get into it we want to set things up the
March twenty first event is a few days
away for people that listen to this
after March 21st I'm sorry you're
screwed but like we have expected 9.7
inch ipad pro iphone SE bringing back
the 4-inch phone but when we talk about
the 9.7 inch ipad pro according to 9to5
mac it is expected the starting base
price of this new ipad will start at
five ninety-nine making it the most
expensive 9.7 inch iPad Apple is
released at least as a base price
come in a 32 gig and 128 gig capacities
the ipad air 2 is expected to still
stick around although the inventory
levels of that are gonna probably
dwindle and it will most likely go away
but that will be your 499 iPad I don't
know if Apple's gonna drop the price on
that maybe even 4 49 it might you think
they might show a little love that
hopefully hopefully cuz that's that's a
very expensive starting price I mean
after you get applecare LOL hacks you're
looking at close to eight hundred dollar
what about a case what about days and no
other 45th we know this one is supposed
to support the Apple pencil oh alright
yeah baby that's one thousand dollars
you better come you better come with it
if you're gonna get the 9.7 inch ipad
pro but we know it'll have a smart
connector so that you can use a stocky
with the Apple keyboard smart keyboard
that will be sized appropriately for
this 9.7 inch ipad it also have stereo
speakers and a better camera than the
ipad pro we've talked about this but the
new news from this story is that 599 is
expected to be the starting price point
it's a little a little high for a
product that people I again for 32 gigs
to that's not much again nothing tells
me that this is gonna move the needle
for Apple in any way shape or form when
it comes to iPad platform now they're
just it's like almost just like
maintaining what they have now you know
just you know minor updates you know
they were there will be thank you for
pointing that out in the periscope is
there will be LTE options so that's
typically I think another additional 129
yeah on top of the base price plus the
monthly you know your monthly service
visit 32 gigs is a good starting base
but again these art at these are tablets
it should it should be 32 I 16 in the
past has been the starting point if you
want to argue that going from 16 to 32
and the tech advancements is a one
hundred dollar price point it's worth it
that's fine you can it be dope if they
put in 64 oh yeah but right now I'm on
Apple iOS devices 128 gigs is the
highest storage you've seen people been
requesting why doesn't Apple give me 256
my phone I don't think we'll see 256 in
a phone
time soon so don't don't hold don't
don't hold on to that idea the other
product that we expect to see the iphone
s ii now reports are saying that the
design is pretty much identical to the
iphone 5s the main difference right
people have been trying to figure out
how grooved or how sharper these edges
be 95 mac is saying that it'll pretty
much be the same design except that the
edges which were had that mirror finish
on it before oh yeah which i actually
thought was really tight it looks nice
yeah they will be a doler finish which
will prevent it from getting scratched
up cuz that pretty much was what allowed
that thing to be the most scratched up
phone of all time yeah totally when we
solve all times look horrible when I was
done with it it looked like poo poo I
poo poo um also it will include a 12
megapixel camera 4k video we've talked
about that a picture of the packaging
that is rumored to have leaked out it's
confirmed and this is i think is i'm
gonna talk about this in a second it
confirms a 16 gig based storage also
will have NFC for Apple pay but look
Apple needs to wake up you are telling
me that you are still packing 16 gigs on
a phone that has a 4k camera with no
expandable storage a for a full if
you're loading your phones with 4k
cameras moving forward you cannot have a
base storage capacity of 16 gigs no I
know that's what I do that it if you
shoot one video then you're done so I'm
just telling Apple right now fine you
might think it's cute and fancy to do it
with this iphone SE or five SE or
whatever it is wack but change that when
you do the iphone 7 give us a minimum of
32 i would say 64 because really now
these days were with memory storage it's
not that much but apple's gonna make
their margins so let's say let's start
at 32 let's just just hope that apple
can at least do that if they release an
iphone 7 with a 16 gig base storage you
know who's throwing out bad apple baby
many bad apples haha how you like them a
little help them with apples on the
stage destroyed that that would that
that would just be stupid um hands-on
videos have been shown off
to kind of reveal what are these rumored
cases they fit closely but not perfect
to the 5s but again some of these leak
cases are actually we don't know how
official they are so just totally be
just just a mock-up case yeah yeah just
a mock-up case so we'll see what we'll
see what happens nine if I Mac says that
the at least from what I recall that
reporter that the case it should
actually still work with the new se so
that we'll find out again Monday March
the 21st then announcements start at ten
a.m. we'll have our live coverage
pre-show post show at nine a.m. pacific
time alright this is also cool for those
of you who purchased any Apple TV and
have been asking me on Twitter where
where's the Apple events app I don't see
it apple recently just threw out their
apple event to live stream app so it's
now available in the TV OS app store it
is free you can watch the event on your
TV which hey you could do though yeah
it's it's nice you could do that with
the previous Apple TV but people were
kind of getting a little nervous they're
like uh what but I would have to say
that you want to listen to our coverage
first yeah our coverage is so much more
funny bomb or pretty dope we just have
more fun than they do it's like you and
I talking in the shooting it and then
two ladies you're lucky you're gonna be
here Scott style be on the pitch you
know we tried it I know it sounds silly
but the best way I describe it to people
it's like the pre-show of the super bowl
and the post-show the super bowl but
much better yeah I don't know we do a
great brian Tong does a great play by
play you know it's funny mean i just
read the blog yes we read the blog which
show pictures you see Apple used to let
us use the live stream of the show I
always thought was the most effective
when we do our talkie-talkie then we
could show the live stream so people
won't leave and then we do our
talkie-talkie after well what what ends
up happening is there live stream messes
up or people can't find it when they all
come to us so we welcome it we welcome
it we welcome you with open arms all
right um also in addition to this Apple
TV nugget I love this one did you did
you see the sonic the hedgehog yay
remastered now available on the Apple TV
the Apple TV so it's an app you can use
the apple remote um I'm curious how well
it works because the requirement is that
all games have to use the apple remote
but you know you what am I gonna slide
my finger back foot how accurate is
Sonic the Hedgehog Sega Genesis remember
when they um man someone's gonna correct
me but they used this term to advertise
it that the Sega Genesis was the best
console because i had like high-speed
blast processing that was their name for
like to show that our consoles really
fast it just a made-up marketing term
but sonic the hedgehog really started it
all um a reportedly Sonic 2 and Sonic CD
will be available later this month
that's awesome check out Sega yes Sonic
the Hedgehog was known as like the
fastest video game at the time right
yeah high-speed blast process I serious
someone look it up someone look it up
and can be like dude that's what it was
called I swear I kid you know I didn't
look it up before this cool this popped
up in my mind all right just a little
update to the Apple versus the FBI story
a report by the New York Times talk to
they said about a half dozen of apple's
engineers and they say according to the
report that if the FBI wins its court
fight which hasn't yet to be decided and
they're requesting to force Apple to
help in unlocking their iPhones the FBI
may run into another roadblock Apple's
engineers the employees are already
discussed seen what they will do if
ordered by law enforcement authorities
to help some of them say they won't do
the work while others may even quit
their high paying jobs rather than
undermine the security of the software
they've created this is according to
more than half a dozen current and
former apple employees some of their top
engineers that specifically designed i
OS have been around the team since the
ipod these are veterans that know the in
and outs one of them is specific to the
bug fixes and can identify them they
would leave which the report also claims
would make it hard for them to even kind
of build this new what they're referring
internally to as a as a government iOS
yeah loved gulped govt TOS well they
just want
just stick with FBI OS it's so much fat
oh yeah it is that is good FBI oh you
like that yeah I do like that I made I
made it up but of course everyone else
made it up but I did come up with it
yeah so all these guys are like security
you know programmers and their jobs are
very high in demand so they would be
easy for them just to leave and go get
hired somewhere else look yeah a lot of
them are saying you know it's very
interesting the article is that it's
fundamentally offensive to their core
principles and think about as an
engineer in security whose job your
whole life has been like to make sure
this is secure and then someone tells
you to not make it secure anymore it's
it's almost fundamentally thinking
backwards like you just can't wrap your
head around here like what and then they
also said it would take up to 10
engineers about a month or so to do this
that's a long time for for employees to
be working on a project you know so I
don't know fundamentally look yeah i
like everyone makes different analogies
they said one of the analogies in the
article was saying it would be like
asking a doctor to administer a lethal
injection which is a little extreme yeah
i would like to compare it more like
asking me to put a black streak in my
blonde stripe that way that is how
important this FBI Apple cases that
would ruin the integrity of the blonde
streak therefore diluting my brand and
my hair you see you should do that for
halloween next year make your all your
hair blonde and then a black streak I'd
be amazing oh yeah higher OS fire OS
anyways this is just a interesting
article good read on the New York Times
how Apple internal has already talked
about how they would resist if the court
order goes in favor of the FBI yeah my
favorite part about this article is that
it refers to Tim Cook is Timothy D cook
his full name which I think we should
just start to referring him ltd cook
Timofey Timothy D Cook said today we can
calm Timmy d-md timid day today also
there's a full transcript of Tim ed
cooks interview with Time magazine it's
a long long article there there aren't
really any major nugget
two parts from it other than the fact
that you know he calls it like a
nightmare it's a struggle Apple didn't
come up with this decision lightly there
were multiple people on all levels in
the room that made this decision and why
he won't back down again it's a long
stretch a long story you but go ahead
read if you want you can check out time
magazine's website I think they have the
full transcript there as well for you to
was Steve Jobs ever on time magazine's I
know the movie had a big deal but he was
on it right he was on it so originally
when Apple announced the first I believe
it was the first it was the mac and they
they had a generic persons like the
computer with the person of the year
yeah yeah the computer was the personal
year and it was supposed to be him yeah
and he just went H just went bananas so
whenever he was alive today and he saw
Tim Timothy D cook on that cover he's
been on time be oh yeah new jobs has
been on sometimes I remember him there
was an article when the when the first
imac came out that kind of had the neck
he was on there is it was the inspired
by a sunflower the actual design you
know that was that mac that I'm talking
about the imac it was an imac and i had
old screen and a neck and then like a
semi-circle base he also i believe was
on time to when he passed he was also on
time i would guess if I had to guess how
many times Steve Jobs had been on time
magazine it's probably been on it three
or four times in his life someone can
call in and correct me on that but I
think if I like visualize what what I've
seen probably three or four times he's
been on if he's been in a few magazines
the adjustable neck imac was pretty pimp
oh just a few well let's just pull up
like every single one I know that's
quite a lot so check out the Time
magazine article in other news around
apple and this one is around the actual
cloud a report from VentureBeat says
Apple has been planning to build its own
cloud they're calling it project McQueen
now this is this is the motivation
behind it for the past several months
Apple's been working on this again
project McQueen to really try to become
more reliant on their own data centers
and infrastructure because right now
it's
really talked about much but might like
many services that are on the web there
they pay amazon web services or micros
microsoft's azure cloud service to
provide that and deliver the content to
us that we need but Apple hasn't been
happy with little column amazon i don't
want to calm AWS just amazon's web
services because it hasn't been able to
load their photos and videos on to users
iCloud iOS devices as fast as they want
they feel like it takes too long so one
of the solutions would be to build their
own infrastructure like many other
companies have a I believe dropbox is
one of them that got off of using
third-party web services and then built
their own Instagram i do feel i
Instagram did that did this as well
originally they were on some of these
third-party services but as you grown as
you scale up there's a point where they
can't support them as much this would
also be great for apple's music are and
TV subscription service quite honestly
yeah so fine apple looking to develop
this their own they say that if they did
build their own infrastructure it would
cost wise they'd be able to pretty much
cover the cost for it to run in three
years after that and the conversation
kind of came up between a Microsoft
employee and an apple employee after
they talked about how Apple's growth
would prevent Microsoft from continuing
to support them at that same level so
apples I maybe we should build out our
own so Apple is looking this is not a
guarantee that it's happening there have
been talks that have been plans but
there's nothing specific there has been
no no actual buildings have been put in
a place for this project McQueen but
Apple clout Apple runs a lot of services
on iCloud some work better than others
mm-hmm it's all right could be better
amazon the Amazon Web Services have
problems to occasionally like I think
during the last major hurricane in New
York they went out for a while or some
some there were some disruptions and
stuff they can't go down yeah sometimes
like AG hour yeah and everyone just goes
crazy when that does but uh that's what
Apple's thinking but even kind of
something you always hear the term I
you can read the tea leaves see the
future yeah I actually saw aimed you
know that I'm catching it with Harry
Potter right now I've never seen the
actual movies oh really so I got to
number three and it just appropriate
that there's like a scene where it was a
prisoner of azkaban and he's reading the
tea leaves in the cup do you remember
that part not okay it doesn't matter
it's really rough it but Google just
scored a huge win against Amazon Apple
is now a customer with Google they've
reportedly signed a contract that's
according to Business Insider worth
between 500 I'm sorry excuse me worth
between 400 million and six hundred
million dollars to use Google's cloud
platform taking that business away from
amazon it's not clear if this is an
annual price or a total value of the
contract but it is known that this money
has been taken away directly from what
they would have normally spent solely on
amazon web services wow so thick Apple
is definitely doing some things
transitioning their services on the
clock on cloud platforms or maybe it's
not a sexiest stuff but this is kind of
some of that stuff behind the scenes
yeah so uh should we get to voicemails
yeah let's let's uh let's do that let's
do that please got some voicemails today
from some of our fans remember everybody
all listening in 1 800 61 62 63 eight is
the number you can call and you guys
continue to flood us with more and more
we you did say what people call in just
say like they love the show yeah we've
got a big college people saying we love
the show we're like you we appreciate
but we just we aren't gonna play that
that's like it's like isn't it such an
ego show to talk about how many people
love your show I know we just get
hundreds like hundreds of emails
thousands almost you know took me like
all after to call all it's just so much
anyways we appreciate the love guys and
gals um but yeah let's go to jump into
our phone calls okay this is bernard
from chicago from outside Chicago hello
Brian Steven this is bernard outside of
chicago um i absolutely enjoy you guys a
show I have two questions maybe you guys
can help me my first question is this
what is the direction of Apple when it
comes to visually impaired tech for
visually impaired people it seems like
Apple is coming out with all these
phones are no buttons um and all that
kind of stuff so I just wanting it their
stance is still the same as it used to
be you know business as usual when Steve
Jobs was alive or testing has changed um
I'll have a second question my bad okay
yeah that's that's dude don't worry you
don't have to say sorry to me it's not
like you're running the entire show in
switching cameras anime playing audio
clips and messing with audio levels at
the same time yeah you had a second
question but it cut off so my bad too
bad all right i believe it was it
Bernard right was Bernard I guess what
up B so I would say and this is not a
bias but historically Apple has arguably
been the phone with the best
accessibility options for a touchscreen
phone they haven't done anything really
drastically different from that
standpoint but they have you know some
of the features they have beyond just
being able to change the contrast being
able to zoom into the screen with three
fingers so you can see things a lot more
easily there's also this feature called
switch control access where think of it
wherever you wanted to touch kind of a
square appears and appears on each app
and kind of goes down the line and then
you can basically say when you want it
to select that so if you went to the
settings you could actually essentially
do it without having to really press too
much they have extensive accessibility
controls I'm obviously not the best
expert but I would say most most people
have told me that they do have the best
accessibility features it just comes
down to which ones you use specifically
but I haven't heard of them making any
drastic moves I think even from the past
iOS 82 iOS 9 there weren't many changes
to that but it doesn't mean that they're
slacking on it so yeah I have a friend
who makes his text like huge on a screen
you can like make your text really big
and bold and stand out and then also
last week it's not totally related but
last week we had a call from a guy who
said he uses the iPad to see things that
you know because he's not he doesn't
have very good eyesight so he
the iPad just to see and read books oh I
don't know that's kind of unrelated but
it's interesting i would also input in a
guard domoi on periscope did remind me
that what I was talking about with a
switch control feature you can actually
like like turn your head left or right
to some make selections oh really based
on that switch control i was talking
about so just imagine looking at your
home screen and the box is going around
each app and it's time it's going like
dunk don't know you can turn your head
one way to select it and then turn her
and then just kind of like shake your
head the other way to go back to the
home home button it's so it's there
there's but there's a variety of
different things like that so it's a lot
of just check it out just just check it
out okay next call is Sonny from
Louisiana hey guys my name is Sonny I'm
from Louisiana my question for you is
this now that Apple has announced is
coming out with the iphone SE do you
think that iOS 9.4 is going to include
an update for the iowa arms art to the
iphone 5s thanks guys love the show just
recently started watching on YouTube
made up I love you yes I love watching
on YouTube thank you uh you know the
update to iOS the iPhone 5s is basically
let's see how many generations at five
s6 success it'll it'll still get some
support I don't a lot of times you may
not necessarily get all the same
features from a standpoint of just from
hardware alone the iphone SE is going to
have Apple pay on it you're not going to
be able to do that the iphone SE is most
likely going to have the hey Siri
feature I don't did my phones okay I'm
on my phone is that off because there's
an m9 processor in the SE that is not
going to be available in the iphone 5s
most likely the software will work but
you just won't be getting any major
features that are supporting it
sometimes though i would say whenever
phone is around that three to four year
range although Apple has improved that
it's not always the best thing to just
do the update you kind of want to wait
it out and see what people are saying to
see if it is really working for them or
not so cool cool all right we got one
more call from Shamar in hotlanta here
we go
hey what's going on guys was gonna be
chillin what's going on btz this is you
boys Shamar from Atlanta hey oh I'd have
a bad apple and it has to do with what
I've seen as far as with the sony
playstation view I'm a little upset
because I bought you know i bought the
apple TV the new application when it
came out you know and I know that the
live broadcasting service was available
at that time but now seeing with sony
has done I'm like what is the problem
you know I think apples level of hubris
here is this is ridiculous Sony managed
to actually make a comparable package
that if my particular company wasn't
already providing a good service because
I used to be a core cutter I would I
will flock to this this is the this is
great and I'm just a man i guess i'm at
a loss while Apple could not secure the
deals for their live broadcast service
and you know I don't know what specific
features that they were going to offer
her this only is not but this this makes
me almost wish that I hadn't upgraded
the pucks it just that's all I just had
to get it off my chest it was just like
a knee-jerk reaction to seeing it I'm
like you got all these good pricing
tiers a robust set of channels better
sling TV and I'm like dude this is isn't
there's no reason why Apple could have
done this so that's all enjoy show guys
thanks thanks Jamar are boorish Marsh
MLK champ from jamel 2k depending on
what what platform you're on a hundred
percent agree have been saying this
since the beginning of the year if Apple
does not get their TV subscription
service in place by the end of year
it'll be a huge fail they've got to
Sony's plan starts at 29 99 it's always
been really good but if you look at it
it has all of the core stations you
basically want everything from like ESPN
TBS TNT CNN is like it has an e that's
all this other it has AMC it has
everything it literally has a core i
think it's around like 50 the base model
plan is around 50 channels it goes up to
like 75 and then like or 70 and then it
goes up to 100 channels but it goes like
from 2999 to like let me see here
real quick here um goes from 29 yeah so
2999 for the 55 channels 3499 for 70 +
channels 4499 400 + channels and you can
also do some additional add-ons that is
cheap dude that is Rudy dollars or
thirty dollars for a legitimate TV
streaming service that's awesome and I
think one of apples things is they want
to be able to incorporate some sort of
DVR functionality but right the the
network's like no we're gonna we're
gonna give that to cable comes I think
that's one of those things but again
other companies have done it we've said
this before in the past on our keynotes
sling TV hazards although not as robust
as PlayStation view now sony has it and
Apple has nothing that's just the
landscapes for a bad apple right that
was with Shemar wanted a bad out how he
