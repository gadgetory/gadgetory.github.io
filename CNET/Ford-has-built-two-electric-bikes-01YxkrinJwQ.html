for to make a bike but it has four it
has two experimental electric bikes here
at Mobil or Congress 2015 let's take a
look so for it has two electric bikes on
show here they called the ford mode me
and the mode pro this is the mode pro
it's aimed more at businesses while the
mode me is more for everyone to use
so both bikes share the same basic
electronics and because they're electric
bikes what that means is when you're
pedaling you'll get a little bit of
extra thrust from the motors this is a
200 watt motor it's got a nine amp hour
battery and in terms of how long that
would actually last for tells me that a
bare minimum you could get is one hour
thirty and that's how much battery juice
you would get if you were cycling
continually uphill so another thing
that's really cool about these bikes is
that they've got loads and loads of app
control and that's through Ford's mode
link app and you can see your phone
sits on top of the bike just here so
this app lets you do loads of
interesting stuff you can do things like
turn the lights on and off you can turn
the indicators on and off and you also
get haptic feedback so that's a
vibration through the actual bike
handles when for example the navigation
tells you that it's time for you to turn
or when maybe a car gets too close to
the back of the bike because there are
proximity sensors in the rear so again
this is all experimental for now but I
really like the design I'd love to give
these things a go so here's hoping that
soon Ford turns them into something we
can actually buy I'm Luke West we've
seen it for much more checkout cnet.com
