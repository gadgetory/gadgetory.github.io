you're wrong
hello my name is Domo and this is a suit
or a s60 14 a server and boring is no
way in its vicinity and that's not
because it's fine where I'm talking
about now first off this is a poor bein
a server meaning it can host up to four
hard drive to offer up to 16 terabytes
of storage space it's very easy to
replace or insert the hard drive through
this front-facing drive bay up here it
has a small LCD and four button for you
to eat right with the server and now
here there's a USB 3.0 port and a button
to work as a quick backup solution on
the back the server has another USB 3.0
port and four USB 2.0 port and also to
eSATA port that's the most amount of
port ever seen on a four billion a
server and you can use those port to add
more storage to the server in case the
16 terabyte is not enough you can also
use those port to host printer or Wi-Fi
adapters the server come with two
gigabit ethernet network ports you only
need one port to make it work but it can
you both at the same time for either
load balancing failsafe or performance
enhancing purpose and now comes the
interesting part of the server which is
its web interface and you have to use a
computer to appreciate it and by the way
if you feel robbed by the fact that I'm
using Windows on a Mac Book Pro
well don't that's because I'm dumb no
after all and you're not now the web
interface is what it used to manage a
nest server to launch a web interface
you either use a shoe store control
center software or you can't just point
the browser to his IP address once log
in you'll be greeted with something very
familiar you see these icons here that's
right it looked just like those on an
iPad and they work very much the same
you can run multiple app at the same
time and you can also minimize them into
small button on the taskbar up here and
on one end of the taskbar you see
there's a button clicking on this will
minimize all opening windows if you
notice it worked very similarly to the
show desktop button on a windows
computer now on the other
tosspot their shirt button using this
button you can quickly shoot for an apse
or a setting up the server and quickly
jump to it without having to scroll
around if you notice this work very
similarly to the spotlight feature of
Mac OS on each pin you can store up to
15 icons but you can create more pages
and move the icon between them you can
even name the pages to your liking this
is a great way to arrange apps overall
this is a a new and very nice and NASA
experience and the apps actually worked
out very well my testing for example the
download center apps is one of the best
that I've ever seen you can actually sit
for what you want and start downloading
right away by clicking on it
you can even save the surgeries to now
this download center Eric probably the
reason why the 16th a bar is not enough
for some of you out there and I know
claiming now performing why this asustor
server is excellent it's one of the
fastest for very NASA where I've seen on
the market poor thing consider I think
is totally worth is Sri Prize which is
about seven hundred twenty dollars now
for more on how good it is make sure you
check out the full video stay calm and
when you're there
follow me on Twitter Facebook or Google+
so there you go this has been the first
look at a shoe store a s60 14 app server
and by now if you don't believe that it
is interesting well you are wrong and
that's because I don't know and somehow
it feels great to tell people that they
are wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
