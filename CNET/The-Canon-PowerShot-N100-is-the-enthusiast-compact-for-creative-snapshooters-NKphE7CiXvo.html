makers when it comes to point-and-shoots
but every once in a while one of the
manufacturers steps out and decides to
take a risk on something new such as
this the canon powershot and 100 i'm -
called Malusi net and while the N 100
has quite a bit in common with canons
s120 enthusiasts compact the N 100 is
more for snap shooters who want better
photo quality and shooting performance
with this you get the S 120 s larger
than average 12 megapixel BSI CMOS
sensor a 5x zoom lens that starts at a
bright f-18 aperture and a 3-inch
90 degree tilting touchscreen but
instead of the s 120 s manual controls
in raw capture you get things like a
creative shop mode that automatically
creates five different versions of a
single shot using different color and
tone settings and crops and styles and
also you get hybrid auto that captures a
few seconds of video before each picture
and then stitches them all together into
a movie there's also a new story
highlights mode which creates a 2 or 5
minute highlight reel of photos and
movie clips that you can individually
select or have the camera automatically
select based on events date or person
and then there's this second camera
that's only purpose is to stick your
face in the corner of photos you're
shooting you get other modes - to
experiment with and Wi-Fi and NFC though
that's a bit underutilized and well this
thing is definitely feature packed for
its 350 dollar price tag you can read
the full review at cnet.com but unless
you really like the sound of it's novel
features you might be better off with
the S 120 I'm Josh Goldman and that's
the canon powershot and 100</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
