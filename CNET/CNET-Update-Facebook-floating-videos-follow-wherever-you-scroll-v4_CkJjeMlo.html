wherever you scroll I'm Bridget Carey
this is your CNET update Facebook really
wants you to watch more videos but it
knows you're also impatient and you want
to scroll away after hitting play don't
feel bad it's not your fault
social media has given us all some sort
of screen attention disorder where we
feel this compulsion to keep scrolling
but have no fear Facebook has come up
with a cure now you can click an icon in
the video to have it pop out and float
on the side lingering in the corner as
you continue to scroll floating videos
may have you in awe but the Internet is
going nuts for an app that promises to
alert you when someone unfriend you on
Facebook the app is called who deleted
me and well as I stand here recording
this report it's not working the company
has not returned our email to confirm
why but a post on Facebook seems to
indicate it's having server troubles it
may not have been able to handle the
surge of new users from all the coverage
it's getting it's an app for Android and
iOS and it's also a Chrome browser
add-on it's designed to monitor your
friend count and list who unfriend you
now normally on Facebook you'll never be
notified if someone unfriend you the
only way to know is to visit their page
and see that you were both not friends
now if you don't want to see someone's
post anymore but you feel bad about on
friending them you could always just
change your settings so they don't show
up in your feed and honestly I can't
recommend downloading an app like this
that taps into your account to monitor
activity history has shown us that these
types of apps just end up causing
headaches
remember Snap saved it saved all
disappearing snapchat messages but that
was a security nightmare that resulted
in a massive online leak of private
photos while Twitter also has a new
feature that I cannot recommend you now
have the option to add your birthday to
your profile which does a few things for
one it tells Twitter your age so you can
have advertisements targeted to you if
you publicly share your birth year it
makes it easy for someone to steal your
identity and it also adds balloons to
your profile on your special day
yay balloons okay now here's some tech
to really get excited over you can soon
buy a real star Trak communicator
modeled after the
from the iconic 1960s original
television series Enterprise it's really
just a bluetooth handset for your
smartphone acting like a portable
speaker for 150 dollars it also comes
with a little charging stand it debuted
for the San Diego Comic Con this week it
won't be min to our galaxy until January
of next year no word though if this
version is going to be able to transmit
on subspace frequencies that's it for
this tech news update there's always
more cnet.com from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
