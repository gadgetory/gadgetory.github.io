a Facebook event that started as a joke
and turned into something way too real
even if you've never heard of Naruto
you've definitely seen this goofy run
from the anime if you're not familiar
with it here's one of the runners
explaining it so you just bend your body
forward and then extend your arms in 30
degree angle 30 degrees and then you
start running the anime trope became a
running joke because of how prominent it
was in the show how ridiculous it looked
and the people who seriously ran like
this thinking that would make them
faster well more than 900 people said
they were attending the event on
Facebook but only about 20 people showed
up in Central Park I decided to join
them because I've always wanted to be
part of a living meme I hopped on the
train to Central Park got warmed up and
I was ready to go
it turns out the majority of people who
clicked attending the event did it as a
joke here's to the handful that actually
showed up and ran</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
