wall and if you don't then you're forced
to ask where am I gonna put my sound bar
it's a pressing issue but Samsung has
something that could solve the problem
it's the sound stand it's a pedestal
that actually sits underneath the TV and
pumps out noise now this isn't a
completely original idea there are
already some other audio companies
making things like this but Samsung's
offering is quite tempting inside there
are two woofers two mid-range and two
tweeters it will connect over HDMI
optical or Bluetooth it looks quite
chunky but it doesn't take up that much
space it's only 35 millimeters thick and
it will support TVs in the 32 to 55 inch
size range the sound stand certainly
seems capable of making a real racket
we've tried turning it up playing a
movie here and it's definitely very very
loud but of course these are crowded
trade show conditions it's not exactly
the best place to be testing audio so
we'll wait until we can get this into
the review labs for the definitive
verdict there's no price to release date
yet but in the meantime while we're
waiting why don't you let us know
whether you would buy something like
this
I'm the West Road CNET at CES 2014 with
