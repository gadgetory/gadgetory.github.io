studios it is Monday October 2nd
I'm bvg and we are here for episode two
ninety two of the three fifty nine
podcast and on today's show we've got
Alfred in Ben Fox Ruben and David Katz
Mayer is back again thanks for coming
back yeah you know I feel like I was
just here there's like so much streaming
news I know well you know it's it's it's
TV time is there can you even say
whether you know if there's gonna be
even more coming out on Wednesday during
the Google yeah I I don't know I mean
they always release they've last couple
years they released chromecast 2015 and
then chromecast ultra last year I'll be
curious to see if they want to update it
I don't feel like they're going to just
cuz we haven't heard anything okay well
for this show we're gonna be talking all
about Roku the streaming family got an
all new update we'll also be discussing
virtual credit card skimmers with out
Freddy wrote that story over the weekend
and then we'll wrap up with the SNES
classic edition hopefully somebody out
there got one and we'll discuss that
without further ado yeah one David oh
yeah let's let's get to the podcast send
in your questions and comments BVG we'll
get to as many as you can at the end of
the show and let's go and we'll be
recording the podcast back in 3 minutes
and 59 seconds from 3:00 to welcome to
the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred
hang and wait Katz Meyer I was gonna
intro you that's okay I'm gonna do it
anyway with us for a second time in a
row is David cat's in the cradle Katz
Meyer our epic TV reviewer there you go
you got it anyway we brought you back to
talk about the new lineup of Roku
devices which ran from $30 to $100 yeah
what are the big changes here really
there's only one new player among those
five the other four we've seen in review
before although they do have bumped up
processors but the one I want to talk
about is the streaming stick plus the
new $70 stick that goes right up against
the Amazon fire TV just rolls off your
tongue oh yeah oh it goes yeah
yeah so those are the two kind of big 4k
HDR streaming sticks coming out this
year it's the cool new addition is this
remote that can control your televisions
so it's got buttons on it for following
the power the programming so long well
you know they've had it forever on other
devices for example cable box controls
but this is the first time streamers
have had it I think it's just an extra
expense that nobody wanted to add but
they're putting it even down on the $50
non 4k streaming stick and it's cool
because you know again one remote
controls your TV volume and power you
know I need to reach for the remote and
you can probably leave it in a drawer
for the most part I was thinking about
how frustrating that was the other day
where I had like to turn the volume down
but I couldn't find the other remote
yeah it's oh you poor baby yeah I know
that happens to me all the time it still
it's like such a first-world edge oh
yeah
so for anybody that has a Roku or
another streaming box right now is there
a good reason to upgrade like what would
be a good candidate for an upgrade um I
mean maybe somebody that got a new TV
and and you kind of just you know
cascade them down you know put the older
streamers on the older TVs and put the
the new nice one on the new one new TV
you got otherwise you know some people
are annoyed by their older streamers
sometimes the Netflix app isn't updated
or you know it goes slower or maybe
you're sick of Amazon trying to push
stuff in your throat for example so
there's a lot of different reasons to
get something like this and they're so
cheap you know at the end of the day you
might go oh it's a great gift just put
on my list yeah I'm thinking of
upgrading just to get the extended Wi-Fi
range you know if it works at all yeah
did you actually notice the amped-up
processor they always say it's like 5 X
7 X 15 X faster I did just because the
old was so slow
so the original Express the $30 entry
level device is hella slow the new one
is like super fast which means it's kind
of like it takes the place of the
streaming stick which was really fast as
my new recommendation because it's 20
bucks less and by the way does
everything you know all the apps and
everything and it's it's cheaper so it's
it's kind of the new go-to it was so far
out testament full in a little bit roku
choice well um switching gears alfred
you wrote about virtual credit card
skimmers what are those so you know how
they had credit card skimmers already at
your ATM where when you you know people
like stick hardware onto it then you put
your card in and it's deal with your
card information now that's gone like
virtual so in the same sense you know
instead of them having
go to every a team and pudding-like this
piece of hardware on it and then going
back and then extracting it a research
firm had discovered that basically there
had been several hacking campaigns
against you know major banks most of
these are overseas I haven't seen any
attacks happen in the US yet but
basically they'll hack the bank like
either through phishing some kind of
exec there and then install the skimmers
on all of their ATMs at the same time so
there was this one campaign in Croatia
in like January 2016 where basically it
made like 1.3 million euros before they
were was there wasn't it 13 but I might
have been in it yeah yeah yeah they but
they ended up making a lot of money is
there anything the consumers can do
about this it's really hard to detect
when it's a virtual skimmer because it's
literally exactly the same thing as
yours but I mean there there's been
things that people have been able to do
for Hardware skimmers a company called
spark fund came out with an app called
skimmer scanner a few weeks ago where
basically a lot of these skimmers use
like a Bluetooth chip on it so it like
purposely seeks out this Bluetooth chip
and if it detects it it you know there's
likely a skimmer around you so also we
wanted to get to the NES classic edition
which went on sale SNES classic sorry
what did I say NES classic that also
existed went on sale this past Friday
and the meaning console was probably
like sold out in all sorts of places but
David you got one yeah well actually I
think you might have as well I did not
go oh you didn't go I didn't I didn't
show so we all went seeing it as a posse
kind of went down because the Amazon
treasurer truck was right there we were
among lucky few so it's you know it's a
it's a really cool $80 you know a device
that has all these games built into it
you know and I'm pretty excited to play
some games from my childhood you know
Super Mario I'm not that excited I spent
the weekend playing a different game so
you know I'll go back to it you know and
and maybe it'll be a cool thing around
the holidays with the family coming
sounds good if you want to read more
about these stories check us out on CNN
I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm alfred Inge and I
am David Katz my thanks for listening
your catchphrase now you were waiting
for that you were waiting for that
though had a real damn time I told you I
was gonna intro you you know there was
comments on that in the last episode of
like yeah I'm here because I heard the
whisper on the podcast I would say what
happened did somebody stub his toe no
it's now you have we have to stumble
over each other every time you're on the
show yeah well you know what this is
David I'm David I'm David I'm David I
just want to do all the intros
that's fine connect can I do that
everything's okay Gigi
all right I don't know he's so good at
it known that all right I'm gonna start
farming the the comments section for for
any good questions but David what game
were you playing that wasn't the SNES
you just dropped like a hundred dollars
on its oh no way I mean come on you got
to defer I mean I'm a one game guy I
can't read more than once
it's called divinity original sin - it's
a game that I'm actually acraman wrote
an article about it recently about our
popular is on Steam I was there before
the article but it's just it's over the
top isometric since Martin first cast it
at first
exactly so those it kind of gives them
into recently it's like a little bit
like a baldur's gate old school type RPG
yeah but see see ya know well actually
it's I'm running on a PC but I'm
complaining with a controller which is
my preferred tactic so I plugged the PC
into the TV and play a 65 inch PC games
with a controller from my couch sorry
I'm gonna stop now
well um but yeah it's fun it works great
even though it's an isometric with a lot
of control and crazy inventory and all
that stuff that the controller works
awesome yeah what's the first game
you're planning on playing on the SNES
classic Mario World of course I mean
come on yeah recently like played
through it again yeah nice nes classic I
was telling Ben this where I felt like I
didn't need to get one considering that
I can get all the games I wanted to play
already on a yes plus the Raspberry Pi
that I have at home about the games porn
yeah and I'm like I don't I don't care
for that so you know I you know I'm not
a guy that just like likes to get
something to show something off and
that's what I feel like this that's me I
feel like so much of the music industry
was that for a long time now not so much
but you know your comment on vinyl
records or something no not so much for
vinyl records but if you just repackaged
like Greatest Hits or stuff like that
and you made it like a really impressive
package or a box set remember there's
EVD boom box at boom the TV box alkaline
item because people reason enough to get
it or last like six weeks but there was
a big deal so is
Nintendo cresting off of that general
feel of you know I felt that they've
been taking like the the streetwear
approach to this or like the Jordans
approach where it's like oh we're gonna
make it like limited supply so it looks
like it's really rare and then all these
people want to come and like buy it and
it's like really good marketing for them
yeah well not only that but like the IP
existed from yet twenty or twenty or to
me I'm like that's like the only reason
why they have such limited supply for it
like that because they want this kind of
like Jordan's like appeal to the which
are also collector's item if people
aren't buying Jordans because like they
make you like they're better to play
basketball in they're not I would I
would really be interested in the
GameCube mini console which by the way
the Gamecube was already pretty tiny
again with and and when the Nano they
got a fine line to walk because with the
NES classic them you know by all
accounts it was much smaller inventory
than this and this is kind of like they
decided all right now we're gonna beef
it up we're gonna try to avoid some
backlash yeah I I would the Gamecube
like mini console would be the only one
that I would buy maybe that or like a
and n64 only because you know you can't
really do like Virtual Console like
GameCube games that well and like if you
if you want to do like dolphin emulator
that's like you you actually need like a
decent rig for that well both of those
consoles I wasted so many hours of
exactly which is why those were I I
played those too so so often and
considering that we've got the NES
classic and the SNES classic now and
they have been really big heads yeah the
likelihood of those additionally many
consoles coming out seems pretty
significant I think at least a 64
they might cap it after that though
because then it becomes contemporary
when did the class I was in high school
on the Gamecube came out it's been a
while I still that feel like that might
be right on the edge of what you would
call the the concurrent generation of
Nintendo consoles of video gaming
consoles I know it's only what was at
fourth gen that was fourth gen something
like that
yeah and I know that's that's relatively
far back now but still I think it's more
associated with like gaming today than
gaming of yesterday it's also like
hitting a demographic people of a
certain age you know like that's those
the games that I grew up playing was NES
and SNES and it's like I don't really
care that much about the GameCube game
so it's like you got to hit the window
of when those guys have a disposable
income the biggest reason why I'd
appreciate a Gamecube Classic though is
if they you know started selling Cape
doom controllers again just because like
those are optimal for playing Super
Smash Brothers on definitely and yeah
wait a minute was it the GameCube
controller or the n64 controller that
had like the three prong that was 64
that's the Batarang
controller that I liked a lot the the
Trident you like the 64 controller yeah
yeah yeah that was great for Super Smash
Brothers I hate it I was god yes I have
three hands so it was perfect for me all
right do we have any Roku questions or
any other questions in the chat we do we
have some great questions
Josh Buddha asks David is it worth
getting a Roku if I already have a
chromecast depends on whether you want
to use a remote to SH as opposed to your
phone which I yeah I used a chromecast
for a little while and using my phone I
found to be yeah I will say this I swore
by chromecast for a bit but it became
really like annoying whenever oh my
phone is dead alright and I can't watch
anything now that's kind of silly yeah
and and just having physical buttons
means you don't have to look at anything
besides your television screen and to me
that's like a great you know a single
kind of concentration as opposed to you
know driving around on your phone oh I
just got a tweet
oh wait somebody's calling me oh yeah I
gotta figure out well not only that but
like you also don't have to unlock your
remote every single time you have to
change you want to change the channel or
well you can put the stuff on the
lockscreen for some of them but yeah
yeah at the end of the day I think the
remotes more convenient I broke down and
put just one of my old iPhone
fours threes I forget what the hell it
was let's turn that into a universal
remote I just park that dock near the
table or like Matthew dacher says and
our buddy I as in house they're they
swear by the Harmony remote yeah yeah
that's what I use at home and again it
controls a Roku doesn't control a
chromecast so you know you're you're
you're kind of one of the other I mean
it's a valid argument that the
chromecast has a lot of you know
features especially the app updates
usually come faster you know to the to
the mobile apps that the chromecast uses
then for example something on a Roku
where they got a you know brew up
something new for everything but Roku's
really good at keeping up to date so
David while we're staying on topic at
the Harmony remote Matthew doctor says
he's sick of the or my problem with Roku
and other sticks is a lack of IR control
how or others handling that problem with
universal remotes well in Leon Harmony
yes so harmony again does a great job
because they have IP control built into
the hub and it can control Roku's it can
control playstation 3 you know stuff
like that that doesn't have IR you know
I don't know about other devices cuz
honestly in the remote control game
harmonies kind of the beginning and end
they're the ones that have the most
technology and and do the greatest for
sales I think there's other guys you can
go to CVS and probably have a remote you
know from the from right behind the cash
register there but at the end of the day
I always recommend harmony and they've
they've done really well for me and and
that control of stuff that doesn't have
IR is is one of the main things or you
could just you know get a device that
has an IR receiver on it but those are
getting more more rare I mean that's why
I hated using my Roku like the the
really old rogue before though weird
like okay that's not working that's not
working right I gotta aim yeah yeah now
it's like you know you can go across the
house or whatever and a Harmony app
works pretty good too so yeah I've been
using my app as a controller a lot more
and I will say I do appreciate the
chromecast more only because I can cast
stuff on it that's not like from YouTube
yes or anything like yeah you can put
anything or screen your you know
whatever you want to put up there
there's no option like that for right
well they have mirroring but it's in
beta and it's been in beta for I think
like five years so they don't really
care that much about it their main thing
is Dedinje for the actual apps on the
box or the dongle it's fun for them the
Donald the dongle Roku would all stick
this time by the way no no dongles it's
still
yes kind of but that's the thing you
have to ask what's the difference
between the stick and a dongle yes a
dongle technically has attached HDMI
cable that you cannot remove whereas the
stick is the HDMI and the box or
whatever want to call the Express that
little thing has a detachable standard
HDMI cable so so is the the chromecast
is a stick then it's a dongle because
you can't
I guess the chromecast or TV yes right
yeah that dangle dangle dangle dangle
but isn't a chromecast just a stick on
its own though diddily diddily well the
original chromecast was a stick yeah
that's all I saw that's what I'm
referring even in 2013 man I'm talking
about the quote-unquote new chromecast
which came out in 2015 which is a little
puck and oh yeah yeah yes they went from
stick to dongle leading the industry in
that direction it's more questions yes I
mean my head is spinning so yes
absolutely
all the semantics of dongle ISM James
favor asks will these new features be on
Roku TVs yeah oh great question so a lot
of them yes the short answer is yes the
new features especially well the remote
that controls your TV isn't really
required if you have a Roku TV in
general but this gives me an opportunity
to talk about Roku TV they have a new
update coming out too and November but
the cool thing about Roku TV is their
televisions that Roku built-in you don't
have to connect anything to them to get
all that Roku functionality and
streaming or whatever it is and there
are favorites more TV operating system
because they're super easy to use the
new thing that they're rolling out so
you watch over-the-air antenna right if
you cut the cord especially you have an
antenna connected it's got a program
guide on it so Roku finally adds that
program guide the thing that the program
guide does that nobody else does it's a
little asterisk next to the names of
shows and like you know whatever I did
it with night chord and American Ninja
Warrior or whatever it was stuff that
was over-the-air
you press a button and it immediately
shows you where that that exact episode
is streaming on other services you click
the button again and you start watching
that episode
it's crazy it's like I'm basically using
my over-the-air as a browse as a
super-powered browse for all the stuffs
available on streaming so you're sitting
there like oh wait this isn't on yet
it's it's you know tomorrow night
oh wait click I'm watching it and you
know it's it's a really cool way to kind
of subvert the teat life TV experience
by saying hey by the way do you know
this stuff is actually probably on
Amazon and maybe as a prime subscriber
you can watch right now and you don't
have to search you know actively on
those apps it's all kind of thrown at
you by God you need the Roku TV for that
type of feature you are correct sir
so again if you have a stick or whatever
it doesn't have a TV tuner built into it
yet and that you know I kind of
functionality for TV tuners basically
just for the TVs why don't they have a
TV tuner like functionality built in
because I do have like own over the air
like antenna I'm already and like to
have both of those things kind of
annoying I mean yeah that would be cool
I could picture like them making a Roku
ultra box whatever this 100 bucks and
maybe another 20 bucks to put a RF you
know jack on the back of a can screen
antenna - I think it's just cost you
know and and the fact that at the end of
the day every TV now has a built-in
tuner so they figure why are we
duplicated this stuff buddy and the same
logic applies in Smart TVs every TV
smart now so that's the TV tuner dongle
dangle I got it - entertainer all right
skip to a couple more questions before
we wrap it up for the day Michael Brown
ass wouldn't supporting Android pay and
Apple pay be the easiest route to combat
fake skimmers yes it would and that's
why a lot of people in the industry are
kind of trying to move toward that or
like contactless pay and things like
that you know what with the whole foods
thing that happened on Friday so I wrote
an article on Friday morning Whole Foods
had announced that some of their stores
had points of service like system
sabotage basically like if you swiped
your credit card at any of their tap
rooms and restaurants one why are you
going to a bar and a restaurant and a
Whole Foods but anyway that's not the
point
like your system was like huh like
because I just got over the fact that I
spent six hundred dollars in groceries
and I need to drown my sorrows
that's oh that was a credit card skimmer
no it's not a skimmer situation because
that's points of service that's
like--you pain it's not that's not my
situation but the point is is that like
they were saying that Apple pay an
Android pay and all that stuff all the
all the phone paying systems that those
were not compromised because they have
like security depending on the phone
like etc etc right yeah tokenization
yeah so a lot of people are like moving
towards that the problem is is that you
know not everybody can switch that it's
kind of expensive to move to a system
like that those are far from not you
know entirely safe gender so also I'm
horrified at the idea of like I can't
afford my sandwich today my phone's dead
yeah that how many on the train had to
buy a physical ticket sucks anyway for
continuing with their first world
problem podcast but basically you know
yeah a lot of places are trying to move
to contactless pay like banks are trying
to encourage more businesses to be doing
that yeah that's a good fix but you know
the these are that's not like an end-all
be-all to it to this thing of course not
never be an end all be all because
they're gonna keep making it to be a
pain in the ass very good question
though Michael X excellent question
alright let's just go over a couple wish
list things for Nintendo before we wrap
it up for the day you know what if they
made a switch classic with a TV tuner
[Laughter]
entertainer only it was a dongle
switched on they would be the perfect
product the great mr. lizard regarding
the words
welcome back great mr. lizard awesome
regarding the SNES classic I'm waiting
for these games to hit the switch
Virtual Console yeah obviously and then
Michael Brown I'm just waiting till
Nintendo partners with smartphone OS
makers to allow Gameboy game support or
games in consecutive app stores they're
never gonna do that they're never gonna
do it one game at a time is they can't
about it because Nintendo is a huge
tease and all they want to do is make
their fans very angry at them at all
times as a pokemon yellow coming to
iPhone OS and limited availability only
300 downloads in 22 like them know like
they're never gonna put any like
specific gate like remake games because
on the phones because like why would
they do that when they can do it for
their consoles that's what they did they
remade they want to sell hardware they
made gold and silver available again but
that's only for like a 3ds or / 2d s
download just astonishing to me because
they have such a great software catalog
why not tout that why keep pushing the
hardware game it's a matter of getting
the right perfect if you notice that
they will when they get to notice if you
notice the games that they make for like
mobile that's all like a big money grab
for them Super Mario run whatever like
they charged and I was the one that was
one game and it was super tough hyped I
mean Apple was talking about that yeah
Pokemon go where you know like all these
businesses bought into like buying pokey
stops and Bates or like other people go
to their stores for one it can't just be
monetized it has to be ultra moms yeah
exactly so I think about the many
consoles like the SNES classic is just
minting them cash yeah maybe it's you're
spending $80 on a piece of plastic when
you literally already had right with
with like just a handful of games inside
there their profit margins on that must
be like because I can still sell it on
eBay for like a hundred and ninety so go
for it alright no you're not a sucker
you're just giving into the nostalgia
bomb that's happening man they got the
pictures of the games on the back it's
really cool you're gonna most imagine
myself playing them 15 years young and
then call your mom on like your Nokia I
don't know video game for I was playing
a ton of Game Boy Advance games on my
phone when Google didn't really police
the whole emulator stuff there but those
were good days man yeah yeah we threw
Pokemon read on my phone before they
shot that down I was playing any
weighted Chrono Trigger it was no this
was like the first Android phone this is
like the g1 so it had like if you want
yeah I like the first week it's awesome
we're going out of talk rabbit you still
have it no going out on a limb here to
close things out it's a one place that
Sega is kicking Nintendo's ass is in
software nostalgia Hawking get the
pudding put put the at games console
aside cuz that that blue that blue mega
balls make a drive it's fine no but you
can now that they're rolling it out all
these mobile ports for the classic games
all the way up through the Dreamcast era
genius take my they've already got all
my money they've already got only money
I'm downloading everything so far and
these are good ports like Crazy Taxi on
the iPhone and on the Android works
fantastic he got Christian Whitehead
working on those original sonex with
which were the big motivation behind all
of this they they're done a killer job
putting classic Sega in your pocket I
mean Sony I'm not Sony but like games
that were like exclusive for the
PlayStation have been doing a really
good job of that too I saw some when you
play like Vice City phone that's
ridiculous
I think that's existed for a little
while yeah I know but like that's like
it's like straight from but it's the
same strategy we want in tendo to yeah
right and if only they would well I mean
tremendous tremendous immense money its
its second king of you know just enough
money they did well with Super Mario run
I would imagine in Mario yes Mario Mario
dude he's really I'm not changing it I'm
going to say Mario along with all my
other Philadelphia brethren do you also
say like what's his brother's name Luigi
okay understand you're behind this I've
