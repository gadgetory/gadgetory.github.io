an outtake I think of me the first time
the first time that I did it where I
started to walk up to it and opened up
and I was like I can't I'm not looking
in the eggman I saw alien I know what's
about to happen to me and I'm not ready
to die the alien obviously a classic
movie monster was it quite scary facing
good or is it just a guy in like a
bright green onesie it's not I have to
say not really scary you know there was
there was moments that are like whoa
where we're all in the long grass and
little baby creatures going through you
know scuttling through the grass that
was quite a sort of scary but I kind of
find it funny I suppose what as well a
little bit the brilliant thing about
Ridley is that he knows that the actors
will give him more and in it I don't
feel more grounded for them if he gives
them practical things to work with so we
always had these uh some version of
these creatures looking around holy
there was a contortionist Tuesday in the
suit who does pursue you in it and uh it
is horrifying you think you know you're
on a set you know it's not nothing about
as real but once you're in that
atmosphere the lights there and they cue
the alien which is like bullshit that's
him I'm out of here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
