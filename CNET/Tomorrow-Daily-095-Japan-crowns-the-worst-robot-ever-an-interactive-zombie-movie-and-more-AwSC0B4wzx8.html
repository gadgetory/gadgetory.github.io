change the way we travel inside
buildings in just two short years and a
new interactive zombie movie shows you
if you can survive the zombie apocalypse
and we have a Japanese competition
that's looking to crown the world's
worst robot you're not kill it's
tomorrow daily
greetings citizens to the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show of the known universe I'm your
host Ashley together joining me today
our very special guest Tom Triana's here
how's going good glad to be here it's
awesome I we're excited to have you uh
kale is kales on a super secret mission
I'm assuming he's performing some manner
of weird kale pizza espionage I don't
know he could he said he couldn't say a
whole lot about it sounds delicious it
must be delicious delicious espionage um
but he'll be back tomorrow but for now
we've got taught here Tom tell us a
little bit about yourself so that
everybody can be your best friend I my
name is Tom tranel stand-up comedian I
live here in Los Angeles I'm a writer
I'm a producer I took a job at apple
just because somebody told me that I
couldn't challenge accepted took a job
at apple worked at the store just for a
couple years just to hang out cuz it
turned out I spend more time at the
store anyway and I was like why don't
they just pay me and they did and then I
went on tour doing stand-up comedy for a
few months we just did a 15 country tour
this year so it's good to be back to Los
Angeles for a little while and also I if
you could not tell by his shirt he's a
huge nerd this is why i'm hot and it's a
fire flower from mario i also love rap
music hence this is why i'm hot I like
it I like the mashup so are you ready to
talk about some headlines do this
alright let's do it
okay so unless you live under a rock
you've probably written in an elevator
goes up and down pretty straightforward
hasn't really changed ever since they
were invented with the exception of
maybe two car elevator shafts where you
can have two different elevator cars
moving in the same elevator shaft uh
this German company is looking to change
all of that which is really really cool
and exciting and futuristic which we
always love on this show this is a
german company named Theissen kripp they
want to make two axes travel possible so
the big issue with kind of innovating
elevators it's kind of weird to say
would be cables so that's what elevators
run by it's a cable system this
particular thing would be a no cable
system this would be removing cables
from the equation which is kind of neat
they look to the Star Trek turbolifts as
a consideration yeah really really cool
the turbolifts and so this is called the
multi elevator and this is a concept
video that they released earlier today I
saying this is how it would work these
are our plans this is how we want this
elevator kind of work together and they
say a lot of people are going to be
living in these like mega cities in the
future and if buildings are shaped like
this which if you're just listening
they're shaped like a bunch of Legos
smashed together then you would have to
have elevators that moved left and right
as well as up and down and so that's the
point of these elevators now is watching
this and this is what I'm concerned with
the the photo they showed of that
building looked like an architect doing
a drunk jenga game yeah yeah those
buildings do not look sound to me they
do not look like they are going to stay
up no I mean and if you've been a little
Las Vegas a Luxor has the pyramid hotel
not this way right which by the way not
awesome for a bunch of drunks in Las
Vegas can be going parallel yeah I don't
uh I've written that elevator also may
be intoxicated I may or may not have
been and it is terrifying because the
floor is moving diagonally upwards I
just very strange if you're not paying
attention you're very much like I don't
is gravity not what something terrible's
yeah it was awful to happen yeah so um
but they say that this multi elevator
would be
be more efficient it would carry more
people it would have a shorter wait
times and it would also have a smudge
smaller elevator shaft meaning they
could add more of these elevators or
even you know more more office space or
whatever it is that you would have
available well I feel like this is one
of those situations where science
fiction or fiction is becoming reality
or emily is because with the turbolift
this is the first step in creating the
enterprise because you're going to need
a helmet it goes left right up down
right right and that's I see I really
like this it's really exciting and it's
super fun uh you know the cool thing
about this is it's actually in
development right now they're saying a
prototype is going to open when this
German building opens in 2016 there's a
building that they're actually working
on this project in right now so this is
going to be a reality supposedly in a
couple years so hopefully in a 22 year
span ki you know killing her maybe tom
novy traveling over Jeremy let's check
out these elevators speaking of Las
Vegas you know what would have helped
this whole project move on when Las
Vegas was redoing a downtown area they
actually wanted to build the enterprise
a full-scale model enterprise hotel guys
in Las Vegas this would have been amazed
nice and crept really missed that was an
opportunity missed yeah the true
opportunity Vegas was behind it they had
an architect it was all ready to go this
would have been perfect I would have
been really fun well ok so speaking of
fun you have to tell me about this
interactive zombie movie I got to play
it this morning and it's pretty awesome
yeah so I checked it out it's an
interactive Dombey film it's a feature
film really high quality when I watch it
at first i read up on it I thought to
myself a five minute movie that teaches
teaches you how to survive the
apocalypse that's a little doesn't make
sense because I can last five minutes in
the zombie apocalypse after that I'm dog
meat but it's very cool it's optimized
for your tablets definitely a lot more
fun on your tablet but a filmmaker who
clearly got a lot of help from the
g-shock folks because as yeah lots of
g-shock close-ups in this g-shock is
definitely featured in this it teaches
you to use your memory and your memory
will help follow the story along and you
can get up to three lives if you fail
like maybe I did you get to restart but
you get to do make Shay
circles zigzag which is why the tablet
is the best way to do it i mean they did
it on a screen it's real easy to play on
a touch screen it's a little bit tougher
on a touch pad if you're playing on like
a laptop yeah cuz you only have a little
tiny bit of space yeah but you watching
the film you're the one that follows it
along and it's I was watching it and
playing it and all I kept thinking is
this is like Boy Scout camp intense it
was crazy you the music the sim autauga
fee the quality of it was amazing it's
very good and it's fun it's fun and it's
brought to you by filmmaker named
Maximilian Neiman so good job Maximilian
Neiman now are you in the Romero Walking
Dead camp of slow zombies are you in the
28 days later fast runnings out oh you
know I like a challenge so I'm gonna say
I'm like I love me some classic Romero
zombie but I just I really love that
fast-moving like tear their way scarier
because they can catch you it's like I
feel like I could just always get on a
bicycle and like right away from yeah
but the problem is when the Romero
zombie is horde up on you that's when
things get crazy that's true that's true
but then it's like you know World War Z
they're all super fast there and
diseased and then they like climb up
like ants like you know like you know
it's like crazy I like that like my
in-laws hey I just said that so our last
story today made me laugh so much this
is this is a competition in Japan you
guys that is looking for the worst robot
in the world so it's a robot sumo
wrestling competition it's called hip
hippo con and it's in Japan and it's
made for people who have no idea how to
make robots so if you're watching the
footage you can see all of these
absolutely terrible robots made out of
things like food containers and like the
one there's just got a broken leg it's
over the goal is to make worst robot
possible there were 31 entrants it was
in july of this year but they just
released the footage for the japanese
media arts festival week ago so now we
are getting to delight in all of these
awful awful robots so it's really funny
that the the lower the translation is
just hilarious the subtitling is just
like these are crappy robots and they're
the worst look it's pole dancing Barbie
robot you can pull dancing Barbie that
I'd say is an awesome rope I wasn't
insane amazing robot and then we got
these about this one's like a train
rain robot and crane help knocked it
over it's over I but all of these robots
are very very different there's one is
literally a dustpan that's a dustpan
we've in like this one just seems too i
don't i don't even think it knows what
it's doing it's just swiping the air
this one looks like a ball of Kali clay
get cotton maybe let that looks like an
egg just look a little egg and then one
with like a pan it's just very strange
but but my favorite robots are of course
there there are a few standouts all of
the barbie what is that oh wow whoa whoa
whoa whoa I don't know what's happening
in this shot that is insane guys it this
is the thing to watch on the show today
for just listening this is absolutely
the footage you want to be watching it's
no words can describe there's this this
robot that doesn't do anything unless
it's moving down a plank yeah this is
the robot I believe this one right here
on the left the dislike hexagon actually
was the one that one because it
literally did nothing but be really
heavy and big and all the that one right
there that's disturbing that's a tissue
box with personal massagers yes to it
personal massager legs but yeah the
robot that ended up winning was that big
giant one that looked like a big box and
it did nothing it did absolutely nothing
it just SAT there and and the guy who
once said I actually feel ashamed to
have one because I won with this
terrible terrible robot it was pretty
great pretty great and the announcers of
the very beginning even admit crappiness
Trump's strategy that's a quote from
their video which is fantastic what a
great tag line for a robot competition
it's really good I feel like we should
end our next year I would like to see
Rosie the robot and go up against Johnny
Five from short circuit don't see what
happens well ok so that brings me to our
question of the day which is if our
hashtag nice TD bad bot and the question
is what's the lamest robot you can think
of lamest robot I can think of one that
breaks my remote control of its on fox
news for more than five minutes no that
is a pretty lame robot I would say like
I could just think of a robot with a bro
like with a broken leg that just walks
in circles does absolutely nothing just
keeps going in circles notes battery
dies like what what a talent that is or
a robot that
burns toast for no other reason than to
burn it fair enough fair enough it just
burns toast like it's called my toaster
that's the robot that burns to her for
me but you guys get bonus points you use
Photoshop make a really terrible robot
and send it over to us because I think
that would be amazing um that's it for
the first half of the show and went by
so quickly yes it did we're going to
come back with new releases because it's
Tuesday and then of course we also have
user feedback and your phone toggle for
the day so don't click way to our daily
hey everybody we're back welcome back to
the show i'm here with tom tramp stamp
comedian hey all around funny guy super
nerd super nerd old all the great things
like we said kill kill be back tomorrow
super secret Pizza espionage I don't
know um diese bring some back with him i
would i would hope so you're gonna keep
my fingers crossed um but it's Tuesday
and since you're not normally here on
Tuesdays we like to talk about all the
great things that are coming out during
the week for people to check out so this
is new releases
so first up we have the next kind of
chapter in the game of thrones universe
which is pretty cool it's telltale games
game it's telltale games Game of Thrones
Game say it again so really that much
telltale games Game of Thrones Game um
it's called iron from Isis episode 1 it
looks amazing they have pretty much
everybody from the original cast the
actual game of thrones cast doing
voiceover for this if you have ever
played a telltale Game before like The
Walking Dead or you've played the wolf
among us you know how good their games
are they're usually a lot of
conversation and kind of you know a
little bit of a
choose-your-own-adventure vibe right
like interactive choose your adventure
and this actually goes into the Bolton's
storyline with with Roose Bolton and you
know what like there's like a cynic
another house that we maybe haven't
really been introduced to in the show
but then they are they get into Ramsay
Snow's kind of a Ramsay Bolton i should
say his storyline and a lot of that
stuff it's supposed to be really really
good I'm really looking forward to this
one and you can get it on quite a few
platforms you can get it on xbox one
xbox 360 playstation 4 playstation 3 and
pc so it's a lot of different ones that
I'm assuming ipad and android tablets
will follow so it's pretty awesome um I
do have you dig big game of thrones fan
I'm about to say something that may get
me thrown out of the nerd Club it's
gonna be no and that means he you're
gonna actually not I know I haven't
started watching the show because I've
decided I can't get emotionally invested
in a program until I know how long it's
gonna run fair enough okay i just
watched Deadwood oh that's such a good
shot shows been over since it was
illegal and creepy to like fantasize
about Kristen Bell yeah oh that's true
wow it's been a long time yeah it wasn't
it canceled in 2004 2004 yeah wow yeah
but I need to know this relationships
gonna last for a while I think it's
gonna last I think you might be okay I
don't know I thought the same thing
about revolution I just found out that
got canceled yikes maybe you're right
yeah well I think a lot of people felt
that way about Firefly and we all know
how that ended five or six seasons in I
will L will binge-watch you binge it out
yeah alright I like it the next game on
our list is of my personal favor
at my pic of the week captain toad
treasure tracker mm-hmm I'm a little bit
obsessed with captain toad it's about
time toad got his own I agree captain
Cano p oh we gotta get we gotta get on
board of him that's his japanese names
Kenobi oh so we gotta get on board with
captain toad he is treasure tracker I
love that Nintendo kind of picked out
the in Super Mario 3d World you're able
to do these levels there little treasure
levels where you get stars and they made
his own game based on that because it
was so fun and it was so different and
cool and it's getting great reviews and
I am really looking forward to getting
that on Friday for my wii u um from a
marketing standpoint this is what I have
to tell intend oh I was very excited
about this and then I read the actual
description and it says and I'm quoting
the features equipped with nothing more
than a neck scarf a backpack and
oversized head lamp not doing a great
job convincing with the tote is a
superhero get out your neckerchiefs
everybody get out Joe neckerchiefs I'm
excited yeah I am excited I'm not gonna
I'm i am so real about captain toad it's
not even funny and then lastly i
actually missed this last week but i've
been hearing incredible things about
this and i'm a big fan of horror movies
so the babadook is out in theaters at
right now you can go see it and I've
just heard nothing but this is a great
horror film it really like take some
turns you don't you don't expect looks
absolutely terrifying um and i don't
know i'm really i'm a sucker for a good
horror movie so i watched the trailer
and I was honest to god creeped out it's
really creepy yeah the trailer is weird
and like it's said that she reads from
this book and it's called the babadook
and it's this monster and all his stuff
in and then of course like terrible
things start happening around the book
creo notes the babadook he's coming to
kill us um but yeah it's uh it really
fascinating i want to see it and it
looks really good and kind of like
almost indie like but it looks smart
smartly written very good horror what
wheeler what was cool about it was they
released it on directv first and then
released in theaters so as it was
exclusive to direct TV for a while which
is the way that the industry is going
the streaming technology it's kind of
like hey its exclusive here first and
then you can watch it in theaters or or
like well we've seen a lot of them have
like documentaries and stuff come out
did he want to man first and then and
then based on I think the Giro per
reported that to the video the movie
fiction not a documentary wish it was
real but ya know they did that too they
they released it on video on demand it
did so well that they did a theatrical
release if you want a good like maybe
poop your pants a little bit horror
movie this looks like the one watched it
watch the trailer it looks pretty good
and I'm often disappointed by horror
movies so I'm looking forward to
actually seeing i'm actually looking
very forward to seeing this awesome well
we should all go see it together this
weekend and all pooper pants together
okay well it is now time for your user
feedback so we had our hashtag of the
day earlier in the show we do that every
day and yesterday we asked everybody to
tell us I to use the hashtag TT trailer
to tell us what they would have a
trailer full of as their only
entertainment for the rest of their life
okay so cuz there is this gaming trailer
it was a truck and a trailer that had 25
xbox 360s and 25 screens where you could
sit down and like basically have a giant
land party did it have a generator for
all these I'm sure it did I'm sure it
did hey that would suck if it didn't it
would yeah that would be kind of a crazy
power requirement but yeah so we asked
everybody at and we had some really
great responses August throat to us and
said I would have my wife and kids in
the trailer with me cuz I can't I really
can't live without them hashtag TV
trailer hashtag family and there's this
is this family right there I'm assuming
it's your family it could be a stock
photo of somebody else's family I don't
have taken it out of him have a bad
dream Sears Sears catalog um Leo retro
sand said I would love to have a trailer
a dedicated to super smash brothers
mario kart 8 and the legend of zelda
ocarina of time hashtag TV trailer like
that those are good choices cuz any of
the replayability and super smash
brothers it's a longevity the sort of
long game in ocarina of time they also
have mario kart 8 also very competitive
lots of replay value I like it Lionel
wrote to us and said I would have a
trailer with no gravity so I can float
around forever doesn't seem like that
can get boring I think I grave that like
the microgravity trailer would be kind
of amazing except for the you know
eating drinking having to go to the
bathroom thing that you could get out
but then that would be your only form of
entertainment yes yeah just float around
tues new exploding experiments and
things inside there just try out a bunch
of stuff okay and then lastly Stefan
wrote us and said I wouldn't need a
whole trailer all I would
smartcard an oculus rift there's room
for two I love this littlest picture
it's a guy in a car ready to drive with
a rift on was fantastic that's not
dangerous no definitely that will that
will surely end well that will surely
end well um but yeah you guys did such a
great job this week and we love pictures
