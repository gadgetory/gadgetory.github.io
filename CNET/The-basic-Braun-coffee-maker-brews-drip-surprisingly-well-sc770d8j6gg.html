coffee makers ordinary appearance this
coffee maker here it may look like an
ordinary kitchen appliance but in fact
brews pot after pot of very delicious
Joe it's affordable too it's priced at
$100 which may sound like a lot but when
compared to other luxury coffee makers
it's actually quite affordable it's also
small and compact which means it'll fit
on your kitchen countertop without much
trouble at all like I said before it
also makes excellent coffee which is
something I don't expect for machine
that cost this price Braun had to make
some trade-offs here to get the price
down number one it doesn't have a
thermal carafe instead it uses a glass
carafe which sits on a hot plate which
isn't ideal especially if you want to
have your coffee sit around for hours
and the compact size comes at a price
opening up the tank to put water in is
actually kind of difficult because
there's not much room to maneuver also
if you're familiar with Cuisinart or
other old-school coffee makers the glass
carafe definitely has a tendency to
spill especially if you try and pour
water or any kind of liquid too quickly
out of it there's more we could get into
but we don't have time right now check
out my full review but all in all though
I have to say I'm very pleasantly
surprised by this bran coffeemaker it
brews very good coffee at a price that's
very affordable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
