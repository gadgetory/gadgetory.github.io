the Lenovo s5000 colorful glowing
mid-range Android phone now often less
fancy phones don't look particularly
nice but Lenovo appears to put a bit of
extra effort into making this phone look
quite fancy so the front and the back
are both covered in glass and if I flip
it around here you can see that the logo
is glowing green now this is just a
pre-production model at the moment but
lenovo tells me that you will be able to
change that color so you can maybe have
it glow a different color for a
different type of notification like an
email or a tweet for example the screen
is quite large this is a 5 inch display
and it has a 1280 by 720 pixel
resolution looking at it it's quite
sharp and the phone feels pretty speedy
to use as well that's not surprising
considering it has a quad-core processor
nestled beneath its glass exterior it's
only running Android 2.2 which isn't the
latest version but it's still very
advanced for a mid-range phone another
quirk is that this phone features some
very high resolution cameras the one on
the back has a 13 megapixel sensor while
the one on the front is 5 megapixels is
coming out in June it's going to be
available in white or this fetching pink
and it's going to cost two hundred and
sixty nine dollars so this is shaping up
to be a good looking phone for the price
but what do you think let me know and
check out cnet.com for much much more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
