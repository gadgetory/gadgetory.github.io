the panasonic tc-p st50 series this is
the company's least expensive 1080p 3d
TV that has their neo PDP panels this is
kind of the beginning of the really good
panel for this TV it's a successor to
the st 30 from last year which is one of
our very favorite tvs in terms of price
to picture quality ratios so we kind of
expect the same thing out of the st 50
this year i've been told that this TV
has a new improved panel which equates
to slightly better black levels we're
also going to probably see some better
motion resolution on this TV although
mesh most revolution wasn't a problem
last year this set also has a completely
new processing which again should
improve the picture quality of a certain
extent of course this TV also has new
filter for the screen so it actually
rejects ambient light a little bit
better design-wise they made some really
good improvements the st 30 last year
was a little bit ugly this one it's a
little bit nicer with a thinner design
around the screen thinner panel / also
if design was your hang-up on the st 30
last year like it kind of was me this
one really solves that problem this TV
series is available in the 50 55 60 and
65 sizes so covers that full range it
drops the 42 and 46 from last year but
have to step down to the UT 50 for that
panasonic also through its VIERA Connect
features onto the CD which is internet
capability you can do some new things
with it this year including a tablet app
and a pc app you can throw web pages and
apps back and forth between the app and
the TV there's also a full suite of
streaming services as available last
year and finally of course the st 50 is
3d compatible that's active 3d not
passive panasonic does not include any
active 3d glasses on this TV however
that's a quick look at the panasonic
tc-p st 50 series i'm david katz meijer
from CES 2012
