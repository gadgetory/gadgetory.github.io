well the future as of October 2012
because the dream of Windows 8 has
always been to take your tablet your
laptop mix them together have some crazy
touchscreen detachable futuristic device
that's maybe a bit like an iPad Android
tablet but still feels like a full
laptop or PC well finally we're
reviewing the HP Envy x2 which is one of
this generation of what we call hybrids
maybe we call them detachable x' their
laptops that act that can detach and
become their own tablets and have
permanent keyboard bases that come with
the systems it's a little bit
complicated but I'm trying to
differentiate between that and something
like the surface pro that's gonna be
coming out which really has a keyboard
that's more like a cover well they're
kind of similar except in this instance
the keyboard also has extra battery
space and ports so that's the advantage
there it bumps up the battery life on
the Envy x2 to a whopping 10 hours when
it's connected like this like a laptop
or about seven and a half hours with
just the tablet this is expensive this
is an $850 system now for a laptop
that's not too bad but consider the fact
that under the hood what you're getting
here is an Atom processor now this is
better than the addams of the old
netbook days but still is a far cry from
any of your basic ultrabook processors a
lot slower also only two gigs of ram and
a 64 gigabyte SSD that's better than
what you'd find in your average tablet
perhaps but a little low compared to
most laptops it does have an 11 inch
1366 by 768 display it is full touch
multi-touch and it feels really nice it
feels as good as any tablet you'd expect
to respond and you also have in your NFC
I'm not sure when you would actually use
that and a modest selection of ports
you've got two USB ports HDMI SD card
slot and that's it and there are no
ports in the tablet itself it's really
made to be used as a cover consumption
tablet device not to connect anything so
you'll need to plug it into this base
the trackpad here is find the keyboard
feels comfortable now consider that you
get a super budget laptop and a really
cheap tablet maybe something like a $200
Android tablet or even an iPad Mini at
350 and come to about the price that the
HP Envy x2 is at and that's kind of the
conundrum here is it really worth
combining all of that and paying pretty
much the same thing and hobbling your
performance a little bit now this can
run all Windows programs it's a full
windows 8 experience so that's nice and
the construction and design feel really
good this is very key like although
before warned that the way the hinge
opens here it's top-heavy so you're
gonna tip it over if you push it too far
back but it holds its own when you stand
it on a table if you put it on your lap
it might feel a little bit awkward and
detaching the screen it's hard to do
with just yeah as you can see it's a
little bit hard here and you have to
pull it out so it's not really that
elegant compared to you know sleek
magnets like on the Smart Cover on the
iPad or even the surface pro is type
cover the tablet is 1.5 pounds there's
just a little bit more than a nine point
seven inch Retina Display iPad so it
feels actually pretty comfortable in one
hand and I found it great on a train so
it's a fine tablet it's just not a
superlative one there's a sort of laptop
that is one of the better convertible
devices that I've seen that has a
detachable tablet but it's nowhere near
as do-it-all powerful as something like
a yoga 13 and you're paying a lot to get
onboard this and this is no bargain but
it is an interesting product that
generally works as advertised as long as
you're treating it like a fancy touch
netbook I'm Scott Stein and that's the
HP Envy x2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
