Jeff Bakalar I'm here today to share
with you my favorite picks for games and
gear in this product spotlight video
first up is the Nintendo Wii U which is
priced at three hundred dollars for the
basic set and 350 for the deluxe the wii
u offers a tablet controller that
promises to change the way we play games
check seeing it soon for our full review
of the console but there's no doubt the
wii u will be a hot gift we're pretty
deep into the current generation of
consoles and the xbox 360 and the ps3
are entering their elder years sony just
released what we're calling a super slim
ps3 and a couple of bundles one of which
is available right now if you're new to
the world of playstation this is
probably the one to get but if you don't
want the packing game you may need to
wait until the super slim is sold
separately the xbox 360 will see a
temporary fifty dollar price drop for
the holidays so if you're more
interested in microsoft's console now's
the time to buy when it comes to
portable gaming there are two main
options the Nintendo 3ds and the
PlayStation Vita while the Vita has
hands down better graphics some people
might appreciate the quick pick up and
play nature of the 3ds each system has
solid games though you'll pay a little
more for Vita ones speaking of games the
Vita has access to the PlayStation
Network and store which does offer an
impressive amount of titles to choose
from there are a lot of top-quality
downloadable titles available and you'll
save a bit of money downloading full
games as opposed to buying the hard copy
in a store right now my favorite game
for the Vita is little big planet and
you can buy the Vita console for two
hundred and fifty dollars the 3ds still
pushes its 3d glasses list technology
but most people myself included play
without it on it's kind of a distraction
but nevertheless there are a lot of 3ds
games coming down the pike including
paper mario sticker star if you're
picking up a 3ds i recommend the XL
which has a much larger screen that goes
for two hundred dollars now let's move
on to the console games there are a ton
of titles that you should have on your
radar first we're starboard games that
are available for both the 36
and the ps3 while it's already been out
for a few weeks I can't say enough
awesome stuff about borderlands 2 it's
easily a top-five for 2012 contender
there are so many addictive missions and
weapon upgrading and hoarding to get
through in the game I'm not sure that
any other title will give you the replay
value that borderlands 2 will another
game that should be on everyone's
shortlist this season is dishonored it's
a game that lets you play any way you
want be it super stealthy or very
aggressive your actions dictate what
happens in the game's already awesome
storyline so make sure you check it out
there's no doubt Assassin's Creed 3 is
one of 2012's most anticipated games
because it completely changes the
typical Assassin's Creed environment the
setting is now in the American
Revolution and you'll take on the role
of Connor a half English half Native
American then there's call of duty black
ops 2 so what is it about this new Call
of Duty well the game takes place in the
future so there are a lot of futuristic
weapons at your disposal plus the games
online multiplayer is insanely addictive
so if any of this sounds intriguing call
of duty black ops 2 is definitely for
you now we'll move on to the exclusives
or lack thereof while the ps3 has had
most of the noteworthy exclusives like
uncharted resistance and God of War this
fall it's the xbox 360 that gets halo 4
so that about wraps it up for my product
spotlight of games and gear make sure
