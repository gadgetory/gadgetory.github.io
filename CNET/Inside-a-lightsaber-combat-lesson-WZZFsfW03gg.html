we're going to check out the lightsaber
combat academy let's go
Hey
my name is Roy I'm one of the
instructors here at Luna Sports San
Francisco we've been teaching classes
here since October 2000
little sport is a lightsaber combat
sport that was created by three friends
who saw lightsabers a lot of them had
experience with martial arts but they
thought what if the lightsaber were a
real thing so the blade would be
weightless for the 300 degree cutting
edge but all you can control is the hilt
we're waiting for the technology to
catch up when that comes out will you
say
in this class most people at this point
have their own savers for at-home
practice and outside class sparring they
are built to be combat durable they're
made from aircraft grade aluminum with a
polycarbonate blade it has enough to
give that it doesn't bounce but it's
sturdy enough that it's not going to
break definitely do get a lot of
exercise out of it it's a lot of moving
it's a lot of dancing around similar to
like boxing and how you gotta move
around I really like this class I think
it's very interesting and family yeah
they told me how to position and how to
attack people and how to protect
yourself I didn't know it was like that
in a real sport I didn't think it even
existed but I think it's really cool it
gets people out gets people doing
something that really enjoy doing and
you have the nostalgia of having grown
up in Star Wars so it's kind of like a
feel-good but you get some working out
it's awesome it's really fun a lot more
technical than I expected it's not just
picking up glowy sticks and fashioning
each other with them different
techniques that were very specific it
was a really good workout mostly lower
body stuff of course when someone's like
chasing you a lifesaver
I hate going to a gym so this seems like
a way more fun alternatives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
