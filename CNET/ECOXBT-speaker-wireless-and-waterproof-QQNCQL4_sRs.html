cnet.com and I'm here with the grace
digital echo xvt that V T stands for
Bluetooth and yes this is a wireless
speaker it is also a waterproof speaker
it's not water resistant it is actually
fully waterproof well it isn't the
sexiest looking speaker some people
might even say it's a little bit ugly
what is impressive about it is that it
delivers very big sound for such a small
size speaker so really at first glance
well it might not look that good and
even a little bit cheap it's actually
one of the better Bluetooth speakers you
can find for the money it's priced at
less than $100 it's obviously very
portable has a rechargeable battery
inside gets about 10 hours of battery
life takes about two hours to charge it
and you can basically take it around
anywhere with you as far as the charging
goes there is a little hidden door on
the back you pop it open and you can
charge the speaker you do have to put
that gasket back on to make it
waterproof again and this also comes
with a little lanyard to keep that
little door attached the speaker so you
don't lose it there's also a carabiner
that you can attach to this speaker so
you can dangle the speaker from your
backpack even your belt though it's a
little bit heavy weighs around 1.5
pounds like other Bluetooth speakers
this has a range of about 33 feet you
can do a little bit better up there no
obstacles in the way but really you can
stream from a smartphone tablet any
device that's Bluetooth enabled to the
speaker and use that device as the
remote control there are a few buttons
on the top volume control it also has a
built-in speakerphone which is a nice
addition but all-in-all despite the
speakers on sleek design it is not the
best looking speaker in the world I did
like how it sounded and I do think it's
well-designed and a good value for the
money especially since it's waterproof
I'm David Carr noise and that's the
grace digital echo xdt
bluetooth speaker thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
