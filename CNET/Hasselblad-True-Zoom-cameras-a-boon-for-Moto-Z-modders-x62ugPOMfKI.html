a zoom lens dia shoot a lot in bright
light then the 250 dollar Hasselblad
branded true zoom camera attachment part
of Lenovo's moto mod series of add-ons
is for you it's essentially a slim
compact camera that attaches seamlessly
to the phone and overall it's a really
elegant solution but it's not without
its crazy-making annoyances I can't
emphasize enough how convenient to zoom
lenses and this isn't the first phone
with one but this one's dead easy to add
and remove motor mods attached to the
phone via magnets and in this case the
phone stock camera app switches to a
version design for use with the camera
mod it has similar components to say a
hundred and fifty dollar compact digital
camera with the photo quality to match a
one over 2.3 inch 12 megapixel sensor
and a stabilized 25 to 250 millimeter
equivalent 10 times zoom lens the lenses
maximum aperture of F 3 point 5 shrinks
to F 6.5 by the end of the zoom range
limiting its usefulness in anything but
bright light and its widest they're
serious distortion and vignetting on Raw
photos which gets automatically
corrected for JPEGs the HD video isn't
great with compression artifacts and
somewhat bizarre non-standard frame
rates like 28.3 for frames per second
there's not a lot here that's really
Hasselblad it's got the company's 75th
anniversary commemorative orange shutter
button with half press focusing a grip
with the same nice physical feel as the
one used by current Hasselblad cameras
and the big h it will also ship with
access to Hasselblad x' raw software
focus to bed focus mobiles only
available on iOS not Android
unfortunately the app always routes to
default settings even if you switch away
from it for just a second which is
something you do constantly on a phone
that means for instance it forgets
you're in manual mode or that you're
shooting raw as far as I can tell if you
use another camera app you can't shoot
RAW it's also way too easy to
accidentally hit the home menu and back
buttons while holding it like I said
crazy-making and keep in mind zoom
lenses generally eat a lot of power and
this one's no exception except now it's
running down your phone's battery
