that matter right now New York City's
Taxi and Limousine Commission has
announced the proposal that would allow
passengers to tip drivers and Bryan's
where credit cards are the only option
for payment of course this includes
services like uber which currently does
not let passengers do so the proposal
was launched thanks to an online
petition that was set up by the
independent drivers guild which is a
group reppin uber drivers in New York
according to the New York Times the
American Hotel &amp;amp; Lodging Association has
been researching ways to increase
regulations surrounding home sharing
services specifically Airbnb as a way to
combat the company's growing popularity
of course Airbnb his response to the
news hasn't been positive claiming the
move is to ensure the continuation of
price gouging and finally Volkswagen is
investing three hundred million dollars
in a national network of 450 car
charging stations that complements the
company's commitment to a zero emissions
future
