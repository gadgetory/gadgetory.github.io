they want your cuddles
this is leva Bella the latest creation
from toy makers Spin Master her eyes
head lips and arms all move in harmony
to give her lifelike expressions she can
laugh blink and purse her lips to suckle
on her bottle and pacifier Spin Master
showed off a prototype of lava Bella at
the New York Toy Fair but when she comes
out later this year she'll also be
smarter than your average baby doll
sensors in her hands tummy and back
react to different touches she could
play peek-a-boo and get tickled and the
more you play with her the more she
learns and she'll cost around $100 but
lava Bella isn't the only new robot in
town at Toy Fair there are plenty of
machines looking to make a new friend
some poses familiar characters like the
16 inch tall BB a droid it comes rolling
toward the sound of your voice ponies
have a little more magic this year
responding to touch and sound while
being seriously cute pet tiger robots
love a good ear scratch and will react
to a good growl not all BOTS need legs
Lightning McQueen talks blinks and
drives in whichever path you doodle on
his backside screen if you're in the
mood to have your own minion turbo Dave
can navigate your room and respond to
hand gestures or you can just put a
robot right on your hand like the
fingerlings baby monkeys that you can
pet kiss and rock to sleep but why buy a
new robot when you can become a robot
the beat moves wearable bracelet add
sound effects to your dance moves making
it so much more fun to do the robot like
they say you can't beat them join them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
