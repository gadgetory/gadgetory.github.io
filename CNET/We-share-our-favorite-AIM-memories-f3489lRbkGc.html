profile icons cute my way messages were
just so emo and you know maybe the
person I'm thinking about was know that
this lyric from the Smashing Pumpkins
song is about I had a secret one but a
secret one that was I wanted to be so
unlike me that people wouldn't recognize
that was me and it was like Asian baby
girl 69 X and X Asian baby girl 69 I had
Jeff on AOL and then I lost it I was
waiting for 60s music and I was trying
to find some something that wasn't my
name and wheels of fire came up and sure
enough wasn't taken they mean well in
the car maybe well just like had 69
attached to every username and I was
just like all right I'm very
uncomfortable I would sneak down from my
room and like get on my family's
computer and just like make sure that
the sound was turned off so like men of
the aimed sound effects would wake up my
parents know I was like 12 or 13 so my
mom made it so she made me the email an
email is drama girl zero zero seven
because I was in theater and I like
James Bond and that's what she told me
why she made it I mean mine was writing
geek 88 so I was just as Intolerable
knows it for myself I was very
impressive
make mine I still like to hear the sound
effects a little bit like there was like
the door opening and you need look and
like see if the girl you like was on you
would almost instantly just write
everyone who wasn't idle sure sure sure
you'd wait a little bit because you
didn't want to seem like you were just
waiting for them to get on so you would
just give it some time
many a crush would have a special sound
wave they would play like and I'd be
like oh okay now be cool don't jump on
right away wait wait wait like five
minutes and just dig oh hey what's up
yeah and then I'd show up casually you
know nine minutes later she's like oh
hey you're online I see you know and
that was really really lame and pathetic
and didn't work very well so right and
then you just write that first instance
of like oh the stuff that happens in
this weird dumb little chat box that can
have an impact on the real world like
you were going to school the next day
and be like oh that like shade I taught
somebody they found out about it yeah
shouldn't have told that to snow dude 47
like yep it sounds kind of sad but I do
you remember smarter child yeah I talked
to a robot I played games of oh god it's
so hideously embarrassing we're like
just leaving movie like song quotes as
you're away message and it was always
too like that one girl away messengers
were for posting passive-aggressive
messages that is 100% the only reason
anybody set in a way message I remember
like this really popular guy who never
ever talked to me message me about
homework and I helped him out but then I
felt like oh you don't like talk to me
any other way so then on my way message
I kind of like hinted at that and then
he apologized and was like I'm sorry
didn't mean to do that like I like I
don't mean to ignore all the stuff and
I'm like yeah whatever your dick and he
read it from my away message and then
now I think back I'm like I gave him a
hard time it was a sad emo song lyric
that reflected exactly how angry you
were at your best friend that day this
is about you Stacy
these lyrics perfectly identify what I'm
going through right now and you need to
check my away message and read it so you
know the agony in which I exist email
music was like really popular when I was
in college or a really upbeat positive
lyric that was like I'm totally in lust
with this
tween boy know those lyrics ya know it
got deep I would like have like
documents where I would collect quotes
and lyrics for any sort of mood I'm in
you know like don't don't bother me
right now or whatever it might be you
know maybe maybe that guy's thinking
about me he'll see that he'll see this
away message and he'll know maybe it's
I'm thinking of him maybe also can we
can we talk about how how important aim
was to Asian American culture yeah
maybe because it was the bay area and
there was a lot of different kinds of
Asians around and then aim was like the
main message system that we use and it
was just like you know also when you're
like a preteen that you just want to
identify with a group and it wasn't a
very elegant expression though some
things we're like really like the sticky
caps in the asterisks and the squiggly
lines and like all that stuff when I
started texting a lot more that's when I
started not using a many more I was
using text messages my mom was texting
before I was like what are these why are
you sending me messages on my phone you
could just you know send out aims she's
like no this is faster this is easier
there really was too much time wasted on
like maybe it wasn't wasted time maybe
it was well-spent time to you know be
poetic threw away messages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
