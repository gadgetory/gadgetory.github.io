this is the Bose Soundlink color -
Bluetooth speaker like its predecessor
it cost $130 and comes in a few
different color options it's similar in
shape though it's slightly shorter and
squatter while the original finish was
mostly smooth hard plastic with some
rubberized trim on the top of the
speaker insides this new model is
entirely covered and soft to the touch
rubber which has a little give to it and
seems better designed to withstand drops
however it is a bit of a magnet for dust
and carpet fibers the new speaker is
officially water resistant and it's ipx4
certification makes it splash proof
though not waterproof it also now has a
built-in microphone that gives it
speakerphone capabilities battery life
is rated at eight hours which is decent
but not great sound like color to sounds
a little better than the original and is
arguably one of the best sounding
Bluetooth speakers for its size I ran a
bunch of different music through it and
came away impressed with the sound it
was able to produce though it does have
its limitations it does best with jazz
classical acoustical live music and your
favorite soft rock classics there isn't
a ton of base but with well recorded
techno and hip-hop tracks it's got
enough kick to it to surprise you
sometimes however tracks where a lot of
instruments are playing at once are more
challenging for this little guy anyway
that's the Bose Soundlink color - a
mostly improved sequel to the original
color thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
