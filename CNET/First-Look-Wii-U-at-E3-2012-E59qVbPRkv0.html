first look at the Nintendo Wii U gamepad
and some of the experiences that intend
to a showcasing up here at the show we
first wanted to talk about this gamepad
this is the final version of what we
expect to see we'll see the two dual
analog sticks here that you can push in
and press as buns themselves they've
moved in the d-pad and the face buttons
as well some other unique
characteristics about this actual
gamepad is the fact that Nintendo wants
you to use this more than just gaming so
down here on the corner you'll see this
TV button what that allows you to do is
use this as a remote to replace your
current television remote and you have
this kind of unique spot here this is an
NFC spot for near-field communications
where if you have something like an item
or a card it can scan and exchange data
between that and that opens up a lot of
possibilities of potential games or
information so this is really a great
controller on the back side we have here
they've kind of added this this rounded
surface I guess you could call them
handle bulges to really make it feel
more comfortable in your hand and you'll
see the two triggers here now when we
talk experiences with the Nintendo Wii U
gamepad one of the things that you can
do here this is obviously a second
screen so there's a game where you have
these ninja stars you fling them from
the screen on this gamepad onto your
television screen to knock down ninjas
we also had another experience where you
using the actual gamepad experience a
totally different thing than the other
people where we're walking through a
forest and slain enemies but this use
the crossbow the screen allows you to
aim at specific targets and shoot them
so that allows you if you have a gamepad
to really do something different than
your other friends with just a standard
Nintendo Wii controller so up to this
point we've still not heard any official
release date or pricing for the Nintendo
Wii U game system we're hoping to hear
that soon but there you have it a first
look at a Nintendo Wii U gamepad and
some of the experiences that you guys
can expect to see coming soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
