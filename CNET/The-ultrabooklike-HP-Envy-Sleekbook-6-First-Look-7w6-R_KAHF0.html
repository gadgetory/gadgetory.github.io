a look at the HP Envy sleek book this is
a 15-inch laptop from HP that is very
thin reasonably light kind of like let's
say an ultrabook but it can't be an
ultra because ultra ebooks need Intel
CPUs this is a version that has an AMD
CPU so instead HP s call this a sleek
book which is sort of the name they made
up and honestly it sounds pretty dumb
but you do kind of get the idea this is
something that's ultra book like and and
I really appreciate the fact that they
were able to take a lot of the HP Envy
design cues from the more expensive
laptops and bring them into this less
expensive AMD version you really get an
identical body to the Intel version of
this particular laptop but this guy
starts at $5.99 which i think is a
fantastic price when you consider it's
got brushed metal it's got a big guy
touch pad it's very thin it's reasonably
light and its coarse Scott's got
Bluetooth and USB 3 and a bunch of other
you know extras you would normally see
maybe cut from a super budget laptop now
there is a little bit of a trade-off in
terms of performance you know and
e-chips for the last several generations
at least have not performed on par with
their Intel counterparts but if you
think about what you're doing with your
laptop you start from the web you're on
Facebook email maybe streaming some
video it's gonna be perfectly fine for
all of that there's even some decent
built-in graphics with am T's current
chip infrastructure it's kind of a CPU
and a GPU together on the same chip it's
maybe a little bit better than Intel's
current HD 4000 integrated graphics
depending on what you're playing and I
heard a lot of serious gaming but it's
enough to get you through there are a
handful of things that feel a little bit
cheap the hinge creaks a little bit and
it's not super sturdy even though it's
got a metal finish is very susceptible
to fingerprints and smudges but if
you're willing to trade off some of that
fit and finish and some of the raw
performance for actually a decent
battery life and something that just
looks a lot more expensive than $5.99 I
think you'll find a lot to like here I
am Dan Agron and that
is the HP Envy sleek book</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
