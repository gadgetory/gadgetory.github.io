plan you should probably keep track of
your data usage web surfing downloading
apps and checking email will quickly dry
up your data allowance if you aren't
careful of course cell phone providers
don't mind they're more than happy to
slop a ten to thirty dollar fee on your
bill whenever you go over your limit I'm
Sharon Vaknin and I'll show you how to
monitor and cut down on your mobile data
usage if you find yourself going over
your limit on a regular basis the first
thing to do is figure out what's hogging
data and there are three main culprits
here first cut down on your streaming
Pandora Netflix Spotify are just some of
the services that will kill your data
allowance in fact the guys at tested
found out that pandora uses 30 megabytes
per hour that's a lot of data especially
when you're on one of those 200 megabyte
plans apps are also data hogs
downloading applications on the go is
one of the fastest ways to use up your
data you're better off waiting until
you're connected to Wi-Fi finally turn
off any services that constantly
communicate with the network push email
app notifications and GPS should be
turned off whenever possible it's going
to take more effort on your part to
manually check email and Facebook
notifications but you'll save a lot of
data in the process once you cut out
those major offenders it's time to start
monitoring your data here are a couple
apps for iPhone and Android that will
let you do just that for Android check
out my Data Manager the app tracks your
data usage in real time and breaks it
down by app this way you can monitor
your data and find out exactly which
apps are the biggest culprits the best
part is that you can set usage
thresholds and mighty the manager will
notify you when you're dangerously close
to hitting your limit if you're an
iPhone user download data man it's free
it'll track your usage in real time lets
you set thresholds and sends you alerts
whenever you've hit them with these apps
and my tips on using less data you're
well on your way to avoiding any
annoying overage fees for seen it I'm
