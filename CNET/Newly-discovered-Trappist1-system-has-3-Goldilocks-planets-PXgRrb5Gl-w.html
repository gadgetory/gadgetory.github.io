darling star system in town okay so not
exactly in the same town or even the
same state relative to the size of the
universe but closest NASA announced they
discovered a system called Trappist one
that has not one not two but three
planets that fall into what they call
the habitable zone
that's when planets are in an area that
isn't too hot or too cold and
potentially have the ability to support
life as we know it all seven known
planets in the system are earth sized
and they're also much closer to the star
at the center Trappist one is that star
and it's much smaller and cooler than
our Sun so the three planets in the
habitable zone would probably be visible
in the same way we see our moon in the
sky NASA even made a super-sweet travel
poster with an idea of what that could
look like Oh before you start packing
your bags though there is a catch
trapper one is 40 light-years away so if
you were in a spaceship moving at the
speed of a jet plane it would take you
44 million years to get there as for
potential life on those planets
scientists need more atmospheric data
before they can determine if life is
possible on Trappist 1 e 1f and 1g which
they hope to get when larger telescopes
like the James Webb Space Telescope
launches in late 2018 for more
information check out C Netcom I'm
ashley Esqueda and until I can be a
robot living on Trappist one s be good
humans</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
