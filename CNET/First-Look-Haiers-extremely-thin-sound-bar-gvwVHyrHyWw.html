we're gonna take a look at the higher
SPE v40 slim this is a budget sound bar
system and it's currently selling online
for about two hundred and sixty dollars
this is probably the thinnest sound bar
I've ever seen it's just one point one
inches thick and that really gives it an
impressive slim profile it's propped up
by sturdy metal feet on the bottom and
there's wall mounting hardware included
to the subwoofer to is surprisingly
small and it has a narrow profile that's
just five point six inches deep and
subwoofer is also wireless so you can
place it nearly anywhere in the room
although it does need to be plugged into
the wall there isn't appear to be
anything else on the front of the sound
bar but if you press a button on the
remote the display lights up from behind
the speaker grille it's a really great
design because you get the uncluttered
front panel but you can also see what
input you're on or how loud the volume
is when you're making adjustments you
can control the higher either via a
series of buttons that run along the
back or via the included remote the
remote is okay but the buttons are laid
out horizontally which is a little
unconventional flip the sound bar around
and there are two HDMI inputs on the
back which is pretty nice considering
most sound bars don't have any HDMI
inputs at all the higher also includes
an optical audio input and a mini jack
input so you should be pretty set for
connectivity on the other hand the
higher doesn't have built-in Bluetooth
or airplay so you can't wirelessly
stream audio from a smartphone or tablet
although you can easily add that
capability with an Apple TV or a
Bluetooth accessory while the highest
than this is impressive it's even more
impressive that it manages to sound
pretty great even though it's so slim
the solid sound quality is mostly due to
the fact that the subwoofer and the
sound bar really blend together nicely
so everything sounds pretty natural
you're not going to get a ton of deep
bass from a system like this but it
handles both movies and music
surprisingly well and overall it
performs better than budget competitors
like vizio as VHT 215 or the yamaha ys
101 with great sound quality in ultra
slim design in a healthy set of features
there's really a lot to like about the
higher especially for the price if
you're looking for a budget sound bar
the higher
should be at the top of your list I'm
Matthew Muscovy ak and this is the
higher s vev 46</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
