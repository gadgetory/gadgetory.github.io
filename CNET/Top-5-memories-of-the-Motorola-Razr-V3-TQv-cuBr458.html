seller and one of the most celebrated
gadgets of the current century
standby as we chart our favorite
memories of the Motorola RAZR v3 before
they became powerful pocket computers
the most important thing for a phone to
get right was style and the razor series
had style to spare revealed in 2004
Motorola's v3 was the thinnest phone
around but from aluminium with a
nickel-plated keypad this thing looked
phenomenal hinges aren't something you
see in phones anymore but the razor
makes you miss the days of flipping open
a phone not only did it keep your mobile
screen protected it felt amazing the
perfect flourish with which to end a
conversation having online desk by
Monday today the v3 looks positively
stone aged but even at the time it
wasn't all that cutting-edge a 176 by
220 pixel color display plus a VGA
camera for taking still images were
warmly received but other phones of the
era had fancier hardware instead this
phone relied on its iSchool design which
saw Motorola sell 50 million VIII's in
under two years
motorola knew it was on to a good thing
and made sure there was a raiser for
everyone with an increasing parade of
colors and patterns designer models
charity models loads of variants with
slightly altered hardware the world
quickly became flooded with Motorola's
hit mobile the victory had a huge
cultural impact even making it as a
monopoly piece and Motorola really ran
with that success probably for too long
in fact and by the time the razor 2 was
released it was competing with Apple's
much more advanced iPhone Motorola was
slow to jump on the smartphone bandwagon
and suffered as a result but the Rays of
e3 will always stand as a testament to
the power of really striking design
razor we salute you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
