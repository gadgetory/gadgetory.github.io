money to get a great ebook reader I'm
John Falcone and this is the Amazon
Kindle for 2012 the Kindle is now better
than ever but it's also cheaper than
ever starting at just $69 for the
ad-supported special offers version or
$89 for no ads it's physically identical
to the 2011 model but page turns are now
15% faster unlike color tablets that
cost $159 or more this entry-level
Kindle is an e-ink reader that offers
just the basics books magazines and
newspapers on a black and white screen
unlike the more expensive Kindle
paperwhite and Nook Simple Touch this
Kindle has no touchscreen and no
built-in light there's also no 3G option
this is just a Wi-Fi device the Kindle
doesn't come with an AC charger just a
cable but the microUSB port is
compatible with most cell phone chargers
so you probably already have one the
Kindle does have a rudimentary web
browser but it's nothing you want to use
versus a smartphone or tablet because
there's no touchscreen on the Kindle
everything is controlled with the
on-screen buttons page forward and back
buttons are on both sides of the screen
so they're equally accessible for
left-handed and right-handed readers
controls below the screen include home
back menu and a five-way directional pad
to type notes or search terms you click
the keyboard button and enter letters
with the d-pad it's a pretty clunky way
to input text and a reminder that you
should not get this model if that's a
priority on the other hand if you're
just interested in reading books this
Kindle has some important distinctions
unlike a tablet or phone you'll get very
long battery life you can go up to a
month between charging with normal usage
you also get an excellent no glare
screen so you can read it in full
sunlight and this Kindle is less than 6
ounces so unlike many tablets it's not
difficult to hold even during long
reading sessions the Kindle also gives
you
to Amazon's excellent content ecosystem
and only Amazon since it's not
compatible with the ePub file standard
so while you won't get the ability to
buy from non Amazon stores you do get
Amazon's best-in-class book store with
more than 1.8 million titles and almost
200,000 exclusives and because the
Kindle can hold up to a thousand books
at a time and offers even more instantly
accessible from the cloud you'll never
run out of things to read
additionally Amazon Prime members can
get access to thousands of free loaners
with the Amazon lending library and the
Kindle can also be used to get free
ebooks from many local libraries as well
the other advantage of the Amazon
ecosystem is that it's compatible with
reading apps on almost any other device
so using the whisper sync feature you
can pick up reading any Kindle book
where you left off on an iPhone iPad
Android tablet Android phone Windows
Phone blackberry pretty much any system
with an app store or a web browser
Amazon also offers a send to kindle
plugin for major web browsers so you can
send long articles to your Kindle for
later reading it's pretty much a free
version of Instapaper as for the ads on
the special offers Kindle there
occasionally annoying but they only
appear on the lock screen in the index
page they never interrupt what you're
reading and you can always pay a
one-time $20 fee to make them go away
forever
while this Kindle does come with a basic
feature set it does a fantastic job of
delivering a no-frills
reading experience ad in Amazon's
best-in-class eBook selection and it
becomes clear that the Kindle is the
best overall ebook reader available for
under $70 I'm John Falcone for CNET
