and we're bringing you an epic battle
that has stood the test of time
it's a Throwdown showdown for game
console supremacy between microsoft's
xbox 360 slim and sony's ps3 slim our
judges for this fight are seen at senior
associate editor Scott the bottom line
Stein associate editor Jeff never backs
down Bakalar and you know who really is
a Tom we'll take all three judges blind
scores and average them out to the
nearest tenth the final prize fight
score could be an average of all rounds
using the same decimal system we're
going six rounds deep for this face-off
round one is design both consoles are
bringing their slim and spelt
streamlined designs to the prize fight
ring the Xbox 360 is sleeker slimmer and
improved in every way over the original
we like the glossy piano black finish
and its new edgy style but you still
have that sizable AC adapter the ps3
slim is the sleeker of the two and more
travel friendly but it's matte finish
takes away some of the sexy and it still
kind of resembles a George Foreman grill
and it feels a lot more generic compared
for the new xbox slim sometimes
makeovers really make a difference and
the 360 slim takes this design round for
the first time with a four and the ps3
slim gets a three next round the speaker
the standard Xbox 360 slim rocks a
larger 250 gig hard drive finally brings
built-in Wi-Fi you'll get HDMI and
wireless controls but its proprietary
hard drive is still a head-scratcher now
the biggest difference between these two
consoles is blu-ray the ps3 slim has
been rated one have seen its top blu-ray
players and it's now a real advantage
plus you also have a user replaceable
hard drive it's 160 gigs gives you a
little less storage it has built-in
Wi-Fi HDMI and it's Bluetooth capability
allows you to connect many third-party
accessories including almost any
Bluetooth headset plus the system is
already 3d ready for movies and games
through software updates the ps3 throws
its first
with a perfect 5 and the xbox360 gets a
3.7 dr. averaging two rounds Sony leads
by 1/10 of a point
but there is plenty of fight left round
three is online server group Microsoft's
Xbox Live service is the gold standard
for online gaming on a console it's
going to cost you $50 per year but its
ease of use the size of the community
and access to integrated services like
Netflix last.fm Facebook and Twitter and
more make it the total package Sony's
PlayStation Network is absolutely free
and you really have to give them credit
for that but it's not nearly as
developed and after all this time I'm
still waiting for cross game chat II
PlayStation Plus is a new $50 annual
service but you're really paying for
exclusive content instead of new online
features using Netflix still requires a
disk it's built in web browser does
allow you to watch YouTube content and
PlayStation Home still isn't a place
where I spend my time Microsoft strikes
back with a perfect 5 of its own and
Sony gets a three point three round for
is up next
and it's the only reason we're all here
for the game both consoles are packed
with franchise titles that each side
wishes they could have the 360 can brag
about the bloody battlefields of Gears
of War the unlimited adventure that is
fable and the world of Halo and Master
Chief but it's lost some of its momentum
the ps3 arguably boasts a stronger and
more diverse exclusive franchise library
with their modern-day Indiana Jones in
the Uncharted series god of War's epic
story and scale little big planets
creative community
heavy rains unique control system and so
many more now when it comes down to
downloadable games the Xbox Live Arcade
has a much deeper and diverse library of
games from the past and it continues to
release awesome new exclusives like
limbo the PlayStation Network isn't on
the same level with its downloadable
game library but it can still hold its
own with offerings like flower but there
just aren't enough of them you can still
play most of your original Xbox titles
on the 360 slim but backwards
compatibility on the ps3 slim is
non-existent both consoles have games
that make each one just as drool-worthy
as the other and the judges call this
round a tie at
points apiece so after four rounds the
Xbox is taking control leading by four
tenths of a point but we've still got
two more to go round 5 is graphics
performance the 360 elite and ps3 both
have titles that showcase their
graphical prowess even if it's subtle
the 360 Slim has shown to have a slight
advantage when comparing the same
third-party titles but then when it
comes to console exclusive titles the
ps3 really flexes its technical muscle
now Jeff and Scott called this round
even but if we're talking about the best
graphics available why don't you sit
down and play God of War 3 or uncharted
2 and show me an Xbox game that can best
them the ps3 gets a slight edge with a
4.3 and the Xbox gets a 4 now this is
still anyone's prize fight the sixth and
final round that decides it all is value
both of these consoles are $2.99 at
their entry level and you guys can argue
all you want about who has the better
games and who has the better graphics
but when you're talking about value it
really comes down to one thing and it's
the ps3's blu-ray player that will
support 3d content into the future and
makes the ps3 slim more than just a
gaming console and if you want to play
online with your xbox you'll still have
to pay for few more dollars per year in
the final round the ps3 slim gets a
perfect 5 and the Xbox 360 gets a 3.7 so
lets averaged out the scores for all six
rounds and after a back-and-forth battle
where both sides held the lead we are
tied tied at 4.1 points apiece now you
know we can't walk away like this and
this prize fight has to have a winner so
we're going to break this down by
hundreds of a point so do the math for
yourselves people
but after a six-round throwdown the sony
ps3 slim holds on with a 4 point 102 4.0
6 in the closest prize fight in CNET
history and is your prize fight winner
you
can't go wrong with either of these
consoles and if you're lucky enough get
both of them but Sony's blu-ray player
that used to seem like a gimmick in the
past is now the difference maker
I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching I
will catch you guys next time for
another prized life
