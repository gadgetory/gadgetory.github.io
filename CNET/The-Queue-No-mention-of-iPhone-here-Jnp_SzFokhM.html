connected plaxo iPhone camp guides and a
virtual desktop computer you are seconds
away from being all cued up hey there
what's going on I'm rich demuro with
Cena TV in New York City this is the cue
congratulations Hastings Nebraska your
name greenest city in America by Yahoo
funny I thought people actually had to
live there to qualify on to your must
click moment a digital newsstand talking
the day's headlines in a way the old
newsprint never could and made from a
used vending rack an LCD monitor and a
mac mini throne a little apple script
and the digital newsstand collects and
displays news just like him back to the
future if you're trying to tune in your
favorite internet radio station today to
help you get through the day and it
seems to be offline there could be a
reason you won't get static but you will
get a National Day of Silence on Tuesday
jun 26th thousands of webcasters turning
off the programming to protest impending
royalty rate increases on July fifteenth
some streams will be shut off others
will replace music with uncomfortably
long silence and public service
announcements all right there's my
contribution now I don't spend a lot of
time playing with plaxo but I've used it
for years and it just seems to work well
to sync your address book without a lot
of fuss but now they're getting all web
two point oh we on us plaxo version 3.0
is the first major overhaul in a while
it'll now sync your address book and
calendar between various sites so you
can have the same info on outlook gmail
yahoo AOL mac and your cell phone and
more 15 million people use plaxo and
it's good for getting automatic updates
to your address book just watch out you
have to be on your toast and say do try
to push a premium paid version pretty
hard I'll be covering New York for the
big iphone launch on cnet TV and no
doubt there'll be lots of people waiting
outside for the hype phone or at least
we hope so it'll make good video but the
smart ones will have checked out the
ultimate iPhone campout guides compiled
by travel site grid skipper the guides
clue you into nearby cheap hotels places
to eat and drink free bathrooms and
Wi-Fi all near the apple store of your
choice you're covered in New York LA San
Francisco and potentially even more
places finally the beta when you're sick
of lugging around laptops flash drive
other ways to keep everything everywhere
all the time vivio is the next best
thing to a virtual desktop now I haven't
actually tried this one myself but it
seems pretty cool it's like a poor man's
computer for 13 bucks a month you get a
virtual desktop complete with windows XP
five gigs of storage virus protection
and free applications including itunes
OpenOffice quicktime and firefox if you
pay a bit more month you can get access
to microsoft office there's also a sync
program so your data on your real
computer is there when internet isn't
very cool idea can't wait to try it
myself sign up for beta hopefully the
invitations in the mail that's it for
today I'm rich demuro with seen a TV in
new york city do yourself a favor don't
lose too much sleep over the iphone see
ya
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
