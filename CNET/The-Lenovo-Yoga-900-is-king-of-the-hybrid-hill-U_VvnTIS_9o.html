the hybrids I'm Dan Ackman and this is
the Lenovo yoga 900 and what a
difference a year makes just about one
year ago we were looking at the Lenovo
yoga 3 Pro it looks like Lenovo was
actually listening to everyone's
feedback on this system because the new
version besides changing the naming this
is now just the yoga 900 keeps the
things that we liked about it it's still
thin it's still light it's a little
thicker in heavier and you'll find out
why in a second it keeps that watch band
style hinge which allows the entire body
to be thinner and just kind of looks
cool but it trades up from an Intel Core
M processor to a brand new 6th
generation intel core i7 I think every
configuration of the yoga 900 has a core
i7 now which is great for performance
and we found out does not actually have
a negative effect on battery life this
thing I should get really great battery
life as well
now if you're not familiar with these
fold back style hybrids they look and
feel like regular clamshell laptops if
you didn't know as a hybrid you just go
ok it's kind of a thin Windows laptop
and then of course you can fold the
screen back and continue folding you
have kind of a kiosk mode if you go like
this so the screen is sort of pointing
at you and the keyboard is hidden behind
it almost like a base and you can
actually you know touch the screen or
show presentations or videos then you
can fold it back a little bit more you
could make it a table tent people always
say I never see anyone actually do this
but it's another way to present it or if
you fold it all the way down then you've
got essentially a tablet it's kind of
big and thick for a tablet but you can
hold in your lap and use it like one so
the keyboard and the touchpad are
exposed here on the back and the tablet
mode but it turned off so you can touch
them and and nothing's going to happen
there until you fold it back into laptop
mode just like that
besides the cool hybrid features and the
funky-looking hinge you get Lenovo's
usual really excellent keyboard
construction you've got these Island
Style Keys that just have a little bit
of a curve at the bottom helps catch
your finger while you're typing the only
thing that drove me crazy about this
keyboard is the fact that the backspace
key is in set a little bit it's not at
the end of
row here so I kept accidentally hitting
this home key next to it you could train
your fingers under a day or two to get
used to it I'm sure other than that
you've got great performance excellent
battery life and the final great feature
about the yoga 900 is really all the
stuff that you get for a pretty
reasonable starting price of 1099 even
at that lowest level yoga 900 you get an
Intel Core i7 processor and you get a
big 256 gig SSD that's twice as much
storage space as you get in a lot of
other laptops even at this premium price
I'm Dan Ackerman and that is the Lenovo
