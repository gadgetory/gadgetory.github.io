camera then there are lots of good
reasons to mount it to your tripod in
order to do that you'll need a
smartphone tripod mount which normally
cost 30 bucks but today we're doing it
ourselves for this project you'll need a
few simple materials you'll need a
smartphone case hardshell is best like
this one a quarter-inch nut and l-shaped
bracket some double-sided adhesive a
wrench and finally some spray paint so
the first thing we need to do is prep
the l-shaped bracket first of all I want
to give it a cleaner look but also I
want it to match my iPhone case so I
have some black spray paint and it's
really as simple as putting on a coat of
paint so let's do it okay that was
pretty simple now all we need to do is
let it dry for about 25 minutes and when
we come back putting together the rest
of the mount is really easy so our
bracket is dry and now it's time to put
that smartphone on our tripod so what we
want is our double-sided adhesive I'll
take one side off and stick it to one
side of the l-shaped bracket this
happens to be the perfect size for my
bracket but if you need to just go ahead
and trim it so that it's that nice clean
look okay we'll take off the other side
here and place it in the center of your
iPhone case
this looks about right just want to make
sure it's sturdy next we'll bring in our
phone slip it into the case
so with our l-shaped bracket in place
secured to our case the mount is pretty
much done and you're ready to put it on
your tripod so check out how simple it
is I already have my quick release mount
on the tripod so I'll take the l-shaped
bracket put it over that screw then
we'll grab our quarter-inch nut and
secure it to the screw and you can hand
tighten it but if you want a little bit
more security just use a wrench give it
a little twist that's perfect
and our super cheap DIY tripod mount is
done why don't we take it out for a test
drive
so there you have it a super simple and
very useful mount for your tripod and by
the way all of these materials they only
cost me a few bucks at the local
hardware store us for the smartphone
case whatever you want to pay is up to
you but you can find them for really
affordable prices online if you have any
questions or you want to show me how you
tackled this project
