at the galaxy skin in fortnight and I
gotta say the skin looks pretty cool the
eyes glow and the print on the body is
actually a galaxy as you move around the
galaxy displayed on your body also moves
around to reveal stars and nebulas in my
few hours of playing with the skin I got
a lot of attention especially before
boarding the bus people were handing me
weapons giving me jug jugs following me
around that my little Posse was actually
kind of cool I can also credit the skin
for delaying my elimination when another
player pause for a moment to admire my
character my teammate came in tried to
knock him out but we just couldn't
finish the job
now the reason why the skin turns so
many heads is because of the high cost
of getting the only way you can get the
skin is by purchasing a Samsung Note 9
or a tab s4 this makes it one of the
more exclusive and expensive skins in
the game a Galaxy Note 9 phone will run
you $999.99
while a tab s4 in the cheapest
configuration cost the measly six
hundred and forty nine dollars and
ninety nine cents now if you're
interested in the new phone the
exclusive galaxy skin might sway you to
purchase the note 9 the phone does have
a big six point four inch screen and a
pretty beefy battery now I'm not going
to bore you with the specifics of the
phone but if you are interested in
purchasing it I'll add a link to our
review of the note 9 in the description
below and for full disclosure the
footage you were looking at was not
captured on the note 9 but actually on a
Playstation 4 Pro you can redeem the
skin onto your epic account Wow on the
note 9 or the tab s4 you just have to
make sure you're logged in to your main
account the first time you launch for at
night on your phone this is important
because the skin can only be redeemed
once per device now I got to give major
props to Samsung and Epic Games for
allowing the exclusive skin to be taken
off mobile devices and onto any one of
the many platforms you can play for
night on but because the skin can only
be redeemed once per device you can't
walk into the store and use the
bleh model phone to get the skin also
fortnight does not have item gifting yet
either so be careful of scammers trying
to get access to your epic accounts now
while this is one of the most epic skins
I've ever seen I'm not sure the skin is
worth risking your account or shelling
out $1,000 but what do you think let us
know in the comments below if you think
the galaxy skin is worth a thousand
dollars and I have some good news for
those who want the skin but just can't
afford the Samsung devices I can say
that we are giving away a samsung galaxy
note 9 that's right we are giving away a
note 9 starting September 1st you can
visit cnet-dot-com-slash-loaded
for the low low price of free Plus keep
an eye on that giveaway page because in
addition to all the other cool stuff we
give away we are also giving away some v
bucks in the near future now if you
already have a note 9 or a tab s4 and
are having a little trouble unlocking
the skin it's not just you the process
is a bit more complicated than one would
expect Samsung says to make sure that
you play three full matches that means
playing until you get that victory
royale or like most of us been
eliminated starting a match and quitting
won't count after that wait 24 to 48
hours and you'll receive an in-game gift
box with the galaxy skin as a reward and
yes it's only a skin there are no
special emotes or pickaxes just the
character model so one final reminder
