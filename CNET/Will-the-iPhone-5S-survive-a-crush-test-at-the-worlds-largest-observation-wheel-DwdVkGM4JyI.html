Jeff Bakalar visited the high roller
which is the largest or which will be
the largest observation wheel in the
world when it opens sometime in March
that's 110 feet taller than the London
iein we did a pretty amazing and crazy
test like I don't know the results of it
but let's check it out see what he did
hey everyone I'm Jeff Bakalar here at
the high roller observation wheel at the
link we're going to see if this poor
innocent never did anything wrong to
know on iPhone 5s can withstand the
force of this monstrosity behind me the
biggest observation wheel in the world
the high roller observation wheel is
right behind us right here to explain a
little bit more about the high roller
mr. Eric Everhart is here he's the
general manager Eric this is quite the
impressive observation well tell us a
little bit about it well we're very
pleased and proud of it it's 550 feet
tall it's the largest observation wheel
in the world as you said we have 28
cabins each cabin has a capability of
having 40 guests on board at a single
time these little pods are pretty big
they weigh about 44,000 pounds and
actually have eight tons of air
conditioning so how long does it take
for the entire wheel to go around one
revolution it's a 30-minute circle Wow
so it moves just under one foot per
second okay and we're really looking
forward to having all the guests join us
right on so this is opening in March
correct late March ok so tell us exactly
how we're going to torture test this
iphone5s
we're going to tape this iPhone to the
drive rail and then drive it under one
of the traction motors that actually
propels the wheel around so so that's
the sort of gutter that the wheels pass
through the whole thing and these tires
are held down with about 5,000 pounds of
force
iPhone 5s it's pretty delicate yep my
money's on it'll be fine my money is on
my 5,000 pounds of pressure on the tire
yeah you know you'd be surprised what
Foxconn okay I believe you all right
we're going to go check this out and I
kind of feel bad for this phone
ready let's see what happens here's the
handoff Eric bye sorry
thank you the time is now
let's hit it boys okay here comes got a
good feeling
oh man let's just listen just listen I
think it's gonna be okay

to the stage alright back to you guys on
the scene that stage all right so we

magic I heard cracking it's down there I
