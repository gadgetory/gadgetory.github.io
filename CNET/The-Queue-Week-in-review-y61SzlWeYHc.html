rich demuro with cnet TV and we're
taking a look at what's making tech news
for the fourth week of may 2007 but
first let's get you started with a
battle of intergalactic proportions for
America's favorite new Star Wars stamps
those r2d2 mailboxes no joke it's all
part of a promotion for 15 commemorative
Star Wars stamps America got to vote on
their favorite which will be released as
a single stamp later this summer myspace
making a deal with various state
attorney general's in an attempt to keep
sex offenders off the site the deal uses
technology called Sentinel safe myspace
will check profile information against
state and federal databases to flag and
delete suspected sex offender profiles
according to news com the program
already flagged and deleted about 7,000
suspected profiles out of the 180
million on the site we could get a
little more freedom to copy
high-definition discs if a plan under
consideration by the big movie companies
is approved while the motion picture
association of america would like us to
back up our dvds by going to bestbuy and
getting another copy if you're like me
that seems kind of silly now under a
proposed licensing agreement consumers
would get to make a few legal copies of
their HD DVDs and blu-ray discs you can
even rip the DVD to a home media server
system the concept called managed copy
the studios would still have to approve
it taking you around cnet now sure it
may not be American Idol but web where
is now taking votes for the best web
apps web where is a scene at network
site where you can learn about cool and
useful new web applications the web
where 100 looking for the best in 10
categories you can vote for your
favorites and browsing media mobile
entertainment and more you might even
have fun just finding out more about the
finalists you're allowed one vote in
each category so make it count finally
the beta everybody plane ticket one day
only to find out the next at the fair
went down 100 bucks or so now yop does
got your back the website which means
your amazing personal travel assistance
founded by a former airline exec it
keeps track of your purchased flights
and emails you if the price goes down
when it does the site helps you collect
refunds
in the form of travel vouchers or cold
hard cash so far the average refund
running about a hundred bucks there's
just something about free money it's so
nice that's it for this Q remember to
