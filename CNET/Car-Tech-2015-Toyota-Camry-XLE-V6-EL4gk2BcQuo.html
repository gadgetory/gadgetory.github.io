scene is even the more suburban eyes
colleague of the Honda Accord but that
was yesterday let's drive the formerly
bland and appliance like Toyota Camry
this one a 15 XLE v6 and check the tech
and new reality
now if you buy one of these 15 Camrys I
can tell you you're not going to be
going to the junkyard to get replacement
body panels off of 14 every piece of
sheet metal's curves and bent a little
different than the last year car except
for the roof and if you look carefully
they've given it kind of an adaptation
of a Lexus spindle grille but with a
Toyota grille kind of graphed it on top
of it now inside the Camry is not quite
as new you'll notice that they've done a
much nicer centre LCD helper screen by
the way it's Lexus quality now here on
the main screen this carry is over
largely from past Camry is a 7 inch
touch LCD with voice as well but there's
no other controller no big wheel to turn
click and kick but it's very reachable
the buttons are large what's interesting
out below here is something new that's a
button I've not seen the car before that
is a Qi wireless charging button and
this to the right is a wireless charging
mat if you've got a phone it's either
compatible like a galaxy s6 or if you
add one of these little Qi wireless
adapters it just hugs the back of the
phone in fact a few months ago they even
announced the Mobile World Congress that
IKEA is going to build this technology
into their furniture so it seems as
though a lot of industries are
aggregating around this one now under
the apps buttons where most of the magic
of this system happens notice they
consider navigation to be an app though
it's not the kind of app you have on
your phone so a little interesting
language there the Camrys navigation is
fine but it's dated at this point it's
about the oldest thing in this - it
doesn't do online search itself you have
to bounce out to Bing or Yelp or
something else to do that and it's voice
command is serviceable but slow and in
Toyota fashion it locks out just about
everything while you're moving and
stabbing around its point of interest
databases to find relevant things along
your route none of its satisfying
traffic is provided in that nav system
by the HD radio rig so you're not having
to have satellite radio activated even
those car comes with its standard over
here on the right you get the more
interesting apps you've got Bing
you've got Yelp you've got open table
and you've got voice command on the nav
system for pio is four different ways to
in many cases get to the same result by
then all of use google voice command on
my phone as for meaning you're not
lacking any sources am/fm HD radio
satellite USB there's no hard drive to
rip to
totally fine by me interesting trick
here if I'm listening to the radio and I
hit the voice command button to do
something else for a moment look what
happened here it automatically paused
and cashed my radio broadcast so I can
pick it up where I left off
or if I want hit this button and
immediately go back to where it is live
click being a camry it's a simple car to
drive no paddles no fussy drive mode
buttons PRN D shifter kick it left for
sport mode and there you can also shift
manually if you want now onto the hood
of a Camry we've got the bigger of the
two engines this is the three and a half
liter v6 you can also get a 2.5 liter
i-4 that's also a hybrid I'll talk about
those some other time by the way these
guys are all taildraggers there's no
all-wheel drive on the Camry that's
current generation as you probably know
268 horsepower come out of this guy 248
pounds beat of torque now the weight is
actually relatively felt by modern
standards under 3500 pounds for this v6
based car 0-60 happens in like 5.7 5.8
that's actually pretty good
especially for a car that doesn't have
performance as the lead attributed its
brain MPG 2131 I was getting in the high
20s and extended mixed driving so
everything seems to check out and almost
surprisingly well now I'm in sport mode
and I'm getting on it right now and this
is a nicely programmed transmission that
is taking the engines power putting it
to good use and making nice smooth
shifts that aren't doughy we've got some
very nice ride quality here without
being wallowing here no on this car is
really good it's well done I mean
everything is easy to see there's almost
no button or display that is obscured by
the wheel or anything which we surprised
too many cars do that for what I want to
convey to you is the fact that this is
not a numb dough ball like perhaps a
previous Camry you've driven many years
ago as for the driver assist they all
seem pretty well calibrated to me blind
spot tech is about right it doesn't
early or late warn me about cars what
they've done they've basically gotten to
work
okay let's price our Camry it's
basically top of the stack it's a v6 and
it's xle which is the top luxury package
still we're in at just over 32 delivered
and there's not a whole lot to add to go
seen that style fine spot is 500 bucks
telematics they call safety Connect is
515 the tech package is 750 for cross
traffic alert that pre collision sensing
adaptive cruise and lane departure
warning and the Entune app suite with
JBL upgraded audios an almost paltry 800
bucks all in I can't even hit 35,000 on
this car top of the line load it up seen
that style now a Camry with this v6 is
not a sporting drivers delight but it's
also not a sporting drivers red anymore
I clean up that head you didn't give it
a whole new look and then I would take
one of these all day long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
