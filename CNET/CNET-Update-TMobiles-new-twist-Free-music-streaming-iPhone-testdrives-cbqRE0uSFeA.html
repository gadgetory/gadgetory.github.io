drive a phone I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your CNET update t-mobile wants to
prove to you that its network is just as
good as the other wireless carriers and
to do that it's acting like a car
dealership by letting you test drive an
iPhone 5s on its network for a week
there are no strings attached although
if you don't bring the phone back they
will charge you full price for it
t-mobile has been improving its service
and expanding coverage of it's faster
network but when you're the fourth-place
US carrier perhaps the only way to get
consumers to believe in the network is
to let them take the phone home for a
spin t-mobile has been making drastic
changes in how it charges customers it
killed contracts removed international
data roaming charges it pays you to
break your contract with a competitor
and it all seems to be working t-mobile
added 2.4 million new customers in the
first quarter that's more than all other
carriers combined and t-mobile added
another incentive to the list streaming
music won't count against your monthly
data limits you can listen to Pandora
iHeartRadio slacker iTunes Spotify and
Rhapsody without accounting against your
plan as long as you have a plan that
costs $50 or more a month now if you pay
for the $80 monthly plan with unlimited
data at full speed t-mobile is going to
give you a different perks top paying
customers get free access to a new music
app it's called Rhapsody on radio it's
like Pandora but you can skip as much as
you want and there are no commercials
that's available June 22nd there are a
few other apps to keep an eye on
LinkedIn created a new spinoff app that
is only for job listings it cuts out all
the fluff of the main app no posts or
people connections or recommendations
just job hunting and when you find a
listing you can apply and use the app to
keep track of positions that you're
interested in but if you don't feel like
being so serious check out a new app
from Intel
it's called pocket avatars and it lets
you send a short video clip message
we're a 3d cartoon face mimics your
mouth and your face as you talk it's not
perfect but it does succeed at being
silly
you can pick from many free faces but
some of them cost $1 to use you can add
effects to make your voice sound funny
this is intel's first smartphone app for
consumers and lets the company show off
the facial gesture software that it's
been working on for years
that's your tech news update but you can
always get more at cnn.com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
