more like jewelry than advanced pieces
of tech but this is no longer the case
with the up to the company's newest
activity tracker is more discreet than
earlier models and it adds a clasp to
help it stay on your wrist although it
stills falling off a few times even
though it's incredibly difficult to put
on the up to does everything we have
come to expect from an activity tracker
it can track the steps you take distance
traveled and calories burned it could
also track your sleep at night although
it's not automatic instead you must
double tap the top of the band and when
a light appears press and hold to enable
sleep mode I had some trouble with this
gesture and found it to be unresponsive
on multiple occasions and I frequently
had to tap the band several times to get
it to work but one of the best things
about the up is the software the jawbone
mobile app is colorful powerful and
frankly it's one of my favorites aside
from activity tracking there's food
drink and mood tracking and you can
create teams to compete with others the
app also provides you with smart
coaching recommendations challenges and
feedback I was challenged one day to
walk more than nine thousand steps
another notification reminded me to swap
out chips for crackers which would help
aid in my weight loss it's this sort of
feedback in smart coaching that makes
the up shine ask for battery life you
can expect to get around seven days
which isn't bad
although the up24 could last double this
the tracker is also water resistant and
can be worn in the shower but not while
swimming while the up two lacks more
advanced features seen on the recent
competitors like heart rate sensor or
even a display it's still one of the
better activity trackers out there and
that's because of the attractive price
point and superior software the up two
is available now for a hundred dollars
in the US for more information be sure
to check out my full review over at
CENTCOM I'm Dan Graz ever seen it and
that was a first look at the jawbone up
