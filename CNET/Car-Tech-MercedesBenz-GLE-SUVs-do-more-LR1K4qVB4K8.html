new york auto show taking a look at
Mercedes Benzes jee le range of vehicles
and the GLA used to be called the ML
it's a five passenger SUV and we have
two very extreme examples here first on
my right is the mercedes AMG GL e63 now
this is a high-performance model it's in
Mercedes Benzes AMG line they call that
mercedes AMG now so this has a 5.5 litre
twin turbo charged engine under the hood
that's got direct injection so that'll
do 550 horsepower 516 pound-feet of
torque you can also get this model in an
S version that'll do 577 horsepower 561
pound-feet of torque that's a huge
amount of power for this SUV now SUVs
are notoriously top-heavy so
mercedes-benz does a few things to
improve the handling here we've got an
air suspension and they're active curve
system which uses active stabilizer bars
to keep this car flat in the corners
keep that handling while keep all tires
firmly on the pavement we also have
mercedes-benz's all-wheel drive system
they call it 4matic that's standard with
this vehicle and that should help in the
handling now let's take a look at
another extreme example in the
mercedes-benz GLA range this is the
mercedes-benz gl550 II this is actually
a plug-in hybrid SUV you don't see many
of those on the road this uses a three
liter twin turbocharged engine under the
hood assisted by an electric motor so
total system output is 436 horsepower
479 pound-feet of torque that's much
more power than the standard gasoline
and diesel versions of the GLA but it
also should get better fuel economy too
with that hybrid system we actually have
a plug-in hybrid battery pack here 8.5
kilowatt hours there's a charging port
on the back bumper and that will give
this car 18.6 miles of pure electric
range that will also improve the overall
fuel economy quite a bit mercedes-benz
says this can get up to 88 miles per
hour in pure electric mode we also have
all wheel drive the 4matic system
standard on this vehicle although the
one compromise we get is the load floor
is raised a little bit to accommodate
that 8.5 kilowatt hour battery I'm when
cutting them here at the 2015 new york
auto show
