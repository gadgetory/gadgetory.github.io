unlike the modular like g5 from before
LG took a more mainstream approach this
time and from what we've seen so far
it's paying off the g6 is LG's nicest
looking flagship yet which I don't say
all the time given last year's g5 was
pretty mad but the g6 has a really
polished design its 5.7 inch display
features an 18 by 9 aspect ratio which
is uncommon considering most phones are
sixteen by nine because of this some
movies can make full use of that display
without any letterboxing on the sides
the g6 is also LG's first dust and water
resistant flagship on paper it can be
submerged in a meter of water for about
30 minutes for the everyday user that
just means it won't crap out after you
accidentally drop it in the pool or
skill coffee on it there are some pretty
cool camera upgrades to the phone has a
dual camera setup with 2 13 megapixel
cameras now on the back there's a
standard angle lens and a 120 degree
wide angle lens so you can capture more
content in each frame and if you're
really all about that wide-angle life
the 5 megapixel front facing shooter has
a wide-angle option as well one of my
favorite things about the camera is a
new interface feature where you can see
the gallery stream as you take photos LG
added a separate camera app to called
square camera aimed at hardcore
Instagram users it offers a number of
different tools so you can take neat
square photos what's the weather today
another software feature is Google's
signature AI assistant which is baked
right in aside from the Google pixels
the g6 is the only other phone so far to
have this natively you can chat with
assistant and use it to look up things
like random facts the news and nearby
places unfortunately the g6 does not
have a removable battery too longtime LG
fans this might come as a disappointment
since LG has been one of the few
companies to feature swappable batteries
in its flagships but it's not all bad LG
increased the battery capacity just a
notch to 3.3 ampere-hours and it can
wirelessly charge now yes even when it's
wet whatever you feel about this battery
changed there's still plenty of things
about the G sticks to look forward to
and with all the handful of new features
coming to the phone you might not end up
missing that swappable battery anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
