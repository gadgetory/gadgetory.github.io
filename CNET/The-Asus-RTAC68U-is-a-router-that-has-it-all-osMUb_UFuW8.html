RTA c66 you Wi-Fi router from asus is 0
because came out last year but still is
one of the top notch devices on the
market so the question is how do you top
something is already top notch well two
things first you get down low to talk
about it check a number to make
something that's a lot better and I
think Isis did just that which is all
new RT AC 68 you railroad right here so
let's see how much better this one is
but before I think should go and read my
review and the other one otherwise you
know no difference also it good for my
page for you so go do it now this is a
high-end true dual band 802 point 11 AC
or AC for short Wi-Fi router and that
means it support all existing Wi-Fi
clients on the market beat your laptop
your smartphone your tablet regardless
of their Wi-Fi standard what is new is
when you use this router with the 0
existing 802 point 11 n client on the
2.4 gigahertz frequency band you can
have the speed up to 600 megabit per
second that up from 450 mb per second of
the old standard and they are multiplied
by this router first of all it's very
solid and well-built it looks pretty
good it comes in a news karastan up
desire here and have a smaller footprint
even though it is actually larger and a
little bit heavier than the older model
and now it come with three detachable
antennas right here on the front here
you see the usual array of the status
light now they are very helpful but in
case you are bothered by them you can
actually turn them off via the button on
the back right here and now you can do
whatever you want to do in that dark
room of yours also on the back there I
have two USB port and one of them
actually is USB 3.0 that's 11 port and
for LAN port all of them are gigabit did
I say 11 port well actually I light this
is also the first I've seen that
actually can turn one of its land port
into a secondary one port and that means
rare
can actually connect to two separate
internet sources at 8am such as fiber
object and cable and in that case you
can have very fast you can ask me to
balance the load off a fail-safe in case
one of the source is disconnected now
most of us don't really need that but
for those who really want to be
absolutely online all the time that is a
great feature now the router has a very
good web interface with a lot of feature
foul in previous models such as a very
cool network maps here qms a built in
VPN server ipv6 support up to six gasps
Wi-Fi networks and instead of level 2
right here design for advanced and
business users most importantly the
router also excelled my testing offering
up to 65 megabyte per second of
sustained real-world speed now that's
about eight times the speed of a regular
Ethernet connection via network cable
very impressive indeed the question is
how much does it cost well two hundred
and twenty dollars if you find it
expensive it is but the good news is you
do not need one like this for your home
but if you can afford it I think you'll
love it from on the router here check
out my phone with viacom you should do
that because again it helped with my
page for you but most importantly in
find out how much is top the top notch
well that's because I'm don't go and
this has been the first look at the RT
68 you Wi-Fi router from a suit
