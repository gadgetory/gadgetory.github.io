celebrity encryption can be worth a lot
to you in fact it may be even worth
$15,000 this is the Silurian by
london-based company Syrian labs it's an
Android smartphone packed with
military-grade encryption antivirus
tracking software and a customer service
team that alerts you if it detects a
connection to a suspicious Wi-Fi network
there's even a privacy mode switch on
the back so when you're worried about
being tracked it turns off all sensors
in the phone only allowing phone calls
and text messages it's not a perfect
shield against hacking but it can guard
you better than other phones which is
why the company has customers that are
Hollywood celebrities government
officials and executives dealing in
secrets but if you're going to pay a
premium for privacy tools why not get
one in crocodile skin and gold trim
it'll only cost you a little more at 18
thousand dollars okay
the widest privacy have to be a luxury
for the rich the Silurian phone was on
display at the annual New York luxury
technology show alongside other tech
toys targeted for the lavish lifestyle
in my quest to better understand gadgets
for rich people I discovered that the
top 1% they like drinking beer just like
normal joes but instead of paying for a
6-pack at the store they may opt to fill
their own mini keg with a custom stout
that's rich the man can serves up craft
beer right from your own personal gallon
keg with a tap built-in for $200 its
small enough to even take in a backpack
for your day hike and when you need to
burn off that beer gut there's the luma
diet a belt that goes around your waist
and promises to break down fat by
dousing your gut with red light the
company plans to release it in October
for around $400 now does this work on my
thighs too because I could use one of
those let's drop around
but if you need some more red light in
your life you can soak yourself in it
with the lights dim light bed 18000 LED
bulbs hit you with a combo of red and
infrared light to rejuvenate repair and
energize every cell on your body
provided you use it while naked taking a
red light bath in your home only costs
sixty five thousand dollars as I lie
there in the blinding light I realized
the richer people with needs just like
us but with more room in their homes for
odd gadgets and they enjoy putting
leather on things like that crazy
expensive phone but maybe we can live in
a world where better phone security
doesn't have to come in gold dipped
titanium finish or maybe that dream is
just a result of too much red light
affecting my brain this is relaxing
