will arrive on the 29th of July here's
why Microsoft needs the next version of
its operating system to be a hit
Microsoft's biggest desktop rival is Mac
OS 10 and while Apple software has only
a fraction of the market share Tim Cook
and pals undoubtedly have the most
popular gadgets and have made moves to
ensure all their different products work
well together to compete Microsoft is
promising one app store across all
devices and universal apps that exist on
both PCs and mobile tech it's also
following Apple's lead in making this
major update free to existing customers
google has done a really good job in the
last few years of making the case for
not having an operating system at all
packing many of the services we love
like email maps documents and more into
a web browser shifting focus onto the
web and away from the desktop Microsoft
needs Windows tend to remind customers
what a fully fledged operating system
can do Windows is by far the most widely
used operating system on the planet but
this is a double-edged sword windows 8
hasn't been as successful as Microsoft
would have liked leaving huge sways of
customers using Windows 7 or even the
now unsupported Windows XP in a bid to
unify the world of Windows Microsoft
will put Windows 10 on phones tablets
even on the Xbox and while it's sticking
with its colorful tiled look it brings
back the Start menu which will go over
well with those who prefer the
familiarity of classic windows if
Microsoft can bring that broad appeal
Windows 10 could ensure further years of
desktop dominance and even start to
fight Apple in the mobile market but if
it doesn't win over the masses this
could be the point where the windows
dynasty comes to an end it's all to play
ball so bring on the 29th of July</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
