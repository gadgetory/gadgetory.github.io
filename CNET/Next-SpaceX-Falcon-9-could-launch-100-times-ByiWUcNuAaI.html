upgraded rocket that can mark a big leap
forward in spaceflight history Elon
Musk's SpaceX has been working with
reusable falcon 9 rocket in fact the
company just launched a used rocket at
the end of March and it plans to fly
more used Rockets later this year but
recently some used falcon 9 rocket have
been discarded into the ocean so how
many times can these Rockets be reused
before being thrown away right now the
answer is maybe two times but that will
change SpaceX has been working on a more
powerful version of the Falcon 9 booster
that can handle being reused up to 100
times we're talking about the fifth
model of the Falcon it's called the
block five and this could take flight
later this month maybe as early as April
24th the April flight is to launch a
satellite for Bangladesh and if the
rocket lands back on earth successfully
well it may be used again and again and
again and it's that kind of reusability
that SpaceX needs to handle the task of
building a human colony on Mars so as
for these older versions of the Falcon 9
reports say engineers felt that it
wasn't safe or economical to use it more
than twice so the company is trying to
use them up now and then discard them
but the hope is that with the block 5
model it can handle many many more trips
before being thrown away what's your
take on the future of the Falcon 9 sound
