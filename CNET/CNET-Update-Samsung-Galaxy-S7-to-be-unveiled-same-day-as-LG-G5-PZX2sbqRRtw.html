challenger to the iphone I'm Bridget
Carey this is your cnet update in just
three weeks Sam slime is going to show
off its next top of the line galaxy
phones the galaxy s7 and s7 edge will be
revealed at an event on februari 21st
which is during a big mobile trade show
in Barcelona Spain called Mobile World
Congress in this Samsung teaser video
you see someone putting on a gear VR
headset and then there's a glowing box
where the corners look like the number
seven of course this is to hint at the
galaxy s7 now some early reports and
rumors hint that we could see a microSD
card slot in this model to expand the
memory and it would have a
pressure-sensitive screen like the
iPhone it could also be powered by USB
see that's a new type of USB port that
offers fast charging and data transfer
and this is what it could look like
according to some leaked images tweeted
out by a mobile reporter Evan bloss and
he's been right about such types of
reports in the past now knowing Samsung
I'm sure we're going to see several
flavors of the s7 at this event but LG
will not let Samsung hog the android
phone spotlight on the same day at the
s7 event LG is having its own event and
we're expecting to see its new top phone
the LG g5 it's going to be a busy end of
the month for mobile but back to Samsung
those of you that use the default
samsung android internet browser will be
able to install adblocker extension apps
such as the adblock fast or crystal app
this is the same as how the iphone can
block ads with the Safari browser when
you download add-on apps this now works
for those with the newest version of
Android called marshmallow and supports
coming for those with the older Android
lollipop blocking ads could give you a
speed boost in loading some sites but
Google is looking to give you a whole
new type of speed to your internet 5g
and you may be able to get 5 G's signals
beamed to us by solar power drones
according to a report from the Guardian
this wild concept is called Project sky
bender and google is testing it now over
New Mexico the test is to carry the Phi
G signal by drones over millimeter waves
which is much faster than today's 4G
speeds but those waves can only travel
short distances of course Google already
has high speed internet as it offers to
some homes as Google Fiber but it could
be adding a telephone service to that
some fiber subscribers are reporting to
get invitations to add a phone service
to their package and it would link all
of your phone numbers even your mobile
number to one single number and the
features are the same as you would get
with google voice looks like Google is
going for the triple play internet TV
and now phone that's it for the tech
news update there's more at cnet com of
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
