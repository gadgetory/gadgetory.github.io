from vacation and welcome to the alpha x
for everything good and bad inside the
world of Apple now if there's one thing
I missed the most while I was away it's
you the Apple biters here let me wipe
that chew off your face okay now let's
get to the show and this is news I did
not want to hear it coming back
according to a report from the
information the new apple TV is expected
to be pushed out to 2015 after Apple
engineers working on the device have
been told not to expect to launch until
next year the alleged culprit Apple
employees are pointing the finger at
cable companies who they say are
dragging their heels and the pending
Time Warner comcast merger are the main
reasons behind the delays now the
content companies are pointing the
finger right back denying their role in
the hold up claiming Apple still needs
to lock down the deals with multiple
content companies to create the service
it wants to offer see it's a classic he
said she said right now no one's to
blame but bottom line we shouldn't
expect to see the new Apple TV this year
and that's really the only product I
wanted to see in 2014 well that and the
latest Shanti workout video should be
here we go oh shiz niz e is right oh and
the current Apple TV has been updated
with the Fox now and CNBC channel so
maybe that will hold us over for some
time in 2015 that we have no idea about
alright Apple refresh their entire
macbook pro line with retina displays
just like we said they would with a
speed bump and doubling the ram for the
entry-level configurations no major
broadwell chipset upgrades just a little
bit of performance boost and the
top-of-the-line 15-inch macbook pro gets
a 100 dollar price drop overall this is
good timing for the back-to-school
season like Apple has done in the past
and recent apple support pages have also
indicated we might see an updated
mid-2014 imac 27-inch desktop and a mac
mini as well neither model has received
any kind of upgrade lately but the apple
support pages were recently modified and
information has now been taken down so
it looks like this was a legit leak from
the coop town kids and we could possibly
see another minor speed bump and ram
upgrade but no major hardware changes
i'll write a lot of you have been asking
about this and just to get you up to
speed Apple has started to send out OS
10 Yosemite builds for the beta program
that will be sent out to 1 million beta
program members you guys can still sign
up for it right here and I think you'll
like it but do not I repeat do not make
it your primary OS you also want to keep
in mind that they won't be updating the
beta program as often as they will for
developers and you'll be able to install
the final release of Yosemite over the
beta version when it's ready this fall
and speaking of that fall release 9to5
mac recently reported that apple is
plenty to release the final gold master
build of Yosemite around October tent
according to their sources iOS 8 is
still set for September 9to5 mac also
reports their sources say Apple is still
working on a couple next-gen Mac line to
be released this year including
finishing up work on the long-rumored
12-inch MacBook with a Retina Display
that is said to be much thinner and much
lighter with an aluminum body now
there's also a new desktop computer that
is either a new iMac or a standalone
monitor with a 4k resolution the big
push here is to have a 4k retina machine
available with Yosemite with updates to
both iMovie and final cut to bolster
their 4k support all right let's take a
break for the App of the Week this week
my pic is the guardians of the galaxy
game for your iPad or iPhone it's five
bucks and sure there are a lot of good
games that are free that I don't want to
talk about right now but I'm deep in the
hype machine for this movie now check
this out the game allows you to play his
characters not just from the movies but
supporting characters from the comic
book series which yes
i have read you battle through 60 levels
of real-time gesture based combat with a
cool original story from dan abnett who
was on the writing team of the comic
book this movie is based on grew still
says those magic three words and you'll
get caught up leveling up characters and
using their special abilities like
Charlie 27s crazy spin punch now the
game has a four and a half star review
that's legit it's even the same amount
of stars as Kim Kardashian's app so you
know what's good this is super cute so
really is this game worth getting oh
yeah yeah can you tell I'm really
excited about the movie and since we're
on the whole Guardians tip check out
this awesome video from Matthew Pierce
who drew the main character star-lord
using mac paint on a 1984 Mac and sped
it up for our viewing pleasure this is
just awesome lots of detail and work
went into this and the final product
really just speaks for itself alright
that's going to do it for this to be
show send me your email to the
Applewhite at cnet com or tweet me at
brian Tong and i'll get back to you
after i'm done at the tanning salon just
Sokka I can even out my butt thanks so
much for watching and we'll catch you
all next time for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
