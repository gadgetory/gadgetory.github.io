iPhone I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update members of the hacker
activist movement anti SEC claim they
accessed an FBI agents laptop and found
the unique user identification numbers
for 12 million Apple mobile devices and
the group posted 1 million of these ID
numbers online this was done to bring
awareness to how much info these Apple
ID numbers can share and it calls him to
question what the data could be used for
now these IDs are not your Apple user
email password that you use to login
rather they are serial numbers unique
for each Apple device that can track
users although it wasn't shared online
the hacker group says the files also had
details about the address and cell phone
number of the owners there's been no
word yet on how or why the FBI would
have these numbers or even if they were
used for anything Apple has been
criticized in the past for giving app
makers access to these unique serial
numbers and Apple has previously said it
will restrict how much of this ID data

self-checkout kiosks before but there's
research being done by walmart and other
retail stores to take self checkout to a

scan an item as you put it in the cart
and then you take your phone to pay at a
small counter it's just in a really
early test right now but it's another
step by storage to get you using your
device to shop and to make checkout
stations cheaper it is official apple

device on September 12 Apple sent out
media invites for press conference in
San Francisco and there's a mysterious
shadow of the number 5 on the image
