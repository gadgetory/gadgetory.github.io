appliances and today we're talking about
the Nespresso virtual line so up until
this point the Nespresso brand has been
making a series of espresso makers for
your home but they decided to mix it up
a little bit with the Nespresso virtual
line because it can do coffee and
espresso now this coffee maker costs
$2.99 that's a lot but they're kind of
going for this whole premium thing with
their grand cru blend now Grand Cru is a
term that denotes a superior blend and
Nespresso shows that off with the crema
layer that layer of foam that you see in
their espresso that shows up in their
coffee - it definitely adds a touch of
decadence to your brew but we didn't
notice a huge difference in taste
compared to other coffee makers overall
though I love this machine I think it
looks great a lot of the other ones are
functional but they don't have any style
this kind of has a retro vibe going for
it and it's incredibly well laid out on
this side you have a 40 ounce water tank
the other side collects the coffee and
espresso pods after you're done using
them so this machine only has one button
to operate which is both good and bad I
love the simplicity of that you're not
gonna have to be bogged down with
pressing coffee or espresso or any other
options but the reason there's only one
button is because each of their coffee
and espresso pods has a barcode that
reads the brewing instructions so once
you pop the coffee pot in there you just
press the button and it does everything
else for you which is really really nice
but you can only use Nespresso brand
coffee or espresso pods in this machine
it's totally proprietary since it spends
time reading the barcode it also takes
longer to brew the Bunn my Cafe took
only 42 seconds to brew an 8 ounce cup
of coffee
whereas this machine took almost 2
minutes but overall I really love this
machine if you love coffee and you love
espresso and you've tried an espresso
brand coffee and espresso and are happy
with it this is a great option it is
expensive but it does offer a touch of
class and a little decadence
