2017 we review a lot of gadgets here at
CNET and only a few can claim to be
number one in their category here are
the best of the best the best
televisions of 2017 are the LG OLED TVs
here's what CNET's resident TV guru
David Katz Meyer had to say about the LG
OLED c7p the LG c7 has the best image
quality I've ever tested that's high
praise the c7 is also compatible with
both major HDR formats dolby vision and
HDR 10 which means you'll be able to see
a more true to life picture the LG b 7
oled has the same image quality as the
c7 but differs cosmetically and has some
different audio technology for a little
less money than the c7 unfortunately we
were not able to do a full review of the
b7 honorable mentions go to the 2017
Vizio m-series and the 2017 @tc LP
series roku TV how about a media
streamer to feed that TV the best one of
2017 is the Roku streaming stick plus
it's tiny but don't let that fool you
the Roku pumps out 4k and HDR video at a
price around $70 it might not have voice
controls like a fire TV but the remote
that comes to the Roku streaming stick
plus can control the volume and power on
your television and of course since this
is a Roku device you have access to tons
of apps including Vudu Amazon Netflix
and pretty much everything except Apple
onto the best headphones we've got a tie
between the Bose QuietComfort 35 2 and
the Sony WH 1000 XM 2 both sound great
and offer excellent noise canceling the
quiet comfort 2 has an action button to
call up Google assistant or can act as a
noise cancellation toggle the Sony model
offers atmospheric pressure optimizing
Nach it helped in airplanes the sony WH
1000 XM 2 gets 30 hours of use with
noise cancellation the QC 35 2 gets
around 24 audio around the house
check out the Sonos one which picked up
an editor's choice honors it also packs
a LexA so you can access amazon's
virtual assistant
20:18 Google assistant will also be
available along with Apple AirPlay to as
ty Pendlebury put it the Alexa power so
nose 1 is the first smart speaker that
actually sounds good with music let's
get to the best laptop and that is a
Lenovo yoga at 9:22 yoga so it can flex
in all kinds of ways the 9:20 moved the
webcam back to the top of the screen
which is a much more flattering angle
the 920 also packed Thunderbolt 3 into
its USB sea ports
what about phones the best iPhone of
2017 is the iPhone 10 yep the best
iPhone is the most expensive one but you
get what you pay for right in our tests
face ID worked fine which is reassuring
since touch ID was relatively reliable
the cameras are top-notch while the top
notch on the screen may cause you to shy
away from it and last but not least the
top-rated Android phone of 2017 is a tie
in one corner we have the Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 in the other we've got the 1 + 5
t both feature the new 18 by 9 aspect
ratio there's all the rage these days
the 1 + 5 t is one of the best value
phones you can get starting at around
$500 the Galaxy Note 8 is on the premium
side with a price tag of around 950
dollars
however the note 8 has a few tricks that
5t just doesn't the note is
water-resistant offers expansion thanks
to a microSD card slot wireless charging
and of course the S Pen if money is no
object
get the note 8 but the 5 t is a great
choice for the price there are a lot of
things we did not get to cover in this
video like other smartphone gadgets
appliances and wearables go check out
