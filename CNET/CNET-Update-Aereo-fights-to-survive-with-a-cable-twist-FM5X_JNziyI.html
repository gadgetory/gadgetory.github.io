Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update the streaming television service
Aereo is still fighting to stay alive
and this time it has a new legal
argument since the Supreme Court says it
acts like a cable company it wants to
have access to the same content license
deal as cable companies Aereo submitted
that argument to the Second Circuit
Court of Appeals and if you're new to
all this drama well here's a quick
explanation area provided a unique
service you could pay the company about
ten dollars a month to get access to
free over-the-air local broadcast
stations so instead of you need to buy a
digital antenna and hook it up Aereo
just handled your antenna on its
property and it beamed the content to
you over the internet and it used the
digital antenna loophole to not pay
retransmission fees to the networks CBS
the parent company of cnet was among
several broadcasters that sue dario for
not paying those fees but two weeks ago
it all came to an end when the Supreme
Court said that even though Aereo has
this unique spin on its streaming it
needed to follow the same rules as a
cable company and pay licensing fees to
the networks but streaming services were
never considered cable companies before
so that ruling gives Aereo a new
technicality to argue if the court says
Aereo is a cable system then Aereo could
take a new form and consumers may have
another choice for tuning in to local TV
now while Aereo keeps up that fight and
Facebook is facing some legal drama of
its own the US government may weigh in
on facebook's controversial and
secretive emotional manipulation
research that was conducted on nearly
700,000 users two years ago Senator Mark
Warner of Virginia is asking the federal
trade commission to investigate how
Facebook handled that experiment and
whether there needs to be rules or
oversight put in place for future tests
on users the Electronic Privacy
Information Center also filed a formal
complaint with the FTC over how Facebook
conducted this study the FTC is the top
agency to oversee consumer privacy in
the US and it has gone after facebook
before regarding how it handles our
data in addition regulators in the UK
say they were investigating facebook if
it violated any of their data protection
laws with the study in other facebook
news you'll see new types of ads on the
social network within a Facebook
advertisement and app maker can sell
in-app goods so that means instead of
just seeing an ad for a game you can see
an ad that lets you instantly purchase a
power up for that game that's your tech
news update you can get more details on
these stories at cnet com and be sure to
follow along on Twitter from our studios
