Gold it's the name of my cover band okay
so you're in the market for a commercial
van no okay
well let's pretend like you are for a
second because today we're taking a look
at the Ford Transit 150 now most of the
times you'll see this van operating is
sort of an airport shuttle or as a large
panel van for construction crew or
carpet shampooers or something like that
but this model is an XLT model which
means that it is sort of set up to be a
little bit nicer than your standard
white commercial van for starters we've
got this pueblo gold paint which really
is a nice way of saying beige but you
got to admit it looks a lot better than
the white that most of these vans are
going to roll off the assembly line in
we've also in the dashboard got a pretty
nice tech layout it's almost as though
Ford just wholesale ripped the dashboard
out of a 2013 Ford Focus and dropped it
in this van so here in the center of the
dash we've got the MyFord Touch
infotainment system with navigation
hands-free calling I've sort of
criticized the system for being a little
bit slow in the past and it still is
here and the screen is a bit smallish in
this dashboard it just sort of looks
pint-sized and really far away from me
which makes it even harder to interact
with
here's a cool feature with the barn
doors at the back of the van they've got
a locking feature so you can lock them
in their out position in case you're
carrying something that's really long
you need to hang out of the back of the
van you can also unlock them and have
the door swing all the way out 180
degrees for unfettered access to the
storage area now commercial vans are
very reconfigurable right now it's set
up to hold about ten people and their
luggage but those seats can be popped
out to make room for more stuff or the
entire interior can be stripped and
outfitted by Ford for whatever needs you
have with just me and one passenger in
it over the weekend it got about 17 18
miles per gallon which isn't bad I
imagine that it'll get a little bit less
than that when you fill this thing up
with people and stuff I don't spend a
whole lot of time in commercial vans so
the ergonomics of this vehicle are a bit
weird to me now one of the things that
is really odd for me is the sort of
weird positioning of the steering wheel
now I understand that I'm sitting high
and the steering rack is way down low so
you have to have a very steeply sloped
steering column but in order to sit
close enough to this wheel to drive the
car comfortably I end up sitting almost
too close to it which sets up the weird
irony of there being all of this space
in the van but I can't get in and out of
it without smacking my knee on the
adjuster for the steering column it's
just a little bit odd
the engine is as configurable as the box
itself so you can get the transit 1:50
with a 3.7 liter natural gas engine or
you can have it run on propane there's
also a diesel option you can flip-flop
the engine around when your spec in this
vehicle out to match whatever needs for
power or torque or efficiency you might
have now under the hood we've got for
its 3.7 liter v6 engine that's going to
put out about 275 horsepower and about
260 pound feet of torque that's not in a
mint amount of power in a vehicle that's
this big
so pricing a commercial vehicle like the
transit 150 can be tricky because well
every part of it is configurable do you
want to gasoline engine or propane
engine do you want sliding doors or barn
doors are you buying just one are you
getting the whole fleet it gets
complicated so let's keep it simple and
say that this model is going to start at
around $33,000 and something well
equipped like this XLT model is going to
run you around 36,000
