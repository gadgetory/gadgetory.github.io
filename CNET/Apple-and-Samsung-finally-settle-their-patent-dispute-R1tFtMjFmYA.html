finally end their patent battle the
companies have been locked in a bitter
war over designs and features in phones
and tablets for the past seven years in
May a jury decided Samsung should pay
Apple over half a billion dollars in
damages after an earlier jury ruled
Samsung infringed on some smartphone
patents way back in 2012 the companies
let a california district court know
they'd reach the settlement and a judge
signed the order dismissing all suits
with prejudice meaning another case
can't be opened using the same claim no
details of the settlement were
immediately revealed and it's likely
both companies will be legally required
to remain tight-lipped on specifics when
asked for a comment about the case
Apple referred CNET back to a statement
it made after the jury reached its
decision in the may 28 team retrial
quote this case has always been about
more than money
Apple ignited the smartphone revolution
with the iPhone and it is a fact that
Samsung blatantly copied our design it
is important that we continue to protect
the hard work and innovation of so many
people at Apple unquote samsung declined
to comment why do you think Apple and
Samsung settled the case drop your
thoughts down in the comments and stay
tuned to Cena comm for more information
