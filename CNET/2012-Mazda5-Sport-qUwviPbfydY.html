high texture isn't the phrase I'm
looking for but the five is still
intriguing let's drive the 2012 Mazda 5
sports and check the deck the Mazda 5 is
basically a mini minivan three rows a
sort of people mover style and size we
don't normally see in this country but
that sells well in many other markets
get a ride from shorty tours at the
airport in Kingston for example and
you'll be in something like this but in
the US this car is kind of a class of
one maybe its uniqueness is why Mazda
chose not to bother differentiating it
with tech now they sent us the base
Mazda five which for some reason is
called sport although it's got nothing
added to it that makes it sporty that's
just what they call it inside is a
basically handsome cabin the materials
are pretty good for this price class
this guy is sub 20 grand base I like
what they've done with the head unit
this one is pretty usable easy to get to
the buttons are in logical places let's
take a look at what you've got first of
all you don't have navigation not
available not standard not optional not
happening
you've got AM and FM no HD radio CD you
can do either a single slot or a six
disc with optional packages or trim
above this car Sirius satellite radio is
compatible on all models but not
standard not on this guy again
option or package it in and the only
other digital source you have is the aux
jack down here no iPod connector just
this guy the old mini jack plug so we're
talking real basic technology here now
overhead in this car you've got some
choices you can option or trim into
which would include a glass moonroof
again we get the base car so it's not
happening here you can also get a rather
inadvisable rear seat entertainment
system that is a centre ceiling-mounted
drop-down seven-inch LCD for playing
DVDs to the second and third row I
normally say don't do that because they
really get in the way of your
rearview mirror however the roof on this
car is so high it might not one thing I
do like about these Mazdas is this
eyebrow display very consistent in their
vehicle is a very Honda thing as well
this is a really great simple graphical
way to give you lots of status more cars
ought to do this we have kind of a
rarity in this car by the way because
it's a base trim we have a six-speed
manual this is the only trim level you
can get this gearbox in step up to
touring or grand touring and you've got
to get an automatic now a little
low-tech Mazda 5 is not worth a damn if
it's not good at doing stuff carrying
things here are your third row seats
which by the way it's pretty impressive
for a vehicle this diminutive and
putting them down is really easy
pull the tab flop there you go with a
flat load floor I got to tell you there
are a lot of cars that make that a lot
more difficult now the floor is not
terribly low because the back load decks
a little high notice the second row
seats also create a pretty much level
floor and the utility continues with the
side doors there's one on each side of
this little guy so you can open it up
pretty much like a skeleton see all the
way through easy load all around neither
door is power again simple car just
simple systems at work I got to tell you
I was deflated when this 2012 mazda5
arrived in our garage I recalled the
2011 model with its clean almost
handsome lines that did favors for a
cheap car but this overdone scalloped
swoopy thing going on with the side body
stampings is a major overcompensation
and i suspect it'll date rather badly
it's too bad because the rear pillar
blackout taillights and the rear
roofline are really nice up fronts the
motor sidesaddle front-wheel drive only
two and a half liter dual overhead cam
inline for pre basic stuff apparently
it's a holdover from their old Ford
partnership days judging
and that logo on the intake this guy
will give you one hundred and fifty
seven horsepower 163 foot-pounds of
torque that's good enough to get this
car up to sixty in now by next week nine
and a half seconds same difference
mpg though is pretty good for a big
brick 21:28 let's test this Mazda five
here on the most treacherous on-ramp in
the SF area a dead stop two full freeway
traffic entering the Bay Bridge from
Treasure Island and you've got about a
hundred feet to make or break
all right not bad there's enough power
here in fact it's enough power here that
I would consider the automatic I seem to
recall the last time I drove one of
these it had an automatic and I came
away thinking was perkier than this car
with the manual maybe of imagining
things but I at least look into it it's
not a car that's that much fun to drive
with a stick and the mileage is the same
automatic or manual gearbox so that
comes off the table as a factor spacious
greenhouse as you can see behind me not
a lot of blind spots just that very far
when we call it a deep pillar at the
very back of this thing but aside from
that it's a lot of good open space
smooth riding car quiet for its price
class it's just a pleasant vehicle
here's the bottom line every time you
get one of these in I kind of have to
fight to stop myself from going down to
the dealer and thinking about getting
one
okay let's price this little barren
wasteland of Technology a Mazda 5 sport
the base trim is like 20 grand out the
door with destination now to tech it up
and I use tech liberally you want to add
about twenty six hundred dollars for the
top package that turns this into a Grand
Touring that's going to get you the hid
xenon headlights Bluetooth hands-free
power glass moonroof and a couple other
niceties like a six disc and Sirius
that's about as far as you can go with
this guy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
