and we're heading back but a lot can
change in four decades how do we get
there is the flag still upright and what
exactly happened to the lunar module
after Stanley Kubrick stopped filming
the moon landing I'm Claire Reilly
welcome to watch this space farm the
scene at Studios in Sydney this is your
guide to everything on earth you need to
know about space and tonight moon 2.0
ever since the united states america the
hell out of the lunar surface in 1969
we have been fascinated with stomping on
that giant sky rock once more after all
who wouldn't want to take another giant
leap for mankind and follow in the
footsteps of two guys and then buzz and
Armstrong I mean Buzz you literally
can't make this stuff up let's recap the
moon was big in the 60s for a generation
obsessed with science and innovation it
was something to strive for something to
spur on innovation and of course a way
to prove to the Soviets that America
could own the sky starting in 1959 the
Soviet Union and the United States were
neck-and-neck in a race to reach the
moon the Soviets did a flyby so the u.s.
did a flyby
they had a booster malfunction we had a
launch pad explosion they sent a dog to
space and instead of saying hey guys
maybe this is escalating
we sent a shoot during the 60s while the
jocks were cheering on the Packers and
the hippies were protesting Vietnam
those quiet nerds at NASA and the Soviet
space program sent more than 40 missions
to the moon by 1969 the entire world had
moon fever the only cure take two men
and send them to the lunar surface but
just like a kid trying to steal his
brothers ice cream by the time we got
the moon we didn't really want it
anymore after the Apollo 11 landing in
69 the u.s. sent five more crude
landings to the moon
officially bringing ancestral arts back
for the last time by Christmas 1972 ah
memories
but I love affair with the moon isn't
over yet after all that time we're
heading back and no it's not because
Armstrong left his wallet behind it's
because we want to get to Mars and the
best way to get there is to go to the
moon first it's all part of space policy
directive one signed by US President
Donald Trump late in 2017 which aims to
get humans back into space and further
into the solar system we will not only
anti-flag and leave our footprint we
will establish a foundation for an
eventual mission to Mars and perhaps
someday to many worlds beyond to do that
NASA has outlined an ambitious
exploration campaign including multiple
missions into space first stop the moon
then Mars then stop for snacks at
Jupiter then until morning the
exploration campaign has some big goals
including sending humans on long term
missions orbiting around the moon
sending robots to the moon surface and
then eventually getting humans back on
the lunar surface - to do all that NASA
is going to build a lunar orbital
platform gateway it's a mouthful but
think of it as a solar powered space
station that will orbit around the moon
like the last outpost of humanity in a
space Western after we've built this
Stargate or more accurately moon gate
NASA will have a base to conduct
missions and get humans back to the moon
I know what you're going to say is this
about the Moon or Mars is this Ryan
Gosling or Matt Damon situation but you
can relax viewers nASA has room in its
plans for both those space hunks NASA is
moving to Mars in stages when the first
parts of the station launch in 2022 the
Luna gateway will provide communications
between spacecraft to the moon and back
to earth it'll also allow NASA to
transfer large packets of data back from
space with lasers because lasers are
awesome from 2024 the Gateway could
support a crew letting astronauts work
in space for long stretches at a time
and with the addition of an airlock in
the future crew could also do spacewalks
from there the space sky is the limit
NASA is currently working to develop
lunar landers to run missions to the
surface of the Moon for research and
even prospecting because if Armageddon
taught us anything it's that sending
miners into space always ends well
all that research crew support and
communications capability is really
going to help us long term as we start
to plan missions to Mars after all the
last time we landed on anything in space
Atari had this really cool new game
called pong
so yeah the tech wasn't so great but we
still have a long way to go before we
get to Mars quite literally the distance
from Earth to the moon is about a
quarter of a million miles the distance
between Earth and Mars on a good day
thirty three point nine million miles
those first Martian astronauts are going
to have a lot of time to catch up on
their emails but for NASA the moon makes
sense we can test out new tech set up
comms and work on our astronauts space
legs before we take the long haul to the
Red Planet it's kind of like pitching a
tent in the backyard before you go on a
big camping trip sure you're closer to
home and the conditions are a bit
different
and your system won't tell you that
she's hidden the tent pegs and then
later tell you that she forgot to bring
them so you have to hike to the next
campsite oh but your dad's already left
and you're on Mars and it's getting dark
and you don't have a tent and I haven't
forgotten Janet but the moon is the next
best thing so we're still going to Mars
we're just gonna pop by the moon on the
way after all it probably misses us
after all these years that time we paid
it a visit all right that's it for this
week's edition I've watched this space

they happen I'm Claire Riley for CNET
good night moon and Godspeed
umm what would I say they sent a rat to
the moon we said a cat to the moon they
sent a dog don't use any of this cuz
this is all garbage unlike your last
camping trip literally one job I haven't
spoken to her in 12 years it's fine
33 point 9 million miles do you have any
idea how many times you can watch the
Martian on that I barely made it through
once
just kidding Matt Damon I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
