playing around with this camera
the cameras are similar to iPhone 8 plus
it has the dual lenses but the telephoto
camera is different in that it has a 2.4
aperture as opposed to iPhone 8 plus is
2.8 aperture and this lens also now is
optically image stabilized to improve
your photos the 7 megapixel front-facing
camera now enables portrait mode and
portrait lighting still in beta on the
front so you can take selfies with the
blurred out background that mimics the
bokeh effect of the high-end DSLR now
look at the camera
I'm just using this selfie camera to
take a picture
the blurred effect is is similar this is
using two lenses to create that effect
but there's only one optical camera on
the front it uses its array of sensors
to create the effect so this is the rear
camera in portrait mode with the blurred
out background and this is the
front-facing camera which - my ID right
now they look very similar it looks very
good
I do think that the Porsche mode in the
selfies can take a photo of yourself
that you take with your own camera and
elevate it in bright sunlight when I
tried to take a selfie with the
front-facing camera in portrait mode it
had trouble creating that bokeh effect
with the blurred background so you can
see here there's a little bit more sky
in this photo and it did not enact the
portrait mode blurred background effect
and I tilted the camera adjusted a
little bit so there was less sky in it
and it did work if you're taking a
selfie with more than one person you do
need to be careful to make sure you're
in a similar plane so that one of you
isn't in focus and the rest of the group
is out of focus maybe that's a good
thing that means your photo bombers will
be blurred and not in focus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
