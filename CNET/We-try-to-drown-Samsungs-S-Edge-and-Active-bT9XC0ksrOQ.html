continues Samsung says that its Galaxy
s7 s7 edge an s7 active are all rated
ip68 which means that they should be
able to work after being submerged in up
to five feet of water for 30 minute long
story short we ran a bunch of water
tests on the galaxy s7 active some
passed some failed some really failed
like when we threw it in the pool
Samsung said that they found a problem
in the initial production line run and
that's the phone that we had they fixed
it now so we're gonna test it again and
we're bringing some buddies along these
two other phones that have the exact
same rating these phones are charged and
they're fresh out of the box I didn't
drop them I didn't dunk them they're
basically pristine so all three of them
are gonna go in the pool and we'll see
if they survived
well this is very very good news all
three phones have survived and the way I
know this is because I can see the time
and date on the always-on display now
I've just retrieved them from the pool
so they still have water droplets on the
outside and you can see a little bit of
water in the jacks but the camera lenses
are clear I don't see any water in there
on this phone at least that's the edge
and the active to my eyes looks good I
don't see any fogging on the cameras all
the water seems to be on the outside
most waterproof phones have nano coating
inside and that's what repels that water
so the presence of water is not the
problem it's only a problem if the
presence of water starts to affect the
way that the phone performs and a
problem we had before was that the water
got on the inside so far it looks pretty
good those screens are operational I can
take a photo and it doesn't look blurry
that was a problem we had with one of
the actives when it failed the photo
looked really blurry so I'm just gonna
go through I'm gonna restart this phone
make sure that all the buttons function
is there supposed to and so this phone
appears to be working just fine well all
three Samsung Galaxy s7 phones here past
our pool test which is a good indication
that Samsung did indeed fix the problem
that plagues our first s7 active this is
great news because with that water
resistant rating it means that you as a
phone owner will have one less thing you
have to worry about if you're at the
lake at the beach or even at the pool
