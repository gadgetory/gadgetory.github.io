there for speakers like the JBL pulse
and the beats pill
you've probably caught yourself thinking
about buying a Bluetooth speaker but for
me I don't care how cool it looks I'm
not dropping 200 bucks on a portable
speaker fortunately there are some great
options out there that sound great for
half the cost I'm Donald Bell and this
top five I'll be counting down Cena
executive editor David car noise picks
for the best sounding portable Bluetooth
speakers under a hundred bucks starting
off with the most affordable option at
number five the Philips sound shooter
forty bucks gets you a big sound from a
small size plus eight hours of playback
time the grenade looking design means I
probably wouldn't pack this in my
carry-on also the lack of a built-in
volume control is a little inconvenient
but 40 bucks is a great deal or for just
ten dollars more try number four the
cambridge sound works
oontz a more restrained color palette
than the safety orange of the sound
shooter plus you get playback controls
volume controls and ten hours of battery
life sure the name sounds like a
Norwegian venereal disease but just
think of it as a conversation starter at
number three the G project G boom may
look like Darth Vader's lunch box but
this $99 speaker delivers big-time bass
more than any other speaker on this list
it's not the kind of speaker you're
gonna fit in your pocket but you get
integrated controls for playback and
volume and a USB port that lets you
charge other stuff like your LG g2 or
maybe a moto G for a little less bass
try number two the UE mini boom at
around 90 bucks you get good sound for
the size plus the ability to pair two of
them up to create a stereo pair works as
a speakerphone to which the G boom does
not and it's small enough to throw in a
bag I gotta say that putting mini in
your name always makes me feel a little
emasculated but it sure beats spending
200 bucks on an over height speaker that
looks like something you wouldn't want
to find in your mom's sock drawer
alright
and now the best-sounding portable
bluetooth speaker for under $100 at
number one the JBL flip you can think of
it as the less flashy cousin of the JBL
pulse now
guess who a soda can sighs speaker with
good sound integrated volume and
playback controls speakerphone
capability and a neoprene carrying case
that could probably help you smuggle a
beer into a music festival
also since JBL just showed off the flip
- at CES expect to see this one go on
sale pretty soon alright so there you go
five great sounding portable bluetooth
speakers that are a fantastic value for
more ideas check out our full list of
rated Bluetooth speakers over on SEANET
and for more top buys from me
