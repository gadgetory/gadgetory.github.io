doesn't charge you more because it is
one and it's far away getting the most
buzz of anything in the Lincoln lineup
but is there enough of it let's drive
this 2014 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid and check
the tech so what is an MKZ
this one is based on a Ford Fusion but
Lincoln swears up and down from about
the shin level up it shares no parts
i'll take them at their word because it
doesn't look like a fusion in fact in
2013 they got this dramatically new
face' and run by the unscientific poll
on the street says that pedestrians and
valet parking dudes have told me it's a
good looker now when you get into the
MKZ it's a familiar cabin we've seen
that instrument panel before there are a
number of subtle improvements I'm
impressed with first of all the touch
response is suddenly much quicker on
this my for what they call my Lincoln
Touch and it's ever been before I'm able
to hit things once and have them work
that says enough right there in the past
my Ford or my Lincoln Touch did not do
that
beyond that the map interface and the
way you enter destinations has not
changed so if you're familiar with that
you've seen this before one thing I want
to point out about my Ford and my
Lincoln touches it's a very much if you
see it you can touch it interface
there's almost nothing on here that you
can't touch to act on everything here is
very direct and I got to give him kudos
for that something's there unusual only
on this hybrid are this energy flow
screen you will not have seen this on
another my Ford or my Lincoln Touch
non-hybrid
and like Audi for example Ford uses a
four corner logic upper riders nav upper
left is communication lower left is
entertainment lower right is climate
then you get two screens like this you
go to settings and you go down here to
your wireless and Internet and then you
go what
who put that in a car I've seen routers
that are simpler to configure than this
so they're still kind of drinking the
kool-aid your media choices are many on
these systems from USB drives you have
two of those my ipod and my USB driver
connected bluetooth streaming of course
SD card am/fm NHD satellite radio still
got an optical disk in here so this is a
really really multi-headed Hydra that
works well for all your media on the
other hand kind of a paucity of apps
really aren't any because the irony with
Ford products is that if you get the
high-end my touch interface you don't
get the broad support for apps that you
get with sync at a lower level that's
been a weird schism in the Ford layout
and it still continues here now another
thing they've improved dramatically
finally are these two touch ribbons for
volume and for fan now it works really
well volume goes up and down smoothly
the fan goes up and down smoothly the
first time other controls here can be a
little nebulous I mean you just touch on
the actual bezel here to do things like
temperature raise and tuning and
changing climate mode push button
shifter over here I have a gripe with
these they all feel and operate the same
way and that may sound obvious but that
means that they don't have a unique
personality which i think is important
for drive controls it seems a little
little too easy for me to change modes
now of course by not having a shifter
here and moving it to these buttons you
pick up some more console space and of
course we've seen the mini screens over
here on the sides of the speedometer the
most interesting one I want to show you
is the one that is a driver momentum
coach
they'll coach you into how well you're
modulating your acceleration your
braking even your cruising to maximize
fuel efficiency and recharge the battery
which is right next to it the sport
normal and comfort mode is oddly buried
here in a menu evie plus mode kicks in
when the car knows you're near one of
your typical destinations it learns
those and puts itself more into electric
mode as you approach one eco cruise
dials back the power during cruise
control so you may actually drop below
your set speed but save energy
of course there's blind spot and cross
traffic alert sensing and a forward
collision warning technology that
clashes a big light in the windshield
before you rear-end someone but as
otherwise mostly passive automatic
parking is something Ford brand's
pioneered at low cost and on the MKZ it
works really well but a near-future
model might have Ford's next level of
this tech which would also control the
throttle in the brake
not just the wheel
okay the engine bay of our hybrid is
hybrid two-liter four-cylinder lean-burn
Atkinson cycle engine is your combustion
component that's combined with a 70
kilowatt electric motor so what is all
adapt to 188 total system horsepower
ford quotes the torque as 129 wimpy
foot-pounds concerns me because 129
foot-pounds is about the same as me on a
bicycle this car weighs almost 3800
pounds it's not a lightweight yet it
still delivers 45 45 mpg
there's your payoff and zero to 60 is
fine at eight point eight seconds one
choice only on the drivetrain of course
front wheel drive only no all-wheel
drive available on this guy automatic
transmission there is no manual ok on
the road the first and the biggest
shortcoming of this vehicle comes across
and that is just a lackluster powertrain
get on the pedal and things start to rev
but the power doesn't arrive and the car
almost never runs in even mode which is
very nice when it works torquey silent
that's a cool thing about some hybrids
this one doesn't do that the engines
almost always on and it sounds like the
grinder they use at Starbucks now I'm
calling BS on that 129 foot pound rating
that just can't be right because this
car gets up out of its way quite well
just not in a way that's exhilarating
you hear that I'm stepping on the gas
the engine's going up and down and up
and down and the car's not moving in
relation to that it's just a real
rubbery and disconnected that said the
ride quality is quite good all MKZ is I
understand it have an adaptive
suspension this one certainly does the
steering's over assisted as well at all
speeds it just didn't do a good job
tuning that if they are going after a
sort of a precision import feel you
don't get that this is like an old
Lincoln feel ok pricing our MKZ hybrid
here's the big headline this is the only
hybrid on the market that does not cost
any more than the non hybrid version of
the same car
so about $37,000 delivered but there's
quite a bit to add to go seen that style
53 75 is the big one for the preferred
package including the backup camera and
sensors HD radio navigation blind spot
and cross traffic alert a power trunk
the bigger wheels heated seats
thx audio and more then another 20 200
or so from the technology package that
includes adaptive cruise control the
automatic forward collision prevention
and braking lane departure warning
active and passive and that very good
automatic parking technology finally for
1,200 bucks you can get a standard glass
roof like we have I'm going all the way
though 29.95
I know it's a lot to get a panoramic
glass room they do a nice job on these
cars it's a nice looking car it's got
some vastly improved cabin tech and
Lincoln's come quite a ways but not far
enough to make the argument to pick this
over much else sorry to say it but this
is a car that still needs another leap
forward
