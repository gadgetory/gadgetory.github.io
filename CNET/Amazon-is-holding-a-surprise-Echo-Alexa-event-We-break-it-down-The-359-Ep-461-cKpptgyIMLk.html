Alfred Eng surprise Amazon is holding a
product launch event today our own Ben
Fox Rubin is in Seattle for all the
latest news it'll happen in about two
hours or so 90 minutes but we've got a
lot of rumors to work with right now
we're likely to see a new echo dot and a
new echo show but some of the other more
recent leaks have suggest that we may
get a lot more things like microwaves
subwoofers in cars so I'm sort of in car
gadget a power plug Alberta anything in
here in this list you are particularly
excited about seeing other things just
sound like really random things they
just I mean maybe the power plot like
the smart plug like kind of makes sense
for for their end because you know you
have to plug stuff in anyway you know it
might as well make it Wi-Fi enabled
there's something like that but
everything else just seems like they had
like a like dart board with like
different products on it they just threw
stuff out of it oh microwave yeah I'm
surprised they didn't make like a smart
dart board that like I feel like me
would have actually been interested in
an Alexa power dart board it gives you
the score runs games for you that's
actually brilliant probably coming next
year but yeah this is a it's a weird one
because they've got subwoofers
amplifiers receivers the microwave I
still can't wrap my head around because
why are you buying a microwave from
Amazon just because it has a lexan it I
mean I think you know eventually you
know a smart assistant is gonna get into
every appliance that we own that being
said I don't really think that a
microwave is the best you know suited
device for that just because I get it
like you're thinking oh I can like put
my stuff in and just say you know said
defrost this or set it to like two
minutes but you're already there here's
the rug though is there are microwaves
that can do this they're already they're
compatible with Alexa you don't know the
beauty of the echo and Alexa is a lot of
devices other devices were already
powered by it so it just seemed weird
that they were going in going their own
way and just building their own specific
products to run Alexa I'm very excited
to tell my microwave to play the 359
podcast I don't think that works
that's awful then I know there's no
reason to buy that microwave
it's weird though right like we look at
Apple events and we say oh they're not
really like changing anything up or like
doing anything that crazy that's you and
then we look at an Amazon event where
they have all these different let's
change everything side come on we don't
need that all right so it's just like I
don't really know what the middle ground
here is that's the thing this is kind of
an extreme right I think you're right
the smart plug does make sense the the
amplifiers receivers Joan and cats were
here yesterday talking about Amazon's
kind of pushing audio that kind of makes
sense but some of these other things
were I guess it's just really cool our
update also doesn't really make that
much I guess it's like a way to get a
Lex into your car but no if I really
want to look I mean there are new cars
that are being sold now that have you
know like Wi-Fi connectivity or electric
connectivity to it but you know that's
not a lot of cars so it's just you know
the thing if you're getting this for
your car it's kind of useless unless you
have that feature maybe it has a built
in though maybe that's that it maybe it
plugs in gives you a car Wi-Fi feature
and Alexa maybe that would be a much
more interesting you know these are
probably all rumors were you know we
weren't pre briefed on anything so we
don't have any you know intel on animals
of that it's happening in about 90
minutes so for more of those events in
our live blog checkers I don't see that
in Russia I'm Alfred ankhs listening
that felt really long
and that concludes a recording of the
audio podcast this time with audio sorry
again folks technical difficulties you
know how it gets flame Brian we came and
played Benny we blame Ben this time you
anyways across the country it's hard to
blame them send you questions and
comments and we'll dig them out of the
chat and try to figure out what the hell
Amazon is doing today first let's start
off with a question from a peck did
Amazon actually announce this event is
this like to the public nope and then
well so I'm keen is asking why aren't
they streaming it yeah so this is really
weird Amazon did this last year they did
they did pre pre pre briefed us on the
existence of the event a little while
ago they but we weren't actually able to
talk about it I don't know if they
officially announced themselves we
announced this morning the embargo had
lifted at 6:00 a.m. Pacific 9 a.m.
eastern amazon might have announced I
don't even know if they did on their
official channels and they did this last
year no live stream which I guess they
kind of want control the the
announcements and control the story of
the product launches to really the folks
who are on the ground like I said if you
are really intensely interested in
what's going on with Amazon Ben Fox
Rubin and Rui Chris from our Louisville
smart home team will be doing the full
live blog so you'll be able to get all
the details we've got photos or we will
have photos as well as all the latest on
the various products I thought it was
more yeah I think it's more like a
control thing of you know being able to
hey look we know this microwave sounds
really stupid but look look look here
here's a story you're here yeah check
out look it actually is not as dumb as
the Internet's making out to be a kind
of a devil's advocate they originally
started saying like it'd be really
stupid to have a computer in the pocket
and look where we all are now that's
true people say that oh yeah why come
back well because for why they think it
was feasible they didn't think that
there would be a lot of logical reasons
I remember a lot of emails in your
pocket I love the apps that you love to
use I mean they weren't even in
existence back then I mean yeah I guess
I don't know like I I was a kid when all
that stuff came out and I was just
basically which what computer are you
talking about here but I just remember
thinking like this is like really useful
and
well then I can go on AIM like anytime
now I don't have to stay at home on my
desk
to do that I don't know yeah so maybe
maybe I'm also a lot of I think there
was all skepticism one day at first echo
arrived mm-hmm you know I was like what
the speaker why is Amazon making a
speaker Alexa was kind of thing but I
mean it was a talk let's put a kibosh on
that right now don't say oh like you
know what anymore
all right how much do we really activate
during this show when we when we do that
there's enough complaints in the
comments that I wanted to address it so
sorry it's just force of habit
there's there's that that in itself that
the that the name has become so
commonplace yeah and so household that
we all just kind of refer to it but it
can't fix itself and tell when it
shouldn't be triggered Alexei
so the a word back then I mean no one
really knew what the award was gonna do
what the capabilities were so I think
there was a fair amount of skepticism
about Amazon getting into a smart
speaker so the to be fair we will I mean
we will keep an open mind about the
microwave I am actually looking forward
to the smart plug if it's you know voice
controlled I had this thought the other
day of you know there would be a lot
more smart assistants out there if they
were in mugs yeah but like specifically
in like a power strip because like
people love getting power strips well
the problem with a power strip though is
if you've got five different devices how
do you house the power strip you know
which device you're referring to known
are like the power strip itself is the
is the smart assistant oh like yeah I
don't know that this is the lamp and
this is the TV and this is the narrow
like just imagine your echo dot but it
you can yeah but you can plug like five
other devices into it just to like
charge a phone or like yeah like I'm
saying you're saying shove the voice
assistant in the very common place yes
items in your home like I mean weren't
they talking about maybe light bulbs at
one point or another I know there are
like well yeah there are that speakers
now they're not smart to say that
doesn't really that's not what the main
point of a smart plug is those more plug
is to basically control other devices
yeah no no it's not the control other
devices you plug in one device
that smart plug and that device becomes
smart yeah because extension yeah I
wasn't talking about that I was talking
about like as like as a like power strip
yeah I say that would buy that I don't
think there's a Star Trek Borg joke in
there somewhere I'm not sure exactly
where but it's it's there somewhere
let's talk about do we have a head count
of how many things are supposed to be
unveiling today or we have a lot of
speculations the speculation we have no
head count our official head count the
the speculation that CNBC reported
couple days ago is a products in total
by the end of the year 8 ok yeah so
maybe we'll see 8 this time I mean
there's something I'm the more I think
about it alfrid the more your theory
kind of makes sense that they would just
start trying to shove it into everything
well everyday things not just everything
I mean putting it in the microwave into
your kitchen I know James fever was
saying something about maybe putting in
the oven
Ricky B said a toothbrush I think that's
stretching it a little bit but if it was
just kind of omnipresent instead of
having to like scream across the living
room to find the I think the the issue I
had with the microwave was a lot for a
lot of folks at least one of their echo
dots is in the kitchen so you don't
really need that extra alexa spot right
location cuz you've got the dot there
you've got your echo every time you say
her name you got to put a quarter in the
dish sorry I did it again sorry we don't
have a swear jar we have a smart
assistant chart we're just venmo it what
we need then is like a neural net
processor link so that they all don't
jump on top of each other because like
if you have more than one in your home
and you scream out at it aren't they all
just gonna activate the same time and
like cause no I guess they're smart
enough to kind of recognize where you
are they recognize like the closest one
yeah that was really frustrating for me
a few nights ago when I told my google
home to like sent an alarm
okay but I was in my bedroom and for
some reason the one in my living room
picked it up oh so the alarm rang there
no no I it responded there so like
okay great side so go to my
tell you like cancel the alarm then go
back into the bedroom and like yet very
close to my life beds and again like the
microwave in your kitchen Canon are
probably pretty close to each other so
it's kind of weird - have you ever done
dn't that's what I mean that's what I'd
be worrying about it I'm stepping on
each other's toes right yeah yeah I mean
I don't mind the idea of smart devices
it sounds silly but like I don't know
about you guys but my commute can be
really nasty some days and there are
literally days where it takes me almost
two hours to get home from here and one
I've got cats at home so I'd love to be
able to feed them remotely if I'm on my
mobile device yeah so the connectivity
there is valuable I have a smart
air-conditioner now that I can turn on
from a distance and I always wanted one
of the smart crock pots so I could have
dinner ready when I walk in the door but
I mean the idea of putting this kind of
connectivity and intelligence into
kitchen devices sounds silly on paper
don't hate it truly in the long run how
do you feel about it I just love that
it's going in a microwave just you can
just go and ask like what are some
recipes for a dinner for one mmm that's
kind of sad all right let's take a
couple more questions Mike Shaw well the
Amazon microwave work better at heating
up foods bought at Whole Foods that's
pretty good that would be really smart
of a product not energy from nothing rog
synergy really come on that was good
right life improvements what if there's
an amazon show inside the microwave and
you don't even have to set a time it
just already knows so like what you put
a show is inside the microwave to blow
up so I'm thinking this I think he's
asking maybe about the camera the camera
can like recognize what you're trying to
heat up
that'd be bizarre Oh Oh interesting we
may it's like a hot dog or not a hot dog
yeah I only have the two settings - well
they've got that scanner thing already
right or is that still in beta then they
have that wand the the wand or was that
oh yeah yeah
scan like a barcode and it could reorder
something what if your microwave and
your barcode so many things that Amazon
announces and I'm like I have no idea
what happened to this thing like the
buttons thing that they tried making for
the echo games that like nobody played I
don't know we're probably gonna expect a
bunch of these random one-off gadgets
today as well so yeah didn't they
announce the buttons at last year's that
like no one use it all yep I mean you
got I gotta give some props to Amazon
here though we're so like you know we're
just gonna try out a bunch of it sure we
are trillion dollar company you can
afford that throw money around and
random projects for a while and like
some of them actually do pay off like
they're like $50 like Kindle tablet
that's yeah yeah that's doing pretty
well for them look the echo started off
as an experiment now this it's you know
and it also needed like the echo dot is
also like that's like their best-selling
like a selling product on Amazon yeah
although apparently the Google home has
eclipsed it over the last quarter or the
Google home mini okay which you know
simply start selling the mini again
Google mini
I'm saying Google home mini sales in
total yeah but my point with the dot
though and like the fifty dollar tablet
and things like that it seems like all
of the experiments for Amazon that pay
off are basically they're really cheap
product so it's just like I would really
hope that today's event is more so
gearing towards that but I also know
that's not gonna happen because how
what's the average price of a microwave
and then how much more are you really
gonna pay for it to be like a smart a
smart microwave maybe they needed a 200
bucks maybe maybe they keep it yeah
maybe they keep a little cheaper that's
the Amazon way that's your right that's
every time they've done that they've
been fairly successful although you're
you're right I don't think I think there
will be some stuff for the more
budget-conscious folks that I think
there should be a wide range of products
today though just give me cheap stuff
Amazon it's all I want
well that's definitely what they've
accelerated or Excel dad that was the
wrong word is being able to make it
Summa bull you know we've got lots and
lots of fancy-schmancy tech out there
but not everybody can really attain that
the fact that they got the echo into
homes is kind of a testament to it
yeah and I'm only gonna Pat their back
so hard because it's still kind of
creepy but that's that's something to be
revered let's go ahead and take a
question from Jonathan while we're on
this topic now that the echo can control
Xbox and Cortana and works with Sonos do
we expect more announcements like those
we expect more synergy more partnerships
I think so yeah I think there's gonna be
more like soft whatnot software but just
like feature announcements for it yeah
just so we're compatibility with other
smart home products or compatibility
with other consumer electronics devices
yeah I mean the the Cortana thing I
think when it first was announced for
like oh that's kind of cool but then
Cortana really is kind of faded into
relevancy at this point so it's less
cool yeah we can say Cortana all we want
we're not gonna activate anything I know
Cortana so is that the call word
I'm just tempting fate here's a question
from Anthony do you think a Amazons lady
in the car will connect through your
cell phone similar to Android auto and
carplay it would be a feature that would
make ordinary cars more smart and
connected to one's home that is well
that's a little difficult because you
need to have the auto manufacturers
support for putting carplay and android
auto in to like the dashboard the
interface I was envisioning more a plug
into the ODB or ODM OD I think ODB
connection in your car from the wu-tang
clan yeah that exactly it's very bastard
alternate bass the connection underneath
the steering wheel you can plug that in
it could have a cellular radio and then
it'll have Alexa and I'll have a
microphone and speaker for for a lots of
access if you're trying to do something
but I would imagine most likely at work
with like the Alexa app on your phone
the Alexa app desert
dollars in swear jar sorry but the app
on your phone doesn't it doesn't respond
to them right I mean it's like track
said I don't like what you've done and
stuff but you can't use your phone yeah
at today's event do you think we're
gonna actually see prices or just
unveilings stupid if they dig right
price yes I mean it said the the only
reason like Apple doesn't well they used
to not or most companies don't
broadcaster prices cuz there's usually
like a phone carrier relationship thing
and was on just selling these things on
their own stores so they would I'm
almost certain they'll release pricing
immediately oh by the way and the for
the car thing it's obd not ODB offer
on-board diagnostics those are very very
different things right I know I know I'm
sorry
not car guy let's take a question from
APEC does or will Amazon support devices
like Apple does if they discontinued the
item oh good question well I mean it's
it's hard to say haven't discontinued
anything yeah it's like we don't really
have a track right sure these continue
older fire tablets phone I still use the
phone
I still use the 2015 fire that's the
original part yeah it is is it well not
not like like the original 7-inch one
not like you yeah you know with those
speakers they don't have an OS I'm aware
of that they get updated for so I
honestly don't know sorry
alright sorry I was in the middle of uh
sipping my breakfast and you've caught
me off guard
before we change gears we're almost out
of time let's put a dollar amount
speculative dollar amount on what we
think is going to come out today
start with the microwave what do we
think we're gonna see I'm gonna get
we're going to $250 smart microwave with
Wi-Fi integration and smart one
recognizing technology I don't know yeah
I mean I 250 would have been my guess
we're doing like prices right style yeah
yeah 251
yeah alright I'll be 252
yeah I actually don't know what the
average price of a microwave is so I've
never you know they they really varies
it's hard to say average price of
microwave you can get really nice
expensive ones but you can get dirt
cheap ones for like forty fifty bucks so
that's my guess than forty fifty dollars
right it's gonna be completely wrong
because what that's how much they have
is gonna change the world that $50
microwave yep come on man look if they
want this microwave to sell put put it
at like 50 bucks that's all I'm saying
if they want they want a home run here
there you go I mean they can stand to
lose some money okay they could actually
they have they've definitely
demonstrated the willingness to lose
money on products in the short term
probably an echo dot 3.0 probably
roughly the same price point right fifty
bucks yeah I mean you know look my guess
is it'll look nicer because of Google
home mini is you know it's it's a nicer
looking fresher looking product and the
the dot is kind of showing its age a
little bit well we saw this thing that
was a leaked photo from Fran droid yeah
yeah I don't know if that necessarily
could argue that it looks nicer it uses
fabric I think that's the key that Rick
you from Google yeah exactly
so this is you know the plastic does
kind of look and feel a little cheap
after a while I like the Kirby on top I
think it's a good I think that's a great
accessory it should be they should be
included in all it should it should work
with Nintendo where you can put amiibos
on it Oh like talks and way that
characters voice is only brilliant no
that's not don't give them ideas cuz
then they launch their own amiibo thing
that you need to collect yeah give
anything work giving it like a little
toy microwave to turn on your microwave
maybe the wall Luigi voice on on my
smart assistant yeah there is cool it's
not used in any games because he's not
in that many no not confirmed for smash
yet okay do we think we're gonna see a
phone do we know if there is any word on
the return of the echo look any word on
fire TV or echo being integrated into
TVs for the holiday season
oh ok it's a lot I've already forgotten
all the dairy I don't think we're gonna
see an echo look I don't think we're
gonna see a phone the phone would be a
real stretch at this point but what
about ramping up echo presence in
television and entertainment centers
well they already announced the TV cube
right I think that's the closest that
they will get I don't think they're like
in the business of making their own TVs
no yeah weren't in the business of
making their own microwaves either says
using Alexa now or they using Google
there are a number of TV makers that are
starting to integrate assistance into
their products but I'm not entirely sure
which assistant they're using it might
have been Google actually but yeah I do
see that down line I don't necessarily
see it for this today's event got it all
right just to take a couple of quickies
on the way out the door before we go and
put our ears to the ground on the amazon
announcements
any word on this alleged MetroPCS
rebranding Roger you know anything about
this I'm not aware of anything okay
sorry now it's metrop t-mobile light I
don't I don't know I don't know what I
don't know what the rebranding would be
I would that caught my attention cuz I
hadn't heard anything about it so I
thought I'd bring it up but sorry guys
thanks for the question anyways and one
more for the road what if you could have
the echo dot and Google home minis
positioned to surround sound speakers
for your TV and it still worked as smart
assistants now I think that would be a
great idea if you could just buy for $50
speakers and then get a echo speakers
and then just put a wireless subwoofer
in there how would work I think the the
knock is always then if you're gonna I
don't think the speakers are good enough
like you if you're gonna do that you
might as well just buy like really nice
speakers or decent set of speakers and
and then connect those two yeah I would
I would agree with you that like it's
probably not good enough but at the same
time I think that if you're the type of
person to use like your smarts B or even
consider using your smart speak
like a surround sound system you're not
really that much of an audiophile to
begin with you kind of just want that
ability to do that good I pretty much
have a jenk setup of that in my home
where but it's like not for TV or movies
it's like specifically for music only
where like I'll have them in every room
and I'll have them all playing at the
same time so okay I can walk maybe music
is always playing the quality is not
that great but like I don't really care
I just feel like that ability versus the
price that I think you probably get
better quality at a lower price if you
just go yes oh noes yeah or so those are
pretty expensive oh yeah but I mean if
you're if you are going for quality like
getting a 5.1 is not a cheap investment
in general even the cheapest sure is
still kind of up there but I don't know
doesn't my two cents I think we are out
of time if we are out of week make sure
to stick around
follow along with CNET we'll have more
and more from the amazon roger you want
to plug that yeah the 359 is available
on iTunes tune in stitcher feedburner
and Google Play Music Google podcast the
Amazon echo of course Unicom we will
have our big live blog of the Amazon
