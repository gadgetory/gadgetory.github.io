laptops and their tablets but they also
want you to know about their phones i'm
dan graziano i'm here with their newest
phone the zenfone 2 this has a 5.5 inch
full HD display and comes with either
two gigabytes or four gigabytes of RAM
which makes it the first smartphone that
would come with four gigabytes it also
has a quad core 64 bit processor and
while other companies have Qualcomm or
Samsung processors this has an Intel
processor just like your computer on the
front there's a 5-megapixel camera and
on the back there's a 13 megapixel one
and as you can see here there's two
volume keys similar to the LG g3 and g4
but on the top there's still the power
button the zenfone 2 comes in two models
there's one with 16 gigabytes of storage
and a slightly slower intel atom
processor that will be available for two
hundred dollars the next model is 64
gigabyte that's three hundred dollars
and has a slightly faster processor but
it's also the one that 4 gigabytes of
RAM which should help with multitasking
both models also have a micro SD card
and at 3,000 milliamp battery and 2 sim
card slots although one is only limited
to 2g speeds I'm Dan Graziano Cena and
