it's also meant for classrooms and kids
and probably your home at $329 it's a
replacement to the best-selling nine
point seven inch model that came out
last March
this version supports iPad pencil the
pressure-sensitive stylus that was
previously an iPad pro only accessory it
comes in two storage types 32 gigabytes
or 128 gigabytes for 4:29 we saw it for
the first time at the lame tech school
in Chicago and it looks hay like an iPad
the newest iPad almost seems like the
nine point seven inch iPad pro that was
sold back in 2016 there are some changes
this iPad has an a-10 processor 8
megapixel 1080p rear camera and faster
LTE if you feel like activating the sim
it doesn't have a side smart connector
like iPad pro models which means you
can't support those smart connector Docs
and keyboards but new accessories for
schools like logitech's rugged keyboard
case that connects via lightning are
available the iPad works with the still
the same Apple pencil for drawing or for
marking up documents in new I work app
improvements notably Pages Logitech is
also making a $49 crayon built off
pencil technology that's not pressure
sensitive but it is made to work between
iPads easily in school settings without
bluetooth parents Apple's aiming at
creating apps to make the most of the
iPads native creative capabilities
coding apps AR tools such as iPad and
other support AR kit and using Apple
clips GarageBand and other apps for
music video and drawing the new iPad
isn't a whole new machine really it's a
better priced variant on the pro and
Apple's leaning heavily on educational
support was newly announced apps to
deploy these tablets and schools but it
may very well be the best iPad to buy
for families and the best budget iPad
ever stay tuned for a full review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
