tips that everybody should know at
number 5 watch where you're going
apparently this is a problem people are
no longer used to being outside two
teenagers playing the game got stuck in
caves a hundred feet underground another
person was involved in a huge highway
crash because he was trying to catch a
Pikachu a 15 year old girl was hit by a
car while playing Pokemon go don't be
like these people play pokemon go
responsibly at number four avoid
squirtle map hear me out on this one the
first time you play pokemon go you can
capture a few starter Pokemon really
easily here squirtle Bulbasaur and
Charmander
but why capture them when you can
capture Pikachu instead when you see the
start of Pokemon ignore them and keep
walking around after ignoring them
around four times the starter Pokemon
will have Pikachu in tow
at number three naming Eevee you can
control the evolution of Eevee all you
have to do is capture one then edit the
name if you write Sparky you'll get your
Eevee to evolve into a Jolteon type in
Draenor to get a Vaporeon typing in pyro
evolves evening into a flare yawn and
number to catch them all alright no one
needs 40 pages however capture as many
Pokemon as you can when you catch a
Pokemon you get Stardust and candy
Stardust is useful and powering up your
Pokemon candy helps of all of them you
can offload unneeded Pokemon to the
professor let him handle it I asked you
on Twitter for your best Pokemon go tips
here's what you had to say Patrick says
if you want to know what areas have more
Pokemon blown up ingress the small white
dots are XM and coincidentally show
Pokemon availability mark says don't
download it take the dog for a walk
instead
and I say to mark my dog has been walked
so much more since you can hunt for
Pokemon and walk a dog at the same time
on to number one AR is a battery killer
the augmented reality mode is really
cool it overlays a virtual Pokemon on
whatever your cameras feed however it
eats up your battery life like a fiend
on top of that Captain Pokemon is more
because that you have to keep your
Pokemon in you without AR mode on you
will see a pokemon dead center turn it
off to save battery
but remember tip number five watch where
you're going for more top fives check
out top 5 cnet.com on my exact on I'll
see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
