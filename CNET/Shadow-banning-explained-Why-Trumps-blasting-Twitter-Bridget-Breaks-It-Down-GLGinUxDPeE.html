are being shadow banned from Twitter
President Trump is tweeting that this is
discriminatory and illegal cue the
internet outraged so what exactly is
shadow banning it sounds like nonsense
from a science-fiction show guys Steve's
been shadow banned by a demagogue in in
upside-down for anyone who is not in the
mix with the angry side of social media
this whole concept must sound bizarre
but there is a real thing called shadow
banning and unlike with Trump is
claiming it is not happening to
Republicans on Twitter let's break it
down
shadow banning has been around for a
long time on the Internet it goes way
back before Twitter or Facebook we're
talking the ye olde web forum days let's
say you were in an online discussion and
a bad user got in the mix maybe throwing
around spammy links or violating the
rules and just being an unwanted troll
an admin could make it so no one else
will see that users future posts it's
like turning the user into a ghost but
they don't know they're dead and maybe
they'll get the point that their
unwanted when everyone stops interacting
with them or they'll just get bored and
bother someone else so why not just tell
a user they are kicked off because maybe
they'll get mad and make another account
to continue the bad behavior Shadow
bannings stuck around as the internet
grew up it was read its only form of
banning for years until 2015
Facebook has its own twist on the
concept if a page is sharing hoaxes and
misinformation the network said it would
rather demote the posts so fewer people
will see them but it won't totally ban
the page so what is happening over at
Twitter now this all got messy when a
vice news post claimed a few Republican
Twitter accounts were shadow banned but
it wasn't true you could always see the
users post the tweets were not banned
nothing was hidden the thing that got
folks upset had to do with Twitter
search function if you went to type in
these accounts in the search bar their
names were not being suggested in an
autocomplete an example would be if you
type in Donal that's gonna autosuggest
Donald Trump or other popular Donald's
wait someone's name wasn't showing up in
a search suggestion bar automatically it
must be a conspiracy to silence
right-wing voices sorry it's much less
sensational Twitter says it was a bug
back in May Twitter changed his search
so that it wouldn't give high
recommendations to accounts with signs
of negative behavior so if an account is
getting muted blocked and reported often
well the system may have flagged it as a
problematic account
Twitter's head of product said these
behavior signals were causing those
names to not appear in search and it is
being fixed Twitter said it had nothing
to do with political views or the
substance of the tweets now when it
comes to if shadow banning is illegal
well I have some inside information on
this are you ready okay listen up social
networks can ban whoever they want so be
good on the Internet kids thanks for
watching hopefully that sheds some light
on shadow banning share your thoughts
about it in the comments and let us know
if you have concerns about the practice
be sure to LIKE and subscribe and hit
that bell to never miss a breakdown the
next time someone tweets about something
that gets everyone whipped up into a
conspiracy craze until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
