news to your mobile device no
accessories necessary I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your scene at update you can
now watch live television on the go with
a new service called dial and the first
phone with the service is the metropcs
samsung galaxy s light ray 4G you can
get a few channels in New York we're
picking up for and this isn't using any
data dial is a technology developed by
broadcasters and their friends to beam
signals directly to mobile devices
there's no subscription costs it's just
a special trip they put in and that
means you're going to be paying more
than typical for this phone because of
that technology metropcs has no contract
to subsidize the price so this phone is
going to cost you four hundred and sixty
bucks but this fall you'll be able to
get dial on your existing iOS device as
a plug-in accessory there's no word on
what the devices will cost but prepare
to spend anywhere from 100 to 150
dollars to turn your ipad into a TV now
would that be something you're
interested in send it out video with why
you'd buy it or why you think it's not
worth it and will air your responses on
the show if you played the zynga game
the Ville on Facebook you know it's an
awful lot like the sims well Electronic
Arts feels the same way because EA has
sued Zynga for copyright infringement
over the Ville being too much like its
Facebook game the sims social Microsoft
was describing Windows 8's new interface
style with the term Metro but now
they're not using that word the brand
Metro is being dropped but don't be
surprised if a new branding term will be
coined in its place so you heard in our
previous show that Google Wallet opened
its service to all major cards and a
google blog post said it supports Visa
Mastercard Discover and American Express
would hold on American Express said in a
statement that hey we didn't approve of
being included in the mobile payment
system upward well guess what it still
works and you want to use an amex card
Google and amex are just talking things
out so everyone's happy but you don't
have to worry remember when being on
Facebook was the big game changer for
the presidential race in 2008 well four
years later now the campaign's each have
their own apps show to how the
importance of technology evil
of Z trace President Obama's app Obama
for America is a tool for supporters to
share his policy stances and news and it
also has voting info for state's
republican candidate mitt romney is
taking a different approach those who
download the app called MIT's VP will
apparently be the first to know who he
picks for his running mate via a push
