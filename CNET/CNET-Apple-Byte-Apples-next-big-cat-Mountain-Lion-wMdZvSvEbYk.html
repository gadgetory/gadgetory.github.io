welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
and it's all about the news that no one
saw coming apple's announcement for OS
10.8 mountain lion now you notice
they've removed the mac from the name
too and now it's just OS 10 apple's
latest operating system that will be
available later this summer really
merges iOS and the mac OS deeply
together for the very first time iOS
users love the addition of notifications
even if android users weren't that
impressed so the vega is bringing the
Notification Center to their newest cat
you'll be able to see the notifications
bar by sliding your two fingers to the
left to reveal itself and notifications
will appear as they happen in the top
right hand corner with the ability to
control how they're displayed in the
preferences also mountain lion is
completely integrated with iCloud
support and it brings two new apps for
you reminders and notes that will
seamlessly sync to your iOS devices in
addition to keeping your mail contacts
calendar and more in sync across all
your Apple devices now apples messages
replaces i chat with a new look and feel
it will let you send unlimited messages
to anyone on an Apple device with the
messages app it will also support aim
jabber google talk and yahoo messenger
directly in the app plus you'll be able
to switch to FaceTime directly with just
one click now another feature I'll use a
lot is share sheets which will now
enable you to share links photos and
videos directly from different apps like
Safari and others that can be posted on
Twitter vimeo and flickr with mountain
lions new ability to have automatic
integration with those services OS 10.8
will also have airplay mirroring support
that will allow you to stream what's on
your mac to your HDTV with an Apple TV
and this is a big-time feature that
we've been waiting for on the mac
platform and it's probably the most
exciting feature for me and a few quick
ones gatekeeper is improved security
that gives you more control over what to
download at your computer and where it's
from to be sure it's not malicious game
center support comes to the mac and
you'll be able to compete against your
friends and check out the leaderboards
from your desktop plus the new OS 10
will bring support for many popular
chinese services so there's an overview
of what we expect to see an OS 10.8
mountain lion and there's no
pricing or official release date yet now
the other nugget that I can pull from
this is if Apple's previewing mountain
line for us now WWDC is going to be huge
since there won't be a focus on OS 10
and yes I know what you're thinking
it'll be huge as an iphone 5 huge plus
think about it iOS 6 and possibly even
more now developers have access to the
mountain line preview right now and
they'll also be able to get a look at
the pre-release of Safari 5.2 that
finally includes a unified google chrome
like search bar and if you want to get
your hands on the public beta version of
the new messages app you can download it
from this link here it only works if you
have lines so it's a little bit of
mountain lion on lion action that's hot
now unfortunately when it comes to the
new OS later this summer it might be
time for you to upgrade your computers
because several older macs will not be
compatible including the early two
thousand eight macbook air and intel
core 2 duo macbooks from late two
thousand seven to two thousand eight are
out the mid-2007 Mac Mini and the 2006
polycarbonate IMAX and for those macs we
wanted to honor them with a moment of
silence
I'm sorry a little emotional okay let's
check out our app of the week the app of
the week is clear and it's 99 cents
right now and it's really the most
innovative and fun to do list on iOS
with a sleek UI and some major fidget
factor now you have multiple lists and
the color coding shows you the priority
of the to-do item you can create a new
item by either pulling down so it
appears on the top tapping on the bottom
so it's the last item or pinching apart
so to appear between 22 dues swiping to
the right completes an item and swiping
to the left deletes it its main drawback
is that it currently does not support a
third party or webdav calendaring
systems but at the very least it could
build I cloud data support for the app
in the future but it won't be integrated
with your iOS or max reminders it's
we're checking out and I'd recommend you
give it a look I love it a lot so I
wanted to make that clear to you all
right onto the quick bites if you're
wondering why people might be making a
mad dash to sell their iPad tues on ebay
multiple reports are claiming and others
are confirming that apple's event will
be held on March the seventh in San
Francisco Apple has not released the
official day but all signs point to
wednesday marks the 7th so Circle your
calendars and did you know it's also the
same day that the board game monopoly
was invented in 1933 hey Brian one no
one else happened on that day baseball
commissioner Ford Frick endorsed the use
of the spitball thanks charlie all right
guys Apple will be changing their policy
and will now require companies and their
apps that use address book data to
explicitly ask for permission to do so
this comes after a week that revealed
some of the big names in the app world
like Twitter Foursquare Yelp and more
we're accessing transmitting and even
storing users contact data on their
servers without permission path was the
first app that was exposed than others
came forward and some even quietly
changed their app to ask permission like
Instagram did alright guys that's going
to do it for this week's show email us
at the apple byte at cnet com thanks so
much for watching i'm brian Tong will
catch you guys next time for another
bite of the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
