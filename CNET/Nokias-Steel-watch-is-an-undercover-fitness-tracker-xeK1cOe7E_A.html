that you wear around your wrist the
nokia still is a SmartWatch for those
who don't actually like smartwatches if
you find wearables from other brands too
clunky or newfangled
you'll rejoice in the steel simplicity
at first glance it looks like an
ordinary wristwatch a stylish one for
sure but there's no hint at any
technological sorcery going on inside
but sorcery there is the Nokia steel
houses fitness and sleep trackers inside
there's no screen on the watch itself so
you'll get all your data through a
dedicated app so yeah it's a nifty
device if you're not about the seeker
look of most swamp watches plus unlike
other wearables which you have to
recharge every few days Nokia says the
battery on the steel will last a whole
eight months but still there's less
appeal if you've already owned a
SmartWatch or a dedicated fitness
tracker the still is fairly feature
light it'll tell you how many steps you
walked in a day as well as the total
distance you traveled by foot it also
calculates how many calories you burn
but since there's no heart rate tracking
that's just a calculation based on your
profile then there's the sleep tracking
if you sleep with your skill on it'll
tell you how much sleep you got how many
times you woke up during your sleep and
how long it actually took you to get to
sleep I'm sketchy on that feature though
as it's often said it took me minutes to
sleep when I know it was closer to an
hour the watch has a silent alarm
feature but it doesn't vibrate hard
enough it's failed to wake me up on
numerous occasions I still also had some
trouble recognizing when I was actually
sleeping or actually when I wasn't
sleeping
there were times where I thought I was
getting some shut-eye when I was
actually sitting at my desk totally
working many users have also reported
having issues with the app specifically
in importing data from other apps I had
some trouble syncing the watch to my
phone as in no matter what I did it
wouldn't work but after a few days it
did and since then I've had little
trouble there are some kinks to smooth
out and the fitness tracking isn't as
robust as it should be for the price
point but that's not the point of the
nokia steal it's a stylish wristwatch
first and a tech wearable second it's
not the best SmartWatch for the gym but
it is one of the only ones that won't
get you gorked at and a night out for
