stage we're here live at international
CES 2015 I'm Brian cooling me and
joining me I'm very proud to announce
we've got mark fields the CEO of Ford
mark welcome Brian thanks for having
nice to have you here you are new on the
job but not new to Ford six months now
is CEO we've had your predecessor Alan
Mulally up here several times this is
all from the time eight years ago when
you were first here yeah to announce
sync now eight years later is also
mapped very much to the rise the
Renaissance of automakers here at CES
your quick take wire car makers at CES
well I think we're here we've been
coming here for eight years now because
it's a great place to showcase our
innovations and when you look at CES it
allows us to reach a different type of
audience but also when you look at the
features and the technologies in our
vehicles these days you know it's very
much like a lot of the consumer
electronics type of technologies that
are here so it's a perfect match the
industry has trended more toward an
electronic information driven connected
area are you differentiating less on the
traditional values of styling and
engineering absolutely not first you
know we we think of ourselves obviously
as a car truck company but also as a
mobility company and a technology
company so we're not going to take our
eyes off that ball of great styling
making sure we have great fuel economy
safety great quality and smart
technology in the vehicle because we
realize you know what car is it is a
very emotional purchase for folks then
won't have to be in love with a car to
buy a car it's a big deal exactly
exactly people are spending a lot of
money on it and they want to make sure
that they're they're in love with it you
talk about this technology you're
talking about sync 3 is your new
announcement and you were doubling down
on your keynote this morning myford
touch was a bit of a hiccup what about
sing 3 is different you didn't just
repair myford touch you made a clean
break you've got a new technology
partner under the hood
with Q Nix what is the strategy now well
first off with a with st. the original
sink system in my for touch we've been
extremely successful with that system we
have 10 million vehicles around the
world that have sink in it in my four
touch we learned some lessons and we've
taken those lessons and we've actually
improved the quality of our current
system where the latest JD power results
were among the leaders in terms of
quality and usability of the system so
now what we've done is we've taken those
eight years of experience eight years of
feedback from customers and we've used
that to create sync 3 which are next
it's our next generation system so what
it's going to have it's going to have
more conversational voice activation so
enhanced voice commands it's going to
have a graphical user interface which is
more to ative to use it'll be more
smartphone like so you can pinch and
swipe and do things that you're doing on
your smartphone it'll be faster so the
latency will be much more responsive it
will also have series eyes-free on it so
customers who have iphones and then
finally it'll also have the ability to
get used Wi-Fi to get updated as we
update sync 3 over time a customer will
be able for example to use their home
Wi-Fi and be able to do that through
their vehicle this brings me to the area
of how you're going to integrate apple
carplay or android auto you're a partner
with both at what point do you give up
some real estate to them or not do you
float all three systems i'll have a four
to the future with car play android auto
and sync 3 and how do you parlay that to
the driver well that's a really
important question because as a
manufacturer and as a brand we want to
make sure that our Ford's all have the
Ford taste to it in terms of the feel
how the vehicle how the customer
interacts with the vehicle at the same
time we also have to realize that
customers have their phones and they
like their phones and they like the way
those is the the detention if you will
it's its attention but also our approach
is how do we collaborate how do we make
sure we can satisfy that desire of the
customer but at the same time not give
up control of the vehicle things like
the climate control things like you know
navigation things like how you use your
phone you don't let it on auto player
into those critical systems do you well
those mission-critical systems they get
into you know braking acceleration
things of that
nature clearly the safety of our
customers is the most important thing
and we want to make sure there's a true
you know bifurcation in our systems and
a firewall between that but for us it's
all about you know collabera the first
listening to the customer and then
working a partner with it you're
partnering with others as we're doing
with with Google on a number of
different things and as we're going to
do on carp light you heard our I heard
you today say in your keynote you made
very clear the relationship on data is
going to be one where its user
permission from these new apps and
services nothing released without
forward permission underneath that that
I also read oh by the way Apple and
Google it's our relationship with the
customer is that also being said in
there well I think you know this is kind
of a bit of uncharted territory in the
industry as we go forward first off you
have to have customers who are willing
to share data and are willing to opt in
and for us as a company this is a new
area for them they know about showing on
their phones but the car is different
right it's different its location it's
where you're at its speed it's all those
type of things so for us we want to make
sure that we are trusted stewards of
that data customer owns the data and we
want to be trusted stewards so at the
end of the day first and foremost it's
customers data and we have to be trusted
stewards of that and not thinking that
other companies ourselves can do land
grams in a quick-draw address that the
Chevy folks did a couple days ago they
talked about rolling out some new OnStar
services that allow you to do basically
offers and coupons tied in to where
you're going or along your route where
do you see from the Ford point of view
offers and merchandising in the
interface whether it's through sync 3 I
guess the throat would be if it's in
your purview you want to get into that
is there a place where you want to have
a merchant relationship or a merchant
stewardship between businesses and your
drivers well I think we have to tread
very carefully here and again for us
it's all about listening to our
customers and anything that we do in
terms of sharing the customers if we if
we get access to the customers data and
they allow us to the customer has to see
value coming back
to them I don't necessarily think you
know doing you know sending coupons or
merchandise sing or things of that
nature I don't know what other
manufacturers are doing she's tried it
for years and walking by a starbucks and
getting a coupon doesn't necessarily
mean you want a coffee well I can't
speak to what other manufacturers doing
all I can say is we're listening to our
customers is and as we're taking the
opportunity to use their data we're
trying to ask them what type of services
do you want what do you value because if
you're giving up this data the customers
going to want to see something of value
so it's simply asking them and that's
the journey that were on it's not trying
to invent appetites on their behalf but
to read them exactly now let's turn to
an area that was I think a little more
surprising for folks in your keynote
today you talked a lot about very broad
mobility policy infrastructure how we
use personal transportation getting away
from any particular tech or car model
where are you going with that and why
bring that here well first off you know
we were here in the keynote talk about
the traditional things talking about you
know the products that we have talked
about sync three the autonomous
semi-autonomous features that we have on
our vehicles today the development of
fully autonomous vehicles that we have
in the pipeline but we're thinking of
ourselves not only as a car and truck
company but it's a mobility company and
as a company it's really important
always to look at trends in the
marketplace just like we did eight ten
years ago when we saw the rise of mobile
phones and smartphones and which led us
to the development of sync now we're
looking at things like the growth of
these huge cities these ten million
population plus cities around its mega
cities prints you know the population
density more than we can ever imagine
we're looking at the growth of the
global middle class it's going to double
in the next 15 years and one of the
markers of that and rites of passage is
being able to drive a car so there's
gonna be even more cars on the road and
then looking at things like the health
of the air quality that's impacted by
congestion and things of that nature so
we're stepping back as a company and
asking ourselves how do we want to take
our tradition of innovation and take
innovation and use it to help solve some
of these very pressing global
transportation and mobility issues
because we want to be viewed as part of
the solution
and by doing that we think will
obviously run a good business and
they'll be business models in there for
us but more importantly it will satisfy
customers and help create a better world
to allow people to be more mobile to
some people they're going to hear in
that vision the idea that people are
gonna be pushed more toward transit and
a little more from personal cars or
they're going to spend less time with
their personal car maybe fewer than will
own a personal car there's a lot of
unused capacity in the world of personal
cars is there any how do you work
against thats true against that
especially into emerging markets where
it's a blank slate they don't have their
first car yet well I think first you
have to step back and we are a growth
company in a growth industry if you
think about the global car industry it's
more or less the past year it's about a
two trillion dollar business when you
add up purchase of vehicle services
those type of junks go out to 2020 our
view is that it will be a three trillion
dollar industry that's a trillion
dollars of growth so you got to step
back and open up the lens and say first
off we're in a growth business there's
plenty of growth there so even as we see
in some instances in the major urban
areas where potentially there could be
less vehicles per 1,000 be a cup of
people than they've ever been before but
that's okay there's business models in
there and business opportunities for us
to provide mobility solutions that
aren't even on our radar screen
resolutions were that means more things
that interact usually but not
necessarily I mean what we talked about
today was these 25 global experiments
that we're doing around the world to
solve some of these problems and it's
amazing so then the apps you rolled out
today exactly and for us what we get out
of it is first off we're a global
company so we get to learn from the the
customers in that part of the world how
they're viewing their mobility issues
and gives us insights the second thing
it does it allows us to forward the
conversation about mobility and the
third thing it does it introduces us
with to some great partners that we
might want to partner with going forward
to provide solutions and a good business
for us okay I don't want to hold you too
long detroit auto show coming up
starting press days on the twelfth you
next monday give us a little teaser it's
k

there did you take all the tech and put
it here you hold something from we have
