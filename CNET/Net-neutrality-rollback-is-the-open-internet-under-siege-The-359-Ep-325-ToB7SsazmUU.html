episode 325 of the 359 podcast you know
me I'm BVG and your host today the oh
jeez the heroes of the Internet it's Ben
Fox Ruben and Roger Chang yeah hey so
we're gonna be talking about devoting
the entire show to net neutrality you
know obviously the headlines haven't
stopped
they've been tons of news has popped up
on net neutrality we're gonna have
another discussion another debate again
about you know the true impact of net
neutrality and whether or not the FCC's
attempts to roll back the existing rules
really is gonna destroy the Internet and
democracy itself and democracy and life
in society
so let's yeah we'll get that so yeah
yeah if you have any questions love to
love to take your questions on this
because I just love to discuss net
neutrality if you have any lewd comments
section Brian will pick out the best we
will get to them three minutes 59
seconds from 3:00 to welcome to the 359
I'm Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox we're even
the net neutrality debate is heating up
over the last few days FCC Chairman
occupy has been on a media tour
defending his proposal to roll back the
existing rules I actually points the
finger at Twitter you know it's really
the source of that's a real problem for
the 18 T Co Reynold Stephenson yesterday
said there's no need for bomb shelters
or canned goods so I mean we won really
gonna get into this and this especially
this this point that algae pie kind of
brings up that Twitter is actually more
of a problem for the open Internet his
justification is you know Twitter is now
taking a little bit more of an active
hand in I don't censoring but definitely
stopping content that's deemed
inappropriate or removing they're in the
process of reviewing the verification of
right sort accounts right depending on
on who you are and the content that you
should be occupies argument here that is
that they're actually they're censoring
what you see on the internet more so
more than an repeal would be would yeah
and I quote from IG PI the company has a
viewpoint and uses the
viewpoint to discriminate the problem is
is that they're not the government right
so Twitter is obviously an easy target
there are a lot of problems with Twitter
but at the same time their private
industry and there are alternatives to
Twitter yeah exactly that's the biggest
thing is that like Facebook and Twitter
like we I mean they call ups those
platforms but really these are companies
they're not they're not beholden to the
public they're beholding to the
shareholders and you know if they want
to if they want to flex their their
legal perspective or their their
political perspective like they can't
the government that the whole points
government shouldn't be able to do that
okay but that being said I would
probably agree to a certain point with
AT&amp;amp;T CEO and a GTI that the rhetoric has
absolutely reached like a pretty intense
froth and pie goes out of this way to
call out Alyssa Milano for some reason
is now an expert on net neutrality we
all say that it will destroy democracy
itself that's very very questionable in
my opinion again these are my opinions
on this but at the same time I don't
like like my central issue with this is
is that net neutrality started in 2015 a
lot of the gloom and doom that was
supposed to happen due to net neutrality
it didn't happen in prior years before
this regulatory regime was created well
okay two points on those points which
are they're all fair I I don't think the
world is gonna go crashing down when
these rules get repealed because as you
said before 2015 nothing terrible is
happening things were there were steps
that the carriers were starting to take
that showed that in terms of
prioritizing traffic like that was the
thing they were gonna do and I don't and
I think that is still a thing they will
do the world is gonna come crashing down
the day after or maybe the week or the
year after what I mean what the concern
I think is is over the longer term some
of these these actions the ISPs are now
would be free to take would have longer
term lasting damage to the Internet
how it works such as such as pay
prioritization the idea of creating
these fast lanes to basically give
preference to their own services maybe
this doesn't happen right away but it
happens down the line yeah theoretically
I'm not saying 18t would do this but
giving you no priority access to DIRECTV
now to make sure that that video service
always streams super clearly whereas
competitive services like Netflix or
YouTube you know house has to either pay
or end up with you know buffering or
quality issues with their video right
and that sounds crappy obviously for
consumers but is it destructive to
democracy and it's debatable it is
debatable and look the the fact here is
that there with the repeal these rules
there will be no guidelines there are no
consequences for these companies and I
think that's what's more for me more
worrisome that these companies basically
we have to trust these companies to do
the right thing and I don't know I trust
Comcast I can't even say that with this
well look that's the issue is these
companies I good all they they just they
make money they that's their entire
purpose right so whatever it takes to
make more money is what they're probably
gonna end up pursuing right so for
things like fast lanes and paid
prioritization that's that's a lucrative
potential business for these companies
yeah well we couldn't get to all of this
I know minutes I'm shocked I know it's a
complicated issue we're probably gonna
have another discussion ahead of the the
net neutrality though which is on
December 14th
but till then check us out CNN I'm Roger
Chang I'm Ben Fox Reba thanks for
listening where do we go from here okay
I have a point I have a point that we
didn't get to which is a matter of
investment yes so IG pi mentions that
investment from broadband and wireless
infrastructure or investment for
broadband and wireless infrastructure
was down in the past two years since net
neutrality past which down three point
six billion dollars is five percent and
he claims that that's the first time
investment from ISPs has actually been
down since the Internet
start so he definitely sliced and diced
the numbers in a very specific way to
present his argument yes I think the
total number of spending has gone down
but you have to remember in the years
past we had huge amounts of investments
from companies like Verizon FiOS in
laying down fiber and they ended that
project before net neutrality like
before I met Ned - Charlie stuff really
took off right so there's that and
there's the fact that a lot of the
wireless investment further the
investment in telecom is converted from
more expensive wire line to more
efficient wireless right rather than
running through physical lines all you
have to do is like string up a box right
or thought up the tower now even put up
a tower because those towers are there
literally put a box on Tower it's a lot
less expensive than building the tower
itself we're building or digging up
actual ground to lay down lines is way
more expensive I I think those are all
fair points I I would argue though that
under net neutrality the incentive to
invest is significantly reduced if
you're not allowed to charge anybody any
more or less for a better or worse
service what is the point in improving
your service the point you can just give
everybody the same lessor points
competition because look we've got four
national wireless carriers and they're
all right now they're letting each other
up trying to get you to switch over
their business and everyone's moving to
5g no one's not moving if I'd you know
was not investing in these next
generation networks and net neutrality
these rules aren't going to affect that
whether or not the rules are in place
these companies still have to invest
because they need to be competitive it
makes sense if for instance if you know
it's just Comcast or if it's just
Verizon or it's just t-mobile which is
by the case well know on on the
broadband profit some access the
wireless side that's not the case
there's still lots of competitors I
would agree to that point that you know
in terms of the home broadband side
competition isn't quite there I would
say the wireless side that's really
where everything is going anyways
there's still money being poured into
these networks regardless of whether or
not their rules
hold on are you arguing that 5g will
allow me to cut the cord completely
and I would just be a Verizon Wireless
customer and that way I would that would
be my broadband I mean it's as simple as
that but Verizon just announced
yesterday that they're gonna start
introducing residential 5g service in
five cities in the u.s. next year
starting with Sacramento so imagine
instead of a cable box or a DSL modem
you have a 5g modem sitting at home it
has basically a direct wireless link to
whatever Verizon facility centers nearby
and you're getting you know 100 gigs of
speed which would actually sure I mean
like the problem has always been that
the broadband providers are essentially
regional monopolies right and that would
actually ensure some real competition in
the marketplace that's definitely that's
been the issue with Verizon FiOS I think
Verizon FiOS and also Google Fiber to a
certain extent was viewed as a potential
competitor to try to puncture those
monopolies and whatever reason they both
fell apart vaio still exist hearted it
became it just became part of the
Machine like it's just as it uses the
same business practices as the cable
company that's right like in terms of
like sort of complicated pricing
packages and bundles it's essentially
another cable company that's a
competitor which it's fine whatever
Google Fiber was sort of this true kind
of disruptive force but it's all part
because it was just so expensive to
build around infrastructure mm-hmm and
so the wireless 5g idea would be the
potential right white knight yeah and by
the way I do want to bring up the point
in terms of fast lanes 8:18 TCO
yesterday I should brought up an
interesting point in certain situations
actually fast lanes do make sense
whether it's healthcare why don't you
hold on to tell people what fastly oh
sorry fast lane well we were talking
about pay prioritization the idea that a
company like AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon would
charge a customer or sort of a back-end
customer not the consumer right like in
Netflix like a Netflix more money to
guarantee faster guaranteed service to
the customer now we've been using video
as the primary example of why that's
like terrible because like
basically Netflix would have to pay more
to assure video gets delivered to you
and they can theoretically pass those
charges down to you but in in certain
situations like it's self-driving cars
or maybe a robot surgeon that requires a
cell connection you would want to pay
extra for that right like that in those
situations safety issue yes there are
safety issues then and that you'd
actually want to pay for you want to be
able to allow for that kind of level of
priority access okay and in that case
would a net neutrality regime like not
allow ISPs or wireless providers to
charge more for those types of high
level connections that's the thing those
existing rules we're a little bit less
clear with the mobile sorry thing and so
and look when when the former FCC
Chairman Tom wheeler brought those rules
about he also noted that like we're not
gonna fall everything to the letter
launches of the utilities like we think
theoretically could use those rules to
enforce but they also were trying to
open those rules up to the point where
they were gonna be flexible enough with
modern technology like it was the this
is where it gets really complicated
where like the the debate kind of gets a
little blurred the reason why title tube
was brought in was because you offered a
legal framework for the FCC to use to
enforce these rules it didn't mean they
actually had to enforce them all it just
meant that they had back in title to
being utility style right the same rules
are used to enforce the telephone
companies right which every cup every
ISP every Internet service provider
hates more rules more regulation yeah
it's way more rules than they had to do
again it was clear like the FCC didn't
have to use those rules to enforce you
know certain situations but they could
if they wanted if there was a abusive I
don't know it's it's interesting you
mentioned that because it's a similar
argument as you know under the IG pie
consideration we're giving the ISPs more
power that they could potentially abuse
but under net neutrality the FCC is now
granted utility level powers that they
could potentially have brings against
the ISPs yeah it makes sense to me that
the ISPs would
obviously dislike net neutrality because
the FCC could use it as a bludgeon
against them if they wanted to
absolutely so ultimately like they're
there there was no great Milgram like
everyone says the middle ground should
be Congress Congress needs to step in
and create rules what Congress doing
anything and sure that's a good idea so
what I'm hearing here is it's
essentially a case of hate the player
not the game but see ISPs that could be
held accountable however I see sorbian
amounts of potential abuse in these
situations now I like that you brought
up the consideration for being able to
prioritize speeds to doctors and
important rescue for safety reasons for
safety reasons that's magnificent how
many consumers suffer at the hands of
that I like this analogy that came up in
the chat yeah from Joseph he says net
neutrality is equivalent to forcing all
restaurants to offer all-you-can-eat
buffets now that's a really interesting
way to look at it but I'd like to tack
onto that from my own personal
perspective with a giant credit card
premium over top of all of it
potentially that's if neutrality gets
rolled back you're saying exactly yeah
yeah I mean I don't know if I'd
necessarily would fully accept that
analogy like I think that neutrality
would allow every restaurant basically I
guess fair game in terms of opening
their business they could basically
create whatever restaurant whatever
business they want they can offer
whatever food they want I think the idea
is that there'd be some sort of level
playing field for every restaurant say
yeah I guess I'm thinking we got a strip
mall right there be equal spots for
every single Reggie you do whatever you
want with that spot but the point is
that there is no prioritization there's
no preference being paid to McDonald's
over some mom-and-pop shop I would argue
that the the primary issue is a matter
of competition the the problem is is
that you know the the companies are
going to do as best they can to make as
much money as they can and the thing
that prevents them from doing that is
competition and the problem has been and
continues to be that the regional
monopolies from ISPs broadband providers
and it's interesting that you mentioned
5g could actually solve some of those
problems because regardless of whether
it's under net neutrality or without net
neutrality nobody wants to see customers
end up getting screwed and have to pay
more money or have to you know be
buffered we know nobody wants to see
that
I mean imagine I mean like company you
don't want to see that we don't you know
look I I think it's it's obviously we do
not want to see customers because we're
customers end up getting screwed and
just have to pay more for worse service
I mean like that would be obviously by
the way far worse situation I do want to
at least allow for the the fact that in
terms of customers ultimately pay more
that is a good I think that's the way
way long-term nightmare scenario like I
don't think that's gonna happen anytime
soon really it only took two years for
Time Warner to screw me over
well alright maybe just for Brian then
but I would just say like in terms of it
being sort of this broad practice that
everyone just sort of jumps into like
they're not gonna start chart like maybe
Netflix the other issue is that
companies like Netflix are probably
willing to stomach the costs whether the
past on the customer is debatable maybe
a little bit over time because this will
get repealed if it goes the real the
bigger issue is less about Netflix but
like the next Netflix right the idea
that if you're this small companies
small small start-up trying to you know
create your own video app like all
sudden you have to pay this extra
premium and if you can't pay this
premium your services worse than that
for your service and worse than that
price and thus you can't stay in
business yeah like a Netflix is not
gonna be threatened or damaged by this
at all because doctor they're a bigger
player they might actually be they might
have an edge because of this because
it's really the smaller players that you
have to worry about right but that's
like Netflix is profits would be
impacted I would say because they could
potentially end up having to pay more
yeah I would say impact the impact would
be a lot less than you know the next
startup trying to be I also don't I
don't really understand why Google and
Netflix are arguing for these potential
future startup competitors it doesn't
actually make that much sense to me why
are they saying like I think if we want
a free and open Internet under net
neutrality because we want to ensure
that our future competitor that's gonna
eat our lunch could it could do that
but that's that's the thing like they
also there is a recognition that they
could not exist without the idea of the
open Internet cuz then I mean the open
Internet fostered their ability to
become giant companies so there there
aren't another principle it's also good
PR right this is a very very good PR and
make a rules they came Netflix and
Google did not start in 2015 under net
neutrality they continued to grow under
rules that were much lighter touch which
is what IG PI is arguing well the only
issue is the the the practices that I
think everyone's afraid of didn't really
become a legitimate threat you know a
few years ago a few years before the net
neutrality debate really started getting
hot so you could argue about like
whether or not the lack of rules had any
impact because I mean those a lot of
those techniques weren't available yet
mmm-hmm let's get the question yeah I'm
talking sorry no it's great conversation
though and it's really engaging and
we've gotten a lot of commentary I would
just from my own personal perspective on
this as a customer the the the critical
flaw in this entire plan is that you
don't have a lot of options for your ISP
providers and yeah there you are I
literally have one so that means I am
prisoner to their terms and services
until I move yeah and I think that's or
- I have one right I have I'm one of the
lucky and I think that's disturbing and
disgusting until they can find another
way to actually evenly distribute some
of these providers then this is a
completely or you just have cable or
just have telecom I just have telecom
just writer in your weight
I have spectrum Spector's a cable
company okay you don't have an option
not in my neighborhood
the Verizon DSL not files not to my
knowledge
every time I mean maybe it's changed in
the last month but the last time I
looked it up it said it wasn't available
you hooked up files fast isn't available
I'm willing to bet Verizon basic DSL the
other issue is DSL is not as fast that's
what I was yeah
but you do have to some you do have to
isp right but dsl is not yes is that
competitive it's not broadband is it
yeah so
ish I'm sticking with the principles of
my argument all right all right I still
find it damaging and as somebody who for
a career provides content on the
Internet I don't want to see anyone else
in control of that right mm-hmm
so what are some of the questions well
let's go right in and start taking some
of the commentary Matthew - who says I
like the spirit of net neutrality
especially when it comes to the consumer
end of the internet however as an
engineer the wording is problematic
traffic engineering and quality of
service are important aspects of moving
data across the Internet
he's got fantastic points I'd love to
hear an expansion on that and to kind of
bridge off the concept of you know the
negative aspects of net neutrality we're
already kind of getting it may i dicked
around from people like YouTube Google
and Twitter as drone wolf media points
out if Facebook all the social media
they're in control of the media of what
you consume right so the idea is like
are we really handing that traffic
direction off to better people in this
well that's the bit it depends on
whether or not I guess you trust Verizon
yeah it's sort of a no-win situation
there yeah the other point we wanted to
bring up is this is this is a very
partisan issue right when the Democrats
are in control its Pro net neutrality
prone under trial rules when the
Republicans are in control it is maybe
still prone unto chao-li concept but no
rules right so you know we had under
Obama the rules put in under Trump rules
are coming out if directly a Democratic
president comes in the next term we
could have this debate all over again
yeah and it could have tire Levi's they
could just be back and forth like a
whiplash effect for the next hundred
years isn't that essentially all
politics yeah pretty much yeah but like
with this especially there's there's a
lot of investment that goes into it and
you know a lot of businesses say that
they would like to have some level of
expectations so it can be confident to
spend this money so I don't see that as
a positive for anybody that you're just
gonna have a net neutrality get taken
out and put back in over and over and
over it
and depending on who's oh just like oh
wait it's the Democrats all right let's
roll back the plans right Michael Browns
is I believe the loss of net neutrality
will force companies to create
partnership bundles with ISPs comcast
has already created their ecosystem for
service providing we think that's a
slippery slope bundles in terms of like
with with content providers like Netflix
assuming this what do you meant right
that's that's one of the nightmare
scenarios that a lot of people have been
talking like we have to pay the extra
five dollars right or like you get the
social bundle right III think that that
argument at least in the short and
medium term is to me a red herring I
don't see that happening I think the
first ISP or broadband provider that
actually attempts to do that like people
will riot in the streets and freak out
I just don't actually having done like
if you pay for if you didn't pay for the
bundle would you like not yet just like
the other one other potential would be
that instead of doing a straight-out
bundle and saying you don't have access
to this otherwise maybe providing faster
or better access or like for pay access
or whatever so they treat it more as a
positive than a negative like if you
don't pay us you're way more optimistic
than I sir no I'm saying that that would
be a way for them to convince you to pay
more money and then spinning it as a
positive I mean I trying to say I don't
know how effective it is to do that with
like with throttling for websites or say
like websites all kind of load pretty
fast like you have to like really
dramatically slowed down to make it
worse right I mean for me the biggest
issue is in video right because that's
the one that takes a lot of bandwidth
requires a lot of bandwidth and the cord
cutters I'm just saying video yeah video
in general well I'm saying that it's
going to use SERP table television
over-the-air television eventually oh
yeah yeah so that needs to be a priority
yeah but that's things like that's the
one we're like do they be prioritize or
prioritize that like you would see a
drastic impact if they prioritize or D
prioritize the video versus like
Facebook loads pretty quick
wherever you are if it loads like a
second longer is that really gonna be a
problem
right
IIIi still think you're being way more
optimistic III think it could be
potentially a lot worse than that
mmm I foresee a lot of gatekeeping going
on Josh Buddha asks will ISPs be able to
use their power to sense their political
beliefs or will they just be able to
create the fast lanes for the certain
services I think all on the table so
that's that's interesting he mentions
that because that was a G PI's exact
argument about Twitter yeah is censoring
political beliefs that they're doing
currently I mean like I'm not gonna but
they take a position one way or another
related to Twitter this is an ecosystem
of animosity we're gonna be pitting with
ISPs at Wars with actual content
creators or managers I look I'm gonna
maybe I'm naive I don't think the ISPs
would sensor based on political is it
just they've been there depends on where
the checks are coming another film no
because no but to your point it's about
money it's like who's paying for what
but that's not about politics that's
about business it eventually can be
about politics and oftentimes has proven
to be the case hey how many paid
congressmen there are they're all paid
there yeah you know what I mean and well
including Isaac Verizon pie
mr. corruptable already this is from
what I haven't looked at the political
contributions of the major telcos but
generally speaking if you're a big
enough company they're all pretty much
you pay both sides yeah you pay
Republicans and you pay Democrats
because you're you're picking a winner
regardless of who actually gets voted in
all right Ryan Reiser what country
should I move to if this goes bad I can
move to any European country because a
family what should I do
India it just passed super strict net
neutrality rules that's and I think
interesting in the EU I believe there
are rules in place so you're like
covered in the EU I wouldn't suggest UK
obviously because of brexit okay if you
do actually end up moving to Europe
because net neutrality got rolled back
please contact us because we would love
to profile oh yeah and be like this guy
left united states over net neutral
so I don't I don't know that a lot of
people would do that but who knows yeah
I mean that's really sticking to your
principles I guess expanding on that
Nicola and the chat says computer file
had a very nice balance calm video about
net neutrality from the UK perspective
so we want to point out and shout out
computer file go on and check that out
if we're interested for some of the more
international impacts that this could
have definitely Josh boy de how likely
do you think it is that ISPs will police
themselves and keep things the same as
it is now yeah that that's the
million-dollar question yeah you like
that's what ultimately I do you trust
your ISP to do the right thing and most
ISPs have terrible reputation right so
very hard to defend them I mean like
you're talking about Time Warner Cable
now called spectrum would Comcast's like
the like any time their consumer surveys
they tend to you know go way on the
bottom so beyond that because I feel
like these companies attendant it's easy
to rag on these companies what's I think
more striking to me is the I wonder
bring up this point zero rating this
this is a concept in wireless where you
can offer someone service or data or
like video and not have that haven't
eaten to your data cap basically like
YouTube for instance can pay Verizon to
ensure that you can watch all the
YouTube videos you want and it doesn't
hurt your data cap right and so you know
what a lot of these companies did early
on last year 18 T for instance in
offered or Verizon offered go 90 it's
video service as a zero rate service
which meant you can watch all the go 90
video you wanted and it didn't hurt your
data cap which is which is great right
you can watch as much go and accept
there's nothing right but right there
the FCC under the previous
administration actually took the the
carriers to TAS and we were actually
investigating the carrier's for this
practice because it was anti-competitive
the idea that you're prioritizing your
own services in making it easier more
beneficial for the customer to use your
service over somebody else's and then
once I July the new administration new
administration came in they basically
squash that
you squash that whole investigation so
whatever is fine right so your argument
we talked about this ahead of the show
your argument was that zero rating could
be utilized as a blueprint in the future
by ISPs right basically they've clearly
set precedent that they're cool with
prioritization of sort of their own
services and so if there are no rules in
place that they could very easily take
that and repeat it with other services
right my argument to that is I don't
think anybody is not watching YouTube or
Facebook or you know video on Facebook
or whatever because it is or isn't
eating into your data cap I understand
the point in prioritizing but at the
same time it's not it's not preventing
consumers from consuming one by one all
right we got time for just a couple more
one more from - I thought I heard a
rumor that Comcast dropped net
neutrality language from their agreement
from their agreement the truth - that
it's a little bit mixed day so they did
drop some language about promising I
think they promised not to offer fast
lanes that this whole prioritization
we've been talking about Maggie actually
mega written actually wrote a story I
think two days ago two days ago on this
issue and Comcast had gone back to her
and said that they had no plans to do
pay prioritization mm-hmm at least for
now
I thought the fast lane was reason
they're horrible tomatoes and all be all
of this entire conversation like for now
it's okay for now well what happens
tomorrow yeah the comment that they have
is Comcast hasn't entered into any pay
prioritization agreements period and we
have no plans to do so sorry sorry
that's BS this is way too exploitable
neutrality has it been repealed yet that
is apps from these people right and they
probably don't want to give them to you
and the question is is that if if this
thing is okay then what's the next thing
that's not okay what are the new red
lines that are actually going to be
established I think there are no red
lines right well there will be from
consumers I mean like I I do think that
consumers will go against some of this
stuff if it
does create these nightmare scenarios
that people don't actually like and if
they're like what what can you do if
your consumer and if you're like not
happy with this can you walk away except
the competition's doing the exact same
thing so what's your well there is no
competition right if you have a
broadband provider that's the only one
but you can argue against it and you
know create a lot of argue against
against them what does that do though
it's a good question I don't know like
when they end up buckling under that
pressure or whether they just say screw
you there's no one else that you could
actually go to yeah definitely as a 14
year customer of Time Warner Spectrum
due to lack of options they're gonna
screw over come get me
anyways we are almost out of time yeah I
just want to bring up a comment from
Ryan Reiser who's a man after my own
heart right now as the techie I'm
terrified there are just too many people
that don't understand this on that note
we hope that we're trying to help round
yeah a lot of conversation and
commentary and the chat about like I
don't know how to explain this to my
family you know my mom doesn't care and
it's like this is why you should care
mm-hm and I mean even I I feel like I
have a grasp on it but I'm just look I'm
just angry and in fact I think Corner
far as I'm Lord of all of my internet
into canteens and hide in the basement
right but part part of the real problem
with neutrality it is a very complicated
and wonky topic and there is a
temptation to like sum it up in the most
dramatic way to get people to care like
this is the ISPs censoring what you see
now like it's it's not truth of it it's
not gonna be that dramatic it's it's
gonna be something but it may not be
that but well the I can look at this as
censorship is always bad let's think
it's that's it's not as black and white
as X we don't know no that is the unsane
that is the knee-jerk reaction it's an
action I'm right mm-hmm not only that
but like not only censorship is always
bad but it's I think in many ways easier
to describe what net neutrality is it's
the current regime that we live in and
all Internet traffic is treated the same
way who wouldn't agree with that right
right but I would argue that that very
simplistic view is a feel-good concept
that
otice much hornier and every company
every isp says yeah we also believe that
that we they've all said that we also
blue we just don't want any rules to
enforce anything in case we want to do
something else mmm that's or we're gonna
treat it all the same way except the
people that pay us more money for
specialty everybody gets treated the
same way except that guy he gets treated
well no the same way even their argument
would be well we're gonna charge
everyone the same premium access so we
are charging we're treating everyone the
same way they all just have a pay more
mm-hmm yeah I personally don't have a
problem with Netflix playing more I have
a problem with Netflix customers paying
more so it's that's also the debatable
argument is is netflix going to end up
eating those costs if the ISPs make them
pay more for faster lanes or are we and
and you know one of those issues is fine
with me and the other one obviously is
it for me for me like it's that's a bit
of a short side view like it's it's not
the thing versus just not next company
right what is the next startup that's
gonna make it big like is that even
gonna be able to exist because there are
no rules that's the bigger concern for
me I'm crazy Ajit PI used car internet
salesmen and I'm here to pass the costs
on to you all right we got to go out on
an interesting note here I've been
keeping this one in my back pocket again
we have so many great questions and
comments in the chat we can't get to all
of them but be sure we'll be having
plenty more these days more about those
this is fantastic thanks everybody but
from stellar tech if net neutrality
reaches a repeal could this potentially
create a backlash for an alternative
form of internet new editor with a new
protocol in communication this is a
really fascinating thought because like
a separate internet came out of nowhere
it's like oh we'll just always have
television and telephones and lo and
behold through down the way it's a very
interesting idea I feel like we're in
the English nation that's what that was
in the HBO show with Silicon Valley like
okay disaggregated yeah
non-centralized internet that would take
a really long time and I don't really
see that as a possibility however if the
the providers end up creating such
draconian measures that a lot of people
really don't like them it does open the
door to other potential ISPs I can't
believe I'm actually gonna mention this
name stary yeah like those guys
so there could there are some other
possible competitors out there and if
things get so bad with your you know
spectrum or Comcast there would be
considerable in the margin is 5g yeah
yeah and they've been in pilot I think
in Boston for a really long time it
sounded like a really interesting idea I
don't know how far it's actually gotten
off the ground but if the current
providers end up doing a really bad job
with their customers people would look
hopefully to something like star yeah
I'm a little skeptical of a new internet
just because like these forms of
communication evolved because they're
better than the last one if this new
internet is only like regulation-free
it's open like it's just been neutrality
plus yeah I don't think that's enough
people to switch over to another
internet like it just the idea of a new
internet Roger where did your attitude
about stick it to the man come on he is
the man now he's objective about this
whole thing you guys have actually done
a really good job and I do appreciate
that a heart on my sleeve bleeding heart
yeah reaction everything I I what we
need you don't read on me right exactly
don't read on offer a perspective that's
all now this has been very informative
and very helpful I do feel like we could
round up the entire possession with a
bunch of quotes from Malcolm from
Jurassic Park including while you were
debating whether or not you could
did you ask yourselves if you should and
I'm gonna steal this stray from Nicola
in the chat life finds away there you go
