show you how much this hardware
acceleration really matters I'm gonna
pull this down by way of comparison I've
got an iphone 4 here running the current
build of Safari and the Safari web
browser is not taking advantage of
hardware acceleration so you really get
a sense for how dramatic the difference
is when we use the full power capability
of the device you saw it on the pc
you've tried it yourself if you download
a 99 and now you can see the difference
on the phone so that is a first
real-world example of the performance
difference now i'm going to use IE 9
here and navigate over to another site
and just give you another example what
you saw in the video one of those sites
that was shown in the video all those
sites you can try yourself if you
download IE all the sites of the video
are part of the ie9 test-drive site and
one of the ones you saw was IMDB so this
is a mock-up of an html5 IMDb site that
uses and nations and rich user
experience and i want to show you how it
looks and feels very smooth just like
what you saw on the desktop I can touch
these movies and navigate around I can
push the play button and because the
hardware acceleration makes this
experience so smooth the user although
they've just visited a website it's
almost indistinguishable from the
experience you would get running a
client app on the device now similarly
one of the other things that's full
about this my where carousel de Kamp
here is that the html5 standard supports
a wide range of things but one of the
more valuable important ones that
supports is native support for video
watch websites today use flash other
plugins to implement video on websites
and in our case we don't support many of
those sites but with ie9 and its
standard
space support from the video tag sites
like this IMDb site enable native
support for video just using HTML so in
this case I'm going to touch the item
for despicable me we're going to hit the
web service here the website start
downloading this video and playing it
you'll see just a second we still have
our productivity you'll see a streaming
h.264 video in high definition and maybe
we don't have enough connectivity for
you to see this but trust me we
typically would show streaming
high-definition h.264 video I can
actually go back to try that one more
time see if we get lucky on the second
try and we're not gonna get lucky and
second try well unfortunately that
didn't work as I said this is
preliminary not final code will get all
these kinks worked out before we ship it
make it available to users but now what
I want to do is switch over and give you
one more demo example of the software
that's going to be coming in this free
update later this year and that is walk
you through a multi tasking scenario as
Steve said later on this year in 2011
will make this update available for all
windows phone 7 users and will then get
added support for multitasking of third
party apps today windows phone 7
multitasks our own first party code but
generally we don't multitask third party
apps because we want to make sure the
user has a very predictable long life in
their battery when apps run in the
background you're not careful about how
you architected they can often spin and
use the CPU and other resources so the
batteries drink what we're going to ship
is a multi tasking approach that we
think does the right balance of
protecting the users battery while
letting multitasking heaven so I'm going
to start up this demo by running an
active the app that I'm going to run is
called rise and glory it's an xbox live
game that's now available in the
marketplace if you have a Windows Phone
you can try this yourself it's pretty
fun this is a world war one fighter
plane simulation and once the game
launches i'm going to play the part of
the red
and flying my trifling over Europe well
I'm being attacked by other fighter so
the game is loaded I'll touch the screen
and here we go so you can see I am let
me turn the volume up here let's even
get some audio there we go I am flying
my plane around and today if I were
playing this game with Windows Phone 7
if I wanted to make a phone call or send
a text if I navigate away from the game
we essentially put it into a deep
hibernation which takes a few seconds to
resume so I'm going to do the same thing
now let's assume I wanted to make the
phone call I press the start button I'll
navigate around I'll do my thing make my
phone call now I want to go back to the
game we have a convenient back button
today if I were to do that on windows
phone 7 for third-party apps might take
four seconds for a game sometimes a
little longer maybe even up to as much
as 10 seconds but with multitasking the
user gets an instant return to the game
so here I go can i push the back button
back there's our animation boom we're in
the game and then pauses for me so i can
press the continue button very very fast
effectively instead so I'm going to do
it again I'll press Start we navigate
away I can go do something else on the
phone I can run other apps whatever I
want when I push back to come back to
that app voila I can press Continue and
I'm flying high playing so we're adding
a new user interface element later this
year which lets people have a task
switching view from there back button
you can press back back back to go to
absolute design or you can press and
hold that which is what i just did and
will present a view of all the
applications that you've been running
recently so you can see here we set this
phone up before the demo Iran email Iran
fruit ninja Iran groupon on the phone
and I want to give you an example now we
put these things together i can switch
between games incredibly fast so i'm
going to choose fruit into
unpause the game Here I am killing fruit
today I'll do that now let's go back to
our rise of glory press and hold back
now to get over to rise and Lori and now
so for those those teenagers with really
long attention spans want to charge like
two games at the time it will now be
possible with fast task switching and
our new task switching Megan okay I have
one more multitasking scenario i want to
show you're not going to wrap up as part
of the demo another really key thing
that people have raised that's something
they'd like to see on windows phone 7 we
don't support today is third party music
applications being able to play music as
you navigate around the phone if you use
our built-in music application if it
works ok but for third parties so far we
don't support them so what I'm going to
do is give you a real example of that
I'm going to scroll down here and launch
slack room slacker is a free music
service that gives me access to a whole
bunch of radio stations so I launch the
slacker app and I'm going to touch
today's hits to start playing stream
radio station there we go
then I was playing the song hundred
pianos by july four kids today on
windows phone 7 to the third party app
if i navigate away from the app the
music will stop not so anymore this
multitasking support if i press the
press and hold the back button you'll
see again the slacker applications moves
into the top of you i can pan over pick
another app in this case I'll choose my
email so now here I am running email and
was using is still playing
uninterruptedly as it would expect if I
want to go back to the slacker out
because i want to change to a different
radio station or something i can hit the
back button to go right back to where I
just came from and now I can navigate
around do something to slash this
scenario keeps working lots of different
directions if I press the start button
of course as you would expect music
continues to run and we've tried to make
sure the user experience pays really
simple and predictable for people so if
you want to turn the volume down the
system volume controls work and right
there you can see the track an artist is
shown I can skip forward I can skip back
or as is appropriate in this demo
situation I can just hit the pause
button to stop in a way that's very
consistent between our built-in
experience and third-party apps so all
of these features that I've described
will be coming in a free update in 2011
for all windows phone 7 users</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
