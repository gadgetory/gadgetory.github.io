to the iPhone and if you have an iPhone
10 this is what you have to look forward
to hi hello oh this is really creepy
looking good slick - okay this is pretty
cute
cheese emojis are the Avatar version of
Apple's and emojis which use the 3d
depth sensing front cameras on the tent
to track your facial features now keep
in mind that this is just the developers
beta so things may change but in the
meantime here's your preview you can
access my emojis from the messages
you'll have to create your own and start
from scratch but after that you can
customize just about anything any
variation of skin tone different hair
styles and you even have the option to
brighten it up with some highlights then
it's on to head shapes you can choose
based on your age and even add some fine
lines if you want to go a little bit
older next its eye shape and you can
determine any eye color in the color
wheel apply some mascara to your lashes
if you're into that and shape your brows
those options are surprisingly limited
and then comes lip plumping in a color
ears come in three different sizes
apparently and you can even accessorize
with matching earrings
there's sideburns stashes facial hair
some sweet rims and top it all off with
a hat or not not bad once you're on
emojis ready you can send it as a
picture or video message when you press
record you can do the eye roll stick out
your tongue it's actually pretty great
at tracking even on this developers
version if you click on the camera you
even have the option to send it as a
photo along with filters and effects
just click on the star button on the
left and pick an emoji or an emoji or
whatever it is that you want to send
or you can replace your own face when
making a FaceTime call and surprise mom
all right so I used to be an emoji
skeptic but I have to admit it's a
little more fun than I expected what do
you guys think hit us up on the comment
section below and check back for more
