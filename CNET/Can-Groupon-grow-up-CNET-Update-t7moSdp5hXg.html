online with cash and crack open a beer
to lick mature I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update the hotly
debated cybersecurity bill called sista
will likely not become law the White
House has said it will be to the sista
bill claiming an endangered Americans
privacy and gives homeland security too
much broad power for years Congress has
been pushing for new laws to fight cyber
attacks but looks like sista won't be
the winning plan the CEO of groupon
andrew mason gathered his employees
together to talk about how the company
needs to mature how there's no margin
for error and that groupon is like a
toddler in a grown man's body and he
said all this while drinking a beer in
fact he had trouble speaking during his
meeting because he was drinking The Wall
Street Journal was tapped into the
webcasted staff meeting which employees
were also given drinks as the CEO
answered questions on the company's
future yes because when you're in the
middle of shareholder lawsuits of facing
possible investigation into your
finances beer is a great way to look
serious about your company's future in

May third spot if I could be moving into
pandora territory bloomberg reports that
the streaming music service is building
a customizable radio player similar to
that of Pandora and that it would launch
this year in our last show we mentioned
that Sprint will continue to offer
unlimited data plans for the next iPhone
even if that iphone is a 4g phone one of
our cnet readers left a comment about
their unlimited plan with AT&amp;amp;T user I
play nice wrote my one concern is I'm an
unlimited data plan holder with 18t now
when the iphone is 4g i hope they don't
use that as a loophole to get us
unlimited
data plan holders out of that contract
that's because 3gs different than 4g
data and that was a great question many
iphone users who stick with ATT are
allowed to keep their unlimited plan
which isn't offered anymore so I asked
AT&amp;amp;T for an answer right now if you're
an unlimited data plan with AT&amp;amp;T you can
switch to any 4g phone today and you
still have unlimited data so if 18t
doesn't suddenly change things up looks
like unlimited data customers can keep
their unlimited contract with a future
4g iphone that's your tech news update
