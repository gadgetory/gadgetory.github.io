Times Square is the smallest world
you've ever seen enter Gulliver's Gate
and you will find a 40 million dollar
exhibit of a massive miniature world
this new york city attraction features
models of 50 different nations packed
with iconic landmarks and world wonders
all brought to life with a unique blend
of technology this goes way beyond your
grandfather's holiday train set in the
span of a football field you'll walk
through more than 300 different model
scenes within every inch there's a
different story to discover some a
little more action-packed than others
Easter eggs are hidden throughout the
models it's a way for the artist to wink
back at their audience hey there Spidey
some scenes can also animate with your
help an admission ticket cost $36 and
with it comes a golden key with an RFID
chip insert that key into a station turn
it and watch the model come to life
adding to the magic are self-driving
cars these vehicles are powered by
inductive charging with copper embedded
in the road infrared sensors are placed
on the road and talked to sensors in the
car with a computer system directing the
vehicles making sure they don't crash
with just weeks until the official
opening on May 9th the team is also in
the middle of building an airport with
similar technology the planes have
inductive charging coils hidden inside
the tail fins gulliver's gate is both
tiny and fascinating and overwhelming
all at the same time it's got models of
some of the greatest buildings and
moments from around the world on the top
and underneath we've got arduino x' and
raspberry PI's and circuitry for days
controlling the planes trains and cars
and at the center of it all is the
command center the hub keeping track of
all these systems if you have a question
for the technicians just walk up and ask
we are not static Museum where people
cycle through look at the pretty things
and walk away we want people to ask us
questions we have an open hole in this
wall for that reason we have two garage
doors in our workshop that lift up so
that people can talk to
our model makers there's nothing small
about what it took to make this
attraction the best model makers from
every corner of the world were recruited
to construct a representation of their
own region New York was made in Brooklyn
by 16 people over the course of a year
but the miniature Latin America was made
in Argentina by 15 people in just two
months in total there are more than
1,000 trains 10,000 cars and a hundred
thousand tiny people some buildings and
scenes were crafted by hand others were
made with the help of 3d printers and
you could be 3d printed too great step
into this body scanner and order a
miniature print of yourself you can even
be printed small enough to be placed in
the exhibit at Gulliver's gate you enter
feeling like a giant but when you leave
you just may realize how small you
really are for CNET I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
