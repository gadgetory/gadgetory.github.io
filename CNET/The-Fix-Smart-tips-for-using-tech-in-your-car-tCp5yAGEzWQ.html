show about do-it-yourself tech and how
to's from Donald Bell and I'm Eric
Franklin car tech is a really cool thing
and these days we're connected in just
about every way imaginable definitely
and if you're into stats are you into
the cool car sets sure look my rpms rpms
MPGs that stuff yeah that's her if
you're into that kind of stuff we've got
an app in a device that tracks your
car's performance as well as your
driving habits any car built after 1996
is considered obd2 compliant meaning you
can grab all of your cars diagnostics
through a port that's a lot like a USB
port for your car in most cases though
only mechanics have access to this port
but more and more apps are allowing the
user to put all of that data into your
pocket in this case I'll show you how to
use an app called dash which is free for
both iOS and Android with it you can
turn any dumb card into a smart car so
you can see diagnostics like fuel
economy rpm engine temperature and a lot
more plus you can even diagnose the
check engine light all on your own
here's how it works first you'll need an
OPD - device these cost anywhere from
$15 to $100 depending on what the brand
is and what features it has you can go
to Dash's website for recommendations on
both iOS and Android
in this case I already have my obd for
an android phone and i'll plug it into
my car in most cases it's underneath the
steering wheel now we're ready to pair
the obd with my phone so the first thing
i want to do is turn the car on to give
power to the obd
then I'll go into my bluetooth settings
find the obd link it up then we'll
launch - and in a few seconds the app
should find the obd that's it we're set
so let's take it for a test drive
as I'm driving all these Diagnostics are
updating in real-time so I could see my
fuel economy rpm temperature engine load
if you don't know what one of these
means you can actually just tap the
square and it'll give you a really nice
explanation
it becomes a little bit addicting
because the goal is to get as many of
these squares into the green zone as
possible it's not always in your control
but often times you can prevent it from
going into red by controlling how fast
you accelerate or how hard you break
so here's how it works from the moment I
start my car to the point that I take my
key out of the ignition that's
considered one trip and at the end of
every trip I get a driver's score from -
that's dependent on how fast I was
accelerating how hard I was braking and
if I was idling for too long so let's
see how I did go to my trips so I see
here that I got a score of 81 a lot of
that is because I was idling too much
probably because of some San Francisco
traffic but it says I have some great
fuel efficiency and I avoided hard
accelerations
luckily my overall score is still a nice
93 all right that dash is only working
with gasoline-powered cars right now so
if you have a hybrid car or all-electric
car or diesel car or a moon buggy it's
not going to accurately measure those
okay that's too bad yeah I have a moon
buggy yes that's kind of designed alone
it's time for a quick break and when we
come back we've got a do-it-yourself
project that'll work with any smartphone
in your car
you
welcome back
Eric Franklin yes there are two things
you should know about me all right I am
cheap yes and I'm crafty both true
statements and in this next segment you
put both those skills to good use
I do the turn-by-turn navigation in your
smartphone has become an indispensable
part of getting around by car you
probably already have some kind of mount
in your car to help keep your phone in
view and out of your hands
but what if you're not driving your car
what if you're driving some kind of
rental car and you're crazy summer road
trip what do you do then well I'm gonna
show you how to make your own DIY
Universal smartphone mount using
supplies you can probably just pick up
around the office all right so here's
what you're gonna need you're gonna need
a large binder clip then need some
rubber bands and at least one wrench to
is better now let's talk about the large
binder clip now if you can shop around
for binder clips which is a lot of fun
try to find the binder clips that have
this rubberized handle that rubberized
bit it's gonna hold your phone in place
a lot better so that's going to be a lot
easier on your hands when you're trying
to bend this thing back and that's the
next step
grab your wrenches clamp one bit and
then get the other half to bend the
little tips of the arms down these are
going to act as fingers to kind of hold
the phone in place they're really tough
if either a Franklin I can do this by
hand they're gonna flip it around bend
the other arm
if you can get these practically
touching each other that'd be great
because that bend is what's going to
help hold the phone in play it's not
just horizontally but vertically -
that's pretty good the reason why we're
doing that is because your phone is
going to go in here and when it's gonna
clamp down on you you want these ends to
be kind of gripping like a pair of
fingers that's pretty good
now when adding the rubber bands any
rubber band will do but if you really
want to kick it up a notch
you should try a plasti band but a lot
stronger and that strength is gonna help
hold your phone in place a lot better I
just wrapped it on to the arms here
until all the slack was taken out that
should be good enough to help keep some
tension to keep my phone in place now
the next part is tricky placing this
thing in your car sometimes you've got a
nice horizontal air-conditioning vent
that you can latch this thing on not the
case here I've got these vertical vents
they aren't turning here's a good spot
right up here about the clock
a little place I can pinch onto that's
gonna be in my field of view but not too
far to be out of reach
look at that perfect so there you go
it's holding my phone staying in place
doing everything a car mount needs to do
for next to nothing I mean I've
practically stole the materials for this
thing cost me maybe a few bucks at most
very well done dude thank you I can kind
of take stuff from around the house and
you want to buy a bunch of expensive
cars yeah not the best looking thing but
it gets the job done
yeah for sure I have a question yes do
you use your phones virtual assistant
all the time of course you do because
whether you're out and about or in your
car or virtual assistant can help make
life a little bit easier Siri can be a
really effective way to send text
messages especially if you're walking
down the street in a high-traffic area
you're trying to have to bump into a
bunch of people you get a lot of stuff
going on or you're carrying a bunch of
groceries you only have one hand free or
possibly you just get into a back of a
car I'm going to show you some really
useful tips
all right first thing you want to do is
turn Siri on you do that by holding down
the home button for about a second or go
to Settings General Siri and then turn
on raise to speak that means every time
I hold my phone to my ear Siri would
turn on once you hear that chimes Siri
is listening to you and it'll take your
commands so to send a text you say send
a text or send a text followed by the
name of a person in your contact list
send a text to Jonathan
which Jonathan okay so in this case I
have a couple of Jonathan's in my
contact list Siri just wants me to be
more specific so I can make sure it
sends the text to the correct person
Jonathan Stein okay what do you want to
say to jonathan stein see after she
asked a question for confirmation you'll
hear a little chime that means she's
ready to listen to your commands make
sure you don't start talking till you
hear that time or else you may miss your
message so now you're ready to send your
message you want to make sure you don't
pause for too long while you're saying
your message or else Siri will interpret
that as the end of your message and
you'll get cut off send a message to
Jonathan Stein okay what do you want to
say to jonathan stein if you're going to
the store I need eggs milk popcorn
so Siri interpreted my pause as the end
of my message now there's two ways to
handle that one is to not pause to think
about what you're going to say before
you're going to say get your thoughts
clear before you actually send your
message the other way is to hold down
the microphone button for the duration
of your message this way Siri will keep
listening as long as you have that
button held down so let me show you what
the difference is like send a message to
Jonathan Stein okay what do you want to
say to jonathan stein okay so now I'm
gonna hold down the microphone button
for the duration of my message
hey man if you go into the store I need
eggs milk sausage steak avocados and
some kale
ready two second okay that looks right
so I'm gonna send it on okay I'll send
it now if you want to use punctuation in
your message you will have to say the
actual punctuation you want to use let
me show you hey man
period sorry I can't make it tonight
period thanks for the invite though
period later exclamation point okay that
looks good it looks correct now that
goes for all punctuation that's periods
commas question marks exclamation points
and even semicolons if you're the type
of person to use semicolons in the text
message now one last tip if you want to
send a message one sentence at a time
you can totally do that you don't have
to worry about pausing or Siri cutting
you off or anything like that
I'll show you how that's done yo
ready to send it send
I'm coming over now period
don't eat all the pizza exclamation
point descendant send so one of the
biggest takeaways with using Siri well
the first thing is to speak very slowly
and clearly so that Siri has a better
chance of understanding you next plan
your text in your head that way you
don't get cut off mid-sentence if you're
not holding down the microphone and
finally it's best not the text if you're
driving however in emergency situations
Siri is a pretty good hands-free option
let's go back to the office I don't know
your work address now of course it's not
a good idea to text and drive
definitely not we always advocate safety
first safety first yes that's it for
this week's show
all right thanks so much for watching
you can reach out to us on twitter i'm
at donald and i'm at me doable and then
