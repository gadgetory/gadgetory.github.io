maybe you've liked the idea of tech
being invisible nothing here or looking
like something out of a Dick Tracy movie
if so what's on my wrist might interest
you it's the Martian passport watch and
it's a SmartWatch it doesn't require any
other gadget except for the phone that's
in your pocket the whole time
communicating with it via bluetooth now
you ever think about communicating with
your watch call my wife it's all about
style and it's all about a type of tech
fetishization that's specific to that
Dick Tracy aesthetic you're not gonna
find any health monitoring on here
you're not gonna find any music playback
that's not that type of SmartWatch
there's no touch screen on this watch in
fact there's only a tiny LED screen at
the bottom it's really an old-fashioned
analog watch with style that's a 1960s
type of throwback Martian makes three
different types of watches in this line
the passport there's also a round one
called the victory and a candy colored
version of this watch with wrist bands
ranging from black silicone here to
leather and the feel of it stainless
steel case the crystal cover the analog
construction here feels like a throwback
watch and one that you might not feel
uncomfortable at all wearing out it's
pretty stylish and a fossil type of way
but better because this thing is $2.99
that's pretty expensive compared to
other smartwatches in this territory and
what it has really is a suite of
Bluetooth connecting apps and services
you're really going to be banking the
most on using this for its speakerphone
capabilities there is a microphone that
is noise cancelling and there's also a
speaker built into the base of this
watch and with Bluetooth 4.0 it connects
with iOS or Android to make phone calls
to answer phone calls
hello oh good are you
I'm also via small Ola treat at the
bottom it will tell you who's calling
communicate text messages notifications
and allow you to change settings
martien watches work with an app that is
available now on Android is forthcoming
on iOS and it allows you to take a short
of notifications you're going to receive
via social networking email or other now
iOS you can still do a lot of functions
right now including placing calls using
Siri the way you would with any other
Bluetooth device and also to receive
text messages via that little OLED
screen or find out who's calling you
want to do some call screening there's a
vibrating buzzer on here that's very
loud and lets you know when it calls
coming in now you can also feel what's
going on in your pocket if you've got a
phone and some pretty good nerves in
your thigh but if you want to sit in
your living room for instance your
phones out of reach there maybe you
don't have your phone you left your
ringer off and I found it pretty useful
in that regard what else you're gonna
use this thing for well unfortunately
this does not port over to a Bluetooth
headset and it does not have any
headphone jacks so any communication
you're doing with the Marcia Pat sport
watch is going to be like Dick Tracy's
speaking directly into it but it's going
to have a real impact when you have
conversations in fact when I spoke with
my wife on a shelf and told me to switch
back over to the phone as soon as
possible
hey how are you doing I'm calling for
the test video can you can you hear me
can you hear me at all okay and it
charges via micro USB via a little door
on the side and it comes with its own
micro USB charge cable and even a little
AC adapter the Martian watch will last
for up to seven days of standby two plus
hours of talktime and thirty days of use
for the analog watch now so far over the
course of a week that's held up and a
week is pretty good between charges for
all of your basic functions and two
hours of talk time may sound like not
that much but trust me you're not going
to want to talk for more than 25 minutes
on this maybe not even five my arms
getting tired
there are a couple of other neat funky
little features on the Martian watch
including a camera mode
that allows you to Bluetooth connect to
your camera app and control the shutter
from the button there's a fine phone
mode but it only works via the Martian
app and plays music instead you could
also try using the leash mode which lets
you know when the phone and the watch
have gone out of range and gives you a
little buzz reminder most likely you've
left your phone in your apartment
so that's the Marchman passport watch in
a nutshell cool design not really that
useful a set of features watch
fetishists take note i'm scott stanford
