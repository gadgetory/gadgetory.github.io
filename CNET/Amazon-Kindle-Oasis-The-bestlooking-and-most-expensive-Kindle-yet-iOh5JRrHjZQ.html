lightest Kindle e-reader ever measuring
three point four millimeters at its
slimmest point and weighing just four
point three ounces making it 20% lighter
than any other Kindle it's also the
first Kindle to include a protective
carrying case it's a swanky leather one
that integrates a backup battery no less
but all the design awesomeness comes at
the rather lofty price of 290 dollars in
redesigning the Kindle Amazon moved the
battery and electronics to an ergonomic
hump on the back side of the device that
allows you to hold the e-reader
comfortably in your hand and shifts the
weight of the device so it's better
balance for reading and feels more like
you're holding a book with a spine the
other significant change is to the
lighting scheme the built-in front light
has 60% more LEDs and they're embedded
in the side of the display not the
bottom the result is a brighter light
thats plays a little bit more uniformly
across the screen the other updates are
smaller the text on the touch screen ink
display looks very close to what you get
from step down Kindles there's the same
sharp 300 PPI resolution and similar
contrasts alas the device isn't
waterproof which isn't a huge deal but
given the devices name and its price
point
some people might expect that feature
you can turn pages by touching the
screen or press the physical page turn
buttons on the side of the device it's
also worth noting that you can hold the
device in your left or right hand while
reading thanks to a built-in
accelerometer the screen automatically
rotates the page and page turn buttons
to match what hand you have the device
in the case is pretty slim but it
obviously adds some weight to the
e-reader it adheres magnetically and is
easy to remove and slip back on so you
can easily take it off when you don't
need the extra protection Amazon doesn't
give exact battery life numbers but if
you leave the cover on amazon says the
battery life jumps from several days to
months it all adds up to the nicest
Kindle e-reader that amazon has ever
produced
that said it's high price puts it into
luxury territory and will primarily
appeal to Kindle devotees who don't find
paying extra to have the slimmest
lightest Kindle available I'm David
carnally thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
