solutions is a gorgeous and expensive
luxury with perfect balance and aerofoil
shaped bamboo blade smart features are
part of the pitch to them you can
control it from your phone or automate
it using built-in climate and motion
sensors on top of that you'll soon be
able to control it using voice commands
with Alexa Amazons and virtual assistant
so here's what I climbed up here to ask
is a smart ceiling fan like this one
really worth it now there aren't
actually a lot of smart ceiling fan
options the haiku here is one of the
first there's also one from Hunter that
works with home kit these fans are
really nice fans or expensive luxury
fans in their own right before you add
the smart since so that's not the reason
they're so expensive and that's kind of
a problem you don't have a lot of low
end options don't have any competition
so if you want to get a smart ceiling
fan you're gonna need to buy this luxury
haiku one or that nice under home kid
fan now for the money with the haiku
you're getting a fan that you can
automate with app controls on your phone
or those building climate sensors I
mentioned there are also little extra
settings in the app you can set it to
whoosh mode where it'll automatically
simulate a breeze by altering the speed
you can set a sleep mode wherein a lot
of management work during the night to
keep you cool without waking you up it's
pretty neat fan of some new features
it's also a certified works with nest
gadget so it can work with your
thermostat to help cool your home more
effectively and efficiently of course we
don't have a nest thermostat installed
on the smart home right now we switched
over to the eco v3 the Eco p3 has remote
sensors that keep track of the
temperature in specific rooms and then
around that room specific setting
absolutely the same thing the fans doing
it's using its built-in sensors to take
the temperature in the room and then
cool effectively to that point one of
the reasons we went with the Haiku here
in the scene that smart home is because
we wanted to test out its ability to
work with the LexA that will come on
April 28th when the Haiku home alexis
skill arrives in the Alexa app at that
point we'll be able to ask Alexa to turn
the fan on or off or speed up or down or
dim up and down the light that's built
into the fan at this point smart ceiling
fans aren't that affordable the only
models or luxury ones like these so kind
of have to want that sort of nice luxury
centerpiece with a designer finish and
the airfoil blades in order to get one
but if that's not what you want or
that's not what you want to spend then
you're kind of out of luck right now
we'll keep testing it out and let you
know what we think with our full review
later this month</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
