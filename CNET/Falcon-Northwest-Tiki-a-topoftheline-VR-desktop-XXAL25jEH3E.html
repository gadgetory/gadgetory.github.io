the oculus rift is $600 the HTC vive is
$800 you should also be prepared to
spend a lot on a VR ready computer you
could certainly get away with spending
$1,000 or $1,200 but that hits the
minimum spec if you want a future proof
yourself and and be ready for not just
this generation of VR games buy the next
generation of the one after that be
prepared to spend several thousand
dollars like you would with this the
Falcon Northwest Tiki now this is a
small desktop tower despite the fact
that it packs in some very powerful
parts there's even a cool window on the
side to show off your graphics card via
very high-end one like we do here and I
like that has a big weighted base so
that you don't you know get excited and
accidentally tip it over when you knock
your elbow into it but that also means
you can't flip it around and and and lie
it down on its side like you can with
some of the other small towers that
we've looked at in this super high-end
super expensive configuration we've got
an Intel Extreme Edition Core i7
processor and we got the nvidia geforce
gtx 980ti
desktops graphics card not just a
regular 980 so this is the most powerful
performer in our current lineup of VR
reddy pcs but it's also the most
expensive this configuration comes in
around forty nine hundred dollars you
can get a very decent configuration for
maybe a little over two thousand dollars
if you want to knock back a couple of
specs a little bit keep in mind you're
spending this much because you're
getting very high-end stuff and this is
the same system that oculus uses
in-house for a lot of their VR dev so if
you really want to feel like you're part
of the virtual reality world it is worth
checking out that is the Falcon
Northwest Tiki</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
