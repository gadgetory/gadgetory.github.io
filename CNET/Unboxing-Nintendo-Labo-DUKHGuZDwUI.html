in game consoles in years
it works with a Nintendo switch and it's
an unfolded cardboard kit that's like
robotics meets Lego meets origami I've
got the two lab oak it's right here and
I haven't even opened them yet and
before I get to play with them I want to
unbox them and show you and me what's
exactly inside I've got the lab o2 kit
the toy con 2 kit which is the robot kit
which has awesome box art and the
Nintendo lab Oh toy con one variety kit
which has the tools to build all the
other stuff that you probably have seen
in the other videos including a piano
and motorcycle a little robot fishing
pole and a little house thing that you
put your switch in plus the ability to
interact and do other things so these
are big boxes really big and I brought
the switch here to compare this which
looks really tiny so you feel like
you're getting a big box here and there
they're heavy
because there's a lot of cardboard
inside so let's open up to icon one
first go and let's give it a go
cardboard box for cardboard things
inside ooh
it's a very it's a very nice clean the
beginning get started and this has the
Nintendo lab Oh game box so it's not
download it's actually a game card and
see if I can get that open well put it
aside for a sec but inside there there
we go I can open that up
open that here twine one you as a place
to put your name and inside is a little
antenna switch game card so no downloads
necessary that's got everything
including toy con garage all the
software that'll work with this kit so
it says get started make play discover
and it tries to guide you through number
one remove the game card number to
insert the game card into a switch
console number three select make and
start building so it includes
instructions Howard Lego instructions to
guide you through I did those at a demo
I haven't done them yet here with this
kit let's try to keep this intact and
move this off to the side here are all
the pieces now on the top these are
parts that I last used for the fishing
pole orange string we have blue string
we have some plastic grommets
I remember sticking those into cardboard
like Lego Nintendo's instructions will
make a clear when you need to use this
stuff so you've got some some of those
pieces here with no numbering or label
but I remember that they will tell you
to get that ready just put that off at
the side for a second but you can see in
a rubber bands we've gotten more rubber
bands here it's a lot of things going on
there's rubber bands there's a little
foam pieces going on these are the
reflective stickers now these should
work with the IR camera and a toaster we
have rubber bands more stickers lots of
little stickers those are key and more
blue string
unknown what this is for we will know
when we play the game don't lose any of
these pieces keep those in this bag now
we've got lots of cardboard and I kind
of take this out of the box carefully
first ones labeled a wow this is a lot
of cardboard they're basically the rest
of not a surprise the rest of lab oh is
cardboard it's a lot of cardboard sheets
and I don't want to I don't want to mess
any of these up so I'm gonna take these
put them off to the side oh okay
thankfully they're all lettered so you
won't lose track like this one up here
it says H lay them out they're all pre
perforated and remember using them last
time if they're pretty easy to detach so
let's see what we've got
I'll put this box off to the side here
and yeah okay so we've got a we've got
another a that's green we've got a third
a that's blue and then we're back to be
blue see blue so that's you know there's
there's two codes is the color and
there's also the letter D you can also
see what project it's for at the top
well oh I don't want to detach these yet
okay keep that intact
E now it says there's a little fish up
there so that's for the fishing kit
let's put that back over here you'll be
very careful now also for the fishing
kit F these look like they're for the
house a now there is not just stuff in
here for the the five projects there's
extra pieces to that can be used for
other things within toy con garage
for other kind of DIY projects there's
that there's this is the motorcycle part
do the sheets for the motorbike kit a b
c d e looks like the handlebars are part
of the handlebars yeah ok this one's big
I'm gonna keep going through the letters
of the alphabet geh alright the
motorcycle one is a pretty big project I
did not get to do that one yet
piano got the pieces to the piano here
this is a real playing piano so if you
tap the keys it'll it'll make I mean
real Nintendo toy cotton playing piano
it'll make noises when you tap the the
keys so these are all for that I think
there are 28 sheets of cardboard in this
kit I like if there's just like a little
tadpole over there for no clear reason
just to be fine G here's some musical
notes here's a little singing frog
here's where some of the keys are it
looks like possibly it's hard to tell
that's it that's the whole box it's
actually less random things than I
expected and a lot more sheets of
cardboard which should not be surprising
because all of this like paper craft is
really done completely through folding
and popping out cardboard as you can see
that the other pieces are pretty minimal
which is pretty cool so we're gonna do a
lot more with this when we actually
start building it and playing with it
but that's what you get in the labo
variety kit and we're gonna take a look
at the robot kit now this thing has
awesome box art it also costs $10 more
than the variety kay this is $80 for the
robot kit and the box art on the back is
pretty cool too because you're
controlling a giant backpack robot which
is fun but you won't be able to do any
other types of projects with this it's
all about using the robot and it's all
about unlocking more game modes with the
robot so you make the robot which is
supposed to be a much bigger project
than any one of the individual kits with
the variety pack you play with these
crazy string controllers and things that
sense your movements there's also a
discovery element so you can open it up
and see that again the way that all
these things are triggered is through
infrared stickers that interact with the
camera and maybe there's some other
things too it also promises there are
ways to play that I didn't even know
about there's Robo studio which is like
a DJ mode there are some extra
challenges to unlock very nintendo
there's some customization suggestions
that maybe can guide you to how to color
in and and design it yourself and hey if
you have another toy con robot kit there
is a vs. mode so you could do total
Pacific Rim robot on robot gameplay with
four joy cons on the same console that's
fun but just remember you have to buy
two robots to even get to that and
customization you can do some stuff a
toy car garage here but I'm not sure how
much you can do with this kit whether
it's the software I mean a lot of that
is about
bringing your own devices and
customizing the joy Kahn's let's get
into unboxing so again I haven't seen
what's in here I'm expecting it to be
pretty similar to the variety pack in
terms of a whole lot of sheets of
cardboard the box is a little bit
thicker than the other
welcome to Nintendo lab oh alright so
similarly very clean get started here is
the instructions which again remove the
game card start up and follow that's
nice they include a game card for this
for a Nintendo lab oh by the way I feel
like I keep saying lab oh and labo and
alternating it's all those words that
everyone's gonna pronounce a little bit
differently so that's what happens with
with unusual new brand names here is the
game card for a robot I like the game
card art that's cool as you can see it
so that's there put that aside and let's
start unboxing the rest of it put that
over here and wow there's a lot more
straps and stuff that come with this one
not surprising because you're building a
backpack with this so some of these are
backpack straps some of them again are
are kind of pulley type strings same
type of strings and grommets that were
in the other kit so there's a
consistency to it
there's also cool because it maybe means
if you have both kits there are extra
things you could you could do between
them unclear but possible and inside is
stickers not quite as many stickers but
a bunch of stickers and a lot of blue
and orange string and a lot of these
sturdy feeling straps that are just you
know just pure pieces of cloth here for
fabric so different lengths and you'll
figure out what to do with those once
you start
getting into the experience but that was
over there and the rest is all cardboard
so let's take these out I think this
looks like fewer sheets then came with
the variety pack these are all for
building the lab Oh robot when I
remember wearing it is that it is
largely the backpack there's also some
foot attachment stuff and there's also a
visor that you pull down over your face
that allows you to enter into different
game modes like a first-person view so I
haven't set this up yet but I'll just
show you what's in here before we ever
set it up we've got once again pieces by
it looks like that are coated to parts
of the robot that's that's clearly the
the mask a I remember wearing that I
think it's tall my Twitter profile and
that's the robot I think probably the
rest of the instructions
a B C and so on right go through those
you know when you set these up you
basically end up which is like a lot of
oh no yeah I don't want to attach that
yet oh this one's it that's interesting
this one's a whole unfolding one so
that's like a special it's extra stuff
in there it's probably to make it into
the even larger piece so that's an
unfolding piece of cardboard that I'm
not gonna not gonna do yet because I
want to pop it out but I think it seems
like a pretty key part of the the case
of the backpack g.h yeah now I the color
changed there's a different part of the
robot where J is this interesting looks
like again it's a folding the folding
part of it so kind of change his own
inside here there's a whole bunch of
other what is this more stickers lots of
white reflective stuff it's right in the
middle of this many sheets of probably
reflective material for inside the robot
but I don't know it doesn't even have
numbers on it so three four sheets of
that stuff inside inside part J so I'm
just gonna it's like folding so I'm just
gonna stick that just stick that back in
there and deal with it later okay k this
looks like some hand and foot stuff
labeled left right we're gonna go
through the whole alphabet here L and M
and n oh there's like a little city at
the bottom there's like a little little
details and stuff they drop in just for
fun probably because you end up on card
card end and you start to feel like you
need a break and they want to cheer you
up keeping your kids focused Oh
these effector the fists again P
here's Q up is another weird piece Q is
a unfolding bit yes the stuffs it gets a
little more elaborate you know certainly
I don't want to bend these or break them
I'm sure I haven't looked into
replacement parts but I think there are
ways that if you want to replace things
you could I hope there are ways to
replace things and our that's what comes
with it pretty clear cut and this one
has a lot more folding pieces to the
robot and that that's you know that's
one project you're gonna do with robot
you're not going to engage in in
building a lot more of them but I think
it does take a lot more time so that's
what's in both the lab Oh kits and
they're gonna be available soon and
we're gonna play with them and try using
them programming them stay tuned for
more
