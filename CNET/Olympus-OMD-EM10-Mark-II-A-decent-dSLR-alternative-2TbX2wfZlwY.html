5-axis image stabilization and a better
viewfinder plus some new features the
e/m 10 mark 2 is a definite improvement
over its predecessor but it also faces
some steep competition in its market
segment 700 to $800 mirrorless
interchangeable-lens models which want
to displace entry-level DSLRs I'm Lori
drew nifer CNET and this is the Olympus
om-d e-m1 dials the m10 mark 2 is
probably one of the more complicated and
certainly more complicated looking
interchangeable lens models in its price
class though if you want you can
certainly dumb it down if you're
intimidated by all the features while
it's generally comfortable to use and
well designed the grip does feel too
flat and the SD card doesn't slide very
smoothly into the slot I keep thinking
I'm going to break off a tab it does
have a few notable capabilities for its
class including live composite which
lets you see the image develop in real
time when you're shooting time-lapse
exposures and it helps keep shadow areas
dark it also has a novel AF targeting
pad control which lets you look through
the viewfinder while using the back
display as a touch pad to choose your
autofocus point the photo quality is
very good up through ISO 1600 with one
caveat I'm not a huge fan of the power
zoom kit lens it adds a lot of time to
camera startup and I really wish there
were a zoom switch on the body because
zooming with the lens ring isn't very
comfortable in this design video quality
is fine for typical personal
applications but the HD isn't very sharp
compared to 4k capable models like the
Panasonic g7 plus the Olympus's video
has a lot of edge artefacts performance
is generally very good with fast
accurate autofocus but it's 4.2 frames
per second continuous shooting speed
with autofocus can't keep up with the
competition all of this just skims the
surface though for more detail you'll
have to read my full review on
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
