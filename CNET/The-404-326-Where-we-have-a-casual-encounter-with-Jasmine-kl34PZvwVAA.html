tv.com it's going on ladies gentlemen it
is the 404 I'm Jeff Bakalar I'm Wilson
tang and I'm Justin you and this is the
show where we're having a casual
encounter with jasmine brands lazy oh
yeah that's on the show today got
Jasmine friends here she's the editor of
mp3 and digital audio and formerly my
boss at cnet com let's uh let's pro you
woulda told us what's going on your
altered state plane go ahead I just got
off a red eye so I might be a little bit
look yeah Jasmine just flew in from San
Francisco she works out of that office
and she took a little bit of of a
medical aid I would call it yeah let's
let's use that medically yeah used a
little bit of an eight on the plane and
maybe too much of it off you know it's
funny they were warning you about us and
you are the i'm not using delinquent
yeah if you guys can't see Jasmine's
literally lying down in the fetal
position her mouth she's true as well
yeah it's very strange now that's right
yeah this is funny because um when I
first started at cnet com Jasmine was
actually my boss somebody i pod
accessories correct how I was gonna
treat me like a bitch like that just
make me review ipod accessories all day
long you liked it I did love okay what
would you rather do ipod accessories or
printers that well okay come on Emily
the form i could give you a couple
examples of things you'd much rather i
can think of a lot right now i still
remember what I let you write yes oh so
you you were the one who hired Justin
actually um that would have been my boss
at the time higher Justin and
technically he was his boss however he
was kind of foisted on you Cory right
yeah I did it on purpose I wanted it I
wanted I wanted somebody to boss around
just a whipping boy I just I wanted to
manage people and that was my
opportunity so the daily dry cleaning
duties was kind of that
you know the flowers the fresh flowers
on your desk every day I was amazed okay
I would never do that no I got a meadow
Jasmine really good manager I didn't
even ask get me coffee no no it was all
made so what did you make him do I just
made him do real work yeah like not like
you liked this review or more like
actual work that an intern would want to
do yeah like what I would have wanted to
do so so there is never time awesome so
it's basically Jasmine's fault that I'm
here right now you want to blame anybody
for my business it is too oh yeah why
did you bring just us well when you were
working with Justin do you expect him to
blow up to the status of the full oh wow
you're my biggest fan will ya another
using the right way yeah you know I'm
reading on your Twitter right now you
can check out Jasmine's Twitter at weird
eared jazz that's Jas were terrible when
you hear it was it was actually somebody
we had like a little contest on our
podcast yeah like what should i make
Mike's I wanted it to be something like
there's a there's a story there's a
reason right there should i picked but
like what's the most difficult thing to
pronounce know it um there was there's a
few they were all pretty pretty boring
yeah couple more slightly sexual so i
was low it was like okay I'm gonna go
with and then in the last minute like
right before we went on to the show this
submission comes in and it's totally
perfect because I'm constantly
complaining i review like headphones
yeah a lot of like in-ear headphones my
ears are really small yeah like I can't
like fit earphones into them a lot of
time that's a really strange year that's
small that even the smallest size of the
earbud won't finish it does for someone
like it your piece itself has to be
really small yeah some of those stuff
you have to jam all the way into your
ears too that's not very comfortable
yeah so I have weird ears and the top of
my ear like the flap on the top is like
really really short you I can't wear the
ones that wrap around right as it's a
hobbit straight here now I know it's
gonna be in the blog how are you cloud
your ear
are you reviewing all these you can't
put heads of it is different the Jasmine
reading of yeah freaky ears it's funny I
did actually write a blog specifically
dedicated to how you can never trust a
headphone review because it's very
everybody's ears are very vicious the
Jackson and not only on the outside and
that's for the shape and the fit but
your ears hear you hear things different
so for this is why every headphone
review is terrible for you every here I
say don't trust a headphone review I
have mine as well as anybody else right
so there are never enough it's all just
bullet just doesn't matter not
completely but I mean you generally you
know you're gonna if I'm testing a pair
of 500 are sure you know a 530 so sound
good care what any regard your free just
fall out all the time yeah those don't
fit me at all purple driver earbuds I
mean they're giant have you tried out
those shoes that were you have to go to
like an audiologist and get a cast of
your ear or something yet supposedly
they fit perfectly it's a um it's they
make it a cam a mold also good
audiologist and you get this like Donald
actually did a slide show Donald Bell
who also reviews mp3 players and stuff
you go and they squirt this like stuff
interior that sounds all sounds really
really but I'm and then they make a mold
of it and they they that what can be
attached to that will be your earpiece
basically you're fitting instead of
using like a silicone tip or something
yeah you use a special mold that has
been designed for your i'm not sure that
sure does it I know that ultimate ears
right there well known for making their
professional model happens and there's a
few other companies be you know what I
think you can probably get them for
almost any your phone but you've never
tried before I wouldn't know it's I just
feel bad like a perfect fit that's
Donald real quick though real quick so
you're the music mp3 editor what is your
recommendation for headphones and an mp3
player like the perfect it yet the
perfect pair if you had say everybody
let's say reasonably two or three
hundred dollars to spend well get three
hundred dollars to spend what should you
get
Jasmine on the spot on the spot this is
an interesting um it's an interesting
question because it's I couldn't without
knowing the person what they needed but
I'll tell you what I have oh yeah um I
use a my beloved sony walkman s-series
really and um with a pair of odd day oh
I think they pronounce it perfect fit
your phones these are editors how much
how much do both of those go for so the
the S series that I have which is like I
stepped it doesn't have the noise
cancelling built in so it's a step down
I think that one goes for like a hundred
and forty that's a lot that's an mp3
player okay that's okay the headphones
are also 150 mile an hour ago but that's
not bad i mean you really think about it
most people probably gonna buy an ipod
ipod touch right spent 250 dollars off
the bat in every village the headphones
anyway yeah and the apple ones already
costs like thirty or forty dollars right
you can get like good sounding
headphones for like fifty dollars or
less really ones that sound better at
least in that are gonna be more
comfortable right then like the standard
stock but do you see with you know cuz
those are just plastic i mean they're
not terrible call it was a quality of
audio it's always gonna sound tinny and
kind of hollow actually i want to ask
you a question about iphone headphones i
wanted to get one that has an inline mic
on it that isn't too expensive but
that's also durable pisgah because i
feel like the ones that come with the
with the iphone there really that they
always fall apart right at the earpiece
yeah absolutely is an issue for a lot of
your bed yeah either at the earpiece
around the wire cable because the cables
tend to be really thin you can't find
any like honestly you have to spend like
a decent amount of money usually to get
a thick ear cable right but um I either
is actually around up there basically
with Milton in line mics that were with
your iphone a couple of masa top of my
head these audio ones that I'm using
they happen to have built-in mic I don't
use it but they do there was the radius
atomic bass with Mike those are like
look at the DS happy remoted into
right you can act on your iPhone I was
gonna say cuz I know you've been you
know you're it you're like sort of loopy
and you're silly your job I'm really
impressed though I've been doing this
for a long sleep at this point the
monster dr. dre beats does not appear oh
ok they have a mic in its if I would buy
those yeah and they need some work any
uh actual like big waste you know cuz
like you you go to bestbuy you see like
headphones all over the place water
brands that you should stay with yet
what are what are the monster cables of
hell yeah you know what if I would have
said cost myself but I've been trying
some of their headphones out lately like
their ear buds are pretty good you like
yeah cause well also they all come with
a lifetime warranty right yes so if they
break they'll replace them that's all
mom to steer clear from honestly like
Kobe just so far people I had to know
they make headphones but yet worse for
mp3 player yes please do um skullcandy
yeah actually I mean and you know like
I'm totally into the whole fashion style
thing but they just like haven't
impressed me at all with audio quality
those are a little bit to urban
outfitters II for me you know I'd like a
lime green set of earbuds sure sure
little dude really constantly surprises
me is that headphones have been around
probably what for like 50 or 60 years a
long time yet I mean we haven't
perfected this as a race actually I mean
not it's not know we haven't perfected
it however I mean hedge funds have been
doing very well for a long time I mean
they kind of their challenge now is to
make like make them stand out in some
way like cramming three drivers in an
earbud yeah that's a lot of draenor vs
free drivers in each present speakers
right like I know people who have
speakers from 20 or 30 years ago that
some beautiful yeah for sure yeah
absolutely yep and you have that with
headphones also okay I mean I know cable
durability can be an issue but brute a
lot of them have the cables that unplug
mm-hmm from the side and so if the cable
breaks you just go out and get a new
cable right the headphones themselves
they're well made I mean people have had
headphones for you know yours
years and years but then these are like
oak cans over the head I don't think
like earbuds are not really meant to
last forever that's attached I think the
problem is that people have different
requirements for their headphones that
they do for the speakers right like when
you're traveling some people want more
bass you know some people want more
trouble or natural sounding yeah for
sure um you know personally i like i
like the big bass in my ear yeah you do
you know all that why you're right on
that bike year yeah I like the answer
location while i wrote my boy yeah i
share but he's not a big fan of you
never ride with two earbuds in your i do
that all the time it's a really bad idea
injures i could do it all the time it is
it not illegal it is it's not illegal
but it's very dangerous you know what's
funny is that illegal in California it
is yes Wow legal okay never go back to
California of course it makes sense
offer for people who are not getting why
why is it illegal because you can't even
well in California it's illegal because
it's dangerous right because you need to
be aware even even a bicyclist needs to
be aware of the sound like a horn it's
the same thing mean illegal you can't
word headphones in a car exactly stereo
head and I don't you were one right not
that I've seen lunatics do that they're
listening their headphones in the hotel
great ya know even funnier is that at
the meetup our buddy Edwin came up to me
was like hey I know you we've met before
this because you almost ran over my feet
one time yeah he was right around the
office good gin apparently I almost ran
into him in this in the crosswalk in
realize that's not just yeah sorry Edwin
alright let's move along into some story
seriously we're talking were talking
about the the show title today yeah
casual encounters yeah so let's write
the little backstory apparently the the
craigslist section of casual encounters
the most is more of you than a lot of
the matching websites is that true right
so I read in the New York Times um
yesterday I'm not sure when the article
went up but I'm not sure I've now I'm
kind of going back and forth it might
have been their whole personal section
right have you know casually that would
make more sense for women but I would
believe I would believe the the casual
encounter thing all right i prime i'm
pretty sure casual encounters has more
try
epic then like match.com ye harmony and
like that chemistry ok so I all about
looking at the article it does say
casual encounters uh is higher than any
other I don't know this combined any
other match.com eharmony yahoo and for
people that don't know casual encounters
on craigslist.com is sort of the place
where people go to post uh like sexual
requests for people right so yeah you if
you want a random hookup you would go to
this part of the site and like you know
ask for me too but they they use like
code writers code like who wants to come
and shave my armadillo it's funny cuz
the the art is actually saying that
people use roses instead of saying money
you know so they'll be like a hundred
roses to ever wants to come over and
make out I've seen dollar symbols in
there Oh actual dollars yeah I've seen
actual dollars that people are not that
sly yeah Jasmine isn't clearly on that
way I have been a casual encounters
before yeah she's like a stallion easy
yeah well that's what I'm lives alone
are just like that so hilarious
sometimes you know I don't want to blow
myself up but I'm sorry god here we go
with the confessional in Syria so that I
i go to casual weekend is just to read
it right it is like reading a Miss
connections right I don't miss
connection sometimes provide some sort
of entertainment value Reb have you ever
gotten a Miss connection before chasm I
haven't had one written about me now
you've written one though I can tell by
the look and it was successful really
okay so can you tell us about it without
giving too much detail no I don't hey
I'll just say that it was cool and that
it actually worked okay so you get a
date out of it and
let's clarify this is a missed
connection right casual encounter amidst
encounter okay it was very cool it was
really cool I mean I think it's like a
really fun story yeah and I think that
girls have a better chance of getting
that response that I could I believe it
I was not expecting a response was it
immediate to it was like within like 24
hours only god that's oh and it was it
was the person the whole missed
connections thing though like that
really bothers because it's always like
Oh brunette chick on the L train about
six o'clock I mean you a big glasses so
the thing about a missed connection of
my roommate and I'm also another
colleague corinne who I think's been on
the show um you know we're talking about
this separately and you really I mean
you need to have a connection oh yeah
like you need to have like an exchange
of some kind I contacted my contact at
least like can't just be my lawyers day
off the train some guy was like yeah 40
feet away and I had binoculars exactly
otherwise it's not I mean you have to
have a connection yeah Usher you know
that's the whole point of it but um yeah
it's it's interesting I i I've heard
that it has worked before but I don't
think it works that much I don't know I
thought it was very rare well it's cool
because I feel like a lot of people read
it for the comedic value but then
they'll see somebody that knows it could
be their friend I know that guy ya know
like link but they're friends I mean I'm
looking at it right now it says it for
20 asian woman yellow coat patent
leather you want to be real specific
looked at your watch at this time Alyssa
I saw you eating ice cream on Third
Street we're gonna take a break more
with jasmine friends women come back so

maybe another time fine I loved your
like in all the latest what is it all

get him remember would ya okay a real
quick I want to mention this um during
just before the break from the chat room
there's a website called subway crush
com yeah that sounds missed connections
yeah it's pretty much wit mishka net
missed connection right but for the New
York City subway that's great it does
like New York Boston Chicago SF do you
ever that story about that kid in New
York uh he started a website for a girl
that he had a miss connect I remember
that it was called like my new york
girlfriend i remember that anything a
founder yeah he he had a long-standing
relationship you found he found her know
I was like eight months long really but
they I bro yeah they get it broke up
didn't work out that's a cool way to go
by do I feel like every time I get on
the subway noise like that girl is cute
but I am a woody every internet yeah
lets you get over those like shy moments
right and then they can choose to
respond to you okay you know it's
actually really bothersome I used to get
up really early to come to me to come to
the office for elegant rich before hate
guys have to say this ecstasy no creep
ha good there was this girl were you I
saw you only read a who i saw every day
yeah is eating a stuffed pepper yeah i
know that she was she you know she she
did the stare at me every day you're so
arrogant no no but the thing was this
she was not attractive oh she was not
too what's your point I
I'm just really scared of ever running
into her again on the train the worst
story I've ever heard no climax in that
stories of God's calling a girl other
knows me this is one really ugly girl
that I see a lot I just worry about you
see ya accident I can tell she thinks
I'm hot there's office people have to
say Ashton Kutcher it has got problems
and you are you think people losing
their job god forbid someone finds you
attractive Wilson you should count yeah
man yes thank your lucky stars anyway
let's not worried about that far it
seems right about this girl how do you
live I was gonna how do you wake up
every morning and look in the mirror and
say I'm an okay guy I'm sorry I'm sorry
jasmine yeah it says just uncool how do
you live this guy back in cotillion
calls from the public time time to show
the love it took six holes for scenic
ever since the meetup there's been I
want to say a certain lacking voice man
voice mails yeah not that they're the
quantity is there it's the quality while
everyone by the Sunnah Tuesday did you
guys just totally like turn them off or
something no other than what happened
you actually what I think is actually
helping a lot is that we're getting
we're getting a lot more yeah we're
actually forgetting to empty the
voicemails that wait a bit first of all
that has nothing to do with the fellas
like we know I'm saying no no no it
doesn't it does game it does because
there's these like literally three day
breaks right yeah where we can't get any
better no the long as that's ever
happened was the wheat one weekend and
that was like that was the last three
weekends yeah yeah come on it the real
problem is that all the voicemails are
ugly girls calling to tell Wilson how
hottie and we can't delete those quickly
and that's the problem all right so I'm
gonna play these um 1866 four for Cena
that's how you do it this one is about I
guess we should talk CBS do you watch um
664 440 boys are good Ali's you know six
numbers just go to bed Jasmine you're
done someone called in about the big
bang theory on CBS okay yeah play it up
and show know that it's it's a it's a
weird voice may I just wanted to mention
it someone's asking about the slogan
think they get it hey for four crew it's
fake bankai I'm just a little bit
curious about your motto high-tech
lowbrow what is lowbrow mean anyway hit
the show by well let's see I feel like
we're uh I'm Justin you explaining what
a joke is yeah I know right the web
definition of lowbrow bill is a
Philistine or a person who was
uninterested in intellectual pursuits
and that would accurately describe us I
think well that's alright maybe we
should change our motto no no girls do
you like it is that like we don't we
just don't take ourselves from browse
like crass yeah you know that's for
whatever you want I think that's a good
way to look at and we'll take all
negative labels good we embrace all
kinds of things like that but thank you
for calling bill it's been a while I'm
ex-gay next voicemail this is you guys
are gonna
explain this this is about Jackie Chan
No hey 404 this is tim from California
hey I'm surprised that you guys haven't
picked up on this headline about Jackie
Chan about his remarks that Chinese
people need to be controlled Jackie
Chan's China remarks prompts backlash
Chinese people aren't pets says one
pro-democracy Hong Kong legislature I
think it happened last week when Jackie
Chan said that democracy was not good
for the Chinese people and that Chinese
people needed to be controlled whoa so
uh yeah talk about that what Wow well I
don't know hey as our resident Jackie
Chan look alike what do you think Wilson
uh well okay so I believe in democracy
women to put that out there yeah we do
not live in America uh but I'm always a
remarkably surprised at how well the
communist government managed that no
know how well cover up no not to
cover up but to literally bring
about you know 600 700 million people
read out of poverty and give them jobs
and you know like day to day like we all
like we in the United States we always
talk about like freedom and this and
that and like we want to have a free
press and freedom of speech and the vote
for this but before we even get to that
we all want jobs right right but don't
you think the government is being
oppressive to its people buying I don't
know man like what would you do would
you wear their vote or easy is getting
too real in another would you go real so
I know it's really strictly not what is
really this is not Wilson your string
where'd you get that red shirt from I'm
gonna yellow stuff on it too it's kind
of weird but hammer it'swell any why are
you taking anything that jackie chan
says seriously i just throws barrels at
people and jumps through ladders I'm
saying he's just yeah I just always
handcuffed to something and beating
people okay yeah and then like making
jokes about the Beach Boys I wouldn't
bitch boom bitch bush no man can fail to
fish that actually reminds me of this I
was reading this story from the pretty
estep website right there we I've heard
so is about why are people so stupid and
a lot a lot of it you know you just have
to like take people circumstances and
their culture into ya like what is good
for like one group of people might not
be good for another yeah that's all cuz
we're I mean you know you're Chinese you
know this like stability is highly
valued in chinese gold and as the whole
idea of sharing to read like you don't
think of yourself as the individual less
than you do as the family right but i
don't think that's always a good thing
though there are times when you know you
need to think individualistic leader
right ok this is aa who's gotta poop
jokes to tell right now yeah whatsoever
it's jasmine do you know what the
difference is between a drug dealer in a
prostitute oh do you know let me tell
you the punchline is you done this
before a prostitute can just wash her
crack and reuse it equally appropriate
response like no one like okay well I
can't believe it again another thing
yeah what was that about how humans can
be sold over and over again whereas
drugs can only be sold one and this is a
story about human trafficking yeah we're
not going to talk about their let the
last time so bad last point I'll make
there's a difference between economic
freedom and political for you yeah and
the kindness their have managed to
balance the two all right Carla that's
have you done that is my last comment on
this is priced Wilson will be speaking
publicly yeah Kissinger over here will
be speaking later you'd like to hear it
move on to actual story we have one last
voicemail I think someone called us up
about things happen I think someone
called us up thinking we working a
little too real this is what we don't
talk about that Jack Joe your drugs are
wearing off on us someone called us up
thinking we were comcast technical
support hey for a full crew this is
tommy from jacksonville is calling in
because i was on my comcast DVR and i
click the messages and it said that
they're gonna cut off the NFL network
after may first i was wondering what to
deal with that was so uh they want to
redirect that you wanna
the evidence that's ya know I have
nothing to say to a secure every answer
that's the reason join the millions of
people giving them your money a lot of
people don't have a choice about that's
true yeah I disagree what ya don't watch
TV watch it online it's very good idea
has more to do with used it's a
licensing thing I do about it you don't
have a TV i watch all my television
online after the fish squint a lot I
haven't I have a nice computer screen
yeah but you check out TV com right not
like Hulu or any of these other yeah
it's only TV dad I just wanted to make
sure definitely not Hulu or no one at
man on loop love that genuine answer
from Jasmine today alright let's move
along let's get back to a few stories um
let's talk about PSP real quick yeah did
you you play with that yeah I you
success that you did not I did I used to
I don't have it anymore what happened to
it I moved out of the house that it
exists oh just kind of leaching pretty
much enough but I have full use of it a
long time well you know what uh that it
turns out this is amazing I don't know
what your experience was with PSP loved
it sony says that PSP piracy levels are
quote unquote I love this sickening what
sickening we need people pirating PSP
man people who pirate PSP game uh-huh
now I didn't even know you could do that
oh my god it's so easy it's so II do you
how do you do well I'm not gonna really
go in he's gonna charge us twenty bucks
not just for reference it's funny cuz
I'm just trying to think about the
people i know who own a PSP and i would
say easily ninety percent of them pirate
games how does it work because it relies
ecarter yeah that memory stick duo that
fits right in there you like games on
there you load like hacked firmware and
the things just plays whatever it's a
joke so it is sickening it's sickening
it was very accurate this this statement
uh it's unbelievable people are ready
the peter dil de got the senior vice
president of sony computer entertainment
america marketing says
it's to the point where people are just
about ready to jump off the cliff and
pull support for the platform watch so
that's saying like it's so bad that
developers like you know what it's not
even worth it for us to develop a game
on PSP oh my bad i see so much money off
thing about it is it's unbelievable i
bet if you go into a game shop that's
the least uh least amount of game sold
right PSP for sure yeah they're talking
about that game retribution uh wretched
resistance retribution it was a diver
met you know not that i would know but
it was out making the rounds long before
weeks before the show yeah but i mean
you know at the movie industry can still
survive you know people have been
pirating games for a while now yeah i
mean that sony would have something know
what though the thing the the d/s it's
really easy to do with that DS lite also
but are people doing it on the same
level as they are with the pier I don't
know not as high but right it's
unbelievable never when people were
soldering their own chips into the PS
yeah that was crazy yeah and have you
started here but like the ipod iphone
piracy thing like ankle if hacked the
drm and now you can actually just go on
in the install apps really really just I
having to pay for directly into your
iphone for free I'm not exactly sure how
it works but uh they're making some big
deal about it they're calling at the end
of the iphone economy but not that we're
condoning anything but don't you think
that it's gonna you know i was always a
big believer that you know this kind of
stuff will just never really be able to
uh Pirates will always be one step ahead
you know I mean you always imagine but I
guess it you know app stores about to
make its like billion sale yeah it is
yeah pretty soon unbelievable maybe if
they make their prices something a
little bit more palatable for consumers
people will stop stealing things yeah
how much what is the max you'd be
willing to pay for an iphone application
for an iphone application i guess it
depends on what it was mmm like it but
something really cool like would you pay
five bucks for it something really cool
cuz i had told me be 89 cents no no no
way even that 99 cents is good two
dollars for something really i saw some
like fitness app for like six bucks and
I was like are you out of your mind yeah
I just can't think of any application
like so much five dollars or six dollars
I don't feel like it's a lot of money
yeah but you're not enriching your life
with any iPhone app it's like well
there's really involved I can
like five bucks but like I've seen him
for more than that if they had like a
copy paste add that you can watch a lot
of the ones are selling for five dollars
aren't that involved right yeah they're
not they're natives or so let me give
you example there is okays you'd never
pay any money for again I'll give you an
example this is purely purely I wrote
about this app and it's purely purely
for deadheads like no one else would
want it just shows a bear and you can
jiggle it haha no it's a it's a photo
MIT it's a really cool app but it
doesn't really do you know a lot yeah so
it's a photo mosaic app and at the
mosaic itself and saw this one this one
photographer took you know hundreds upon
hundreds of photos of the Dead
throughout their career oh my god and he
made this photo mosaic of all of his
little tiny pictures into a face of
Jerry Garcia and then and then you can
click into the I click on the photos
yeah this is like what are you talking
about did you make this ad you do you
take something on the break you clearly
develop this application but what is it
called with the emissary I think it's
just like the great that's a Grateful
Dead photo mosaic grateful head okay you
click on on the photos you can zoom in
you can drag around you can get to all
the different photos and then you
finally zoom in all the way and it gives
you the information when it was taken
where it was taken you know what was
going on it's like six bucks that's a
lot okay but someone's looks like a lot
to pay for just photos right I mean I
however I mean if somebody's a huge
deadhead like maybe it's worth it for
that like anyone okay thank you dude I
was inundated with so much grateful dead
music when I was a young child I can't
like there's you don't listen to it I
can't there's one song i like but like
