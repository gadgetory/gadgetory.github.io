hunting season I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your scene at update the holiday
shopping rush has begun but before you
start stressing out I have some hopeful
news retailers are pushing out more
online sales than ever before so you may
just be able to do all your shopping
from your computer and not feel like
you're missing out on the deals at the
mall the national retail federation
expects the average consumer to do forty
percent of their holiday shopping online
this year which is more than ever before
but chances are you're still going to
have to go to the mall for some items
but you can keep yourself sane by
loading up on a few apps start with the
basics a barcode scanner I liked red
laser and shopsavvy before buying an
item scan the barcode in the store by
turning on the app and pointing the
camera at the bar code these apps tell
you who else is selling the item at at
what prices so you can find out if
you're getting a good deal and if a big
retailer or even amazon is selling it
for less you should ask the cashier if
they'll match the lower price according
to deal science this year more than
twenty percent of big retailers are
offering a price match guarantee best
buy is one such store and they'll even
match amazon just be kind to the clerk
and have the prices loaded up on your
phone when you get to the register so
you don't hold up the line you don't
have to carry around flyers and weekly
circulars anymore for coupons use the
app shop uhler filter out only the
stores you care about and it'll pull up
any coupons or promotions going on and
you can even flip through the entire
weekly ad the cashier can scan coupons
right off the screen or they could just
type in the code manually i also like
using the app king ring to search for
random coupons and promotions for
restaurants or other things like auto
services if you're someone who doesn't
like carrying around a ton of loyalty
cards in your wallet or on your keychain
it also stores those for you digitally
to stay organized throughout the month
use the app return guru it's for iphone
and windows phone it keeps track of your
receipts in a neat
way once you buy something before you
stuff the receipt into a bag and forget
it use the app to take a photo of the
receipt in a day or less the app will be
updated with the return policy of that
store and you'll get a push notification
alert a few days before the return
deadline hits just in case you changed
your mind if you're shopping with a
posse you can put someone in charge of
managing the app shopkick it's more of a
scavenger hunt to collect points to earn
gift cards you earn points by walking
into stores and in some cases by
scanning items in the store that your
tech news update but you can get more
