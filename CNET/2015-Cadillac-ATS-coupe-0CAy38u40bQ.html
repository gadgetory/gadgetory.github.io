met doesn't like the Cadillac ATS
there's some negatives for you but what
it was missing is a coupe model and
doesn't miss that anymore because here
it is two doors beautiful fastback but
not so fast back that it's almost
cartoony which the cts coupe looks a
little bit too to my eye what's going on
here also under the hood is an
interesting story like the sedan you've
got a 2-liter turbo 4 unlike the sedan
more torque out of the same engine
they've run another 35 foot-pounds out
of it 295 total and like the sedan you
can also get that 2-liter 4 with a
manual gearbox see where I'm going very
interesting inside the cabin some new
technologies are going on there as well
they had the cue head unit available
it's going to have a special app store
for it later in the year which is a new
Cadillac innovation this is also one of
the first cars GM is rolled out that's
gonna have their built-in 4G LTE
wireless to operate those connected apps
as well as create a meaningful hotspot
in the car which you just can't do with
3G shared within a vehicle on driver
assistance Texas will have a lot of the
common plays available now like adaptive
cruise and magnetic ride control is also
in there but they've also got a front
and rear aware automatic braking system
not just front aware Cadillacs moving
fast toward this thing they call super
cruise oh no there's this first
production Cadillac you'll see that has
lost the crest around the Cadillac logo
that old Hail Caesar Caligula looks from
way back in the day just was looking
real dated and now they're moving away
