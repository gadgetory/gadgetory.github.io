Varga yella gala Wadi are turning to
LinkedIn I view this thing I kind of
look up all the recruiters for every job
I'm interested in and I just kind of go
and look at their profiles that strategy
has paid off a recruiter contacted verge
on LinkedIn and she's now up for the
internship of her dreams at NPR students
shouldn't feel intimidated about
contacting recruiters but
LinkedIn's head of recruiting says they
should do their research first about the

is someone who's been thoughtful
they've been ambitious enough to reach
out and they're highly insightful about
their communication that will
immediately rise to the top of the stack

qualities but what can students add to
their profile when some haven't even
landed their first job so many mushu's

experience but they could have a job at
they out in high school some of the
project work they did in school is
surely worthy of being called out in a
meaningful way on a profile ending the
volunteer experience clubs are involved
in extracurricular activities intramural
sports students should keep in mind that
recruiters find candidates by searching
for keywords when you're out looking at
job descriptions or job postings take a
look at what's in these job descriptions
in terms of language skills and
experience and if you have those skills
and experience weave them into your
profile I mean it's gonna really help
sort of tighten up the alignment of your
background and someone who's out there
searching to fill that job
