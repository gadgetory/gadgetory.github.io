city this show covers the biggest news
related to Google and its parent company
alphabet
what else does alphabet own way mo
jigsaw calico X verily and more more
isn't a company I just mean there are
more companies anyway I'm your guide is
apt art today we're talking about
diapers Google app changes and the
world's first holographic phone first
stop the world famous Android Avenue
have you guys heard about the red
hydrogen one phone it's from red better
known as makers of very fancy cameras
the hook for Reds first phone is a 5.7
inch holographic screen
CNET's Patrick Holland got to check it
out wait a second Patrick can you hear
me I hear you fine so let's talk about
the red hydrogen one phone you got to
see it in person in some kind of
exclusive event did red let you grab any
footage showing off that holographic
screen okay so I did see the phone at
the event it's very important to say
that I saw a prototype of the phone in
fact it was very limited what I saw but
it was very impressive
but going into the event they did not
want to take any photos or videos of the
screen and I think it's important to let
people know that the screen does work
but the reason they don't want to show
pictures of it is because it's a
holographic 3d screen and if you look at
it in a 2d picture it wouldn't really do
it justice of how awesome it is can you
try to describe how the effect looks
then yeah I'll try to describe it if
you've ever seen a 3d movie it looks
like that the difference being that when
you're in a 3d movie and if you move
your head around sometimes a 3d effect
can kind of move around or not be as
impactful and also your you have to wear
glasses looking at the screen what was
neat about it it's called for view so if
I move the screen around I kind of had
this the 3d effect no matter which way
kind of tilted the screen or angle the
screen if I was in landscape or portrait
it seemed to have the the same effect
and it was pretty impressive at the end
of the rila there was a shot from the
movie brave and she's shooting the arrow
and you see the arrow coming out of the
screen right at you and
I I asked the guy immediately can I just
watch this real again I was really
impressed by it because I didn't expect
it to work it reminded me a little bit
of the first iPhone when I heard that
you could swipe and touch a screen but
that was crazy when we actually saw it
it felt a little bit like magic and felt
a little bit like that thanks Patrick
