bags welcome to Berlin I do like this by
John I think I like this particularly
because it wasn't so serious or po-faced
and the spiral genre it was still very
much about cloak and dagger is still
very much about the very true elements
that from that genre
you know duplicity espionage people
stabbing each other in the back double
agents triple agents quadruple agents
and all of that and but it was all seen
through the lens of sex and drugs and
80s I was going to say rock and roll but
it's not just rock and roll it's like
techno and like electro and weird teeny
music and just this weird feral energy
she's in all of it pretty much and she
is non-stop I mean the the physical side
of what she has to do every single day
and I shoot like that was unbelievable
and she was unrelenting and she
sacrificed her body to do it and an
injured herself really badly I've got
the times and just kept blowing on
ya know I broke it in the dying days of
split
it's a phone of the director knows I got
broken honey I'm really sorry if you
wanting high off somebody else I totally
understand
and there's that no no no we'll make it
work so I was saying what I think you
know for the the character who is this
weird federal kind of dude I think might
be quite nice they have you just have a
class to cast and we don't need to hide
it and you should make a virtue of it
you know that was young was it I think
it was this and ya know
ya know he was a great character to play
and he was so damaged and so ugly and so
riddled with sexually transmitted
diseases that I'd say it'd be fun to see
how he got there especially if he
started in a place that was pretty far
away from that if he was nice to see
somebody go from I don't know something
a bit more solar put together and more
quintessentially say they're typically
spy movie gun you know and then become
serve no lover of muck he knows he's
rushing towards the gates of hell I mean
he didn't know is it but he's a gleeful
II doing it as well he's gonna enjoy
every single minute he can on this out
because he knows the spy games gonna
kill him</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
