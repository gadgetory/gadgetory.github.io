congregate for a little indoor surfing
you get cyber cafes Desmond crisis the
newest member of the C net central team
takes us on a tour of these high-tech
hangouts
so let's say you need to get on the
internet but you don't have the hardware
required to get online what's the
solution try a cybercafe
hi there i'm desmond crisis the new
early adopter of emerging technologies
it's the coolest thing since the
acoustic coupler the hottest mix of
coffee tea and tcp/ip
now brewing in two local pit stop
this is the icon byte bar
it's a cybercafe now it looks just like
any other restaurant until you get
inside see they've decorated it kind of
like the inside of a computer a very
artsy computer now anyone can just
decorate their restaurant but here's
what makes this place truly unique it's
a public access computer hooked up to
the internet from here you can browse
some of your favorite pages with
Netscape log in to IRC and chat with
people all over the world or log in to
see you see me and use live videos to
communicate you can jump in and start
surfing around you may not know where
you're going you may not catch as many
ways but you're gonna be able to access
it pretty quickly and get a taste for it
oftentimes people coming here from
Europe and send an email to friends as a
postcard so quite a few friends back in
England who I've just sat down to the
cafe net terminal here at the cabin to
go cafe in Los Angeles one of the things
that's interesting about this and they
seem to have a real high-speed
connection and to keep things quick
instead of running dos or Windows
applications they've built it under UNIX
and X Windows from here you can chat
email browse the web or telnet to the
side of your choice for a fistful of
quarters
it's very interesting they package a
coffeehouse and actually be able to sit
down and
get your email without actually having
to have a computer at home instead of
going home or going to a bards I can
come in here to that with my friends
playing the computer a little takes the
fear out of people who are not familiar
with computers as the world becomes
increasingly more crowded complex and
antagonistic it becomes necessary for
people of diverse interest to gather
recognize a common humanity and
communicate one such place for doing
this is the world cafe here in Santa
Monica California so this is like the
mothership there's a Romulan that's
Federation and they're trying to kill
each other for the plan what we did was
we created you know kind of a Tiki
environment around computers within a
six months ago I didn't know a mosquito
bite from a megabyte I wanted people to
feel comfortable around computers with
computers it's a wonderful vehicle for
social interaction next thing you know
you've got two or three people right
around you and all of a sudden you've
created a half a dozen friends around
the computer
I've had that experience and I think
I'll write to you
I haven't seen anybody come up to me and
say hey what the heck is this
with over 80 internet eateries worldwide
the cyber cafe may become the
long-distance phone booth of the future
and you don't even need multiple body
piercing blue hair helps according to
one job a joint owner the idea itself is
as old as the Apple Barrel provide
access of an atmosphere where people can
exchange ideas cyber cafes are not just
for technocrats or digerati they're for
everybody so get in and get on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
