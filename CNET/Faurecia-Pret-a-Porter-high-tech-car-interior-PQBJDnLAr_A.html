the cabin to differentiate their
vehicles yes
power and efficiency and pricing and
sheetmetal still matter but the cabins
becoming in many ways the defining
statement of the car maker so here at
four SIA this year at the LA Auto Show
they're showing a concept of a cockpit
that they call Preta port a and among
the key technology features we're
looking at are this sort of soft cover
upholstery based flip-up lid which is a
idea for them to give the passenger as
much technology as the driver normally
this is kind of a digital ghetto over
here but check this out here's a rear
projection screen they're envisioning or
it could also be a flexible OLED screen
dedicated to the passengers mobile
device which would live down here in a
tray that has wireless charging
inductive charging which is on the
market but hasn't really taken root yet
this could also have a wireless data
link to bounce out the signal using like
iPod out or the connected car consortium
technology to give me a nice reliable
interface from the device but I needn't
even see it it could all be projected
right here even the lowly air vent gets
a little bit of a technology touch you
know today you've got something with
little slats and louvers or you rotate
this eyeball around and it always looks
like it's kind of cockeyed in this case
nothing here moves but the actual
airflow can be changed up down left and
right because of special guts they've
engineered in the dash this always looks
the way the designer intended it let's
go to the driver's side now here in the
cockpit of course this is concept car
stuff but the idea is give me either a
rear projection or an OLED screen like
we saw on the passenger side and this is
truly all contiguous screen again that
could also bring in elements of the
drivers mobile device while combining
them safely and intelligently with
automotive information also here a vent
thing going on here in the structure of
this central pod is the air flow
technology structures that bring it
right to your face where you're always
trying to get it but you got to use
these vents on either side that sort of
barely reached where you really got the
sweat working we've also got a central
controller here and again wireless
connectivity for the drivers mobile
device here for either char
or for data connection from apps to the
car and vice versa
one more thing I'll show you it's kind
of low tech high tech but how many of
you have asked me about this why is the
door armrest always in the wrong
position for you here is a power
operated armrest move it up move it down
get it where you want it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
