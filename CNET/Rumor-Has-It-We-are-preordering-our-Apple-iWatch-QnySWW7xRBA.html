and welcome to the final episode of
rumor has it that I'll be co-hosting sad
face but don't worry the show will go on
after Emily leaves but for today we're
going to try to cram in all the things
that Emily loves most about tech rumors
into one show okay wait does that mean
that we're only going to talk about
cable cutting innovations and that every
single Apple rumor you're gonna sing to
the tune of achy breaky heart no first
up an apple rumor I promise I won't sing
it because my grandmother told me I'm
tone-deaf but seems lacking i watch is
really gonna happen see what I did there
even apple analyst Gene Munster our
favorite person in the world thinks that
apple should make an iWatch now the New
York Times is adding credence to this
rumor with the cool news that the iWatch
will have curved glass Corning's new
flexible willow glass that we saw at CES
could be the mysterious curved glass in
question I think that you should buy
this for me as a consolation prize for
you going to Boston and for me singing
achy breaky heart definitely more xbox
720 news source speaking to gaming site
kotaku has reportedly obtained two xbox
720 development kits as well as a system
overview document which details the
specs of Microsoft's next-gen platform
and that source is the magical super day
who has been a next-gen console source
before who is this guy and how does he
get all this stuff no but according to
super super diet and updated and
improved version of the Kinect will ship
with every Xbox meaning it will no
longer be an optional add-on gamers will
need to have the new Kinect plugged in
and calibrated for the Xbox to work at
all according to the sources see I can
see how this is a benefit for game
developers if every Xbox has to connect
every game can be developed with this
tech in mind however for people living
in a small apartment this news is
terrible if I start dancing around in
front of a Kinect I would knock over my
couch my coffee table a cat and would
possibly fall out of the window how is
that fun now before I leave the show
forever I want to use some of what I've
learned from watching the rumor mill
like a hawk lo these many years to give
you my
top 5 predictions for the future of
technology forever and ever number 5
apple will release a new iphone it will
be a negligible improvement over the
last one and then they'll do it again
number four samsung will also release a
new phone that is negligibly better than
the s3 and it'll also be pretty good
it'll have more features in the iphone 6
but no one will care whichever phone you
like more iphone or samsung half the
world will think you're worse than
hitler and the other half will high-five
you number three people will finally
revolt against the notion that laptops
are dying and tablets are taking over
listen humans still use language to
communicate and language is composed of
letters which have to be typed up in
order to form words so therefore we need
keyboards so therefore we need computers
so their number two wearable tech body
monitoring tech and our newfound
obsession with neuroscience and body
chemistry will conflate into embedded
gadgets that will tell us when to sleep
when to eat when to get some sunshine
and why we should suddenly listen to
half of your music and those gadgets
will be able to play the happier music
to boom and finally number one this is
the technological advancement I want to
happen most and I believe in my heart
that it will though I will be a wrinkled
and gray and too feeble minded person to
enjoy it by the time but one day my
grandchildren will witness a revolution
the cable companies will release us from
the shackles of advertising and pre
bundled cable deals and let us pay the
cable TV ala carte they will treat us
like the adults we are the studios will
realize that advertising is a broken
model that has ruined print media and
it's coming for TV too and they will go
where the New York Times bravely went
before them to a subscription-based
model and all will be right with the
world bravo Bravo that happens what do
you guys think will any of emily's
predictions come true which ones do you
think will come true don't forget to
vote that's our show everyone wait why
are you dressed like a hot dog because
I've secretly always wanted to wear this
and I thought you were going to make me
wear it for humiliation one day but you
never did so I decided to take
into my own hands because I probably got
the ps4 release date rumor wrong and I
won't be here when we find out what a
way to go out Emily classy as always it
is also as a hot dog that I want to say
to you my co-host and co-parent of our
show rumor has it that I am so happy
that you're going to take care of our
baby while I am gone living on the east
coast and if there is anyone in the
world who can handle the demands of a
feisty cranky selfish sleep-deprived
constantly pooping rumor mill it is this
lady right here and I promise that I
will send you child support from Boston
and buy a child support do you mean that
you'll still help write it of course I
will even over skype right and that's
our show everybody please share your
rumors that rumor has it at cnet com or
call us up 1 800 750 cnet and tweet us
love you guys i'll miss you I'll miss
you
