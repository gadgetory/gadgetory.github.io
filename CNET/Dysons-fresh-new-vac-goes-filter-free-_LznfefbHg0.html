Dyson kinetic big ball animal allergy
vacuum now this is a new machine from
Dyson that eliminates the filter all
together so it vacuums and vacuums and
vacuums and doesn't lose suction over
its life now this isn't an inexpensive
vacuum it's $700 so really a couple of
car payments we're talking about here
and competitors that we've enjoyed from
auric and Electrolux each ring in at
four hundredths so you're definitely
paying a premium for that filterless
design what's more those competitors and
even the $200 sharp rotator Pro were
able to go toe-to-toe with Dyson in our
test especially with large particles and
pet hair but when we're talking about
fine particles things like sand and
ground-up dirt the Dyson kinetic really
shines in our test it fit better than
the ORAC touch which is our previous top
scoring vacuum in that category so a
very good result there now all that
basic stuff out of the way let's talk
about that cool new filterless feature
dyson pulled it off by breaking that
cyclone that gets the dirt out of the
air into hundreds of smaller cyclones
with the vibrating tips that help
prevent clogs
now I'm not entirely sure that I
understand everything that I just said
but in our tests it worked like a charm
lots of vacuums promise no loss of
suction but this is a vacuum that
actually walks the walk and we tested
this out by having it vacuum up 10
pounds of fine particulates in half
pound increments after each half pound
increment we'd test the suction to see
how it was doing we did this with a
couple of vacuums if you take a look at
this graph I think it illustrates the
results really well that line at the top
is the Dyson kinetic and it really
maintains its suction doesn't dip at all
the more we use it the other vacuums
can't say the same thing they dip down
as we continued using them the suctions
disappearing so you need to clean out
the filter every couple of months in
order to keep it up at that top level
it's nice and you wouldn't so that's a
great result but does it make the Dyson
kinetic $300 better than the Oryx touch
and the Electrolux retro clean I'm not
sure that it does but I couldn't blame
you if you wanted one this is really
nice vacuum and it's a really cool
feature not having that filter you hate
speeding up the filter in your vacuum
you just want to not worry about it
it might be we're splurging thanks for
watching with the Dyson kinetic big ball
animal allergy vacuum I'm Rui Chris for
