morning's program our program is about
to begin
take you
you
ladies and gentlemen that program will
begin
you
it's very rare we get our hands on a
device or series of devices that can
encompass every market you also creep up
songs I won't read the simplicity to
Jesus wrong the coils are Christmas for
blackberry disbelief Guo Yan if you will
surely come my favorite feature is multi

I like that everything is going to keep
running all the time because I keep
running so I want my blackberry to keep
running as well it now supports cascades
it gives a more smoother transition from
windows one of the pools feature in
every 10 is the balance if I have a
world profile i can quickly shifted
shift with a personal profile climbing
the personal profile i can quickly ship
to the enterprise profile
I think it's a big win for carriers for
users for developers bb10 I think with
new gesture approach allows people to
quickly access things and with the hub
see things across multiple forms of
communication we're really looking
forward to blackberry enterprise service
10 take advantage of its to enhance
features so that we can have more
manageability more security I think what
excites me the most about the blackberry
10 is the camera and video functions
it's very exciting for us further access
give mobilizes to our films I'm just
your platform the keyboard is literally
and I've used many of them literally the
best experience the fastest experience
here is the most efficient experience
that I've ever seen for me flat boot
time is the festival so tell us a little
bit about your journey well I mean the
journey has been phenomenal you know
last August we toddled it up and we
thought that we had covered two and a
half million miles of air time between
myself and Marty Malik's business
development team and we haven't stopped
since then we've literally been to every
continent on the planet except
Antarctica there aren't any developers
there we've been to 44 cities we've
taken our tour everywhere we've seen
developers all over and connected with
them and it's been an amazing experience
all around so what has the response been
from developers in the rim community
actually pretty phenomenal you know
we've seen all kinds of developers that
we've never seen before young people so
for example in Latin America we had a 12
year old get up and get a pitch at one
of our pitching contests his dad
actually had to do the translation
because he didn't speak English in India
we saw another 15 year old who'd written
a book about programming for blackberry
10 and of course we've been seeing this
huge groundswell of support one of the
things that we saw in January we ran to
online port authorities an event where
developers get online and they work with
my team to work to solve problems to get
apps submitted to the store we had
15,000 apps submitted in one porta
thought in one week
and 19,000 and next weekend so there's
just this huge wave of support for
blackberry 10 with developers so you
sound pretty excited about what you're
seeing from the developers that totally
stoked totally pumped anything you'd
like to say to them right now sure to
all the developers out there thank you
thank you for your commitment your
support your dedication with your help
we have put together what is bar none
the largest catalogue of applications
ever for a first generation product
launch in mobile so thank you and thank
you again Thank You Alec so the
developer community has really embraced
blackberry 10 and is excited to show you
what they have to offer but there's also
another group that is over the top about
today and those are the dedicated
blackberry 10 fans let's take a look at
two who just couldn't keep their
enthusiasm to themselves my affiliation
with blackberry and why I set up
blackberry community because I'm falling
in love with blackberry at the first
thoughts that's it blackberry 10 will
give a jaw-dropping moment for everyone

enthusiasm to ask many people as

president and CEO of research in motion
torsten Heinz
Oh
good morning good a good afternoon good
night wherever you celebrate the launch
of becker e10 thanks for joining us here
from new york to london dubai
johannesburg paris jakarta Delhi and
Toronto and I guess I hear some noise in
those cities right now if i'm not
mistaken and for sure to all of our
employees watching around the world we
have definitely been on a journey of
transformation a journey to not only
transform our business and our brand but
one which i truly believe will transform
mobile communications into true mobile
computing it's been almost one year
exactly since i was handed the reins at
research in motion and it has been
easily the most challenging year of my
career to date but as it has also been
by far the most exhilarating and the
most rewarding one and I remember people
asking me how I felt about taking over
the role as CEO and all I kept saying
was it was one of the best opportunities
I've seen in my career to date because I
know that innovation is at the heart of
rent and that opportunity that I saw was
blackberry 10 and now finally here we
are
this is so exciting and so many people
have played a role in getting us to this
day our developer community and
application partners our carrier and
retail partners our customers and the
members of the communities where we live
and work but most of all it has been our
employees the people at rim have been at
their most creative their most engaged
and their most committed I really would
like to take this moment to thank our
employees and to congratulate you on
your accomplishments blackberry 10 is
here this is one of the biggest launches
in our industry and today is actually
not the finish line it's the starting
line when we first gave you look at our
vision for blackberry 10 we told you we
were building this with a specific set
of customers in mind it's people who are
a hyper-connected socially people who
have an appetite for getting things done
the true multitaskers and people who
want to get the most out of their
smartphones it's people who need balance
in both their personal and professional
lives people want simplicity of having
everything in one place it's people who
want to flow seamlessly from app to app
and feature to feature without having to
go in and out using a home button all
the time people who consider true
multitasking a must-have and we all know
these people are moving quickly and they
need their mobile devices to keep them
up to speed and help them get things
done and guess what blackberry 10 will
keep them moving
we've seen the industry move from
narrowband to broadband from analog to
digital and now we intend as rim to lead
the move from mobile communications to
mobile computing to true mobile
computing what does that mean we will
soon give you more ways to connect your
mobile experiences and yourself not just
other people but to the whole world
around you you will be in the middle of
your personal internet of things
constantly connected to all your
information in real time and thus
BlackBerry's secure network and mobile
computing endpoint capability we will be
a leader in connecting you to your
internet of things and this is what
being connected will mean in the future
we have created a platform that is able
to work with other machines to extend
you and your information beyond the
mobile device to occur to your home
you're a healthcare system or wherever
you are this is the promise of the
blackberry 10 platform we are in an
error today we're having a good browser
great messaging apps a good camera and
social networking on your phone is just
expected so with back way 10 how do you
make sure we go beyond those
expectations first blackberry 10 builds
on and betters more than 20 years of our
communications and security leadership
and it adds an industry-leading secure
reliable real-time operating system at
the core and blackberry 10 has a focus
on content adepts and it offers a user
experience that it depths beyond
anything you have seen before but before
i get to unveiling this platform in all
its glory i'm going to ask for a few
more minutes of your time
just saying we have reinvented this
company's simply not enough today
represents a new day in the history of
blackberry two years ago we had to make
a very serious decision adopt someone
else's platform or build a whole new one
from ground up for blackberry and we
made the tough call to go it alone and
for that I must thank a few people first
two then dodge and his team for
providing a fantastic OS and building
the software architecture that provides
the foundation of blackberry 10
the hardware engineering and software
teams at both rim and qnx just continue
to amaze us with what they are pulling
off second we have built strong and very
important relationships with our carrier
partners and an ecosystem that has grown
to over 650 carriers and distribution
partners in more than 175 countries and
want to thank Jim Basel II for this and
finally today you will see the amazing
experience we are bringing two people
with blackberry hub blackberry flow and
peak and you will see the connection
between rim and Q and X for the
inspiration and innovation that led to
these three amazing innovations in
mobile computing our heartful things go
to Mike Lazaridis who's in the audience
today
Mike from all people a trim thank you so
much for guiding us into the future the
future is still hard work bringing an
entirely new platform to the market and
ushering this company through a really
difficult transition took careful
planning and we absolutely knew it was
risky it took heartfelt and sometimes
really brutal honesty with ourselves and
with others we've created a new global
leadership team to lead the next phase
of growth and innovation of our company
we have transformed ourselves inside and
out and we have defined our vision a
dedication to the boundless
opportunities of mobile computing which
makes the day the perfect time for
another big announcement I want to share
from this point forward rim becomes
blackberry
it is one brand it is one promise our
customers use a blackberry our employees
work for blackberry and our shareholders
are owners of blackberry from today on
we are blackberry everywhere in the
world
the new starting line that today
represents begins with one consistent
brand a brand that is recognized around
the world blackberry has changed we have
redesigned the blackberry experience we
have reengineered our products we have
reinvented this company and we want to
reflect us in our brand we are now more
than ever a company that is united in
our vision for mobile computing and it
all starts today with our renaming and
with the global launch of blackberry 10
there are fundamental pieces of our
lives that blackberry always has
enhanced our ability to communicate the
way we share messages and email and the
way we use our time we knew we had to
maintain that foundation communications
and give people what they want and it
needed to be simple and elegant and the
elegance in blackberry 10 is clear when
you want to take action take action with
your information or app a photo a video
a phone call or a chat everything in
blackberry 10 is there in one place for
you and with a simple swipe you can
share you can consume you can create and
you connect that sounds pretty good
right come on
so how do we do this for me that
question cannot be answered without
seeing the faces of our incredible
blackberry employees all twelve thousand
of them in 36 countries worldwide and
this is why this moment belongs to them
so I asked them to help count us up to
the reveal of the new platform
ladies and gentlemen we proudly present
the blackberry z10 and the blackberry
q10 the new blackberry z10 and the new
blackberry q10 powered by the platform
blackberry 10 aren't they beautiful we
knew that a large display was important
because this is the window into the
blackberry 10 experience and we made
sure by using the latest green
technology the blackberries 10 screen
images are clear sharp and incredibly
vivid actually what we did is we created
a cinematic experience with this screen
the back of the device offers a textured
surface that makes it really comfortable
to hold and the back cover krebs ever so
slightly around the edge that it just
feels good holding it in your hand and
the browser is incredibly fast intuitive
responsive and elegant and whatever you
do you're owning one swipe away from the
heart of all of your activities now i've
been using backward 10 faithfully for 10
and i'm amazed by how responsive i can
be in our quickly i can share
information this device aggregates
information for me intuitively and it
adapts to me and makes me even more
efficient I've also been testing the
blackberry q10 this is the first
blackberry 10 smartphone with a physical
keyboard
and we know there is a lot of physical
keyboard lovers out there right we heard
you loud and clear here it is we built
the same fantastic blackberry 10 user
experience but with a traditional
physical keyboard and we built this for
all those people who told us we just
have to have a physical keyboard typing
experience and you're going to love this
so no matter what keyboard you prefer an
all touch or a traditional keyboard
these BlackBerry 10 devices are simply
the absolute best typing experience in
the industry period and meticulous
attention has again been paid to every
little detail of the q10 to take a look
at the glass we've cover this material
was designed exclusively for this
product you won't find it on any other
mobile device and it's thinner lighter
and stronger than plastic and it looks
beautiful so these are the devices and I
think it's time now for us to see them
in action please join me in welcoming
Vivek budweiser on stage morning
everyone
vivek we have been on quite some
journeys road shows and over there yes
when we did all this what did you learn
about what's the most exciting part of
blackberry 10 oh that's easy so for me
it's got to be the blackberry hub one of
the things that I noticed is I've got
email I've got Facebook I've got Twitter
Linkedin BBM everything combined
together and one of the things that I
wanted to focus on is managing all of
this how do I save time how do I reduce
stress well black Putin and the
blackberry hub allows me to do that so
why don't you just show us yeah sure so
first off I'm actually going to show you
what we mean by blackberry flow and you
mentioned it earlier it's about moving
in between applications it's not about
home buttons opening closing you can see
as I open up applications and minimize
them just by swiping from the very
bottom how effortless and easy this is I
have all of my applications running
real-time like nothing's being paused
this is real-time true multitasking and
it feels fantastic but you know what
sometimes you get immersed in a lot of
content this display is gorgeous and you
often have a cinematic experience no
matter what you're looking at and you
know Dawson you and I have kind of been
looking at a lot of car videos recently
so i'm sure you'll remember this one and
you could be on the internet you could
be in a game you could be reading a
document it doesn't matter you're
immersed in that moment so let's play
this for you now now think about this
I'm connected in so many different ways
and I want to be able to look at what's
just come in so that red light that
famous red flash starts blinking what do
i do well by peaking to the hub I've
never left the experience nothing's
paused nothing's compromised it
continues to operate fast fluid
reversible gesture Oh fantastic so easy
to use
really multitasking exactly I do just
enjoy this video by the way so one of
the things you'll notice but I didn't do
this with my car haha so one of the
things you'll notice is I've got a bill
that's coming don't really care about it
get back to what I was doing good i noe
because there you go I delete them
anyway so if you look at this activity
in and out that doesn't exist on black
pretend it's about flow and this is the
experience we're delivering now let's
say something important does come up
let's say to BBM like my buddy Johnny
hey you busy maybe probably not mm-hmm
so you can see how we've moved from
content straight into my blackberry hub
I'm managing everything this is the
power of black we flow and peak and you
know what I find exciting yeah is that
with this flow we have designed a user
interface and experience you can only do
this one-handed and with one thumb did
you recognize this exactly only one
thumb and you have two full control of
where you want to go what you want to do
it is a fantastic experience so simple
and easy you know now we're in the
blackberry hub how about I show you some
more you'll notice that everything's
easy to manage like I said it's all of
my channels it could be anything
Facebook Twitter Linkedin you see if I
filter each view see friend of mine is
sent me a request now again I'm not
leaving the hub I can confirm and accept
that right there and you're not opening
facebook right now exactly integrated
into the hub so there's no in and out
there's no thing point of you know which
which application do I have to use no
you're just naturally flowing and
responding to what's coming into you
exactly same for LinkedIn you know even
with Twitter one of the things that I
love to do is actually tweet straight
from within the hub and again you can do
that right here so imagine it's not just
about managing messages coming in it's
all of your activity engagement in one
single place but it goes beyond that so
you know you and I have a lot of
messages and I tell you what I'll hold
that down you can see how gestures come
in to manage I'll delete the bill
because I don't really care
now you'll notice that as I have more
and more content coming I can action
more more things as a vacation email
that I do need to at some point to worry
what a vacation I'll let them to prove
that celibate I'll tell you about it
later yeah so I'll flag that for later
on and again you can see how easy it is
to manage but like I said it's not just
about messages it's not just about
things that have just come in or things
in the past it's about things that are
about to happen right your next meeting
your next event well with a single
gesture I'm able to pull down and look
at exactly what's coming next and again
without having the calendar open it's
part of the hub it's integrated into the
exactly so you have the past and you
have the future at once web of your
thumb fantastic great love it love it
now you and I obviously have a lot of
meetings and the most important thing
sunny for me and I know it is for you is
the people you're meeting right who why
when did you last meet them well let me
show you a meeting on blackberry 10 you
can see the details coming in but the
most important thing is people we
automatically start pulling down photos
from social networking sites like
LinkedIn so you know who you're meeting
you're not stumbling around in a coffee
shop trying to find out who you're about
to me you know if I select an individual
like Greg you can see the content starts
populating this is all real time you'll
notice that we've actually recognized
all the connections and networks that
you have with Greg we've also pulled in
experience education from LinkedIn
everything's kept up to date and we know
that Greg like me uses a blackberry so
you can invite him to BBM straightaway
it's that easy but it goes beyond this
you also want to know about Greg's
environment so what we're doing right
now is pulling information about company
information social updates posts on
Twitter Facebook doesn't that look just
beautiful and that's it it's as simple
as that cataloging all that information
and real-time updates and then lastly
activity think of the last time you met
Greg the last email you exchanged the
the last phone call the
just facebook tweet all of this
historical timeline comes together and
you know the beauty of this and I
mentioned this earlier i love the
blackberry hub well we didn't leave the
harbor in time doing all of this out of
the hug I mean think think about doing
what Vivek just showed us on on a
different system right you had would
have to go to LinkedIn and search
facebook and search would have to open
several browser pages of the company of
the individual and here we just have
this as one finger tip adapted to you
and it gives you immediate information
that is relevant to you that you need at
that very moment real time that is the
benefit of the hub right don't touch
anymore the device adapts to you and
your meetings and what you need to know
and it delivers the content that is
really really meaningful that's a very
strong concept yeah so we talked about
the keyboard I showed the physical and
you know we talked about the keyboard on
the full touch device and we have the
aspiration to be the best keyboard
experience period so how do we do this
on the full touched upon touch well let
me compose a new email one of the things
you'll notice is the design the look and
feel is blackberry through and through
those famous frets white fun on black
keys everything just feels like a
blackberry typing experience you know
what we really focused on and you know
this is very important for me as I've
certainly like you've been traveling
quite a lot recently you're rushing
through an airport maybe you've got a
coffee a bag whatever it may be and you
just want to get a fast accurate
sentence out well we built the ability
to flick words right to the screen so
you can see how easy it is to just flick
word after word fingering
I call this I call this riding without
typing that is the magic of the keyboard
fantastic grade a quick one thumb typing
on a glass screen with one thumb magic
and you know in fitting with black we
flow we wanted gestures to consume the
entire keyboard so deleting words I'm
just swiping to the left anywhere on the
keyboard you want numbers and symbols
how frustrating it is sometimes to add a
date add a number or a question mark and
exclamation well swipe down anywhere on
the keyboard it's that easy but we
wanted to go more than just building
gestures and one thumb typing we on it
we wanted to understand exactly what
you're saying and that doesn't matter if
it's in English German or any other
language that you may speak so with
multi-language support I simply start
typing and I'm gonna give my best shot
at French here and you can see for those
you that understand French i still
haven't learnt it and i can then move to
german and you can see how easy that is
Wow
there's will trust and confidence we
want you to have that same typing
experience you had on a physical
blackberry keyboard device on touch
simplicity elegance confidence exerts
what this keyboard is all about it's a
fantastic experience and no toggling
between languages it's just a feeling
you can even do this within sentences
yeah absolutely absolutely and you know
sometimes I'm in a real rush and I start
typing fast and I make mistakes I miss
spaces well we drop them all in and
correct that too it's that easy and
that's the black Becky bored so i think
we are holding to the promise that we
have the best typing experience on a
physical keyboard as much as on a touch
keyboard what do you want to look at
next we have talked about enterprises a
lot there's a lot of discussion about
bringing on device twerk there's
concerns about security from CIOs but
there's also concerns you know about
privacy from the individuals that own
those devices that they bring to work
and want to get connected we see people
you know running around with two devices
you know one is the corporate 11 is
their personal one and I think that's a
problem that we aspire to solve absolute
for those constituents and in their
process and we call that balance so why
don't you show us how this works be like
sure so like I said earlier i've been
using obviously the black we said 10 for
quite a while and I've been managing it
him work and well I've had very little
personal time but when I have her take
welcome to the club thank you so when I
have had one of the things that I've
loved about balance is it's it's not
overwhelming it's easy to use a single
gesture on the screen once your
activated to bears 10 allows you to move
between personal and work it's that easy
but you're not looking for settings menu
buried under looking for lots of
controls it's very easy to just move
between both of these spaces you'll
notice as I went into work everything's
changed applications the wallpaper even
blackberry world is now a work and
private enterprise
these are all the applications that my
Enterprise wants me to use but the best
thing about balance is everything we
believe about blackberry flow you're not
in and out of personal and work right
your work and personal lives are very
blended today well we deliver the same
thing on blackberry 10 you'll notice as
I move back to personal I open up
blackberry world which is just full of
such rich content now I minimize that
both applications coexist work and
personal it's secure it's encrypted it's
managed but you get a single unified
user experience that is I think a great
solution to the user yes it is a great
solution for the CIO because he controls
the corporate part of the device and
it's a great solution for the private
user because he owns his privacy
absolutely all on one device so I hope
that we will see people merging from two
devices into one which then will be a
blackberry 10 absolutely and again you
can see another example here
and just another example of the file
manager here on both sides you can see
the briefcase symbol denoting it's a
work application only accessible to an
area of the device but my personal side
while I've got my cloud my SD card and
so much more security privacy in a
single user experience and that's black
rebalance good so that I think is a
great innovation in blackberry and it's
pretty unique what we do but I know
there's another feature on Viper you
can't live without and it's a successful
service that we have with 60 million
subscribers globally loving it using it
and that is blackberry messenger but I
think there's some exciting news to
share around BBM as well there is so you
know i've been using bbm since i first
joined blackberry and i've always
enjoyed the real-time nature of it right
I know when something's been delivered
when something's been read and the
delight of knowing that someone's
writing back to me I've used it for work
with family friends but on blackberry 10
we wanted to take it so much further we
wanted to push the boundaries and we
wanted to build mobile computing inside
this messaging service so now you'll
notice that every time you go into BBM
there'll be a prompt and a call icon at
the very top right well I've been
talking to a buddy of mine Andrew who as
you can see is kind of wishing me luck
with the launch and hopefully the demos
going well so far now we've been talking
most this morning on BBM but with
blackberry 10 were able to take it that
much further how about we make it the
very first public BBM video call oh that
is excited
so Andrews in the UK right now at our
London launch event so we're gonna give
them a call and out there he is well
there is hey Andrew this is Vivica
toaster hey guys oh isn't any in London
so we've gone from a chat straight into
a video call effortlessly this is blank
we flow we're not moving in and out of
applications but what's really important
for us like I said is to push the
boundaries BBM has been about
collaborating sharing experiences so
again for the very first time we're
going to introduce what we call BBM
screen share this is a brand new feature
that allows you not only to share your
camera like most other video chat
applications can but also share your
entire screen so Andrew how about you
share your screen with us in New York
and the rest of the world so you'll
notice what happens now is andrew is in
control he's driving the experience this
is his screen guys coming from London
well so my black was dead time
as he navigates the UI you can see
application after application come
together and it looks like you've got
some great apps there already again the
call continues imagine the possibilities
pictures websites books in the
enterprise documents documents with our
dogs to go and spreadsheets PowerPoint
everything real time it's that easy now
Andrew I know you've been in the UK my
hometown and you told me you taken some
interesting pictures so how about we see
a few of them now they go Andrews just
opening up the pitchers app and as he
does it we can see picture after picture
isn't that the beautiful and illegal wow
that is a great photo too oh yeah we
want it bad so I tell you what Andrew
I'd love to keep talking to but we do
have to get on with the rest of show so
do BBM that photo across to us and best
of luck in London thanks and that was
BBM video chat with screen share Wow
this is good it is really really good
think about this is you know a great
consumer tool your summer vacation right
you just want to show something but it's
also a great collaboration tool for
small enterprises right have no big
infrastructure they can really easily
share information while being real time
engaged in a voice call or in the
vehicle fantastic so Android mentioned
you mentioned vacation and so did I yes
at some point you're gonna take one now
one of the things that happens with us
my lunch today is we're managing content
all over the place emails we've got
appointments we are on the browser we
take photos and we found there's no real
way to bring this all together to manage
and organize all of this so we're going
to introduce a brand new application
called black we remember and really this
is about bringing content together so
let me show you it on my blackberry q10
now one of the things I love obviously
about this product is the always on
keyboard it's ready to go but you
noticed I flagged that email earlier on
well the minute I flagged that vacation
email it's gone into remember if I'm in
the browser and i'm looking at holiday
destinations i can actually share this
to remember i can now move this to a
vacation folder i can add a due date
which I'm not gonna do right now come on
I don't want you knowing exactly when
i'm leaving but i can add attachments
photos videos even a voice note remember
to pack shorts I know it's that why I'm
not telling me so now I've saved this
again with the always-on keyboard one of
the great things i love is i can just
type and do a search for the app look
how fast and how quick that is to bring
up the application now you'll notice
that i've got a number of folders in
here already well there's the vacation
folder there's an unfired entries folder
we go into that there is the email i
flagged earlier on I can move that now
straight to the vacation folder save it
as I come back out everything's there my
browser bookmarks
documents emails I'm able to organize
things even better but what's really
interesting about remember is it's not
just the things you actually pull
together it's a single source and
destination for every type of content
outlook notes and tasks are integrated
straightaway and for you Evernote users
out there that's also integrated you can
see my Evernote notebook right now and
that's black we remember everything
about one project in one place against
simplicity comfort immediacy real-time
access to all the information that you
need that is the theme in blackberry 10
it's just another great example of how
consequently we've put this throughout
the entire user experience great we've
seen those pictures from Andrew from
London I hope you guys have a good time
in London the other cities too but why
don't we talk a bit about me camera yeah
sure what's new on blackberry 10 so in
that area you know we we've talked about
the camera and we've seen some magic
moments I'm actually gonna take the time
right now to do a bit of a camera demo
I'm gonna use my white z10 doesn't this
look beautiful all the way hold it up
there you go look at that now this is
gonna be an interesting potential career
move for me I'm gonna ask you to pose
tossed and if you don't mind but one of
the things we've done with the camera is
make this really easy to use so tap
anywhere to take your photo it's as
simple as that you want to refocus well
just move focus around it's that easy
but what really stands out is creating
that perfect shot so we have blackberry
time shift and what this allows us to do
is capture that moment so I can move the
entire photo tonight allston i can go
into your face I'll be as uh ohs as I
can here and i'll stop for now there's a
good wink there you go how's that and
it's that easy and that's the camera is
that time
ever try to take a picture of four kids
open eyes smiling at the same time yes
quite a challenge yeah great great media
experience but it doesn't stop there
right no it doesn't once you have a
picture what you're going to do with it
so you can make it even better and one
of the things i want to show you now if
i go to my pictures application again
you can see some great pictures here
naturally the one that Andrew showed us
earlier you'll notice now I can hit edit
the minute I do that we launched in a
built-in editor again this is mobile in
mind floor this is Flo look at the
gestures to add effects very easy to do
simple swipes I can go to styles I can
actually add a film strip effect I could
be big eyes I won't do that but you can
see how easy it is to use I can do free
transform crop exactly to what I need
and it's as easy as that and that's the
picture editor on blackberry 10
and just just watching the Vic doing
this he never actually touched the
application grid that we know from other
systems it was all within the
applications all within all within this
one application to know the natural flow
of getting things done comfortably so
you want to go on vacation at some point
like i like i said i'm not talking about
telling when i'm going i'm sure you're
taking a lot of pictures there ya know
what did you do so get an even more
exciting media experience on a
blackberry 10 more for work or phobic
yeah exactly so you know what blackberry
users are like we love not only to live
stories but create them as well so we
built an experience which you know I
personally have used and I've enjoyed so
much it's called story maker so
naturally this is a global launch and
the sites all over the world I've been
asking them over the last day or so to
send content across photos videos and
now I'd like to pull it all together and
tell a beautiful story well with story
maker you can do that again remember the
editor this is easy to use you're not
going to sit here for two hours to
create really beautiful content I can go
in I can choose my media so I'll select
a number of pictures and videos here I
can add some music so we'll take a song
from alicia keys I can put titles and
credits so I can really personalize this
entire experience and when I hit done we
automatically bring the content together
add transitions animations and effects
and you can change them on the fly it's
so easy to use and it looks so beautiful
you can actually then save this and
share it with all your family and
friends so how about we take a moment to
look at some of the blackberry 10 story
No
and that's black with story maker
wonderful
so lots of examples around back reflow
knowing enough paradigm just one swipe
and you can do you know whatever you
want to do vivek thanks a bunch for
doing this with me thank you joseph in
my pleasure thank you thank you everyone
really really exciting to explore the
capabilities of that system i mean
there's so much in it that is that is so
exciting and innovative its new hardware
it's a new operating system lots of new
ideas as you just seem it's a new way of
sharing and connecting this is the new
blackberry
and it's not just a new blackberry what
we also did is we established a new way
of working with our partners we have
worked with partners to offer the best
services like maps camera video and
keyboard as you just have seen we've
also been working more strategically and
more openly than ever before with
leading application partners because the
platform of bb10 allows us to do that as
it is an open platform in fact we will
launch with an amazing collection of
music TV shows and movies with all eight
major studios signing on to provide
their video content in all major music
labels available in blackberry world lot
of things to choose from and I'd like to
invite our vice president for business
development and global alliances to talk
to you a bit about how did we
strategically target the top
applications because I know that matters
too many of us and you across the world

global alliances to talk to you a bit
about how did we stategic Lee target the
top applications because I know that
matters too many of us and you across

welcome Marty Mallick
alright thank you before I talk about
the content and applications on
blackberry 10 first I want to take a
moment just to thank our partners for
their excitement their passion and their
support their belief in blackberry 10 is
absolutely amazing and it's helped us
make this launch a huge success right
out of the gate I applaud them for their
commitment thank you many people didn't
believe we could create a blackberry
that delivers an incredible application
and content experience but we did it's
blackberry 10 this was a total company
wide effort the flawless execution by
the engineers and the content teams to
deliver a deeply integrated solution for
content and applications is remarkable
today I can say with absolute confidence
that the deliberate decision to build
the platform with developers and
applications at the heart of it has paid
off we are launching blackberry 10 with
more apps by far than any
first-generation operating system the
support of the developer community is
outstanding we already have over seventy
thousand applications
over 70,000 applications available on
blackberry 10 today and with the
momentum that we've built we will
continue to see thousands of apps added
each and every week now while we know
that having your great selection of apps
is critical we also know that everybody
has their favorite apps the apps they
use all the time and when they get their
blackberry 10 devices they're going to
be looking for those apps I'm not going

partners committed to blackberry 10 and

platform it's only launched today so how
do we accomplish this we started by
identifying our top targets you know the
apps that are on other platforms the
apps people talk about the apps that
people use the most we do this for both
the global and local brands because we
realize the importance of delivering a
locally relevant content experience it's
important that no matter where you are
during dubai johannesburg New Delhi
Paris Toronto Jakarta London or here in
New York City it's important that you
get the content that you want we built a
global team and for over a year our
focus has been to partner with these
application providers we went to them to
establish true partnerships to show them
the great opportunity that blackberry 10
represents and now we're delivering on
that promise our partner success is our
success but as torsen said earlier a
full content experience it's not just
about apps and games blackberry world is
now the one-stop shop for all blackberry
10 applications games videos and music
within the US we have all eight of the
major movie studios and leading
television networks delivering their
content on blackberry 10

huge catalogue of songs all the major
record labels and the independence
nobody will feel they're lacking in
applications in content on blackberry 10
and the great thing is that getting this
content is the easiest its ever being we
focus on the end-to-end experience we
made it easy to discover to purchase to
download applications and content you
can install multiple applications
simultaneously and there's no need to
reboot your device it's a new blackberry
with amazing content on a brand new
platform there's more apps there's more
top apps and there is definitely more to

speculation leading up to this day much
of it around daiquiri 10 but I hope you

our success will come from listening to
our customers to do so we're directly

conversations with successful creative
entrepreneurs and artists to inspire the
future of blackberry they're also

sector of the workplace our goal is to
better their lives and simplify their
lives too so to accomplish these goals

step by creating a new position at

excited to have you as part of our
blackberry family oh my goodness I am so
excited as well thank you for reaching
out for me thank you for giving me an
early look at this beautiful phone I
love the new browser it's super fast I
love the hub the design the flow you
know I'm definitely a fan of that I'm
obsessed with the time shift I love the
camera is great and the way that you can
capture the picture in that way and I
definitely love how you can switch from
work to play mood through balance I love
that I think it's a good reminder for
all of us to put work aside when we need
to yes we're trying to do to make life
easier for people that's why we
developed a fantastic yeah reishi yes um
you were a long time blackberry user and
then we lost you for a while what
happened let's see that that is true let
me see how I best describe this is kind
of like you know I was in a long-term
relationship with blackberry and then I
started to notice some new kind of
hotter attractive sexier phones at the
gym and um I kind of broke up with you
for something I had a little more bling
but I always missed the way you organize
my life and the way that you were there
for me at my job and so I started to
have two phones I was kind of playing
the field um but then you called and you
told me that you were working out you
added a lot more features a new platform
you got a lot faster all of that was
true and now we're exclusively dating
again and I'm very happy oh so are we
and I give you a promise you're gonna
fight really hard to keep you as our
global creative director but tell us a
little bit about what gets you excited
about this opportunity to work with us
again oh there's so much synchronicity
and I'm fascinated by technology I've
always wanted to work with the weight
work directly with the technology
company but I do have a pretty demanding
job that takes a lot of my time so it
would have to make sense you know and so
I wanted to do something where I could
grow professionally and personally and
really have an impact on shaping a
technology platform the music business
has changed dramatically and because of
that there are so many opportunities in
the creative space particularly with the
blackberry so I read an interview with
you actually that I really loved where
you were talking about the power of
mobile computing and you were saying
that were just at the beginning of a
mobile revolution and how the laptop in
so many ways is becoming extinct so that
was an exact parallel to me with the
changes in the music business so we have
a lot in common and we have tremendous
opportunity to explore together yes and
we're absolutely looking forward to do
this together I'm sure it's exciting for
us to also understand the synonyms
between music and our technology
platform it you really want to evolve it
into that space and I know we together
we can absolutely make that happen so
yes absolutely excited about that
opportunity now yeah you're signed up
for a job yes so tell us what are you
going to do for us I'm extremely
committed i'm a very committed focused
individual so i'm gonna work closely
with the app designers and developers
the content creators the retailer's the
carriers to really explore this
blackberry 10 platform and create ideas
for future i'm definitely going to start
with other super women who also love
blackberry a big demographic for
blackberry i'm also gonna work with
people in the entertainment and music
business to inspire creative projects
and most importantly i really love i
want to further enhance this concept of
having your work life and your personal
life altogether and
device I really want to bridge the gap
between the work phone and the play
phone so it's a big job and it's a super
hands-on role but I am extremely excited
and ready to jump in and work closely
with you and your incredible team yep
and we will make sure you get the
perfect platform to do this with
blackberry 10 thank you um you started

bit about the keep moving projects that
