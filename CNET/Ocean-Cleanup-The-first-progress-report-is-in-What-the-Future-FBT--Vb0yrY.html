show okay guys sorry to interrupt we
actually have some breaking news we have
the first results in from the ocean
cleanup system that's that massive
u-shaped device nicknamed Wilson that's
trying to clean up the Great Pacific
Garbage Patch so the results are in
things aren't going swimmingly the ocean
cleanup group says that for some reason
the trash is exiting the system as it's
being collected now they're not exactly
sure why that is but the leading theory
is that Wilson is moving too slow you
see the ocean cleanup system actually
has to be moving faster than the trash
it's collecting for the trash to stay
inside now this could be due to winds
but engineers say they're positive
they're close to making Wilson work they
think that by opening the u-shape about
60 meters wider that should solve the
speed issue now they plan on starting
those adjustments as soon as
Thanksgiving Day so good luck to ocean
cleanup we'll be following your progress
now back to your regularly scheduled
program on today's show the literal
break through 15 feet below the surface
of Los Angeles Shade for those haters
who say that watching TV is just a
mindless activity and what may be the
creepiest robot we've had on this show
to date I knew I should have made a left
turn at Albuquerque
that tunnel Elon Musk has been digging
under Los Angeles is finally finished he
posted this video on Twitter over the
weekend this is the moment his Bourn
company broke through the wall at the
site of its first station born machines
have been tunneling for the past two
years they started two miles away near
SpaceX headquarters that first station
by the way has been named O'Leary
station for a boring company employee
who died recently
now musk wants to use this as a proof of
concept for his Hyperloop transportation
project the idea is to transport people
and vehicles on skates underground at up
to 155 miles per hour
earlier this month he said the tunnel
will be open to the public
December 10th
all right this one goes out to my dad
who said all those hours watching TV was
a mindless waste of time
waste of time maybe mindless not anymore
thanks to Samsung who's working on
software to control TV with your
brainwaves they've partnered with
experts in neural prosthetics on a
project called Project pontus using
machine learning it reads a combination
of brain waves and eye movements so the
user can tell the TV what they're trying
to watch now this is being designed for
people with disabilities who often can't
use standard remotes you're looking at
the second prototype here
Samsung says it's also working on a
system that relies only on brain signals
for people who can't control their eyes
it hopes to start formally testing the
technology next year ok seems like I've
told you about a lot of creepy robot
projects on the show but this one may
win the WTF award say hello to a FET oh
the Robo baby head that's gonna be in my
nightmares tonight believe it or not
he's actually not trying to scare us
those facial expressions are actually
seven years in the making his creators
say that to date androids haven't been
able to mimic human expressions so to
change that they study the
three-dimensional movement on a hundred
and sixteen facial points now from those
measurements they say they were able to
develop more realistic movements compare
that to when we first saw Fido in 2011
the difference is very striking
so back in 2016 developers showed us
this video demonstrating upper body
movement a feta was first built to
represent a one to two year old boy so
my hope is that we see him walking this
time next year okay that brings me to
our question of the week a lot of you
have asked if I'm a robot I think the
best way to answer that is with another
question if you were building a robot
would you make him a pale white guy who
gets easily sunburned with a gluten
intolerance all right one more note
don't forget this Monday
NASA's insight Lander is scheduled to
touch down on Mars if all goes as
planned this will be the first Mars
landing in more than six years insight
we'll be studying the Red Planet's
interior
it's equipped with a heat probe to
burrow under the surface and
super-sensitive seismometers you can
watch insights landing live at cnet.com
coverage begins Monday at 11 a.m.
Pacific
all right what makes you say what the
future let us know in the comments
that's gonna do it for this show
I'm Mandy Altman thanks for watching
what the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
