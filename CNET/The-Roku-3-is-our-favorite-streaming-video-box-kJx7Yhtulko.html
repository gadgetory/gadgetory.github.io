we're gonna take a look at the Roku 3
this is my favorite gift pick for the
home theater category and it's selling
for $99 the Roku 3 is a streaming video
box which lets you watch services like
Netflix and HBO go on your TV the look
of the box is improved over past Roku
models than even glossy er finish and
new rounded edges you also notice it's a
little bit heavier than the old boxes
and Roku added that weight on purpose to
help the Roku 3 from getting pulled by
heavy HDMI cables around the back you'll
see the HDMI output and Ethernet jack a
micro SD card slot and a power port plus
there's also a USB port on the side
there's also built-in Wi-Fi and the Roku
3 supports dual band Wi-Fi for an even
better streaming experience the included
remote has a seriously cool feature
there's a headphone jack on the side so
you can listen to whatever you're
streaming without disturbing anyone else
in the room plugging in headphones
automatically mutes the volume on your
TV and Roku even includes some earbuds
in the box the remote also works via
Wi-Fi direct instead of standard IR
remote commands so there's no need to
point it at the box
Roku also has a great new interface that
came out this year and it's blazing fast
on the Roku 3 thanks to a new processor
that claims to be five times as fast as
old Roku boxes
the new layout lets you see a lot more
channels at once making it easier to
find what you're looking for there's
also an awesome cross-platform search
feature so you can enter a movie or a TV
show you'd like to watch and it shows
you what services that's available on
and as always Roku has a best-in-class
selection of streaming services
including Netflix Amazon Instant HBO Go
Hulu Plus Pandora MLB TV Amazon Cloud
Player Spotify and Rdio there is one big
exception to that list YouTube is still
not supported on roku devices although
there are some workarounds that work
pretty well so altogether it's really
not hard to see why the Roku 3 is our
favorite streaming box it has tons of
content a great blazing fast interface
and the remote with the headphone jack
is one of the coolest
there is at just $99 it's one of the
best tech gifts you can give I'm Matthew
Muscovy AK and that was a quick look at
the Roku three</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
