CES floor taking a first look at the
esti series plasma from Panasonic which
is the successor to our favorite TV last
year now this TV comes in models from 50
to 65 inches and as far as improvements
in picture we're actually hearing from
Panasonic that you shouldn't expect too
much but what you should expect is the
same value proposition that you got last
year excellent picture quality for a
great price this year you're also
getting all of Panasonic's Viera connect
apps along with a web browser you won't
get their fancy remote that comes with
the VT and the ZTE series but you can
purchase that separately along with a
Skype camera that can be attached on top
it has Panasonic's
infinite black pro technology along with
a 2500 focused field driver two specs
that are not nearly as good as a specs
on the V T and the ZT series it's got
two USB ports and three HDMI ports along
with 3d and it comes with two active 3d
glasses so maybe this TV isn't as great
as the rest of Panasonic's plasmas but
what you're looking for here is
excellent value we don't have any
pricing but Panasonic promises that it
should come out around April or May for
