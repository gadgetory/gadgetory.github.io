light and seeing your car right next to
you then don't buy a three series or a
c-class or an a4 if you want to stay
here opinion and stay distinctive you
might want to look at this guy
there's although s60 t5 let's try this
2013 all-wheel-drive version
let's check the tech and the first thing
you may notice about an s60 especially
compared to its competitors is it looks
a lot less stodgy really strong coupe
eNOS - it's fastback roofline even
though it's obviously a sedan like all
the guys it competes against these may
be the most comfortable seats I've sat
in all year not just in a car anywhere
these are really great seats because
Volvo isn't afraid to put some actual
forgiveness in their cushioning most
cars today have these seats that are
lifted from Quaker pews in old churches
and once you get settled in here you're
looking at what is sort of a modern
rendering of a mid-century Danish ethic
albeit in plastic same goes for the
interface they have a unique and very
nicely rendered language now our car is
a little decon tented they didn't send
us one with the full Kahuna now this
screen even without navigation has your
radio choices am/fm HD radio as well and
satellite radio under media you're going
to find your single CD up here USB and
iPod here in the console
that iPod readouts pretty good it does a
nice job of letting you quickly get to
the different ways of sorting your music
and again nice display of text bluetooth
streaming good metatags show up as you
can see right there and of course you've
got an aux jack in here as well no
nonsense like hard drive or SD cards we
need that stuff just the hits a couple
of gripes though about the interfaces in
this car when you turn the volume why do
I need to see a volume graphic over my
screen that's just stupid I didn't find
a setting to turn that thing off like I
have in some cars I hate it and these
two LCD displays inside the tach of the
speedo really bring down this cabin they
did a beautiful job of rendering
everything in here and then they go to
this 8-bit monochrome thing which is
just ugly you can upgrade the audio in
these cars to a 12 speaker 650 watt
Dolby Pro Logic system which is going to
give you all the usual kind of theater
sound and I believe DVD playback is what
when you're parked check out this
shifter on the one choice only six-speed
Automatic it's kind of one of those
weird things it's clear with an LED you
can see inside I don't know where that
gets you and it doesn't match the look
or design language of the rest of the
car you've got a gate over here on the
left for shifting as well as that being
sport mode if you kick it over there no
paddles on the wheel though and Volvo
continues to have this weird little
peekaboo deal down here behind the
console if I put something near you know
what happened I'd swear I lost it and
I'd go buy another one and then I'd find
this one and I'd hate me and Volvo both
and this kind of annoys me the wheel
does telescope but it only goes from too
close to too damn close I can never get
it far enough away from me if the green
light is steady that means the car is
locked if you get a steady yellow it
didn't lock it a steady red that means
the alarm has been triggered since you
were last there look for your missing
iPhone both red lights flashing at once
that means the alarm was triggered less
than five minutes ago look out for the
boogeyman in the back seat now our car
is a t5 that means it has five cylinders
another oddball trait of this Volvo
compared to its competitors you can get
a t6 version of an s60 that has six
cylinders and the T tells you both are
turbocharged now on the t5 the smaller
engine model you can option all-wheel
drive if you get the big engine the t6
you're going to have all-wheel drive
whether you like it or not this
particular one is going to give you 250
horse and 266 foot-pounds of torque good
numbers to move a thirty five hundred
and fifty pound car to 60 in about six
point six again good numbers mpg again
good numbers 2029 there's nothing
remarkable under this hood so when we
drive it it's gonna be interesting to
see if it turns out to be more than the
numbers tell us
now on the road is where the s60 kind of
falls down for me nice car to ride in
Nice compliant ride as I mentioned
really comfortable seat but the power
comes on kind of Sergi from the turbo
it's kind of old school that way and I
didn't like any of the transmission
modes Drive is always into taller here
sports too twitchy always banging your
head back and forth with every throttle
input and manual mode well forgive that
I bought a car with an automatic I don't
want to shift it all the time just to
get responsive driving so I didn't enjoy
driving this car as much as riding okay
let's price on this s60 a t5 the smaller
engine car is about thirty to eight
delivered at two thousand four all-wheel
drive
there are several packages that roll in
more tech the one you want to go to and
not screw around is gonna be the
Platinum package that's going to get you
keyless the glass moonroof park sensors
navigation voice command you're also
going to get a rear camera that's pretty
much all in there the other major
package to consider on top of that is
the technology package that rolls in all
the nanny technologies adaptive cruise
control lane departure warning forward
collision alert with full braking road
sign recognition and those active high
beam headlights the goofy options to
skip will be 795 for a portable nav
system you can do that on your own for
about a fifth that much and $1,800 for
the rear seat entertainment only if
you're in love with DVDs ten things that
are retro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
