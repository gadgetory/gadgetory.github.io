seen at UK podcast this episode
forwarded 19 for Friday the 30th of
January 2015
reach for the sky sky is getting into
the mobile game plus Sony decides music
streaming is someone else's problem now
and there's more to drones than missile
strikes and crashing the White House
they could save the rainforests and even
save your life I'm rich own home joining
me on high-tech on the studio this week
is Luke Westaway
hello hello thanks for glossing over the
fact that I said rain for welcome I
wasn't even listening and also Andy
white hello he wasn't gonna cross though
that's one no I was gonna I was gonna I
was gonna have a go and ask you to do it
again just a waste time importantly
today Friday no no I'm pretty sure
there's nothing important you can expect
that I won't be mentioning that several
times rather podcaster okay we're
filming this podcast as always so to see
what Andy looks like on the day of his
44th birthday today is not my birthday
but when the podcast goes out tomorrow
on Friday yeah but that's when people
listen to this and can be I are half of
their things but they'll be listening to
it and they'll know that what they're
hearing are the words of a lying man now
today when people listening to it and
they're hearing today you are today in
the future anyway to see the video
youtube.com/scishow 60 I know right
let's kick off with the news
starting off with some very good news
for Apple yeah super good news for Apple
in fact and it's basically had an
incredibly good first sorry fourth
quarter from last year it's given out
two figures it has made 18 billion
dollars that is not only record-breaking
for Apple that is the most that any
company has ever earned in a quarter
holy crap so what's the previous holder
of that previous was Exxon Mobil which
is fifteen point nine billion so I play
cleanly a long way that new yeah Wow so
is there anything interesting that we
need to know about these these results
yeah a few things I mean mostly it's
really all about the iPhone in fact 69%
of its sales came from the iPhone that's
a lot so any any new stuff coming up
this year we can watch yes that is due
to go on sale in April keep your eyes
peeled that is for the US so if you're
watching this in the US howdy
unfortunately we don't yet know where
it's coming out in the UK or really
expression that isn't it keep your eyes
peeled okay yes I do have a thoughts
actually rich um I think it's
interesting to compare Apple today with
how Apple was two years ago or at least
the perceptions of the company yeah
because if you look back just a little
way so it's not in the in the year
following Steve Jobs death we have like
the Apple Maps debacle yes was all 2012
and Samsung was just sort of like
powering straight in there that's right
very very quickly became the world's
biggest smartphone maker and I think a
lot of people very reasonably were
saying so I think this is probably at
the Apple may of Pete but turns out we
were wrong in 20 2014 festive periods
made even more money than you thought
was possible any company and more money
than any company's ever made it's made
all the money and it's all all the
iPhone I'm mentioning something as well
the fact that air sampling a kind of
that came took over the mobile phone
market became the biggest mobile phone
in the world to go from Nokia on the
sets or beating Apple in terms of market
share but now Samsung is in real trouble
they've had their fifth consecutive
quarter of losses this announces the
same times Apple and more important in
terms of global market where smartphone
market share yes they're both
neck-and-neck this is very exciting
because Samsung's on 30% and they've
dropped 20% and apples on 18 - and
they've come up to 26 they're both on
20% so crikey all to play for all those
but worth bearing in mind that that
market share is interesting because
markets get bigger so you can have a
smaller market share than some more
phones but anyway so they're
neck-and-neck is the importantly that's
very interesting and like there there
are some sort of notes of caution in
this news have got more money then he's
got all the money got areas and that is
that it's all down to the iPhone so some
people have said well what about you
know what if the iPhone something
becomes unpopular yeah which is a you
know it's a possibility it happen hasn't
happened yet but it could happen
um commenters however have apples back
Ritchie mxx Ritchie mix rich mix eggs
yeah what's he doing hunting him for
what what's going on in the rich make it
that's how what he says when he enters a
room he's go Ritchie in the room this is
me anyway kudos to Apple they've been
able to market the heck out of an aging
concept and continue to milk it for all
it has glad to see the American Dream
still work absolutely I'm about to do it
Sam that's a bit of a backhanded
compliment isn't it like congratulations
making all the money in middle a full
system that keeps us all if that's not
the American dream then phrase meanwhile
X Y Zed one nine eight one five five
five resolved X Y Zed one nine eight one
five still a robot a stellar actually I
says Apple is going to keep innovating
year after year unlike Microsoft
o Burnout based in logic or facts this
is a little harsh as well on Microsoft
because obviously Microsoft does tend to
sort of get most of things wrong and
things like that a bit but Microsoft
this we do Windows 10 that's for the
last week which kind of interesting and
hololens which is Windows 10 it's
completely skipped over Windows 9 how's
that for innovating because we're no
less innovating I mean companies yeah
yeah they've forgotten
apparently there's a good reason for
that not being in Windows 9 so in
Germany they won't think it's Windows no
I'm sure those are real I'll wait for
Windows yes yeah it's apparently it's
because there's loads of sort of
software like older stuff that just
looks for Windows 9 in sort of lines of
codes and things looking for Windows 95
98 and things and so as soon as it sees
and it soon as it sees Windows 9
regardless of what comes after it it's
like wow okay I know what we're running
an old thing and freaks out it's like
selenium bug it shuts everything down a
crazy point yes it would be absolutely
classic Microsoft if they successfully
did the millennium bug 15 years late
really end of the world
late well it just read tanners like one
does with all my my music and things I'm
the subject of Microsoft innovating
there is they did we kind of missed this
that's week because the podcast record
on the day that it was announced but
there was Windows 10 and the hololens
like oh yes if you're only more about
hololens there is a very good video by
this man over here
the quest away oh come on you'll never
see yep exactly it up yeah it's five
things you need to know about hololens
explains everything
wait for that search for hololens on I
seen it why don't we move on to the
negative story talk a bit about Sony
right now because it's killed off Music
Unlimited
that was Sony's own music streaming
service basically it's a rival to
Spotify and oddly it has partnered with
Spotify to put Spotify on the
PlayStation its own service and partner
with the rival Music Unlimited never
really happened it's out of curiosity it
never really picked up its musical name
and today we're safe expendable in 19
countries and it's gonna be replaced by
a musical limited which is basically
just spotify with like a playstation
sticker on it and that's gonna be
available in 41 countries
it was quite significant that sony
couldn't make music streaming work it's
like being a record company yeah they
own it end to end they've got the
artists and they've got the distribution
platforms into the console yeah but they
just if they can make it work then here
could it just goes to show me that let
your third parties like your Spotify
isn't that kind of thing they're they're
the people who are kind of you know in
charge of music but so yeah so if you
are a subscriber of Music Unlimited then
that will continue until the end of
March about a month and you'll get this
last month for free and then you'll be
offered some free spotify monies to have
a go on that and nursed music unlimited
PlayStation music is gonna start in
spring so there you go reaction Jiji
Lane says I love Spotify but I only use
the free version on my desktop or
shuffle through my phone if they team up
with PlayStation and the free version
isn't available it may be enough to
cause me to make the jump to Spotify
Premium one customer waiting to see the
free version don't be nice go in
hardball yeah that is how to win when
you recommend a ruthless approach I
think the most interesting thing about
this probably is about the if you have a
ps4 you can have Spotify music playing
as you're playing your games which is
kind of cool
yeah what about if you've got good
soundtracks and the games already
yeah but what if you know what that kind
of BP poopy music they have on the video
games no it's just
yeah well I gotta move on yeah okay by
the the Timothy it's probably best yeah
okay you okay with that I think so this
week I'm gonna do that then BBC has a
new service it's called taster yeah and
as the name kind of suggests it's
basically a service lets you style
experience of BBC's new sort of
experiments and things that like Google
you to do with labs really I think yeah
and the idea with this is that you can
sort of use these services and then vote
for the ones that you think the best
that's right so I went along to BBC
Broadcasting House childhood exciting
thing was that not television Center not
a big round one because that's closed
now that's like flat that's where I was
the other day right yeah we're taking in
a stevia center is just is is just
around the corner from it still they are
still operational okay but Broadcasting
House has won this now and I wish I
would support cast now that's three old
one that was in their central owner but
yes so I went along to have look at this
and it's going well it is basically
website where you can kind of rate these
experiments that previously the BBC
would have done and try it out and then
you might never have ever seen them but
so it's always kind of interactive ways
of kind of interacting with their
content so it's tough like for example
if there's a video if there's an
interview filmed for then for news night
or the culture show or something like
that
folks ago they go to chat for ages but
then you'll only see sort of five
minutes of actually on on Newsnight of
the COTS day so what they do is they
kind of they've come in this way of
presenting it to you into bite-size way
so if you like to take you into you and
in this set the example they've got on
live at the moment is Lena Dunham being
interviewed by Jennifer Saunders you can
just go along and you can see them
chatting away there's our stuff like
interactive tour guides of Benjamin
Zephaniah who's a poet a few other
things the thing where you can kind of
create a timeline of BBC news stories of
your life which is kind of cool so it's
kind of interesting it's aimed mostly at
kids it's not a particularly serious
thing there was one take a thing that's
called riot where the eye is with a one
and it's this thing where you can go and
vote for things on really one really one
let's go and open things Romanoff's
reward yes exactly so what was great
about it was at the demonstration they
were like um what could happen for
example is radio one listeners and fans
could they could vote for who's going to
present the the raid the breakfast show
next week and I was like that's that's a
pretty big deal choosing DJs for the
breakfast show and then afterwards I
said are you gonna so you
gonna do that's pretty cool and they
said yeah no we're not doing that so
it's probably gonna be use for more
things like which artists you like so
that they might you know who they can
play next day so interactive mashup
things aimed at kids that they're you
cans could be worth firm because really
a one does a lot of like Live Lounge
Stephanie nights artists in so maybe you
can like vote for who owns more popular
get them in I mean just be Bieber week
after week oh that's think one of the
things I don't
well thing I did we like was the thing
where ft is in where you it's called
it's called who's in and it's basically
like it takes who's come in who's
physically coming to the BBC each day so
instead of like looking at each
individual radio station only seeing
what's on that radio station you get
sense of all different pop stars and
experts and presenters and personalities
and poets and writers and all and all
these kind of people who are going in
and out the BBC on any given day which I
thought was quite interesting because
that's what the BBC's for all that kind
of broad range of stuff yeah yes what we
I mean we pay for it exactly yeah as
much as you can out it exactly laugh I
nearly paid more license fee so yeah pay
your license paid right just thank you
very much because they know where you
live anyway anyway yes people wanting to
stalk their friends look at photos of
food or source casual sex were angry
this week because Facebook Instagram
week and tinder were all down now this
was talk about people saying that it
services have been hacked but no
apparently it was an hour long problem
caused by their own engineers probably
like the wrong Ethernet cable in
some cables tripped over the power cord
it's all back up now so I walked it too
far away from the wall and if I came out
pull down the back well there's the
think so this was that the longest
outage for about four years apparently
so that's quite a bit I think what this
kind of shows is the kind of danger of
the social graph the fact that Facebook
wants to be at the heart of of
everything and it wants you to use your
Facebook credentials to sign into
everything and and it wants to have
almost like a light extra layer on top
of the Internet where every site you go
to have some kind of Facebook presence
where there's comments or signing in or
whatever but that does mean that if you
know if all the kind of
not power exactly but if the sort of if
they're kind of influence and importance
is placed in one place and it goes down
because someone ships over a plug or
whatever it is or even just has a typo
in some code or something then
everything goes wrong it's because
Instagram and tinder that you log into
those services by Facebook exactly so
when Facebook went down it meant you
couldn't use their services because
those those aren't owned and operated by
Facebook there they Instagram is owned
by Facebook ok tinder tinder isn't
tinder is versatile but because you have
to use Facebook to use tinder swipe and
find people you want to do awfully
conversing with that with tinder for
someone who's in a committed long-term
relationship I've had enough people
sitting there showing me awesome is
likely so what is your birthday I
suppose if one day of the year and what
are our listeners 3 isn't listening
saying about this particular well in
this terrible disaster that befell us
all what an hour well actually you know
I kind of imagine when you say Facebook
went down for now at you know the last
matrix film where at the end neo and
Trinity just for a brief moment fly the
spaceship like over the clouds and it's
still like blue sky I can't remember
that but ok this guy in the real world
like above this sort of noxious I
picture I picture people running and
screaming and things being on fire oh
yeah so yeah we're so we heard him yes
pay barefoot pee barefoot TBF people not
sure that sanitary correctly but I'm
hoping that's his initials PE good bath
Li's foot yeah so what does it say says
this is why I do not use Facebook to log
into any other site for someone who pees
barefoot that was quite wise thing to
say it's not believe it's pepper okay
sure
one of those long troughs in a
Weatherspoon's overs lots of
and finally there's not more about
yearning it's it's it's some drone join
is yes there was a bit of panic when a a
quadrocopter crashed in the grounds of
the White House now that of course
didn't mean that the entire building
basically went into lockdown all over
again
no what actually happened now it was I
love this story it was so absurd a drone
kind of crashed into it they won't
switch what happened it wasn't a big
panic but they kind of a drone kind of
landed in the ground and they weren't
quite sure what gone on and then the
next day some guy got up and went yeah I
was a bit drunk last night and I was
messing around the drone I think it
might have gone over the fence into the
White House sorry about that time this
week it happens again we're keeping so
I'm so DT I who make the the Phantom to
explore the best known they've actually
done a software update in response to
this there where the White House sells a
certain area of Washington DC is now a
no-fly zone so whoa if you try and fly
if the software knows it's a no-fly zone
if you try and fly into the no-fly zone
what does it do I think it's like the
end of Robocop where is like prime
directive do not know and then it like
crashes it returns back to you this one
GPS it knows where you're standing so it
won't go in there surprise White House
not the government buildings aren't
already on that because it did
airports are now no-fly zones in
response to when somebody flew a DJI and
to Heathrow and got into flight path
planes and so a lot of sort of a careful
with your drone do you think yeah but
there's this water drone that I mean so
that with this week we also covered
drones for good which is this 1 million
dollar competition for people who have
got these students and you know the
academics and experts like I think
people who have come up with these ideas
using drones and unmanned aerial
vehicles to do cool things to help
people out so for example there's a
drone that a particular drone design
that what it does is it flies above it
flies above like former war zones and it
can
hex landmines from yeah and there's also
there's a couple of different versions
that work with Coast Guard's so that
they can they can not only fly out and
cover larger search areas fly ahead of
the rescue boats and cover search areas
they can also if needs be they can ditch
in the water and they've got handles and
flotation tanks so that if they if they
find a survivor it can take them off the
boat to arrive they condition the water
that piece and a bond for them they go
I think drop rings they could there's
nothing they could do yet so there's
that one of my favorites though is the
one that say it kind of flies over
deforested areas and it fires
nutrient-rich seed pods into the ground
we forest large areas which is really
cool what if those robots go crazy next
in the reef or invention as well for
this last one that wasn't a guy who
thought a little bit outside the box and
he didn't come up with a design for a
drone he came up with an idea for a way
of actually helping drones to deliver
things so you know Amazon are talking
about maybe delivering packages on
drones yeah but they can't just fly over
and start dropping packages out the sky
with you and you don't want Xu baijiu in
the only one seed pods just delivered by
catapult yeah it comes through the
ceiling is now in the kit is now in the
garden but if you know the garden would
you so he's coming this idea that of a
big net basically and viewers can see it
on the screen there it's basically a big
net it's gone it's an actual net it's an
actual net so the drone comes down and
let pops the thing in there it's on the
outside of your house or your flat I
don't mean to garden
it's got a net in there to protect it's
got a barcode there to make sure that
it's the right place and it is called
Skynet what can go wrong but there you
go so have a look at that drones for
good I think it's there that's kind of
cool all right well that's enough news
let's move on to this week's feature
so 2015 is the 30th anniversary of the
British mobile phone industry and it's
fitting then that this year is seeing
some of the biggest shake-up sweep ever
seen
first BT announced it would buy EE then
three analysis buying o - and now sky is
getting involved - announcing it will
create its own mobile network in 2016
Sky's network will be powered by
telefónica the current owners of o2 so
why all these changes happening it's all
to do with what they call in the
industry quad play a four prong strategy
where telecoms companies offer you a
package of broadband landline TV and the
mobile phone BT and Sky already rivals
in the world of broadband TV and
landlines will now complete the package
with their mobile networks just a few
years ago there were five major players
and now there's going to be three so
what's going to happen next Luke you
have some thoughts on this they knew yes
I do
at first I'd just like to pause to
silently appreciate the Majesty that is
quad play what play quad play what play
yeah sounds so boring and yet so like
professional yes it does have a certain
majesty
it sounds like it sounds like a
technique in squash wait you need to
work on your court play the comment says
that content is like and that's a
fantastic piece of quad play there's a
court play classic quad play he's always
been so good at quad play especially on
this turf so is anyone missing out in
this in all these industry maneuvers yes
so this is what's basically happening
now as all the companies are racing to
to get this quad play thing up and
running but some people aren't doing so
well at it notably Vodafone
yeah which poor old Vodafone only a few
months ago was just one of the major UK
mobile providers and now suddenly is
looking in a rather shaky position
because it doesn't offer all of those
things and it doesn't have the full four
quads or prongs of the coin plays it
only has three of the prongs that's
right and no one case it's not a triple
play cooled but yeah no one cares about
anymore no that's all about cooling yep
so basically the question is what's
going to happen to Vodafone so yes I
mean sky like the sky
mobile service is kind of interesting
but it's so far away it's not gonna
happen till next year and we don't only
think about prices yet or stuff like
that so the minute this is still just
kind of interesting sort of what's
happening to all the companies are also
forming these weird alliances the
landscape is shifting it's crazy
absolutely industry consolidation yes so
what about MBA um how do you feel about
is you happy sad I'm just going to say
so the Vodafone might team up with Sky
still my by Skype Italian well as some
people have said vote Franco too big if
I might buy sky disguise got so no one's
too big for Vodafone to buy Vodafone is
it's not just a British Network remember
it starts off to British Network but it
is also in our national thing it is a
big dealing by you and everyone you care
about I can tell the way around maybe
Sky buying no defence oh well how do you
how do you feel about so it seems a bit
confusing like do people really
understand confusing about quad play
Andy well exactly you know you see as a
term like two people play against really
gets or the benefit if there is a
benefit to be hard with that so maybe
we'll take a little while would you like
work about anything soon I wouldn't
because I I don't want this because I
don't want I don't have TV I have a TV
but I use streaming services and I don't
have a landline phone I don't know
anyone who has a landline phone
hopefully but only because my phone
mobile phone sitting on my flat is
rubbish sure so for me like quad play
just does not work as a concept so I'd
rather have a dedicated mobile phone
service which actually think Vodafone it
could be in a good position to as it to
be like a niche provider where it is
only doing one thing but it can
specialize in it and really know what to
do as just a phone provider like there
is a benefit there offering service and
it does have things like Spotify and Sky
Sports and that it's offering with its
own with this bundles already so it's it
still got a decent position it also will
be good to have have more competition as
well because we're going for five major
players two three that's that's kind of
a worry in terms of competition of
pricing and that kind of thing
well it's a long way off that right okay
so it's gonna take a little while yes
and all of this like these big
acquisitions which and by the way Andy
I'm with you I think what blaze sort of
yeah it's a bit confusing do you
definitely want all those four things
you know
you're getting a good deal when you're
paying for so many things at once yeah
but this is all still a little way off
because yeah the BTE deal is subject to
regulatory approval so is the thing
between Oh two and three zone er that's
between telefónica and Hutchison what
why manpower yeah yes so it's all it's
all subject to approval so you won't
definitely happen but the the European
Commission would be get the final say-so
on on the o2 and the EE deals but they
would they agree to a similar deal in
Germany last year which might make it
more likely that these are going to be
pushed through because that sets a
precedent okay of it basically being
okay yeah everyone in Germany be like
hang on it's - it could be that off come
might say well you know you've got to
sell off a few bits of your business and
then you won't be too big when you yeah
and like it's gonna be so complicated
because for example Oh - and Vodafone
have like a mast sharing and agreement
things like that like all of the
companies already have these weird sort
of informal yes they're very intertwined
ah yeah yeah it's all very very
complicated and very fun and that's
gonna be is gonna make it even more
confusing for shoppers because you're
gonna sort of go for you could be going
for like orange and not realizing that
you're sort of like actually tying
yourself to BT which is just so weird
because speaking of which what our first
and first reactions from readers
listeners viewers and other human beings
well James bed well on the Facebook's
hello James says Sky broadband is the
worst slow Brewster slow internet not
even free broadband for a year could
convince me to stay with them now on
building fibre with a much better router
and no regret that's pretty damning good
stuff James George buyer says you cancel
everything to do with Sky PW you release
you and tell the world about your new
service and they're like well let us
know how you feel about about the these
new maneuverings whether you'll be
sticking with your cut provider when
things all get thrown up in the air and
come down and land in completely
different shapes yes oh yeah keep us
posted and for now we're gonna move on
to the quiz yes it's time for the quiz
once again and the leaderboard currently
stands at Jason 6 and e6
Luke 6 this is neck and neck you can't
split her hair between them or something
anyway this week Luke sounds like this
and Andy sounds like this excellent so
one of us has a relevant topical buzzer
that's right because there isn't about
clowns
we are clowns we are going to be talking
about the mobile phone networks of the
past due to the you know changings
around the image it's a thing it's
mobile phones that networks past it
there so fingers on buzzers fastest
singer first question one
it wasn't best known as a telecoms
company but which company owned the
largest private telecoms network in
Britain and at 17,000 kilometers of
fiber optic and copper cable connecting
every major city in town and it linked
to Europe through the Channel Tunnel
Luke was it something like the post
office that's that's not the correct
answer this is I mean it was kind of
similar because that was privatized and
this that some people say when they
companies privatized it goes off the
rails so you know Andy Oh was it it was
the largest telecoms network in the
country yeah the yeah the post office
was the original name for British
Telecom it was the gpio general post
office it was all part the same thing
but then yeah it all splits up is very
complicated actually the history of
Britain I thought you were flipped me
the bird you were holding up but you
hold the upper fingers only get one
moment yeah did I get that you did get
that boy you got a hand you got that boy
right okay cruel food cuz there was a
big clue for me yeah well you needed all
the help you can get a big clue this
time
question to Vodafone made the first
mobile phone call thirty years ago this
year and also the first text message but
what did the first text
Luke happy birthday that's the right
answer yes this is a high-scoring round
because it's my birthday that wasn't
being a coming for you at all it is
already been playing into your hands
though it's not your birthday that
wasn't actually a clue that's just what
it said right question through question
three this all to play for this is
exciting
the suspense which of today's networks
began life as mercury one to one and II
t-mobile it was t-mobile that's the
correct that's so ever and I used to be
on one to one
Wow and actually one to one called your
own answer phone although actually does
on Vodafone now so that's weird anyway
guess so the and is a tie-break question
would have been doesn't matter but cyber
question would have been two nearest
five years when was Cable and Wireless
established the answer may surprise you
1997 the answer may surprise you
1066 it was is this what the battle was
about they left a phone ringing no it
was 1934 oh yeah yeah that's that
doesn't well everyone has to have why
they did yeah it was certainly was like
the first infrastructure company after
Telegraph's and stuff lovely new bonnet
there you go so now you use is on seven
that's very exciting come back next week
to see what's clapping and next up let's
have the feedback
so let's see what you guys have been
saying or should I say you guys have
time for one thing oh we've only got
time for one day
Andrew winter says I recently gave in to
pressure from society and bought a pair
of Beats headphones this was compromised
as I couldn't find anything that fit my
audio needs what I really wanted was a
pair of wireless as my past eight
headphones have broken at the jack in
ear earphones without the stupid sporty
bits connected together by a wire as I
would undoubtedly lose one with decent
sound quality yeah I am no audio file
well who is and around 50 pounds 200
pounds if such things exist I would love
to know so that I can self criticize my
decision so point out here first of all
that Andrews not looking really for
buying advice ceases the kindest thing
we could do was to say there aren't any
and then you made the right purchasing
you've made the right decision Andrew no
the right decision don't don't worry
about anything everything is fine
just don't overthink it but as all your
headphone you are determined to punish
yourself I would recommend you search
CNET best sports headphones because we
have a round up of many headphones Jeff
forty-ones
wireless kind of things that seem to be
within that price range certainly also
point out don't um don't forever
abandon the like wired earphones because
lots of head phones these days
increasingly and have replaceable wires
for stretches which is good okay yeah it
doesn't matter if the why gets any
thoughts on this one yeah well cuz he
mentioned them just like this the the
sporty bit like the clips and stuff
those are actually really important
particularly on wireless on wireless
support headphones because all the the
bluetooth connectivity and everything
and the batteries of course are held in
the earpieces they're really really
heavy so will fall out quite easily
particularly if you are running so you
can't do need those those clips so which
but a few bucks we do next you do the
marriage opposed
there's loads there's some dark
confessions I don't know we can do that
if I think it was like oh I'm just
getting my ear there's no more time mark
you will never see is making us some
kind of chopping gesture I'm not sure if
that's he's saying running out of time
or he's gonna kill us when it finished
I'm not really sure thank you for all of
you back yeah
