streaming I'm Bridget Carey this is your
CNET update Spotify a music streaming
app is evolving into a video streaming
app this week and we're not just talking
about music videos back in May Spotify
revealed that is partnering with major
video outlets like ESPN Comedy Central
TBS ABC NBC BBC to name a few and it's
also going to be featuring popular
podcasts in an interview with The Wall
Street Journal Spotify said the new
content is coming this week on Android
and next week for iPhone adding video
and podcasts encourages people to spend
more time on the app and that means
Spotify could make more money on
advertisements Spotify has been busy
making a number of changes lately just
the other week it integrated with the
Starbucks app so you can save the song
that's playing in the store to your
Spotify playlist Spotify isn't the only
app broadening its reach the social
messaging app snapchat seems to be
working on new types of audio and video
calling features Snap preps developers
posted these screenshots of new features
which seem to be hidden inside the
current app it could be similar to
Google Hangouts or Facebook messenger
where you can make an audio or video
call and also send stickers in a text
chat of course snapchat isn't commenting
about this so we shall have to wait and
see if any of this becomes a real
feature and that's not the only change
coming to your apps Microsoft is rolling
out new features to the personal
assistant Cortana on Windows 10 she's
scanning your email to remind you to
keep your promises currently Cortana
scans your email for any messages that
have phrases regarding package delivery
or upcoming flights to give you
reminders Google now does the same but
Cortana will soon also look for phrasing
if you promise to do something for
example if you tell your friend that
you're gonna buy tickets to an event
you'll get a pop-up reminding you that
you said you're gonna buy those tickets
Cortana is also paid attention to when
you have a meeting that's earlier or
later than your usual work times so
you'll get alerted to take action since
it's out of the ordinary that's it for
this tech news update but you can catch
up on the latest tech news it's
calm and follow along on twitter from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
