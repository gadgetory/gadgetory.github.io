smartwatches why because they offer
stuff that other watches lack battery
life up to a week or more water
resistance you can wear them swimming
and are always on screen pebbles newest
watch that pebble time round is here and
while it does a lot of what the other
pebbles do it turns a lot of its best
features on its head in the name of
fashion it is really thin I mean this
round version is super super thin it's
thinner than nearly any other SmartWatch
I've ever seen and it feels like a
regular watch feels great on my wrist
and it's comfortable but that display is
small compared to its thick side bezels
it is always on and it looks even better
in bright sunlight but it could have
been larger and there's no touchscreen
you use buttons on the sides just like
other pebbles to check the time open
apps control music check messages or
look at your daily timeline there are
many colors and designs you can choose
from and either 14 or 20 millimeter
watch band options my version is black
battery life is shorter it now lasts
just two and a half days on a charge not
bad but not nearly as good as other
pebbles it uses the same charger at
least but I miss having it last a week
it can't be worn swimming you can get it
wet but this isn't a pool watch anymore
the water resistance has been downgraded
which is a shame and it won't work with
every pebble app because of its round
display only some watch faces and apps
work on the new pebble time round you're
going to have to hunt and peck in the
pebble app store and so far a lot of my
favorite apps have not made the leap
will they who knows it has the same
features otherwise as the pebble time
and the time steel color reflective
screen and accelerometer and gyro for
fitness tracking apps vibration for
silent alarms and messages and a
microphone which you can respond to
messages with on Android but it also
works with a lot of cool new voice
enabled apps that can be used with the
iPhone like a new voice dictation note
app but the round is expensive $250 the
same price as the pebble time steel
yes it's smaller but I'd prefer more of
that battery life swim capabilities and
more apps maybe you feel differently at
least pebble offers you a choice just
before warned
that the round makes compromises for
it's cool size I'm Scott Steinman CNET
