fifteen hundred new cat videos posted
every day so I'm glad to hear that
because that means I'm not the only one
who's crazy I'm Brian Cooley with a cnet
top five so shameless I almost feel
guilty about it almost it's top five cat
videos we hunted down the top videos of
cats on YouTube took out all the lazy
compilations and any that looks remotely
like cat torn it is we don't roll that
way and came up with these five that
have monster traffic coming in at number
five it's the ninja cats with 12.6
million views short simple and hilarious
this is that video where the cat keeps
getting closer to the camera without
ever seeming to move brian Tong has the
same disturbing habit number for Nora
the piano playing cat 18 million views
the London Times describes her music as
somewhere between Philip Glass and free
jazz yeah very free video of her playing
has been studied in scholarly circles
shown on just about every TV talk show
and news website and her music is
featured on a CD and like all great
prodigy stories hers begins with humble
roots a shelter rescue from new jersey
number three kitten fight eighteen and a
half million views this transcendent
video is actually a set of important
life lessons first it's about
establishing limits on one's behavior
through healthy conflict second it shows
that no matter how engaged you are in
said conflict that stops when someone
pukes number two two talking cats 30 and
a half million views okay these cats are
talking to each other right just like i
might do with you I mean look and then
they groom each other which I don't want
to do with you
by the way before we get to number one
it's not a mystery why there are so many
cat videos out there cats are the most
popular companion animal Scientific
American says there are 600 million
living among humans the Egyptians
probably got all this started a
relatively short 3600 years ago and if
you're going to follow their lead I
trust you'll adopt from a shelter okay I
know you're sitting there in that cat
sweater you knitted covered in fur
itching to know the world's number one
most popular cat video and this is it
the mean kitty song with 36 million
views you know this one was sparta the
cat came out back in two thousand seven
now the music is disturbingly like men
at work and I get a broad sense of
unease watching that guy run around and
his faux hawk in his camo pants but it
can't mess with 36 million and that's
one cute kitty I'm Brian Cooley I have
seven cats and we'll see you next time
for another top five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
