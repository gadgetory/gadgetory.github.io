after you galaxy s ninth and the guards
s nine bus so we're gonna have a quick
chat about exactly what we think Jess
top-line thoughts any good yeah I think
from what we've seen so far there are
some small improvements over last year's
Galaxy sa at NSA plus those were both
really beautiful phones from the front
they look almost identical the bezels of
button ever so slightly thinner you
still have the very slightly curved
screen you still have this edge toolbar
on the side and it's it's a really
beautiful device they both are when you
flip them around is when you start to
see a difference namely the fingerprint
scanner has moved from the side of the
camera where it was impossibly awkward
that was a real problem it was a big
problem for me too because my hands are
a lot smaller than yours so I felt like
I was just like leaping across the phone
in order to do that now Samsung has done
wet everybody else in the industry does
and they've moved the fingerprint
scanner to below the camera another big
change you'll notice on the galaxy s 9
plus there are two camera modules here
not just one so this is something that
Samsung has done
that kind of copy is the iPhone
technique I guess which is that the
smallest version has a single lens the
medium version or the larger version of
that has two lenses and then we expect
that the galaxy note mine will continue
to keep its two cameras right yeah
exactly so I would say you know there
are a couple enhancements under the hood
as well you'll see a faster chip and I
could make the phones up to 25% faster
than last year's model and could also
improve battery life on a single charge
the latest Qualcomm the 855 I think it
is a 45 other regions will get Samsung
house-made Exynos processor the latest
version but if it weren't for this
beautiful purple color or this beautiful
coral blue color that you have I you
know if you have the two phones black
wins side-by-side if you're looking in
the front you might not really notice
the difference between the II between
the old model now they are very similar
and I think that's fine because for me
the the s8 was such a good looking phone
that I don't really think something
needed to do a complete overhaul of the
other look of this phone yet it still
got a little bit more milking to do of
that design language certainly we've
complained with other manufacturers like
Apple who've kept on that same design
gear on year it does get tiring but this
isn't the year to replace that just yet
next year I might feel differently and
if we don't get the s10 being something
a little bit more dramatic a little bit
more exciting there yeah yeah well I
mean we have colors so that does we have
got
there is also black and gray but these
are my favorite bloodline is boring
stands out yes so let's see the
difference between the s9 and the s9 +
Wow yes it's bigger as you've noticed
we've got a 6.2 inch screen on here in a
5.8 inch display on this guy on the s9
cameras so two of them on this guy that
means that you get the portrait mode I
mean you get a telephoto zoom lens as
well if you want to get in on the action
but that's not that's not reducing the
quality it's not like a digital zoom
where you literally just crop into the
image you still get that full resolution
make a pixel camera eight megapixel
front-facing camera okay so you've got
screen space you've got that second
camera you've got a larger battery
capacity on there about day yeah it's
still the same as last year's if you're
keeping track but with the new chipset
in there you might get like a little bit
more life out of it but you're still
going to need to charge your phone every
night especially if you're using it
really heavily and then also the price
so this is going to be the s9 a plus is
going to be more expensive than the s9
yeah I don't know we don't we don't know
exact prices off the top of my head I
think 739 pounds for the small one and
eight hundred and something for the
bigger one so it really varies so in US
currency you're gonna have $120
difference depending on which care
you're going to and that's just for the
s9 or the s9 plus and so that's
something you're definitely going to
have to shop around but crucially I
don't think there's any difference as
far as I'm aware in the process of
performance or the resolution of the
standard camera so actually between the
two phones
whichever one you go for it's really
down to what I think feels most
comfortable in your hand for me I am
used to having bigger phones but I
prefer the smaller size of the galaxy s
9 I really like the size of the iPhone X
that's a lot smaller and it just feels
more comfortable
one hand so my money would go for the
smaller one being happy that I'm not
having to really compromise on
performance there how about you well I
do like a portrait mode option is it
worth the extra money I mean maybe I
also kind of feel like I want the option
to have it if I want to use that I
wouldn't want to be like disappointed
that I couldn't take those pictures
however you don't lose a lot of the poor
functionality Samsung has upgraded the
camera in both of these phones they
don't get the same upgrades and a really
big part of this is something called
dual aperture and you are a big photo
pump so why don't you explain what that
is so this is the first phone actually
has an aperture that will physically
change that's something that you will
see in traditional dslr's with with with
with professional lenses where you can
change the aperture that's physically
the size of the hole that lets the light
in and really what that means is the
bigger the hole the more light can get
into your sensor and this one you can
change it between an F 1.5 which is very
wide doing it right now
the bigger that aperture lets in a lot
of light so this should be really good
in low light we have seen some examples
already that Samsung has shown but do
they very impressive but of course they
taking those up to optimal lab
conditions so we're going to have to
reserve our judgment until we can sort
of take this out into the field maybe
even around Barcelona and see how it
really performs at nighttime maybe we'll
have to take it into a bar with some
beers and see how it performs there I
think we're definitely I think that
might have to happen yeah you're never
supposed to notice if you go into pro
mode you can force this and you can
change the setting but the beauty is
that it's supposed to be automatic so
that when you do go into the bar the
dark environment or your rear with your
friends that will just happen very
seamlessly and you won't even notice
that you're getting better lectures
another thing that Samsung did with the
camera was that the company introduced
super slow motion video so they already
had some motion video now it's even
slower it was before
I think 240 frames a second but now it
shoots at 960 frames a second so that
takes I think about two seconds of video
point to 60 seconds so if you're
slapping your friend in the face
throwing a cake on the floor your dogs
catching a ball
that'll happen to you personally very
very good for sharing of your friends
and fun for YouTube or that kind of
thing and or we don't know at the moment
I don't think is the resolution 720p so
I did take several slow-motion videos of
myself
I watched the Mac and it does the
crazier you know you're you're not gonna
it's for fun it's for sharing the dogs
really I'm not ashamed because last year
Sony launched their exed premium I
believe it was and that also had a 960
frames a second super slow-mo and that
also did it in 720 so it would kind of
be nice for Samsung to up the ante a
little bit with a full HD option maybe
even hire mean I think 4k will be
pushing it but certainly I think hitting
that Full HD mark on here would have
been good
yeah Sony's the way Sony did it as well
was very difficult to capture that
moment of when you want the slow-mo to
happen and I haven't tried Samsung's yet
but they have got a few features like an
automatic mode which should hopefully
make it easier to get what you want in
slow-motion so one other camera feature
that I want to point out this is
and new to the galaxy s 9 its selfie
focus so oftentimes you get that
portrait mode by having two cameras on
the back
you only have one pip front-facing
camera but the phones will actually use
software to kind of simulate that focus
so I don't think I can get it close
enough to the camera but the idea is
that your background will blur out and
you and your friends will kind of pop
out and sharp really of course that's
not the only exciting thing that you can
do with the front-facing camera because
Samsung has a little bit jumped on the
Apple bandwagon with B ma are emojis but
what Samsung's turn is when you take a
selfie of yourself of course you can
then that will then be turned into an
animated character of yourself which
will then talk as you're talking into it
and so you can use that to send us
messages do all kinds of things rather
than it just being like Apple are
talking poo or a talking fox it actually
is supposed to look a bit like you with
the rabbit or Disney characters there is
an agreement with Disney so err emoji
does two things the first thing it does
is it does create an avatar of yourself
then it kind of splits into two tracks
so you can stylize and edit that and as
again you said record a video
although
it's creepy it doesn't work very well
and I recorded some I tried to smile and
instead of smiling so I went like this
and it went a grimace this looks like
doing a lot of pain
the second thing so you can share that
with others not shares in a movie file
and and the other thing that it does is
it will basically create eighteen
animated gif stickers that you can send
messages and those are pre created so
when you set it up you're not even
smiling you just kind of have a passport
photo face where you stare at it and
then it creates those stickers and you
can use them if you've ever used bitmoji
it's like that it's almost identical to
bitmoji actually and my character that I
created when I tried this looked almost
identical to by bitmoji character and I
really like using bitmoji sending all
the different things so I think this you
have 18 at launch but I'm sure that as
it as it as it has it takes off and
people start doing their own thing with
it and I imagine some people probably
release that that apk out to other
developers who may start bringing that
into things so it could well be that we
start seeing a lot more of these things
and certainly if it Modi themselves get
ahold of the Developer Kit they could
actually bring that into bitmoji profit
I'm not really hot on this future from
what I've seen so far it's early days
there could be a lot of software
improvements but I just don't think the
tracking is really good I look at it I
don't think it looks like me other
people have seen out other editors tried
it their skin tone their hair was
smoothly off do you really want to sit
there I mean you're supposed to have
some sort of you know identification
with this character that's being created
that's what makes it personal and I just
feel like it right and what works with
an emoji is that it tracks really well
so when you move your mouth it moves you
have a tracking is better much better on
Apple's do you think that makes this
seem a bit like a me to game dude
I do feel that way I think that the
front-facing camera has a lot to do with
it
the iPhone turn that this is on
and has a 3d tracker yeah in the camera
this is using 2d so this is just a
matter of generation I think the note 9
or I think next year's Galaxy phones
could improve just when that front
facing camera improves the technology is
out there but it's coming slower to
introduce some features that we do still
have though it's still IP 68 waterproof
so you can't don't take it swimming but
it's safe if you get it splashed or if
you take a phone call in the rain we've
also got micro SD card expandable four
cards up to four hundred gig in size I
mean they're about 200 pounds or what
$300 so you might not want to buy one of
those but at least you can if you wanted
to so that's neat that we have still got
that and Samsung were very keen to point
out though there is still a headphone
jack on the bottom of this so they
haven't got rid of the headphone jack
wireless charging also a future they
used to see in here of course you have
Samsung pay I want to say something
about a speaker which is next to the
headphone jack yeah which is what we saw
so Samsung has enhanced the audio for
the s9 in the s9 plus we've got the
microphone is bottom and a speaker up at
the top these are combined with a Dolby
codec so Dolby software that you'll find
similar to what you might see in it'll
be cinema theater and it creates richer
louder sound I thought it sounded really
good in the demo it sounded pretty rich
but I also don't think that that was
difficult to attain compared to previous
versions just speakerphone audio through
the speakers has never been a strong
suit so it's nice to see Samsung kind of
come to the table but a lot of
the makers have and I'm definitely
looking forward to kind of testing that
out of just for a battle of which food
has the best audio which ones allowed us
definitely it's not going to be a
feature you're not going to use this
music to to power your party for example
we've got some noise going on behind us
but it's it's loud enough that if you're
listening to maybe a podcast while
you're cooking your dinner or you want
to show you a friend and video yeah it's
great for that but but it's not it's it
isn't going to replace a good set of
headphones or a good Bluetooth speaker
okay so we've gone over a lot of the
main features
I think the remaining question is how is
this phone going to perform against some
of the others that are out there the
iPhone 10 the Google pixel - and - Excel
and other things that are going to be
coming down the line that are very quiet
what's your hat take I mean I think
Samsung has its take that si was already
a very good phone and it already held
its own against those other phones so it
has taken that and added a little bit
extra so that's good I think people are
going to respond to that I think this is
going to is definitely going to sell
well because it's a new Samsung Galaxy
phone they always sell well so I think
they're definitely onto a winner here
for me there isn't it's not a huge jump
over the si and certainly if you already
have a galaxy si there's no need to
upgrade to you can safely think okay
this one is not for me I'll wait till
the the s 10 next year or maybe even the
note 9 later on in the year it doesn't
have that pizazz of other here's a new
phone I agree with you and I also think
that a lot of this is going to come down
to the camera there are people who have
older versions of Samsung phones or
other phones and they've been waiting to
see do I buy an iPhone or GOI buy the
next galaxy and I think that when we
dive into that camera when we dive into
the speed
dive into battery life the things that
we haven't been able to test yet they
take time and you don't even have the
review units yet so when we do that I
think that's going to really decide if
this is the iPhone 7 killer or not when
the beats gonna be on sale right so they
go on pre-order March 2nd and they go on
store shelves March 16 yeah
so it means that by mid-march you should
be able to get your hands on one of
these and hopefully by then we may have
even been able to give one the full
review treatment because there is a lot
of things that we want to test with this
to do of course make sure to hit any
questions that we haven't covered in the
comments or you can find us on Twitter
Jess you are and I am at battery HQ and
of course you can reach CNET with at
CNET on pretty much every social channel
that you can find alright that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
