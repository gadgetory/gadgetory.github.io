are they on the verge of evolving in a
something entirely new
I'm Scott Stein and this is a look at
the Microsoft Surface pro tablet the
high-end version of what debuted in
someways last fall with the Microsoft
Surface RT and they look similar but
Microsoft's take on the surface pro side
is a lot more high-end and a lot more
like a real computer because it is a
real computer underneath is a Core i5
processor 3rd generation Intel those 4
gigs of ram there's a 64 gigabyte or 128
gigabyte SSD and also you're not going
to be limited to r/t style apps there's
a full Windows 8 operating system and
intel HD 4000 graphics
this is $8.99 or $9.99 for the two
configuration so it's not cheap and keep
in mind that price does not include the
iconic really the number one thing we
associate with the surface which is the
really cool keyboard cover the touch
cover or the type cover these are the
very same covers that work with the
surface RT are not sold with the system
you have to buy those for 119 129 each
respectively honestly if you're going to
get a surface you're gonna get one of
these and I would recommend going with
the 129 type cover which has a pretty
fantastic keyboard for its size and a
little multi-touch trackpad right
underneath it docks magnetically does it
seamlessly and it works about as well as
any peripheral I've ever seen
even those in the iPad world and it
really 1ups any keyboard covers I've
ever experienced it's really easy to use
it's fun to use with this now keep in
mind the kickstand on the back which
comes out provides a laptop like
experience but you can't technically put
it on your lap in the same way I was
able to lap type but it's really meant
to stand on a table and you'll have to
get a little used to the footprint here
but when you cover this up and use it
kind of like an iPad or a tablet it
becomes an all-in-one cover it's a very
portable and fun way to travel now the
surface pro is heavier and thicker than
the surface RT it's a little under 2
pounds same vapor mag construction here
magnesium very solid feeling but there's
also an additional vent around the side
it's a hairline vent in the back
and you can hear fans inside activate
very softly if you hold your ear up and
it gets a little hot if you keep it down
on a bed or something like that computer
for a while now included with this is a
pressure-sensitive pen the surface pen
which comes and attaches to the side
here in the very same magnetic port
that's used for the AC power it's a
comfortable pen it's very useful for
drawing in apps you don't get the
keyboard but you do get the pen and
another thing you don't get is a full
version of Microsoft Office like you do
in surface RT here you're getting your
basic suite of apps and the kind of
pre-installed set of stuff you'd find in
a full Windows 8 laptop now is it worth
the money well I think that this is a
fantastically designed package I think
that it's a lot of fun to use this type
cover or touch covers the case may be I
think it definitely proves the point
that tablets can be used like computers
especially when they have peripherals
that are this smart but the price is a
little high when you look at the
landscape you get an ultrabook right now
with similar specs for 800 or less and
you can also get in at alternative
option which are these lower powered
processors inside tiny laptops much like
the HP Envy x2 which includes a keyboard
and a trackpad al biet running an Atom
processor for about 850 so you are
paying up here for the extra processing
power and the design you might find
yourself a little hampered by the
storage limitations here and the fact
that there are port limitations this has
one USB 3.0 port it also has a mini
display port and an SD card slot and
that's pretty much it there are a few
other nice design touches on the surface
pro the AC adapter comes with an extra
USB port for charging external
peripherals at the same time clever and
this surface pro doesn't actually need
one of these keyboard covers in order to
survive in fact even though it's
something you want to buy just keep in
mind you could connect a bluetooth
keyboard and mouse to this and be just
as fine especially since it's got a
built-in kickstand in the back but
absolutely Microsoft has done the job in
showing that tablets can be full
computers - I'm Scott Stein and that's a
look at the Microsoft Surface pro coming
