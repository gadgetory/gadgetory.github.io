beat the iPhone 8 plus using just one
lens yet again to find out we put them
to the test at pier 39 in San Francisco
all shots were taken on the default
settings with Auto HDR unless we said
otherwise in ideal conditions landscapes
seem to be neck-and-neck on these two
phones the colors look slightly more
saturated with more contrast on the
iPhone but the pixel seems to have a bit
more detail the downside of having just
one lens though is that the pixel can
only do digital zoom and at 2x this shot
of alcatraz looks washed out in grainy
up close the iphone uses the second
telephoto lens as an optical zoom making
alcatraz look sharper and more vibrant
the same goes for actual close-ups the
greater contrast on the iphone makes the
grains of salt look clearer whereas on
the pixel it all kind of starts to blend
together
the iPhone also uses a telephoto lens
for its portraits along with image
processing the pixel creates the blurred
background effect using software and
machine learning portrait mode on the
iPhone is super easy you just swipe to
the setting and that's it and then on
the pixel though you have to click twice
you have to click on settings then
select portrait mode and you don't
really know when it's activated because
it doesn't have that yellow sign that
the iPhone does I honestly thought the
iPhone would be the clear winner here
but I actually prefer the pixel version
of Frisco Fred the colors are more
accurate and there's more detail in his
face and I do like this wider angle but
the pixel didn't always get it right
it's great with faces and pets but
objects seem to be a challenge portraits
on the iPhone are more consistent and
you can portrait mode just about
anything
what you can't portrait mode on the
iPhone is selfies selfies in general are
better on the pixel you can also use
that same blurred background effect as
on the rear camera as long as you're
both looking in the same plane for
portraits in the more challenging
setting of the mirror maze we turned on
the flash Lexie's eyes look red and her
face looks washed out on the pixel the
iPhone made the light seem more natural
but it's not as clear but with no flash
and no subjects the pixel takes the
crown this picture of the arches looks
sharper with the better colors the
iPhone is well lit but there's more
noise on the pillars look it's a pretty
even playing field when it comes to the
cameras on these two phones they don't
get much better than this and in some
shots
I could barely tell the difference
what's clear is that this year the pixel
is able to keep up and sometimes even
outperforming the iPhone using just one
lens and it's software at least as far
as stills are concerned video is a
different story and you'll have to watch
our video comparison for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
