people but I know when the jig is up
self-driving cars are inevitable they
eliminate the most common defective
component vehicles today you and me
I'm Brian Cooley with the top 5 reasons
for autonomous cars according to the
ills they cure number 5 drunk driving
the autonomous car is the only
designated driver who actually likes
nursing a club soda all night
metaphorically speaking unlike the
current law enforcement model
self-driving cars could theoretically
neutralise a hundred percent of drunk
driving but I put this one down at
number five because most future visions
still expect a licensed driver at the
wheel responsible for the self-driving
car and that doesn't mean you can be
drunk number 4 productivity you waste on
average an hour of your life every
weekday babysitting a steering wheel and
a set of pedals what if you were
productive during that ride to and from
work I mean it's what the rich guys do
maybe you could leave an hour earlier
maybe now I have your attention number
three traffic fewer cars or more roads
that's the age-old battle in the suburbs
right how about neither autonomous cars
can easily pack more cars on the same
roads since they have way faster
reactions than you and they know if the
other cars around them are gonna do
before they do it plus being connected
autonomous cars can be assigned
distributed routes at rush hour instead
of all of us kind of dumbly jamming into
the same few lanes at the same time
number two fuel economy as a component
of fuel economy you suck accelerating
too hard
braking too late and taking dumb routes
to get places autonomous cars can
modulate their dynamics based on traffic
flow signal prediction terrain contour
wind conditions optimal routing and a
bunch of things you've never thought of
to optimize their own fuel economy and
maybe even achieve that EPA number for a
change okay the number one reason for
self-driving cars is accidents or the
lack thereof
face it most driving is about as
interesting as doing dishes and a
driver's license that's about as hard to
get as the common cold it all adds up to
millions of lousy drivers who aren't
even doing that consistently autonomous
cars take the wetware you and me out
from in between the hardware and
software moving traffic accidents out of
the daily fabric of our lives that's a
big win to keep pace of the progress of
autonomous cars and I promise you
they're coming visit us at CNET on
