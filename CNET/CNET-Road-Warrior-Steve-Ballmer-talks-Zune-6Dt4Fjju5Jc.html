and welcome to Road Warrior where we
take a look at the hottest gadgets for
life on the go coming up and in car gps
unit that does everything a cell phone
that takes abuse and steve ballmer on
the zune it's not human ism first up
though Nicoli shows off a nifty an
affordable bluetooth headset the Jabra
BTW 125 he has elder large multifunction
button in the middle that flashes blue
and it's activated on the top here is
the charger slot and on the side you can
barely notice it but it's a very skinny
volume rocker you almost can't see it
because it's so skinny and in its black
that so it blends into the surface
Nicole said that the volume rocker is a
little hard to use when it's in your ear
and I have to agree but otherwise she
recommends it Kevin Massey recommends
the preview feature on the new end car
gps unit from eclipse one of my favorite
features of this system is the way that
it will allow you to preview a route
before you drive it you can see this
crosshair is taking the path to our
destination virtually you can pause it
you can play it in reverse and one of
the great features of this is you can
overlay points of interest on the roof
the avn 6600 also plays DVDs CDs mp3s
and more next up kent german thinks the
verizon gzone type v is the hummer of
cell phones verizon says you can use
this phone up into a metre of water not
that i really know we'd be doing with
the phone when you're underwater but it
is able to handle it so i'll just drop
it in like that and there I go it
doesn't float see and Mac want to make
sure you don't drop to the bottom of a
pool but you could use it to take
pictures and it is supposed to be able
to handle their a very moderate rainfall
can't even tried it in the shower not
sure who he was talking to and you can
drop it too and it's supposed to still
work yes it does finally ena freed
caught up with steve ballmer and found
out about the whole microsoft zune music
player Wi-Fi thing so if we're going to
come with a zoom with 802 11 built-in of
course all pcs have 802 11 built-in of
course no ipods have 802 11 built-in so
there's certainly notice
advantage we're starting from scratch to
build a community of entertainment a
phixion otto's both from the pc from the
xbox you'll see that increasingly from
the media center as well as from the
portable music devices the telephone the
mobile phone etc so we start but we're
building on industry-standard
connectivity so and go a lot of places
so he doesn't know either fair enough
that's it for this edition of road
warrior I'm Tom Merritt check back next
time for more gadgets to keep you armed
and dangerously productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
