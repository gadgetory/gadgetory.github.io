unusual step of letting this feature
introduce itself hi it's me it sure is
great to be on the Mac how about a demo
that's right
the first thing you'll notice is right
here on the dock we have access to Siri
so I can ask Siri a question let's say
how do you like being on a Mac pretty
awesome lots of space aluminum unibody
walls and no complaints about the lack
of Windows so it's the same Siri that we
know and love but now on the Mac it can
do so much more things like
sophisticated queries for files like
show the files I worked on last week
about the off-site have I ever told you
your file in is so stylin so we have my
search results but what's really
incredible is I can refine that
sophisticated query with a follow on
like just the ones Ken sent me that I
tagged with draft for your filing
pleasure so you see I've just the files
I'm looking for right there but what's
great is this is a useful result that I
may want to use throughout the day as I
work so I can actually click on this
plus button and pin it right here into
my notification center we see we're
planning an off site and they're a bunch
of activities but while I'm working in
full screen series there for me and
helps me multitask so I can do things
like play my power ballads playlist oh
yeah
so Siri to the rescue with some awesome
tunes
I can let this play all day but I think
we'll get on with the demo and I can
also have series search the web for me
so let's do search the web for pictures
of falconry here are some images of
falconry I found on the web okay that
looks like some good fun so I can
actually take the results right out of
Siri and drag them into my document it's
pretty epic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
