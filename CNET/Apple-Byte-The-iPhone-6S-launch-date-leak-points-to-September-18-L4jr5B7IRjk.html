I'm how's the show going nuts it's going
good I'm you know gonna started you
realize I'm going out of town right no I
just thought it was like normal yeah
well you know what I've got things to
see and people to do so get it done yeah
I'll get it done okay man yeah I'll get
them wait get it done sure sure I'm
doing right now no problem boss
done
what's happening Brian song here and
welcome to the apple pie for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
now there's always tons of action before
Apple's rumored but not officially
confirmed September 9th keynote and some
of that action is around iOS 9.1 and I
know some of you just said out loud hey
iOS 9 isn't even out right now hey I did
with nine isn't even out right now I
know Andy right well websites like
macrumors have seen traffic from devices
running 9.1 as far back as July even
though it's tailed off but analytics
company app see recently found evidence
of an iPad with the resolution of 27 32
x 2048 in its logs running iOS 9.1 now a
new report by KGI analyst ming-chi kuo
says the 12 point nine inch iPad pro
with a force touch enabled stylist will
enter production sometime in September
or october now Apple still needs to
officially release iOS 9 before anything
else so if you guys all put the pieces
of this puzzle together the new iPad pro
is likely to ship with iOS 9.1 which
means we probably won't see it launched
alongside the iphone and we could still
have one more ipad specific event so
we're thinking just iphones and apple TV
on sep tember the ninth now unless that
changes next week which it could I'll
write an iphone 6s news a triple leak of
info points to September 18th as the
official release date for the next
iPhone the leaks come from different
sources or phone carriers from Japan
Germany and the UK but these are all
tier 1 Apple launched countries and it
pretty much confirms will see the same
release date here in the United States
best buy is also expected to start
carrying applecare in stores for
products including the phone on the 14th
just a few days before the expected
launch now we also showed you the unbox
therapy video last week and I told you
they would bend it in another week and
that's exactly what Lou did he compares
an iphone 6 rear shell
to the 6s shell he acquired you then
have the metals analyzed and found the
6s case had a significantly higher
presence of zinc pointing to 7000 series
aluminum but the proof comes down to his
bend test and Lou found that the iphone
6 case started bending under 30 pounds
of pressure while the 6s rear shell
started bending at 80 pounds of pressure
dude that's how much I can curl with
like one arm is like you need 30 pounds
right Brian not 80 30 yes Mitch 30 well
either way the new iPhone casein looks
like a huge improvement all right new
apple accessories have been leaked out
thanks to the FCC to filings that hit
their website showed the big a will be
releasing new versions of its bluetooth
magic mouse and wireless keyboard now in
a shocker the new mouse will be called
the magic mouse too there were no
indications for a name change for the
keyboard we aren't able to distinguish
any real major design changes but the
biggest difference is that both the
mouse and keyboard will support
Bluetooth 4.2 low-energy 4.2 is faster
more secure and more power efficient
these two guys could be the very first
4.2 products Apple releases if they come
out before the phones and iPads and I've
told you all it's a good idea to wait
for Sky lake and that Intel's IDF 2015
conference in San Francisco they
showcase skylights ability to drive 3 4k
monitors at 60 Hertz that's three I said
previous chips can only do a single
monitor and you know what that's Power
PC world report's intel engineer said
the new chipset could launch around two
weeks so cross your fingers that we'll
see some new sky like Mac announcements
before the year is over and finally the
Apple watch made some enemies with major
league baseball after Kansas City Royals
manager Ned Yost was banned for wearing
his Apple watch during games now
ironically it was the same watch the MLB
gave him for being the American League's
manager for the all-star game now Yost
told the MLB when you're away from your
phone all it is is a watch it's just a
clock which is why they need to make the
next one a whole lot better
now after all this fuss the MLB will now
reportedly allow coaches and team
personnel to where Apple watches in the
dugout during games because they also
agreed with many tech observers without
a phone it really is just a glorified
clock sometimes the truth hurts alright
that's going to do for this we show you
can always email me at the Apple by to
cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong and
i'll answer when i'm not hoverboarding
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
you all next time for another bite of
the app have a nice trip Brian
