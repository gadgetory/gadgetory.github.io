welcome to tomorrow daily and fsq talk
shows known universe I'm ashley's
together and i'm jeff cannata and it is
time for headlines you know when I think
about drones a lot of the times I just
say to myself what if i put a chainsaw
on one and somebody actually did that
finish farmers put together a chainsaw
toting drone and remotely flew it around
the area slicing icicles trees and even
some poor unsuspecting snowmen it looks
really scary but the creators said the
total flight time was about five minutes
at a time because of the weight of the
chainsaw and also mounting the saw meant
it had to be flipped upside down making
it much less effective so if you're
wondering what futuristic invention
finally took down the killer drone it
was a pink balloon we need to arm
ourselves with a series of balloons yeah
when women fight when reached for
comment Jason Voorhees was like they're
replacing me with robots oh no start on
the best horror movie ever seen right
who's being outsourced easily the best
robots hey uh do you like contraptions
we like contraptions Marble Mountain is
a contraption once you check this out
Ben tardif is the creator of Marble
Mountain a device that took him three
years to build it's a modular device
with different pieces coming together to
create a final product which is a
gigantic adventure for marbles it
includes a roller coaster a ski jump a
bowling alley windy city streets a
racetrack even a skate park and a tiny
Times Square he runs 300 marbles at a
time to keep the machine in motion and
it's pretty mesmerizing to watch don't
you think actually pretty mesmerizing it
is I would you watch the video it's also
a little bit relaxing yeah it's just
that the sound of the machine is
relaxing Horrible's everywhere I want to
I want a giant marble contraption as my
like go to sleep machine that would be
delightful I think I would really like
that okay so what story should we talk
about on Thursdays lon show I mean I
feel like
the the future battle between machine or
a chainsaw wielding machines and
balloons is is really the one kind of a
no-brainer I think you're right who you
got is really the question for you out
there you got balloons or you got
chainsaw wielding machines yes please
use the hashtag hey TD and tell us if
your team balloon or team drone chainsaw
because I want to know I think it I
think I all says a lot about your
personality is who you pick I think it
does I think it does we won't say which
way though say which one is a good one
because it could be either we'd love to
talk about that more when we discussed
this story in depth on Thursday so use
that hashtag for us alright guys that is
it for headlines let's check out our
