tablet running a full version of Windows
8.1 it has a screen resolution of 1280
by 800 includes a microSD card slot
supporting up to 64 gigabyte cards it
also has micro USB and micro HDMI
there's a 2 megapixel camera on the
front and an 8 megapixel camera on the
back neither takes the best pictures or
delivers the clearest video but as long
as there's enough ambient and preferably
natural light pictures usually turn out
decent enough the Encore is built like a
typical toshiba tablet it's bulky
heavier than other tablets at its size
has this plastic silver textured back
that should make it more grippy but
doesn't really the corners are smoothly
rounded and don't dig into my palm so I
do like that now I'm a fan of the touch
or Metro interface for Windows 8.1 it's
come a pretty long way since Windows 8
point oh the biggest issue with windows
8 however is that it relies too heavily
on the desktop interface any control
panel is you want to access you got to
go through the desktop and while it's
fine if you have a mouse and keyboard on
an 8-inch tablet however it gets a bit
frustrating when you're trying to close
windows you can't quite hit the X or you
want to search for something but the
virtual keyboard doesn't automatically
pop up that's a Microsoft issue of
course but toshiba did choose to put
this OS on an 8-inch tablet and then not
release a keyboard for it so it has to
take its fair share of the blame as well
performance is thankfully high apps load
it quickly reboots are fast and games
ran smoothly the screen as well is
immediately responsive to swipes the
anchor eight starts at three hundred and
thirty dollars for 32 gigabytes of
storage or four hundred dollars with 64
gigabytes of storage check out my full
review at cnet com for more information
and my final recommendation i'm eric
franklin and this has been a first look
at the Toshiba encore 8
