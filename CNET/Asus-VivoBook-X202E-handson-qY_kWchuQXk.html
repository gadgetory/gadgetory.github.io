look at the asou vivo book X 202 e now
of course that name doesn't really tell
you anything about this system so I'll
tell you that it is an 11 inch ultra
portable Windows 8 laptop with most
importantly a touchscreen because we're
really at the point right now where
every Windows 8 laptop really needs to
have a touchscreen in order to be really
usable now of course adding that
touchscreen especially in the first wave
of Windows 8 laptop somebody saw and at
a considerable amount of the price some
of the very first Windows 8 systems were
$1300 $1600 certainly most of them were
more than a thousand the nice thing
about this guy right here is that it's
five hundred and fifty dollars which is
about as inexpensive as the as the
biggest kind of drawer buster bargains
we saw during the holiday 2012 season
were so once you get a touchscreen
Windows 8 system down under $600 then it
becomes obvious that everybody can have
a touchscreen and everyone can really
enjoy the best parts of Windows 8 now
there is a compromise to be made that
compromised in this case is that you
have an intel core i3 processor rather
than the much more common core i5 or
even core i7 that you have in the more
expensive systems now is that a big step
down
what kind of miss performance wise you
do have to take into account what you
want to do with the system if you're
gonna be web surfing social networking
watching video maybe just doing one task
or two tasks at a time you probably
won't notice that much of a difference
if you're gonna be doing a lot of stuff
really intense stuff you want to do some
gaming then this may not be the laptop
for you but with an 11 inch screen it's
fairly portable it's a little bit thick
and chunky and heavy for an 11 inch
laptop everyone so ultrabook obsessed
these days but it's still very
reasonably sized the construction
actually comes off fairly well for a
budget laptop a mix of metal and plastic
decent design the keyboard a little bit
on the small side but the typing was
actually fairly good I like that the
Shift + Enter and other keys like that
are very large I was not a big fan
however of the touchpad is bigger than
is just just enough lack of
responsiveness to really be annoying
especially when you're used to really
good touch pads that you find in act
books and even a lot of Windows PCs
these
but if you take into account that this
is one of the least expensive
touchscreen and Windows 8 systems that
you can get right now
certainly worth these compromises if
Portability and price is what is most
important to you I'm Dan Ackerman and
that is the isuzu Viva book X - OH - E</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
