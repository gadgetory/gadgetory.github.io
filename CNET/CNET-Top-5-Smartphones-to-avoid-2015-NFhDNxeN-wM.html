there are so many outstanding cell
phones to choose from that said there
are so many choices out there it's easy
for carriers to pad their catalogue with
a few duds on Donnell Bell and this top
five were counting down the latest crop
of smartphones that you should avoid the
phones are ranked from bad to worse by
sina associate editor lin lah starting
off at number five with a rating of two
and a half stars the very cool quantum
my guess is that we deducted half a star
for spelling cool with a k' and then
proceeded to shave off more points for
its slow processor low res screen and
sad sad picture quality on the upside
the phone is 4G compatible and
affordably priced at around $220 you can
do better at number four also rated at
two and a half stars the LG g3 s my
guess is the S stands for now keep in
mind that the flagship LG g3 the one
without the S is on our list of the
CNET's best smartphones so you'd be
forgiven for thinking that this smaller
version would be equally great but you'd
be wrong
processor is weak the resolution is sad
and the on-board storage is and I quote
pitiful so don't be fooled coming in at
number three on our list of increasingly
crappy phones the ZTE grand X sometimes
companies use the letter X to give their
product name a little edge and mystery
but in this case I think ZTE just
couldn't be bothered to give this turtle
real name the whole thing is straight
out of 2012 running jelly bean on a
dual-core processor on the outside it's
only 150 dollars off contract but you
get what you pay for in it number two
with a 2 star rating to match the posh
Orion Pro X 500 the name alone is enough
to give me an aneurysm it sounds like a
nuclear warhead designed by the worst
spice girl and then there's the phone
bad screen bad camera quality bad call
quality and old version of Android the
upshot is that it's a dual SIM phone it
only costs $100 but think of all the
things you could buy for $100 that don't
say posture
not and that brings us to our number one
phone to avoid as of January 2015 the
rating of one and a half stars the
huawei ascend Y 550
if you truly hate yourself this is the
perfect phone to help sustain your
feelings of unworthiness the four and a
half inch screen keeps your expectations
low with an impressively poor 854 by 480
resolution the specs are dated and the
design is ugly on the upside the photos
taken on this don't look half bad but
you'd never know it on that horrendous
screen that they used so there you go
five phones that aren't worth your money
for more information you can read Lin's
full posts on CNET titled don't buy
these phones have more top 5 for me
you've got top 5 cnet.com i'm donald
bell thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
