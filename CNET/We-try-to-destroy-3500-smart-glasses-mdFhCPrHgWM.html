withstand this kind of torture these
$3500 smart glasses are designed for use
on oil rigs in manufacturing or by
government agencies running a modified
version of Android they have similar
specs to a regular phone the wearer can
get hands-free instructions on the
displays or see real-time notifications
we're here at the ODG test labs to put
these glasses through their paces so we
have a salt fog test a drop test a
projectile test and a couple more let's
go and see how they hold up then stop
the drop test from a height of 4 feet
the glasses fall on to two inches of
plywood on the concrete floor
three-two-one the glasses can withstand
eight drops in a row falling on
different sides the factory workers
glasses that pass high-impact tests are
a must we drop a 500 gram weight shaped
like a bullet down a 4 foot tube they're
designed to take two hits on both lenses
for extreme temperatures this freezer
keeps the glasses ice-cold at minus 20
degrees Celsius they can also withstand
heat up to positive 50 degrees Celsius
so the glasses have been in the freeze
for an hour let's take them out and see
if they still work
yep starting up there working for hot
human environments we start with a fog
test putting the glasses in a tank for
an hour with warm salty spray
smell salty okay here we go it's wet and
salty and smelly but they were quick and
for the splash test this sheet of paper
is covered with indicator liquid that
turns pink when it comes in contact with
the spray if the spray doesn't intrude
on the eye area it passes the test the
labs use a slingshot to test
high-velocity impact these quarter-inch
steel balls hit the glasses at around
200 feet per seconds after each torture
test I verified the glasses still work
by doing a quick demo running a
simulation to see inside this box using
augmented reality but after putting them
through this much stress it's safe to
say the r7 are not your average pair of
glasses
