camera are all part of the uniform for
some officers of the Hayward California
Police Department we have a headpiece
sunglasses through our shoulder you tend
to forget about it could still
lightweight this department recently
purchased 150 Taser brand axon body
cameras in order to have a video record
of police interactions with the public
officers decide when to turn it on and
off haywards recorded videos uploaded to
their cloud storage it can't be edited
or deleted but officers do have the
right to review their own footage after
90 days then the footage will fall off
if it's marked as evidence though we're
going to keep that indefinitely ACLU
attorney Chris Conley site's privacy
concerns there need to be strict
policies around who can access it how
long it's retained where it's used but
soon it may be more than law enforcement
wearing these cameras on the job v view
makes a body camera used in more than
4,000 police departments nationwide but
it's also marketing a consumer model for
other professionals we've had school bus
drivers we've had teachers we've got
dentist it's amazing the amount of
people that have things happen in their
life that they want to record so they
can protect themselves later people want
what benefits them on the record and yet
they also want to have the privacy to go
about their lives and not be monitored
all the time these types of body cams
are not much different than other
wearable consumer cameras like Google
glass or go pro so widespread adoption
could mean even less privacy for
everyone in public in San Francisco I'm
