Boz's ultra compact wireless bluetooth
speaker the Soundlink mini which retails
for 199 99 the first thing you notice
about this speaker is that it's got a
slick design and almost looks like it
was built by apple with a unibody
aluminum enclosure that surrounds two
small drivers and front and rear passive
radiators at 1.5 pounds the mini isn't
is diminutive as some of the tiny
bluetooth speakers now on the market but
it's metal housing gives it considerably
more substance than most of its plastic
competitors and if nothing else this
thing feels like something that's worth
two hundred dollars the mini is designed
to be very simple to use with clearly
labeled buttons on the top like all
Bluetooth speakers it will stream audio
wirelessly from virtually any smartphone
or tablet plus any bluetooth-enabled PC
or audio player the speaker remembers up
to six devices so you'll only need to
pair it once i like that the unit comes
with a desktop charging cradle you can
also plug the included AC adapter
directly into the unit so you don't have
to take the cradle with you when you
travel however does not charge via USB
so you do need the AC adapter as for
battery life bose claims seven hours of
play time and a three hour recharge time
well the cradle is a nice extra
everything else will cost you Bose is
selling protective bumper sleeves that
are nice but they do cost a whopping
twenty-five dollars each and a carrying
case will set you back $45 in terms of
connectivity there's an auxiliary input
on the side for non blue two devices as
well as a micro USB port on the back for
potential firmware upgrades like boses
step up sound like bluetooth mobile
speaker 2 there's no integrated
speakerphone which is too bad it's a
feature that not everyone uses but it's
still good to have on board how's the
mini sound well while it just can't
deliver the performance of a larger
speaker for what it is and its tiny size
it sounds impressive overall the sound
signature is somewhat laid-back and
forgiving so it's got a bit of a
creamier sound the bass goes pretty deep
but it doesn't sound incredibly tight or
punchy all in all how
ever you come away with the sense that
Bose eat out about as much as it could
from a speaker this size in this price
range i'm also a fan of the UE boom
which has a bit bigger sound better
battery life and a built-in speakerphone
is water resistant and better suited for
outdoor use however the mini's
combination of a top-notch design and
respectable sound in such a compact
package make it a standout product in a
crowded field of highly portable
bluetooth speakers yeah it's somewhat
pricey but I think most people will feel
they've got their money's worth or be
quite happy to receive this as a gift
i'm david carr nguoi and that's the bose
soundlink mini thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
