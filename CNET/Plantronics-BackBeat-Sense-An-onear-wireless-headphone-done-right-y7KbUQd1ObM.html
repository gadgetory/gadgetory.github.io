this is the Plantronics back feet sense
and on your bluetooth headphone it costs
$180 it's one of the best on your
wireless headphones currently available
for the money for starters it's
lightweight at 4.9 ounces or 140 grams
and very comfortable for an on-air model
with the self adjusting headband and
memory foam equipped ear pads that are
clearly labeled left and right I also
like the feature set like the parrot
Zeek and Zeek 2.0 the sense has a sensor
that knows when you have the headphones
on and when you have them off it pauses
your music as soon as you take the
headphones off your ears and resumes it
when you put them back on the headphone
uses bluetooth 4.0 and you can
simultaneously connect to bluetooth
devices and switch back and forth
between them as you might expect from a
Plantronics product the sense also works
as a headset and works well it's
equipped with dual microphones so you
can hear your voice in the headphones
when you're talking you can also press a
button on the bottom of the left ear cup
and your music pauses and you hear the
world outside your headphones through
the microphone this might come in handy
if you want people to think you're
listening to your headphones when in
fact you're listening to them in terms
of accessories you get a nice canvas
carrying case that has two pockets the
main one is for storing the headphones
while the smaller side pocket serves as
home for the included USB charging cable
and the headphone cord yes you can use
the sense as a wired headphone should
the battery die
battery life is rated at 18 hours of
music playback which isn't as good as
what Plantronics larger backbeat pro
delivers but it's quite solid for an
on-ear bluetooth headphone as for
performance the sense comes across as a
well-balanced headphone with ample but
not fat bass and good clarity and it
should work well with a variety of music
genres its pleasant fairly natural
sounding headphone that plays loud at
its highest volume but sounds better
when it's restrained to about 75% volume
I wouldn't call it Airy but it's
reasonably open for honor model and
noise isolation is decent with the ear
pads sealing out a good
amount of ambient noise the $250 Bose
Soundlink on ear Bluetooth is a bit
warmer more forgiving headphone with a
little plumper base at higher volumes
the bass is tighter on the plantronics
but there isn't quite as much of it so
if you're a bass lover it might not
quite satisfy you but overall the
backbeat sense is a well-designed on
your bluetooth headphone it's
comfortable to wear has a strong feature
set and sound as well as good battery
life if you're looking for an on-ear
wireless headphone it should be on your
shortlist I'm David Carr noise thanks
