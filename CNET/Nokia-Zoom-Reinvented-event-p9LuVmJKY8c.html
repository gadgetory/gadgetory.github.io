conference will start in 4.1 minutes we
kindly ask you not to use your flash
during the first 20 minutes of the press
conference
200 years ago photography was born for
the first time we could see new people
and new worlds we could be part of human
history
and glimpse into the future when we
first held our own cameras we could
capture life and memories in a new way
we became spontaneous
we could find moments like when ever
before
then the world challenge photography
became a daily part
Moustafa
millions every
voters
they cost borders and cultures and
brought people home when they couldn't
be there
everyone became a photographer a
storyteller creating visual records of
their words
the only invention photography
to help a sailboat
we're making photographs living their
needs
the finals
the way we share our stories has already
changed today and the way we capture a
moment is about to change
because everyone deserves a better
future and every great picture tells a
better story
welcome and thank you for joining us
today here in New York City throughout
history people have loved pictures
people love creating pictures sharing
pictures telling stories through their
pictures this passion for pictures is
something that Nokia recognized very
very early on we filed our first imaging
patent in 1990 for the first of 450
imaging patents we hold today we gave
people their first Nokia with a built in
camera when we introduced the Nokia
7650 we gave people from their zeiss
optics in 2005 launching the n9 t and
the next year we added optical zoom with
the n95 we gave people a sensor that was
as large a sensor on a still camera and
people well they started to think twice
about whether they needed the can't
carry both a phone and a camera because
it was all coming together in a single
device and then we open the doors for
people for nighttime photography with
the introduction of a xenon flash and by
2008 people were buying more cameras
from Nokia than they were buying simple
film based cameras from Kodak the world
had changed now we brought more clarity
to pictures than with an 8 megapixel
sensor then 12 megapixels with the n8
and then last year the Nokia 808
PureView put a 41 megapixel sensor into
people's hands we showed people details
they had never seen before
this year the Nokia Lumia 920 the 925
and the 928 they solved one of the
biggest camera phone complaints that we
hear out there and that is the ability
to take great pictures in low-light
conditions
now in the last year we've also
introduced new imaging experience things
like optical image stabilization
cinemagraph Nokia's smart camera
creative studio and photo Beamer but we
are not done not by a long shot in fact
we have only just begun this journey
we've helped people capture pictures for
more than a decade and now we can help
people see more than their eyes can see
today I'd like to introduce to all of
you the next chapter in smartphone
photography
ladies and gentlemen the Nokia Lumia
1020 take a look at that all right now
with the Lumia 1020 pictures will mean
more to you you'll see things with this
device that you've never seen before
you'll get closer than ever before and
you'll discover and rediscover new
stories the Nokia 1020 will change how
you shoot how you create and how you
share pictures forever
the Lumia 1020 as you can see continues
Nokia's color story in yellow black and
white these colors are inherent colors
that means whatever life throws at this
device it will stay as vivid as the day
that it was unboxed we've also made the
back the new front we are so proud of
that design but also in profile so
slender with the beautiful lens on it
like many of the Lumia products it still
boasts a unibody design that fits easily
into your pocket so it's always with you
always ready to capture the moment now
let's get inside the Lumia 1020 and talk
about how it brings more meaning to your
pictures I'd like to invite two of my
colleagues onstage who are going to help
me with a number of demonstrations
first of all we'll be asking Christina
York nice to join us who has a passion
for optics she holds a PhD in display
technology
Christina helped to bring the original
Pierre view to the whole world and now
she's focused on helping us to market
the Lumia 1020 as well I'd also like to
welcome you ha Alec Otto who leads our
camera technologies team and created
Pierre view with our head of imaging
hero some of them
uhaah is named on dozens of patent
applications at Nokia so one might claim
he is defining the future
of smartphone imaging like Christina
yoha also holds a PhD his is in memory
systems design so doctors Bjerknes in
Ellicott whoo please join me welcome
welcome welcome on stage now first of
all with the Lumia 1020 you will see
things you've never seen before the
Lumia 1020 captures clearer pictures all
of the time during the day and also at
night we've done this with sensor
innovation and technology we call over
sampling we've advanced the Nokia 808
PureView technology by creating an
entirely new ultra high resolution 41
megapixel backside illuminated sensor
these guys made me said that 41
megapixel ultra high-resolution backside
illuminated sensor that no one else in
the world has these backside illuminated
sensors have the most sensitive pixels
in the entire world and the Lumia 1020
has the largest such sensor in any
consumer product it means you can take
incredible pictures in all conditions
especially in low-light the 41 megapixel
sensor can capture 34 megapixel and 38
megapixel image files in a sixteen by
nine or a four by three aspect ratio
respectively now the cool thing that it
does is when it takes that
high-resolution image it is also
simultaneously saving a 5 megapixel
oversampled image right at the same time
every pixel in the oversampled image is
created using up to 7 pixels from the
sensor and this causes the 5 megapixel
image to have the maximum amount of
detail theoretically possible as a
result what you get are the smartest
sharpest
smart phone pictures possible plus it's
really easy to share those five
megapixel pictures on your favorite
sharing sites social networks and so
forth now what we've also done is taken
this over sampling technology to the
taking of video as well when shooting
videos the over sampling technology
processes up to 1 billion pixels per
second it's a huge number but it's
actually not the number that matters
very much
it's the fact that you can capture
videos with amazing quality and amazing
clarity now in addition to her passion
for display technologies kristina is
also a novice beekeeper and as we know
taking videos of bees is a relatively
dangerous adventure so you want to stand
a little waist back but maybe zoom a
little way in Christina yes so I'd like
to show you a video I shot here I assume
right in full HD its lossless high
resolution soon the resolution doesn't
drop and playing back this video reveals
details about the beast that I didn't
know before such as how furry they are
or how they carry pollen on their hind
legs so an amazing example of a super
clear video zoomed in all done with that
sensor and the over sampling technology
now last September we helped people wave
goodbye to blurry pictures and say hello
to optical image stabilization with the
Nokia Lumia 920 we did this with a lens
that floats on coils that actively
compensate for the natural movement of
your hands while you're taking a picture
those steady the image allowing you to
capture more light far more light than
competitors smartphones and the end
result is you get clearer brighter
pictures now many people have been
asking since we launched the 920 could
we combine our floating lens technology
with a giant 41 megapixel sensor can we
do it and it turns out that required
some really really clever engineering
and I'm proud to say we have some really
clever engineers who as you can tell
from the smiles really enjoy doing
exactly this type of thing what did they
do they actually completely redesigned
the optical image stabilization now
using a series of ball bearings around
the housing and very small magnetically
driven motors to automatically
compensate for the movement of the hands
if you lightly wobble the phone if you
actually listen to it you can hear that
in action it's just amazing the result
of all of this blur free super high
detailed photos day or night now this is
a picture that I captured I was in a
small motor boat in Helsinki Harbor
chopping through the water so moving at
a fair clip everything shaking including
my hands taking a picture of a sailing
ship that also was moving itself look at
how crisp that is
now this same stabilization technology
we've also brought to video so let's put
up a video that I took on the same trip
and what you're going to see here again
I'm in a moving boat through the waves
taking an image of a of a sailing ship
but notice how the whole image is
incredibly stable and blur-free amazing
implications of having stabilization
with a very high format sensor now
another advance to support the taking of
really clear pictures includes the
addition of a xenon flash here on the
Lumia 1020 take a look at these pictures
I took with three different smartphones
I did it in these lighting conditions in
the back corner of the room about 12
hours ago in this room first I took a
picture of you hon Kristina jumping
using a samsung galaxy s4 automatic
settings flash I thought that's not so
good so now let's try well I know it's a
cool device but let's try it nonetheless
the iPhone 5 there's the image now Lumia
1020 with a super-fast xenon flash can
freeze the motion take a look
you see that isn't that amazing finally
you can actually use your flash
now apologies to you ha he's looking
kind of spaced out there it was a late
night last night
but anyways beautiful pictures all the
time day or night now people also say
that they want to take pictures that get
closer than ever before so with this
device we have reinvented zoom
completely reinvented the concept with
the Lumia 1020 it's easy for you to zoom
into details that you cannot even see
with your own eyes we've done this
through a number of developments the
same great sensor and over sampling
technology that creates all of those
clearer pictures that I described you
and we saw also enables you to zoom into
details with higher quality so check
this out this image even after you take
the image zoom in same image you can
read it amazing level of detail amazing
what you can accomplish with that here's
another example we sent a couple of
engineers up in a helicopter over
Manhattan you can see that this is
Columbus Circle from the same position
let's look a little bit closer same
image same position same device that
level of zooming one final picture I
love to show again taken from that boat
I was in in Helsinki Harbor I thought
this was a really cool image because
what you can see is sort of a mix of the
water the industrial edge of Helsinki
Harbor including a large power station
in the background as well as some quite
modern classic Scandinavian design
buildings this blue building that you
see here now on the blue building you'll
notice there's a little thing oblong
shape sitting up on top I can just zoom
in with my lumia 1020 and prove to you
up that I was in Finland that is the
sauna 3 workers 4 o'clock in the
afternoon coming out from the
and to all of my friends in Finland
these three gentlemen will live in
infamy because they were looking down
there what's that guy in the boat doing
now they know we've also included Zeiss
wide-angle optics the Lumia 1020 has six
lenses the most seen in a smartphone and
our most advanced design ever the six
lenses give you crystal-clear images
with no loss of sharpness or quality
when taking pictures with zoom this
picture that portion of the picture
turns into this with that level of
sharpness but what I have found truly
mind-blowing and what really reinvents
zoom is something that goes beyond the
great Hardware beyond the amazing sensor
and optics and lenses and all about it's
actually the new experience we're
delivering on the Lumia 1020 the way you
now will take create shoot and share
photos Christina and you ha let's share
some of that experience thank you okay
first let me take a photo Stephen and
I'm sure you min okay now we have this
really nice photo but actually the
camera captures much more and the
exciting thing is that I can zoom out
after taking the photo the reveal more
same image you took the image now you're
zooming out yes so I can through them
all because it happens so much more
around what you originally zoomed in on
and I can also zoom in somewhere else
yes to tell a different story I can even
see this secret reminder from Christina
he forgot
I have that reminder so maybe this is
the story I don't want to remember but
actually you can do this as many times
as you want without losing any quality
or distracting the original image so
maybe this is the memory I get from this
moment very good thank you
the whole point in the beauty of the
Lumia 1020 is the ability to shoot first
without any worry and then you can go
back and frame and reframe and reshift
the image and tell new stories you can
zoom in you can zoom out you can do any
of these things so I can go back at a
later date and create a new story from
the same image you can discover and
rediscover stories now part of the
zooming is something we call dual
capture I mentioned this earlier on we
capture one image but save two versions
one is a full resolution image for
endless reframing opportunities the
other is the over sampled image that we
save for sharing as a result of these
two images takes a little bit longer to
process the image than with a standard
camera but no other camera can achieve
what we achieve now the Lumia 1020
processes up to 38 million pixels for
your pictures at once up to five times
more than leading competitive smart
phones and with this type of technology
some of the age-old riddles of the
universe can be solved you can literally
find a needle in a haystack here we have
a haystack Christina yes I actually
travel to a small farm in Norway are we
in Finland and I went to a supermarket
and bought a needle and decided to try
out this camera and here you go you
could have a look can you find everyone
see the needle somewhere so I can try
zooming in individual straws here it's
not there
we could spend quite a lot of time here
so I will save save the time here and
tell you that it's actually right I'll
keep going keep going keep going keep
going keep going look at that the eye of
the needle in the haystack
with the Lumia 1020 fantastic you can
tell we had a lot of fun doing this type
of preparation and of course the point
here is that you can see things you've
never seen before with clear images and
incredible zooming now we've made this
really easy to accomplish using a new
camera application for the Lumia 1020
called Nokia pro camera Nokia pro camera
has an easy to follow tutorial that
teaches anyone how to use it including
some more advanced features you are and
Christina let's demonstrate how this new
camera application actually works now
what we're doing is setting up some
flowers on the stage Yuhas getting close
you can see him getting into position
right out of the box you ha can take a
great picture without messing around
with any pictures or without it with any
settings so right there just take an
image there seems to be some strange
creature in the middle of that flower
we'll come back to her in a second now
what there is with this camera
application is really easy access to
changing all of the camera controls for
example exposure values shutter x ISO
settings manual focus and white balance
it will make your photos and videos come
to life with that added sparkle that you
normally only see when a professional
has been involved and it's super easy to
use
so what you Hutt's gonna do here is play
around a little bit with the exposure
value the viewfinder and this is really
cool gives you real-time feedback as to
what your picture is actually going to
look like with whatever the settings are
that you've selected for example you ha
can decide to underexpose or overexpose
by using the different exposure values
he can bring all of the controls out at
once if you'd like to do that get all of
these controls in place work with all of
them the ones that he adjusts are manual
the rest stay auto so he gets the best
combination of capabilities now we even
have manual focus which leads to all
sorts of great experiences so right here
you ha can manually focus in on that
creature in the middle of the flower and
at the same time is able to
shifting the focal point you'll notice
that I'm blurry in the background until
I'm in focus and the flowers nicely
framed me always a good picture
excellent thank you you are now one more
really cool thing is our ability to do
things with manual exposure settings
playing with the exposure settings
allows you to create some really really
interesting shots whether you're doing
something with a shoot super short
exposure time or a very long exposure
time now we want to try this out for you
right now so we've got a Lumia 1020 set
up on the edge of the stage and I hope
Christina does not fall backwards yeah
okay I'll get that we're gonna do a
little demo and this time we're going to
do a long exposure time well that
Christina get in place
and we didn't practice this at all
before today okay so if I could ask the
team to turn the lights off and all of
you in the audience please no flash
photography because we want to do
something that works best in the dark
and let me get focus here okay I'm gonna
say one two three go we're taking a four
second exposure picture right now after
the picture is taken there's special
processing that goes on that actually
isn't that amazing Lumia 1020 is shining
in the dark we've had a lot of fun with
long exposure times now when you're
creating videos of course the image
quality of the video is really important
but we have also added to the Lumia 1020
rich audio recording what we're about to
show you is a video that was captured of
our head of sound design who also
moonlights as a disc jockey listen for
the distortion free high volume audio
when he Peaks the volume levels listen
to this
so that was just using the 1020 in that
room with that loud audio beautiful
audio experience stored along with that
video now we have packed a lot of great
experiences into the Lumia 1020 to help
you take and share better pictures and
videos along with exclusive imaging apps
like Nokia smart camera creative studio
panorama and photo Beamer which now
supports HD quality sharing the Lumia
1020 has become the most versatile
smartphone out there now because the
Lumia 1020 is built on the Windows Phone
8 platform you can easily share images
you can showcase images right on your
home screen you can share your images
very quickly by posting them out of your
people hub you can save the images on
Microsoft SkyDrive or the AT&amp;amp;T
environment all of those things are
possible the Lumia 1020 offers all of
the great features expected from all
Lumia devices things like free nokia
music free here maps and drive and
access to the now more than 165 thousand
applications available in the Windows
Phone environment now of course we are
also bringing everything that here has
to offer to the Lumia 1020 and this week
we announced a new version of here maps
with an amazing augmented reality
experience thanks to our live site
technology Christina let's get a quick
demo of that yes I have a new here maps
right here and it lets you do more human
interaction so I can search for flowers
in New York to get those and I will then
get a view here of places where I can go
and have a look at flowers but I want to
show live sites so we were first to
bring a location-based augmented reality
to smartphones and I'm now going to see
what's around me right in the viewfinder
so I can pan around like this and
at what flower shops I have around me
there's quite a lot and now what is new
is I can pause this viewfinder to
comfortably look at what I have here so
here I can pan around like this and then
I can zoom in to see what's further away
and also if I'm happy with this but I am
curing curious for some other
information I can do a new search right
in the same view so now I'm looking for
coffee instead in the same same you as
you can say as you can see and this is
not all then you can click on the coffee
place that you want to go to and you can
get the directions to get there and of
course as usual this works completely
offline so you don't need any data
connection to do this which our AT&amp;amp;T
partners are not so happy about with it
nonetheless I'm pleased to announce that
all of our here experiences are coming
to all Windows Phone 8 Lumia devices now
we have as you've seen lots of great
innovation within Nokia but we aren't
the only ones pushing imaging innovation
we are inviting developers to create
unique and engaging applications that
push the boundaries of mobile imaging so
people can share and tell more stories
with the Lumia 1020 powered by Windows
Phone 8 the Windows Phone imaging api's
in the platform already let developers
produce high quality images to
complement these api's I'm pleased to
announce the new Nokia imaging software
development kit this is developed by our
own imaging experts the software
development kit is designed to do a lot
of heavy lifting for you using this
developers can manipulate pictures
including filtering resizing cropping
and rotation now we have some examples
of developers who've had a chance to
work with this this technology for the
last couple of months who are already
building new applications for the Lumia
1020 this includes CNN they're bringing
high resolution zoom to their eye
reporter
occasion by clone have also got on board
for their video sharing platform we will
see new imaging innovation coming from
Yelp and Foursquare
in addition to these great partners I'm
excited to announce a new application
from pathe pathe is a popular private
messaging and photo sharing app and now
they will introduce new features like
filters and high resolution photo
sharing to the Lumia 1020 Flipboard is
building beautifully designed
experiences filled with rich imagery
that will look great on the Lumia 920 or
1020 we also will have a David Hockney
inspired application called pantograph
will have a new photo book app called
snap cam and I'm really delighted that
Hipstamatic will have an exclusive
application for the Lumia 1020 they will
launch their Auto Pro app with the Lumia
1020 with Hipstamatic people can upload
pictures to other social networks like
Facebook Twitter and yes also to
Instagram let's take a quick look at a
demo of oval pro yes so you see they a
go pro view finder there is that very
sensitive leveling indicator so you can
compose your shot you can set the focus
like that you can move that around and
then what I am really excited about is
that here we have the high resolution
zoom so you can just slide in and focus
again to get a really nice shot also we
have indicators here for creative
control but taking an image is is really
easy so I just click there and then I
can go into the library to look at my
auto pro photos and I can click on the
photos that I want to view I can get
more information then I can share to all
go to Facebook Instagram and Twitter
and ogle Pro comes with some really nice
features they are called Len
and films there are hundreds of
combinations that you can do to do
really creative photos that are easy to
share thank you thank you Christina now
we look forward to seeing more great
applications built around the Lumia 1020
in the very near future developers can
begin to start downloading the software
development kit from the Nokia
developers site today now in addition to
developer partners we also are working
with hardware partners like monster and
JBL and even retailers for wireless
charging we're building on our Nokia
gear investment with the Lumia 1020 we
will have a snap-on wireless charging
shell for the Lumia 1020 and for those
looking for the next step in photography
building on the Lumia 2010 20 I'd like
to introduce the Nokia camera grip
you've got a little sneak of this when
we were using the tripod this snap-on
cover provides an ergonomic grip for
one-handed shooting it also has two
steps shutter control for increased
control it has a tripod mount on it and
it adds an extra 1000 and 20 milliamp
hour battery built into that shell very
cool
thank you you ha thank you Christina and
thank you to you and all of the teams at
Nokia for bringing this passion
commitment to a wonderful product thank
you very much
now a few comments about availability we
will be bringing the Lumia 1020 to
people very soon here in the United
States we plan to bring the Lumia 1020
to people first with AT&amp;amp;T AT&amp;amp;T has been
a remarkably important partner for us at
Nokia we are incredibly thankful to the
entire AT&amp;amp;T team but we're also thankful
to the head of AT&amp;amp;T Wireless mr. ralph
de la vega who agreed to join us on
stage here today Ralph
welcome great to be here Steven great to
be here you guys have seen this device
right absolutely absolutely a great shot
when we first started working on this
project a while back we had challenged
Steven to figure out how you can get
that 41 megapixel camera to are a great
form factor and I think they have
delivered beyond everyone X but thinking
you said we need to thin down a little
bit yes is it and you and the entire
Nokia team scientists and engineers have
exceeded every one of our expectations
you know when I've been using this phone
for the last several weeks and I show
the pictures to people I get one word
all the time and it's wow when they see
the pictures what they say is Wow
you have to be proud I'm very proud of
this relationship and we look forward to
selling a bunch of these I do two years
but truly when when you look at this
device I think what it does is it sets a
new standard a higher bar for the
industry when it comes to photographer
and I have never seen resolution as good
as this what I like about it is it
changes the way you think about zooming
it used to be that I would zoom to take
a picture before now I assume after I
take a pixel with a Nokia Lumia 1020 so
you know AT&amp;amp;T is super excited to be
able to be the exclusive US carrier for
the Lumia 1020 because when you have a
device that is so powerful you're going
to want to have the most powerful
Network along with it and recently PC
Magazine named eight
as having America's fastest 4G LTE
network ranked number one across all six
regions that they tested but it wasn't
just see a pc magazine pc world did a
similar test they conducted a test in 20
markets and found that AT&amp;amp;T 4G LTE
delivered a faster upload and a faster
download than any of our competitors so
the Lumia 1020 is perfect for the AT&amp;amp;T
network and so you're gonna get the best
Windows Phone that's ever been made can
we show that the audience a bit of fun
we had with it just a few minutes check
it out this is something called
cinemagraph that's been updated for the
Lumia 1020 this is a still image where
we're able to select motion that we want
to capture start as an animated gif and
is shareable roughen had a bit of fun
earlier today this is something i've
never seen a phone do before that's when
we show it to people the amazing
response is almost always while which is
what a marketing organization wants to
hear but imagine this you really have
what I think is the best Windows Phone
ever with the best smartphone smartphone
camera ever on the fastest 4G LTE
network in the US of A so that is a
great combination you know we have been
working with Nokia for over 15 years and
we're proud that milestone arthur miles
that we have launched incredible
products i think this is one of the best
ones that we have ever done and i'm
proud to tell you that today
AT&amp;amp;T sells more windows phones than any
other carrier and we expect the Lumia
1020 to be a very popular addition to
that liner so I'm sure you're going to
be wondering at this time okay when can
I get my hands on this device well today
I'm proud to tell you that the Nokia
Lumia 1020 will be available in a retail
store starting July 26 for to $99.99
with a two-year agreement and so in
addition to that you can actually start
pre-ordering the device on AT&amp;amp;T com
beginning on July 16th and again to
close I want to thank Stephen and the
entire Nokia
for bringing out what I think is just a
breakthrough device and a breakthrough
in photography
thank you for letting us be a part of it
thank you take care Thanks following on
from the US debut we will bring the
Nokia Lumia 1020 to markets around the
world starting this quarter the Nokia
Lumia 1020 is expected to arrive this
quarter in China and key European
markets we will also ship an exclusive
variant of the device with Telefonica to
selected European and Latin American
markets the Nokia Lumia 1020 will be
available in yellow white and black the
Nokia camera grip that you ha showed you
a few moments ago will also be available
at the same time it will be available
for $79 well with the Lumia 1020 as
we've shown you today you will get
closer than ever before you will see
things you've never seen before and
you'll discover and rediscover new
stories all of which will bring more
meaning to your images at Nokia we are
all looking forward to bringing people
the next chapter in smartphone imaging
thank you very much thank you
we actually I'm going to invite
Christina and you Han back on stage we
have time for some questions from the
members of the press that have joined us
here today thank you for making the trip
for many of you from around the world we
have guests with paddles and if you have
a question if you could please raise
your hand and we will bring a paddle and
a microphone to you okay it looks like
we have one here with number four I lost
different b-tree it's probably gonna be
a bit thick but could you explain a bit
more about how the over sampling
technology works this is why they're on
stage so in high-level it means that you
take up to seven pixels from the center
and when you combine all those pixels
you create so-called super pixels it has
much much more information than the
individual pixels in the image Center so
that's the key to have really low noise
sharp images and also it helps in the
kind of color processing which is going
to kind of quite a lot of details but
that's kind of high level
hey-ya a very cool white paper available
it's quite long but intimate detail
intricate detail on all of the
capabilities that we described today for
technologists and the white paper is
available on the press site number one
please
Arthur gold star from gadget in South
Africa Africa and India are souls from
holes who are not here and really have
backed the trends for a while does this
camera meet the needs of those kind of
markets developing world markets and in
what way would it appeal to those
markets so two parts to that in every
market around the world we see the
leading technology more and more
becoming popular and so for Cameron
thews iasts and just for smartphone
lovers who want to take a great or have
a great imaging experience it clearly
appeals to those people at the same time
let me describe an important aspect of
Nokia strategy clearly the Lumia 1020 is
a flagship device where the most
advanced capabilities are really pushed
to their maximum at the same time what
our engineers do is identify how
elements of that technology and
innovation can be scaled down or brought
down to lower price points so we lead
with the flagship but then what you
should expect to see is elements of
these types of capabilities be it in
software the algorithms or the hardware
brought down to lower price points so we
can get more people who are more price
sensitive perhaps to take advantage of
some of these capabilities number six
please could you give us a sense of how
Nokia and AT&amp;amp;T will promote market and
advertise the product at launch and if
you could if AT&amp;amp;T could tell me if on
July 26 the product will also be
available through its indirect channels
so first of all as it relates to the
promotion effort we've worked for some
number of months to plan this jointly
with AT&amp;amp;T you will see AT&amp;amp;T Microsoft
and Nokia pool its resources for a
consistent campaign that really focuses
on the breakthrough capabilities of the
devices you will see in-store promotion
you'll see advanced training of the
sales representatives and AT&amp;amp;T stores
you'll see a really really big push
towards this and in terms of indirect
channels I suspect it will be going into
indirect channels it tends to start
immediately in the stores and then
quickly thereafter end up in the
indirect channels as well and it
we'll be going to indirect channels I'm
getting the nod from our team here
number five please
hi Ellis from Wireless lab come you were
talking about an special version of the
of the Lumia 1020 for telefónica can
you talk about that so we don't want to
steal too much thunder from telefónica
they'll be making an announcement of
their own that will share a bit more
details on what we've done uniquely for
them an arab newspaper my first question
is when it's going to be launched in the
Middle East and the second question how
yeah other than the camera what other
features do you have which will compete
with iphone 5 samsung phone other than
the camera yes so your first question in
this quarter we're expecting the device
to be in select European markets China
the United States and then through the
end of the year you'll see it broaden
out into various markets including
certain markets in the Middle East in
terms of the overall differentiation of
a product like the Lumia 1020 clearly
the camera the audio all of those
capabilities are a dominant feature in
this device but at the same time of
course it's built on Windows Phone 8 in
terms of having a much better and more
engaging live experience it begins with
Windows Phone 8 but many of the other
capabilities that we celebrated with the
Lumia 920 for example are here as well
for example the the screen technology
which allows you to see your pictures or
whatever you're doing even in the
brightest of sunlight the fact that you
can control the screen while you are
wearing a glove or just with the ends of
your fingernails wireless charging
through the attachment shell and a
variety of other things that makes this
a complete and competitive device
relative to the competitors but goes one
big step further because of the imaging
technology thank you let's take a
question from the back number 3 IP
paschal with Mashable why did you choose
not to build wireless charging 2
into the device so we had a number of
discussions with consumers in terms of
how they thought about that we were also
very interested in making sure that the
thinness of the device was as tight as
it could be Ralph made the comment that
were packing a lot in there so we had to
balance that constraint so we're trying
different things we're totally committed
to wireless charging and you'll see it
in different configurations both in
board and as an attachment in devices in
the future as well so something we're
working with number six please joan
lapin forbes.com over the last interval
since you introduced the nokia the lumia
in new york AT&amp;amp;T has really been a
dreadful partner if you went in I bought
one I owned one it's sitting here in my
purse and I love it but the reality is
if you went into the store most of the
sales people knew nothing about it
there was no signage and if you asked
about it they really didn't promote it
so what have you done to make sure that
this terrific phone doesn't get the same
crummy treatment from AT&amp;amp;T that you've
had in the past that has curtailed your
sales so first of all let me I'm gonna
generalize this to a fundamental
challenge that Nokia faces and it's a
challenge that Nokia homes not AT&amp;amp;T and
that is we made the bold decision to not
try and just create another set of
phones using a common operating system
that so many others have pursued we said
we are going to create the third
ecosystem and with that decision came
tremendous responsibility to actually
help whether it's a retail sales
associate and operator partner consumers
the press everyone to understand what
that third alternative stands for and we
stand by that decision because if you
look at the market today you can see two
big competitors we used to talk about
Android as a competitor we now talk
about a hardware company as the
competitor that whole dynamic has
changed and yet our growth our growth
and market share the success we're
building on day
by day is coming because we made that
bold choice but the price that we take
on for doing that is that yes we have to
we Nokia have to train those sales
associates we have to work with AT&amp;amp;T to
get the best signage what you'll see
with the launch of the Lumia 1020 is
something that will be far better than
we've done ever before with AT&amp;amp;T but it
won't be as good as what we do with the
next major launch later this year and on
and on and on so there's a lot of work
required to push through with that third
ecosystem and we are so pleased with the
effort that the AT&amp;amp;T team have put
behind this it's hard work for all of us
and I know we have tough moments but boy
we're very pleased that they're
committed and standing behind us every
step of the way as we grow with them so
thank you for your questions and for
joining us today before we leave I
wanted to share a perspective from a
famous American photographer a man by
the name of Ansel Adams
he said the single most important
component of a camera is the 12 inches
behind the camera in other words it's
all of you you the photographer you are
each the most important part of the
Lumia 1020 so now we want to encourage
you to explore this new world this new
way of taking pictures please join me
walk through create some new memories
with the Lumia 1020 thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
