a big dose of buttons a big chin and big
sales let's drive the 2011 Acura MDX and
check the tech this 2nd generation of
MDX has been around now since 2007 but
one of the latest tweaks is Acuras
so-called power plenum face people
either love it or hate it
this is also Acuras largest product and
it out sells there are two other light
trucks the RDX and the ZDX
combined by almost 3x let's find out why
one thing out of hand acura they're
stubborn as hell about keeping the
buttons in the dash they've been getting
a bloody nose about this for years and
they're still doing it this is the most
button crazy center stack in auto de mad
that to the wheel and a few other
various and sundry buttons here and here
and here and this is your favorite if ya
like to drive a busy box here's where it
gets a little nutty
you got this forest of controls around
two optical drives this one here
apparently is your audio only six slot
CD changer this one down here is my DVD
place for DVD audio or video can't put
every disc in every slot though you see
we have the Els surround system that's
the high end sound on this guy we'll get
to that in a minute
you got another band of buttons here
that are the unfortunate result of
having rear seat entertainment which I
don't like in this car or most cars
these days complicated thing of whether
it's on or not whether it has control
back there or not what the source is
yikes in here oh yeah there it is I've
got a little pigtail for a USB dealy
that'll hook up to either a thumb drive
or to a ipod you can use that either way
the firmware is there now whenever you
do fit into these slots win and if you
figure out what goes where should sound
really good this Els audio is very nice
it's a 410 Watts something like 15
speakers around the cabin
of them of course a nice hearty sub and
you've got lots of decoders and
synthetics around you've got Dolby PL -
you've got DTS digital surround decoders
and you have the grace note database
that pulls up information about most
discs you stick in here now the reason I
don't like the back seat entertainment
is because it's antiquated so I turn
that guy on right here it's going to
come down and I'm going to end up with
that thing pretty much cutting off part
of my rear view mirror plus people in
the back seat have to share a single
display and even when they do that they
got to kind of can't their head to the
middle of a car which isn't the most
comfortable thing in the world so I'm
not a fan of these in any way shape or
form Oh interesting feature on the XM
satellite radio which this vehicle comes
with you've got a pause and store
function it'll freeze and do a snapshot
of the metadata of what you're listening
to on XM at that moment and also store a
ten-second snapshot it's like a little
audio notebook of a piece of music you
want to go back to and buy or download
or something now some of your controls
up here are not P electronics but are
electromechanical the drive controls
your shifter goes to a one choice only
six-speed Automatic sport mode all the
way back no slapstick there drive dead
forward paddles are engaged up here
downshift left up shift right and of
course we've got a backup camera and a
vehicle in this class and as you can see
I've got my distance markers yellow
lines there I've also got my curb feeler
lines and if I push the center button
here I get a top-down view if I want or
the standard back view or a wide view
alright mbx one engine on this guy 3.7
liter v6 it's the biggest of the v6
family for these guys 300 horsepower 270
foot-pounds of torque
zero to 60 s reported around 7.1 seconds
not bad for a vehicle that weighs 4550
but the mpg is kind of a hoggish 1621
that means you'll never see 20 expect
like 18 day in and day out little dicey
at 450 a gallon and the emissions are
nothing to write home about either you
will not drive this to your Sierra Club
meaning it gets a five and a three on
co2 in greenhouse with the advance
package we have adaptive cruise control
set the speed and the follow distance
and the car takes over you also get the
collision mitigating braking system
which is designed to cramp on the
binders and save you from rear-ending
someone if you're not paying attention
it does seem to work well though it's
calibrated to jump in really at the
absolute last minute unlike say a Volvo
with similar technology the blind spot
detectors are calibrated just about
right I think neither / nor under
warning of someone back there but the
car leaves it to you not to veer in
their path there is no Lane steering
technology okay what's this guy like on
the road well here's the key - I think
the MDX is got some enduring popularity
it doesn't feel as big as it is that's
the number one impression you get from
driving this guy the engine never feels
like it's laboring to move this forty
five hundred and fifty pound beast I
mean there are plenty of large vehicles
and SUVs out there that move well but
you can tell the engine has to be really
impressive to do that that's different
than a vehicle that doesn't feel bloated
and heavy to begin with even when it is
this again 4,600 pounds is no slouch now
super handling all-wheel drive is a
little controversy on this vehicle among
car buffs who think it's a little bit
like pearls before swine because
something this big with three rows and
all this weight and height does it
really need a performance-oriented
all-wheel drive system like sh-awd is
probably not is that great sales and
marketing and moving folks vertically
through the Acura
product portfolio probably so but if
you're out sport driving with 3 rows
full of spouse and kids you need a
second car not super handling all-wheel
drive in your SUV while I was
underwhelmed by the prospect of the MDX
as a sports car I should point out that
my colleagues thought the combination of
super handling all-wheel drive and
adaptive suspension made it a great one
in its class to each his own ok let's
press our MDX not a cheap ride 43 for
base that includes a little bit of tech
but not much it'll have the super
handling all-wheel drive the Bluetooth
hands-free power liftgate in the rear
obviously the one choice 6-speed auto
but to get all the tech I showed you
there's really one simple way to go get
the advanced package and swallow hard
it's ninety six hundred and twenty-five
bucks but it rolls in a ton of tech all
the toys that we talked about and got
excited about the thing I would not do
is get the rear seat entertainment
system that'll save you nineteen hundred
more and all you get up is that kind of
stale drop-down DVD system the one
fifteen outlet in the console and heated
second row seats so that's my formula to
take this guy CNET style
