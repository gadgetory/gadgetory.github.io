first ever virtual reality prize fight
where the rules have changed and
anything is possible this surprise five
punch-out between oculus rift and the
HTC vive your prize fight judges are
senior editor Scott Stein senior editor
Sean Hollister and you know who really
guns Inc Tom we'll pick a winner each
round in this five round showdown first
round is immersion put on either riff
survive and you're instantly taken away
to new worlds and environments it's
glorious now you'll never get VR until
you actually get inside a VR experience
they both look great and sound great but
you won't really be able to call out any
significant visual differences that
favor one or the other what makes the
vive more immersive right now is that
you can freely walk around in VR by
walking around your actual living room
that's important the vibes current
controllers allow you to interact more
naturally in VR space with two Wiimote
like wands that allow you to grab things
compared to being tied down to the rifts
Xbox one controller that really limits
the impact and feels more like your
plane and Xbox game with goggles the
judges agree round one goes to the vibe
next up is comfort if you're wearing a
headset it needs to feel good and there
are differences between these two
contenders the oculus rift just feels
better because it's lighter in weight
you're tethered by a single cord and
flip-down headphones are built into the
design so it's a very self-contained
piece the HTC vive is larger in size and
awkwardly just front heavy it's not a
deal-breaker but you can tell the
difference when you're comparing the two
the vibes three piece cable setup can
also get more tangled and then putting
on separate headphones on top of the
headset plus battling those head straps
means it just isn't as comfortable as
the rift oculus takes around to next
round is the interaction
this one's pretty much a no-brainer
it's the briefs Xbox game controller
versus the vibes one light controlled
that let you grab and interact with
things instead of pressing buttons on a
gamepad the vibe allows you to act more
naturally and this is the biggest
difference between these two platforms
right now see oculus is working on
something better with their touch
controls it's a whole different ballgame
I've used them and they're really as
close to reality as you can get but they
aren't available until the second half
of 2016 the HTC vive takes around three
next round is set up new groundbreaking
experiences cost money now we're
including set up because it really makes
a difference and you need to know what
to expect when you're jumping into VR
now no matter what you'll need a PC
that's capable of running either of
these systems and you're talking about a
minimum $1500 investment just for an
entry-level oculus rift bundle that
includes the $5.99 headset in that price
and can easily hit over $3,000 for
higher-end pcs now the ACC vive setup is
sold for $7.99 that's $200 more than the
rift so we're talking about a starting
price with a PC around eighteen hundred
dollars that can soar up to several
thousand more depending on your PC now
once we get pricing out of the way the
set up is a completely different beast
between rift and vive the oculus rift is
one cable a simple sensor and a headset
it's not a plug and play experience for
your general consumer but it only takes
a few fairly simple steps to get you up
and running the HTC vive let's just say
patience is a virtue
there's cables galore and that's not the
scary part the vibe requires two laser
boxes that need to be installed and
paired with each other they'll need to
be up on tripods or high bookshelves and
have a clear view of your entire room
you'll need space to play so that means
moving your furniture around as well
just to get all the hardware situated
it's easily a half-hour setup you might
need to recalibrate them and even when
you want to jump in the next day after
it's been set up you'll need to plug in
multiple things to get synched up before
you start VR is anything but plug and
play but the vibe it takes the cake for
the longest setup time for any tech
gadget that I've ever seen the oculus
rift easily
takes round four we're even at two
rounds of peace the final round that
decides it all is ecosystem the oculus
rift knows exactly what it wants and it
launches with 30 games but you'll need
to stay in the oculus ecosystem to enjoy
them eval curry is an amazing spaceship
shooter and Lucky's tale gives you a
real sense of how a platformer in VR
plays there's a way for the rift to
access themes via our library but not
all games are compatible and it can be a
pain to sort through what works and what
doesn't now the HTC vive launched with
50 games and works directly with steam
giving it a larger library of content
and more open platform for developers
some of the games are already on the PC
and there are some fun ones but at times
it feels more like tech demos and
experiences and really not full fledged
games it also brings steam staples like
messaging a friends list and voice chat
that really makes it a more social
platform out of the box we know it's
only going to get better for both sides
I personally prefer the oculus library
but the judges agree that the steam
platform and its ecosystem gets the
slight edge this time so in a
back-and-forth prize fight the ACC vibe
ends up taking three of the five rounds
and excels at two of the most important
categories immersion and interaction
making it your prize fight winner but
don't hold your breath because that
could easily change by the end of the
year virtual reality is so fresh and new
and it's just scratching the surface but
it's hard for me to tell someone to go
out and invest in a setup right now
myself
I'll be waiting it out virtual reality
is the future it will be part of our
future and the future is now i'm brian
tong thanks for watching and we'll catch
you all next time for another prize
