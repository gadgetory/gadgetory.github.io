much the exact same as the regular Essex
except that it is on steroids and plated
in armor I'm jessica's all court for CNN
i'm going to show you what's different
about this phone first of all we do have
this thick plastic rim around the edge
and these physical buttons on the bottom
and on the sides they play a really
important role in keeping this phone
sturdy there's no glass there's no metal
it is just plastic and it's supposed to
be the phone does feel pretty grippy
because it's got these indentations all
along the rim and there's texturing on
all of the buttons which are very
responsive I really like using them I
think they're kind of fun even if you
don't live an active lifestyle whatever
that means unlike the s6 be active is
waterproof for 30 minutes and up to
three feet of water is also dust
resistant and it is resistant to drops
for up to 4 feet but I wouldn't
recommend trying it out on purpose it's
nice that there's no flap over the
charging port in this version unlike
previous versions there is also wireless
charging included just like in the s6
see this bright blue button here on the
side this is the convenience key that
launches the activity tracker you press
it once to get to the activities own app
that has weather or stopwatch as health
for your pedometer flashlight a whole
bunch of other things or you can long
press it to pull up another app in this
case I've got music because I like to
listen to music when I run but the
beauty of both of these functions is
that you can program pretty much any app
to watch and just remember you can still
double tap on the home button to launch
the camera there's also a bigger battery
on the s6 active than with the normal s6
but otherwise the specs are pretty much
the same you've got your 5.1 inch screen
with a monster resolution 16 megapixel
camera on the back 5 megapixel camera on
the front and an android 5.1 side the
phone does feel grippy in my hand it's a
little bit wider than the regular s6
there are these little rivet looking
things on the back but they're purely
for decoration this is an embedded
device so you can't pop anything off the
back cover there are definitely some
features on here that would help you out
if you are active but i think that the
s6 active is a really fun high-end phone
to use no matter what your lifestyle I'm
