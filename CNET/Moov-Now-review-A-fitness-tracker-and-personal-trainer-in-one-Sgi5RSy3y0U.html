there but very few of them offer
real-time coaching and feedback aimed at
getting beginners in shape that's where
the $100 move now comes in this little
device can help make you a better runner
a faster cyclist a more efficient
swimmer and help you lose weight on top
of all that it measures your sleep at
night
calories burned and active minutes
although as a fitness tracker it's
definitely not on the same level as a
Fitbit or a jawbone the move excels when
it comes to teaching you exercises the
Android and iOS app includes for
coaching activities there's one for
running and walking another for cycling
one for swimming and one for at-home
coaching which includes interval
workouts you can do without weights and
my personal favorite a boxing workout
the only downside is with this workout
you need to purchase a second device but
all of the others work with just one but
rather than keep talking about the move
now I figured I should just show you
on the ground keep it up fork
awesome job
for a guy who's in shape at least I
believe I'm in shape it's a it's pretty
difficult I'm sweating i'm saucin who
for $100 or even $200 to the boxing you
can get your cardio you can get your
strength especially if you don't have a
gym membership that's such an easy way
to workout I can definitely feel my arms
are sore from it but I I don't know if
it would appeal to me as an experienced
athlete if you're like my parents or
you're someone who doesn't know what to
do at the gym this is a good tracker for
you it's got some quirks but it will get
the job done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
