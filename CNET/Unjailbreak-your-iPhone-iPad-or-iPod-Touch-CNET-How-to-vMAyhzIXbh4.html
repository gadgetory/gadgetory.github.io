realize that the underground world of
cydia isn't really a cup of tea or maybe
you're thinking about jailbreaking your
iphone ipad or ipod but first you want
to know how easy it is to revert back to
iOS the good news is that unjailbroken
is as easy as restoring your device from
a previous backup and you don't have to
lose your data in the process it's a
good thing too because if you ever need
to go to the Genius Bar you have to undo
a break first
I talked into KISS Boston from the
chronic dev team about this and here's
what he suggested first sinker
jailbroken idevice with iTunes to backup
all of your data or if you only sync to
iCloud make sure to force a sync by
going to settings iCloud storage and
backup and backup now either way it can
take a few minutes to complete the
syncing process when the backup is done
and your device is connected to iTunes
click on its name and hit restore now
iTunes will restore your phone or iPad
or iPod to factory settings when it's
done rebooting your device will look
like it's brand new so go ahead and
start setting it up that way when you
get to this screen choose whichever
method you use to backup in this case
I'll connect to itunes again pick the
backup I just made and hit continue in a
few minutes the device will restart one
more time and when it's done everything
will be back to normal without Cydia or
any obvious traces that you once broke
it out of jail if you have any questions
