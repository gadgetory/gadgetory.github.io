Lowensohn staff writer for cnet this is
your first day of freedom probably in
the last month or so josh has been
covering the apple vs samsung trial and
of course we just had a verdict on
friday what's the fallout so far well so
far samsung example about a billion
dollars oh there's that it's better than
2.5 yeah exactly it's a far cry from how
much Apple want it but it's also kind of
up in the air about when they have to
pay that there's still a lot of things
that are still up in the air and moving
around so we don't have a definitive
date on that yet and and it seems to me
that the prevailing wisdom says that
they're not going to end up having to
pay that 1 billion-plus that in the
appeal process perhaps the damages will
be cut down correct a lot of those
things are still kind of flowing and
samsung cell as an opportunity to change
some of those products to really keep
them from infringing mm-hmm and Samsung
is going to appeal right definitely yeah
they've already said they're gonna
appeal I just haven't filed it yeah
correct and that again that's still a
process that's going to happen the next
few weeks in the immediate the immediate
effects of this on samsung how's the
house their stock doing their stock took
a tumble this morning a pretty big
tumble at seven percent but again I mean
a big deal about this trial is the
really long term effects and how they
have to change their products and if
they change their products but Apple
their stock kind of went up didn't it
yeah they're nearing an all-time high
but a lot of that is actually just kind
of people expecting a new phone and I
new tablet in the coming weeks of course
yeah it's hard to separate those two
things out all right so you were in the
courtroom there were no cameras allowed
in there so tell us what the mood was
like cuz you can only tell so much from
a courtroom sketch yeah I mean a lot of
it was just quiet expectation obviously
been kind of a rowdy quarter in the last
few few days with people got rowdy it
did get a little rowdy people were just
kind of getting tired of this long
three-week four-week trial so a ton of
the the verdict was a not so it was just
basically pins and needles and the
reactions that you saw from the lawyers
a both defense side and plaintiff side I
mean it was really interesting because
for samsung losing pretty epically in
fact the lawyers didn't seem to look all
that concern it was kind of
isine Apple was clearly kind of excited
about it but both sides were getting
paid either way so I don't know anything
there was a lot of care and the billion
dollars is not coming from the pockets
of those lawyers correct correct now
2014 this all happens all over again I
mean different set of patents but kind
of a similar situation right tell us
about that right so there's other case
it's not really going to trial for
another two years and that's that's
about some of the newer devices so you
have things like the the Galaxy Nexus
this device it's still on sale whereas
some of the devices that were in this
trial that just wrapped up we're kind of
old or from 2010 early 2011 and you'll
be covering that one yeah and let's do
it yeah well thanks so much for being
our eyes and ears in the courtroom we
couldn't have covered the case without
you my pleasure Josh Lowensohn staff
writer for cnet and I'm Sumi das thanks
