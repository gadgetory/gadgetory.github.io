looking at the new Moto X a year ago the
Moto X came out and it was an affordably
priced and well featured phone plus you
could talk directly to it without having
to touch anything the new Moto X is
ninety nine dollars on contract but it's
499 off contract so it's really
affordable compared to other phones but
it keeps a premium feel it has new backs
on it now moto customization features
before have included different colors
and would their new woods and even
leather back options now there are also
new software features motive voice can
be customized to your particular voice
commands and triggers so you can say
okay Jets got and it'll start listening
to me or whatever you want to put into
it there's a new one tap notification
system that shows display at a glance
your messages your calendar appointments
and there's also a Snapdragon 2.5
gigahertz processor in here a 5.2 inch
1080p oled display and the camera has
been upgraded to 8 megapixels plus it's
connected to voice commands as well you
could say okay take a selfie when your
camera mode and it'll do that the new
Moto X has a 13 megapixel rear camera 2
megapixel front camera and 4k UHD video
recording the Moto X runs pure Android
and it is guaranteed for upgrade for
Android L so you've got that same clean
interface as before plus Moto's own
suite of voice commands and apps like
the glance and voice and car assistance
the Moto X comes in 16 or 32 gigabyte
storage capacities and promises 24 hours
of battery life but if you want even
more Motorola selling a power pack micro
that works with any phone actually it's
a quick charge battery that gives eight
hours of power plus it has an ability to
find your lost phone to a motorola
connect at the new Moto X still feels
really nice to hold they didn't go super
large with the screen 5.2 is not a huge
leap in screen size but it feels good
stove and it is probably one of the
coolest back designs that I've seen on
the phone recently the new Moto X is
going to be available soon and it will
be compatible with the moto hint
bluetooth headset that'll work with
those voice commands I'm Scott Stein and
that's a quick look at the new Moto X
for motor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
