phone that you won't see in the US right
now it's called the Samsung Galaxy round
now it looks a lot like maybe the note 3
or other large screen Samsung Android
phones but it has a curved screen you
can see for yourself here it's not
tremendously curved but it's like a
gentle horizontal curve here then the
galaxy round has been talked about a lot
and it's available in South Korea in
this limited edition with black stitched
leather like finish on the back it's a
1080p 5.7 inch OLED display it runs
Android 4.3 and comes with Samsung's
TouchWiz interface as you'd expect and
curved screen technology is kind of
maybe the next big design wave because
OLED can be bent but it's a matter of
does the rest of the chassis or the
glass isn't able to be bent in the same
way
well this display is able to pull it off
and have a gentle curved screen effect
here and actually from views in a little
bit does seem to reflect light a little
bit differently and maybe reduce glare
it also potentially cups your cheek
better or fits your leg better when you
stuff it in your pants the galaxy round
has a 13 megapixel camera 2 megapixel
front camera and 1080p HD video capture
and as far as processors go it's got a
2.3 gigahertz MSM 89 74 quad-core
processor with 32 gigs of internal
storage in the configuration current P
currently being sold with three gigs of
RAM and a 64 gigabyte microSD card slot
that's 64 gigs maximum so it is similar
to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 does the
curved glass make a big difference
we'll have to see and when it will be
available in the US we imagine at some
point we haven't heard anything yet stay
tuned this is just the first look at
this lightweight and curved phone that
has some competition in the LG G flex
which curves as well but it curbs the
other way from back to front
I'm Scott Stein and that's a little look
at the Samsung Galaxy round not yet
available here
the question is what do you want one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
