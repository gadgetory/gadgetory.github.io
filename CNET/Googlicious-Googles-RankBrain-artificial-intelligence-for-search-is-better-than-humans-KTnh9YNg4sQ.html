we're back with your Google Isha's for
everything inside the world of Google
we've been gone for a while between my
vacation and everything else but we're
back and packed with stories now last
week Google's parent company alphabet
announced record revenues and profits
thanks to increased ad sales and a
stronger control and cost resulting in
the stock price going bonkers so now
during their earnings they talked about
their increased investments in machine
learning and artificial intelligence a
Bloomberg report says a very large
fraction of the millions of queries a
second that people like us are searching
for are being interpreted by an AI
system by Google nicknamed rankbrain
15% of all searches it receives have
never been seen before and rankbrain
makes a guess at what words or phrases
might have a similar meaning and filters
the results to make it more effective
and handling these never-before-seen
searches now Google search engineers
were even asked to eyeball some pages
and guess which one they thought Google
Search Engine Tech will rank on top the
humans guessed right 70% of the time
while ranked brain had an 80% success
rate now you guys can check out the
Bloomberg article it's really
interesting stuff and if you're thinking
this out loud the answer is yes you and
I will eventually both be replaced by
machines
now machines are already doing more
things for us and Google's driverless
cars are another example of what's
coming
the goups continues to reiterate that
they aren't looking to make this a
commercial product just yet and that
might have been around 2020 but Larry
burns one of Google's consultants and
GM's former chief technology officer
says Google's tech could be ready in
less than three years now a new patent
published by the US Patent and Trademark
Office revealed a proposed google in-car
tool which uses your own wearable
devices movements to figure out if
you're the driver or the passenger of
the car now people are still driving and
texting or checking the web or a whole
bunch of other distracting dangerous
things but Google system could
theoretically detect who is the driver
and disable certain functions on their
mobile phone or other devices this is
not a real product yet and the idea
behind it is all obviously about say
but it's also sometimes just another
reason for people who aren't buying a
wearable right now to still not buy one
all right tablets are getting bigger and
bigger these days and you know who else
wants in on that Samsung now a Sam
mobile report reveals that Samsung is
working on an 18 point 4 inch tablet
called the Samsung view that can double
up as a mini TV for the streaming age
eighteen point four inches people now
it's reported to have a 1920 by 1080
resolution with a exynos 7580 64-bit
octa-core processor and will launch in
the US with a price tag of $5.99 but no
release date has been given yet there's
also this nifty looking handle on the
backside because it's as big if not
bigger than a briefcase
okay samsung pay is also finally
available to Verizon users in the US
with a galaxy s6 edge edge plus or note
5 after a long period of uncertainty its
main advantage is really the ability to
use it with old magnetic card base
readers as well and ACC released their
latest flagship phone with the HTC One
a9 and I think is pretty obvious what
design they might have borrowed from or
just blatantly copied like seriously HTC
this is just bad but jack tong president
of HTC north asia who has no
relationship to me whatsoever fired back
at critics by saying we're not copying
we made a unibody metal clad phone in
2013 it's Apple that copies us in terms
of antenna design on the back and Jack
makes a point I had the original HTC one
and it was the first unibody metal
design but then you guys had to make
yours look almost exactly like the
iPhone 6 and 6s you weren't tricky to
anyone here and remember ACC had that ad
campaign called here's to change so HTC
stands for new mungus to fall catamaran
great pine teak atom or almost hot team
caterpillar
all this cat
HTC here's to change but now HTC stands
for how to copy and in the most pressing
issues surrounding Android fans are
freaking out after Apple just pushed out
its recent iOS update that supports
Unicode seven and eight and the new
emojis so Hiroshi Locke himer the new
senior VP of Android sent out a tweet
reassuring users that the Android team
is on it after reddit users complain
about them trailing others in the emoji
game there's no date when you'll be
getting the new taco burrito or middle
finger emojis but it might be a few more
months and I know that really hurts some
of you but you have to deal with it and
I know you can make it through this
together all right that's gonna do it
for this week's show you can email us at
Google issues at cnn.com or tweet me at
Brian Tong thanks so much for watching
and we'll see you next time for some
more of that Google issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
