taking some of your email about
high-tech cars and modern driving this
one comes in from Jonathan be invalid
our Germany who says his question is
about the aim of self-driving cars in
general is it really to be safer he says
there will always be other cars that
aren't automated and are being driven by
humans thus exposing the rest of us in
self-driving cars to the same accident
risky reasons now Jonathan it's
interesting question because this is
often seen as an all-or-nothing position
but let's really dig into it here into
this idea of reducing accidents with
self-driving first of all there are the
inter car benefit so this is the area of
cars dealing with each other and I would
posit to you that getting even a fair
amount of self-driving cars on the road
is going to increase our safety even
though we have a lot of humans still
driving around those cars the
self-driving car will see the human
driven car around it as just another
obstacle to be recognized processed and
dealt with with its various machine
reactions now it's not perfect of course
but I don't think we need to get to an
all-or-nothing fleet for self-driving
cars to be extremely safe then there's
also the intra car benefit how
self-driving cars regardless of how they
act with other cars will help us get rid
of the problems we have from drunkenness
distraction and just plain crappy
driving technique that let's face it
plague so many folks who are driving
their cars right now the third area of
benefit is going to be kind of the group
or the hivemind benefit deep in the
future when self-driving cars are
talking to each other are all reporting
in as a group to some kind of central
control within a metropolitan area and
we can really manage the cars out there
as a fleet making sure every car is
doing the right thing in relation to the
roads and the cars and traffic
conditions and flow as opposed to the
kind of willy nilly haphazard driving
and decisions that we make today but
that's well down the road and that
benefits both safety and of course
efficiency</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
