are bragging about blurry photos I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update Google created its own camera app
for Android users to download and one
feature may make it worth downloading
it's called lens blur and it can blur
the background of an image after you've
taken the photo in the app once you take
a photo you're prompted to slowly move
your camera up and that way the app can
calculate the depth of field around your
subject when the photo is saved it
offers the option for a blur effect by
tapping the part that you want to stay
in focus post editing the focus of
photos is a new trend we're seeing in
some smartphone cameras Nokia's Lumia
1020 can do it and so can the new HTC
One m8 which comes with two cameras on
the back to create that effect this new
Google camera app is only available to
some of the newest Android phones with
KitKat 4.4 operating system but Google
says it plans to release it for more
devices in time smart phone cameras are
getting better but some days you may
want to use a real camera and getting
your photos off your camera into your
computer to share on social media can
feel like a bit of a chore that is
unless your camera has Wi-Fi or an SD
card that gives your camera Wi-Fi that's
the magic of i-5 mobi it's a memory card
that automatically transfers your photos
to your computer mobile phone or tablet
and ëifí just introduced a way to sync
and save all your photos online with
ëifí cloud service and you can choose
to share your photos with a link to your
album or just an individual photo
if--like cloud is free for 90 days but
unlimited storage is $50 a year ëifí
Wi-Fi is a bit of a mouthful but here's
a story that's easier to explain it's
about the simpsons fans of The Simpsons
are geeking out over news that there
will be a special Lego episode airing on
May 4th where all the characters will be
Lego fied into the blocky universe Legos
are a lovable childhood toy but what if
our smartphones were more like Legos
that's sort of what Google is working on
with project ara it's a smartphone with
detachable bricks with one piece being
the battery another piece might be the
camera and you would swap out parts to
upgrade or combine different parts of
various sizes so if a battery is more
important to you maybe it'll be larger
and take up two slots and your memory
would just take up a smaller slot Google
announced it wants this phone to go on
sale in January of next year for around
$50 that's your tech news update you can
head to cnet.com for more details on
these stories and be sure to follow
along on twitter from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
