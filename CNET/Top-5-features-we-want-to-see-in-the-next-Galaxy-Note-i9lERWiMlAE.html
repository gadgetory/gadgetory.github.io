Samsung is gearing up for an event on
August thirteenth in new york city where
it's widely expected that the next
Galaxy Note will make its debut there
are lots of rumors about what to expect
but I had a talk with cnet's own phone
guru Jessica dull court we came up with
the top five features we want to see in
the next Galaxy Note let's count it down
at number five a more high-end feel the
note is a great device but it's
outclassed by a number of phones
including the LG g4 the HTC One and it
pales in comparison to Samsung's own
galaxy s6 the note 4 had a leather-like
thing going on the back which we liked
but Samsung we know you can do better
and we want to see it on the note 5 at
number 4 is a removable battery and
microSD card slot I'm putting these two
features together because they both made
their exit on the samsung galaxy s6 with
its sealed up back the note 4 has a
removable back and we want that to stay
on the note 5 so we can swap out
batteries and have easy access to a
microSD card slot expandable storage is
such a great feature on many Android
phones and we want it to stay on the
note if for some reason Samsung must
seal up the back put in a door or
something so we can add gigabytes of
space at the note please and number
three is an improved fingerprint sensor
right now it's hard to beat Apple touch
ID fingerprint sensor but we want to see
the note be as good a touch ID if not
better between phone payment systems
like Samsung pay or Android pay and
overall security a great fingerprint
sensor is really important otherwise
it's a convenient feature that becomes
downright annoying because it's
inconsistent oh that's right wait a
minute Samsung already has a very good
sense in the s6 put something like that
in the note 5 at number 2 and improved
screen right now the note has a great
screen but there are two reasons why a
higher res screen is important one the
note handles multitasking and the higher
the resolution the easier is to read
text and make out objects on a smaller
part of the display to Samsung's push
into virtual reality demands a
ridiculously high resolution display
when your eyes are right up against the
screen seeing the space between pixels
takes you a tiny bit out of the
experience
by the way we're not too keen on the
idea of increasing the screen size from
five point seven inches unless it
doesn't make the phone itself larger
before we get to number one I asked you
guys on Twitter what features you want
to see in the next note here's what you
had to say nick says he wants to see
wireless charging less TouchWiz and a
better front-facing camera number 1 l.a
kings angels fans said he wanted to see
a camera that focuses quickly Joe also
wants to see wireless charging those are
great ideas thanks for chiming in at
number one we want the galaxy note to
stay ahead of the galaxy s line since
the notes introduction it's always been
ahead on features compared to the S the
galaxy s might be Samsung's flagship but
the note is where we saw the
ridiculously cool if not slightly
unnecessary edge first the note 5 should
have awesome specs that are a step ahead
of the s6 like maybe four gigabytes of
RAM and types the USB flat out the note
5 should be better than the s6 maybe we
didn't dream big enough maybe the note 5
should like roll up into a scroll or
become transparent like in all those
futuristic movies let me know what you
think of the comments or on Twitter I
matt is for more top fires like this
visit top 52 netcom thanks for watching
and I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
