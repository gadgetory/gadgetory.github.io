has a crazy selection of seven models to
choose from right now including three
four standard TVs and four four 4k TVs
so which one should you get my pick for
most people with 4k TVs is the Roku
streaming stick plus sure it's more
expensive than most of the others but
it's still affordable and it's mix of
features and capabilities is the best on
the market I'll tackle the other rogue
whose later in this video but for now
let's take a closer look at the plus
this tiny stick is designed to plug into
the HDMI port on your TV and remain out
of sight
it includes a cable with something
called an advanced wireless receiver
it's supposed to improve Wi-Fi reception
and my test it didn't make much
difference but Wi-Fi reception was still
great more important is 4k HDR video
output the streaming stick plus is one
of the least expensive streamers deliver
the highest quality 4k and HDR videos
from Netflix Amazon Vudu and other apps
if you have a compatible 4k TV that
means to be getting the best picture for
your streaming dollar and even if you
don't have a 4k TV yet chances are good
that your next TV will be 4k the plus is
cheap enough that you might want to get
it now anyway and be ready for the
future
another great feature is their motes
ability to control your TV buttons for
power and volume are programmed
automatically during setup using the
information contained in your TV
afterward you can kick your televisions
remote to the curb
otherwise everything I like about Roku
is on board including the best search in
the business simple menus that are easy
to customize and more apps for can
otherwise than the competition and all
that goodness trickles down to the
cheaper Roku's to slightly less
expensive but still an excellent choice
is the Roku premier plus available
exclusively at Walmart the only
differences between it and the streaming
stick plus are form factor it's a tiny
box not a stick and the lack of 5
gigahertz Wi-Fi I think it's worth a bit
more to get the faster Wi-Fi but maybe
your standard 2.4 gigahertz network is
fine
making the premier plus a solid choice
Roku's cheapest 4k HDR streamer is the
premier drops the fancy TV controlling
remote but keeps everything else if you
just want to spend the least amount
possible on a 4k streamer this is your
boy the most expensive Roku is the ultra
it has all the capabilities of streaming
stick plus including 4k HDR it's also
the only current Roku where the remote
has a headphone jack for private
listening and
includes the headphones - there's also a
cool remote finder that makes the click
or beep if it gets lost in the couch
cushions and you can connect an ethernet
cable if your Wi-Fi isn't great these
features probably aren't worth the extra
money for most people unless they just
want the best Roku period so what if you
don't care at all about 4k HDR get the
standard streaming stick basically the
non 4k version of my favorite streamer
at the plus it's remote can do TV
control and voice search just like the
plus and response times are just as
snappy the cheapest Roku of all is the
Roku Express it's my go to pick for
ultra budget streaming hardware and
delivers the goodness of Roku for the
least amount of money and unlike older
versions of Roku's cheapest streamer
response times are plenty fast for
people with older TVs that lack HDMI
ports Roku sells the Express plus it
comes with a set of yellow red and white
analog cables so you can infuse that
ancient television with a full suite of
modern apps in the end Roku's massive
streamer lineup has something for
everybody but my pick for most people is
a streaming stick plus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
