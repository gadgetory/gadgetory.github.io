let's talk about the next note again
first stop galaxy gateway the galaxy
note 9 will be officially unveiled
shortly after this video goes up we'll
even have a live show covering it at
cnn.com with yours truly
but last week Samsung published a video
showing off the note 9 the company
quickly took the video down but this is
the Internet so there are copies
everywhere the good folks at Andrew
Authority grabbed it you'll see the blue
note with a yellow s-pen the video shows
off that the note 9 is capable of one
terabyte of storage using an additional
512 gigabyte microSD card which means
the note 9 will come in a 512 gigabyte
version the little text on the bottom
also confirms a 512 gigabyte model
it also touts all-day battery life fans
of wired headphones get happy the note 9
has a headphone jack

screenshot the note 9 everybody
Samsung's worst kept secret onward to

fortnight's is coming to Android but
there is one oddity you won't find it on
the Google Play Store Epic Games has
decided to go another route if you want
the game you have to go to fortnight
comm then you download the fortnight
launcher then you get the game now why
would a pig do this
well the CEO had this statement about
competition among services and choices
sure that must be it it's not about the
money right if you didn't know if an app
is in the Play Store Google gets a cut
of in-app purchases 30% to be exact for
tonight has a lot if an app purchases
what's that the CEO made another
statement to Silicon Alley Insider he
says that 30% store tax is a high cost
in a world where game developers 70%
must cover all the costs of developing
operating and support in their games
well alright
good on you for the honesty epic when is
the game being released when we know
we'll tell you maybe even in the
comments let's move on over to pixel
Park Google seems to have leaked the
launch date for the pixel 3 the company
posted an October 4th launch event on
famebit famebit is a website by YouTube
that lets brands work with youtubers
this was found out by this is tech today
and now it's time to head on over to
YouTube unions more details about
YouTube music have been outlined in an
article by Engadget YouTube told
Engadget it will update the app every
two weeks music will be able to be
stored on an SD card that's rolling out
right now don't forget that YouTube
music is the future Google still plans
to put a cushion over the face of google
play music and say Shh you did give it

time to go to Google Gardens the
intercept reports that Google is working
on a version of its search engine for
China it would Center a bunch of things
the intercept said the limited version
of Google would block quote websites and
search terms about human rights
democracy religion and peaceful protest
end quote
the report says the project is named
dragonfly and has been in development
since the last year the app version has
been shown to the Chinese government and
it could launch within nine months the
report also says quote it is unclear
whether Google will eventually launch a
desktop version of its Censored search
platform end quote
google has not confirmed any of this but
remember when Google's motto was don't

conduct now reads employees of alphabet
and controlled affiliates should do the
right thing follow the law act honorably
and treat each other with respect okay
