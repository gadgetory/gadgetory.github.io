like a walking Bubble Boy well it's made
to replace those weak umbrellas that get
turned inside out from the wind and
protects you from all weather conditions
it even has a hands-free option now they
call it the ultimate weather protector
but I call the ultimate game killer and
what if you had some beans for lunch in
the air gets trapped it ain't gonna
protect you from that so I'll give them
props for this new idea but for now we
