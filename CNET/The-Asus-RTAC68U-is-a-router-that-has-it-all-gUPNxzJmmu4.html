our TAC 66u Wi-Fi router from Asus is
all because came out last year but still
is one of the top nut devices on the
market the question is how do you top
some things only top nut well two things
first you get down low to talk about it
check a number to make something that's
a lot better and I think Asus did just
that which is all new RT AC 68 you
router right here so let's see how much
better this one is but before I think
should go and read my review and the
other one otherwise you know no
difference also it good for my page view
so go do it now this is a high end true
dual band 802.11 AC or AC for short
Wi-Fi router and that means it support
all existing Wi-Fi clients on a market
read your laptop your smartphone your
tablet regardless of their Wi-Fi
standard what is new is when you use
this router with the Oh existing 802
point you'll burn and client on the 2.4
gigahertz frequency band you can have
the speed up to 600 megabits per second
that up from 450 big bit per second of
the old standard and they are multiplied
by this router first of all is very
solid and well-built it looks pretty
good it comes in a news kind of stand up
design here and have a smaller footprint
even though it is actually larger and a
little bit heavier than the older model
and now it comes with three detachable
antennas right here on the front here
you see the usual array of the status
light now they are very helpful but in
case you are bothered by them you can
actually turn them off via the button on
the back right here and now you can do
whatever you want to do in a dark room
of yours also on the back there I have
two USB port and one of them actually is
USB 3.0 that's one one port and the for
land for all of them are gigabit did I
say one one port well actually unlike
this is also the first I've seen that
actually can turn one of these LAN port
into a secondary one port and that means
rare
can actually connect to two separate
internet sources at a time such as fiber
optic and cable and in that case you can
have very fast internet speed to balance
the load off a failsafe in case one of
the source is disconnected now most of
us don't really need that but for those
who really want to be absolutely online
all the time that is a great feature
now the router has a very good web
interface with a lot of features now in
previous models such as a very cool
Network Maps here QoS a built-in VPN
server ipv6 support up to six gasp Wi-Fi
networks and instead of that little tool
right here design for advanced and
business user most importantly the
router also excelled my testing offering
up to 65 megabyte per second of
sustained real-world speed now that's
about eight times the speed of a regular
Ethernet connection via network cable
very impressive indeed
the question is how much does it cost
well two hundred and twenty dollars if
you find it expensive it is but the good
news is you do not need one like this
for your home but if you can afford it I
think you'll love it
from all the router here check out my
phone with Viacom you should do that
because again it helped with my page for
you but most importantly you'll find out
how much is top the top notch well
that's because I'm down low and this has
been the first look at the RT 68 you
Wi-Fi router from Asus top that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
