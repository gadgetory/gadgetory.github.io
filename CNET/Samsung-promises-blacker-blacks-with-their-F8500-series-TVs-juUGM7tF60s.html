checking out Samsung's new flagship
plasma TV this is the F 8500 series so
plasma might not be the most exciting
display technology on the block right
now what with OLED and 4k and other
exciting buzzwords doing the rounds but
Samsung's not letting go of plasma it's
got this this new high-end flagship this
the FH 500 series it's going to come in
51 60 and 64 inch sizes so Samsung says
this is 2.5 times as bright as last
year's models which is hopefully good
news because last year's editions really
didn't impress us that much in terms of
light output so here's hoping this one's
a little better first impressions are
that it certainly looks very good but of
course your last away for the full
review to figure out if it's the best TV
for your money inside you get all the
usual comforts so you've got Samsung's
brand new remodeled Smart TV service
with its over apps and web browsing you
get all that it's got 3d of course and
it's got a quad core processor on the
inside a quad core processor not
generally where you'd see one inside a
TV sure but Samsung says that that's
going to be good for things like web
browsing using those smart services and
possibly it'll help with picture
processing too you get Samsung's new s
recommendation engine which pops up
little thumbnails of things that the TV
thinks you might want to watch just
along the bottom of the screen and
you've got voice interaction as well so
if you do feel the need to start
screaming at a television then you can
do that just don't hurt its feelings
other manufacturers are big on NFC this
year but Samsung is using its Smart View
technology which lets you stream video
from your smartphone onto your
television if you happen to filled your
house with samsung smart appliances then
the all-share technology in this
television lets you do crazy things like
monitor your air conditioner or your
washing machine from your television i
don't know why you would want to do that
but the features there if you need it
bad news is there's no word on pricing
so as yet it's a mystery and how much
you'll have to splash out to acquire
this thing for your own home it is
coming out this year though so in a few
months maybe we'll know a little
more information less wait and see ugly
West wait to see net and this is
Samsung's F 8500 plasma TV series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
