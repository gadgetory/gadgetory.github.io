report and now for the gadget of the
week the gadget of the week is the
Nintendo Wii yeah no I know it's not
even out yet and there's no news about
it or anything but the Nintendo Wii
looks like it's gonna be a pretty cool
game console that really appeals to the
mainstream and has that neat little
motion-sensitive controller it's only
supposed to cost $250 or less when it
comes out November and by golly I think
it's actually gonna come out on time
plus the guys over in Nintendo are
having a huge week
why because Sony has announced that the
PlayStation 3 will be delayed past the
holidays in Europe and Australia and
that they'll only ship a combined
500,000 units to Japan in the United
States by the November 17th launch date
plus they said they'll only ship 2
million of they're promised four million
units by the end of the year the delay
is the result of manufacturing problems
with the blue laser diodes in the ps3s
blu-ray player and actually those diodes
have also caused delays on standalone
blu-ray and HD DVD players so you know
let's look on the bright side here
basically the $600 game console that
hardly anybody actually wants has been
delayed due to problems with high-def
DVD technologies that hardly anybody
actually wants see Sony's just trying to
give us what we want or what we don't
want
except slower whoa hard to get everybody
likes hard to get hey don't laugh any of
this could be Sony strategy the way
they've been going lately after a series
of leaks about inside information at
hewlett-packard the company's chairwoman
went on a crazy potentially illegal hunt
for the leakers
basically she got an outside company to
lie to HP's board of directors in order
to spy on their home phone and private
cell phone call records Wow the
intrigued you know I think I saw
something like this once on alias I
wonder if they need someone to go in
undercover and kick a little ass here we
go again time to ride the Apple rumor
pony the company is set out invitations
for another one of its super special
events to be held next week in San
Francisco the invitation says Showtime
and of course everyone's thinking that
this is the big movie downloads
announcement and maybe we'll see the
true video iPod mmm and then of course
they wouldn't confuse everybody by
announcing a new iMac and a new Mac Mini
with Intel Core 2 Duo this week so now
everyone's like oh wow maybe the
announcements like so huge they didn't
want to dilute it you know what I don't
even care seriously I don't give a hoot
what they announce next week and
whatever it is it's probably gonna be
late I'm so sick of hopping up on the
bandwagon every time they wave their
little Photoshop invites around everyone
except me yeah fine you got me I'm not
invited jerks William Shatner has
declined an invitation from Sir Richard
Branson to be one of the first
passengers on a commercial space flight
in 2008 the 75 year old Shatner said he
was afraid he'd vomit all over himself
and also die in a fiery crash oh this is
so funny
he's totally scared he's gonna die up
there on Richard Branson's crazy virgin
spacecraft thingy
good call shatter you would totally
freaking die up there that man is smart
I'm Hollywood and this has been the bus
