that's what Tag Heuer CEO used to
describe the connected watch the
company's first SmartWatch it's running
Android wear so I can work with both
iPhones and Android devices it's made
with a high-grade titanium for that
luxury feel and it costs $1,500
so this is the most expensive Android
wear SmartWatch we have seen to date
they say it will get about a day's worth
of battery so 18 to 20 hours the watch
features a 46 millimeter display that's
protected by sapphire crystal which
should make it a lot harder to scratch
we also saw this from the Huawei watch
which was a lot cheaper so this is
pretty much the same as every other
Android wear device it doesn't have a
heart rate monitor but it can count your
steps it will show you notifications and
personalized google now cards the unique
thing about this watch is after the
two-year warranty period is up you can
trade it in for traditional tag horror
mechanical watch which the company says
will last you a lifetime the catch
though you have to trade it in and pay
an additional $1,500 for that mechanical
watch which could be a pretty steep
price point for lots of people the Tag
Heuer connected SmartWatch is available
today for $1,500
for more information be sure to check
out cnet.com I'm dan Graziano and that
was a first look of a Tag Heuer
connected watch
