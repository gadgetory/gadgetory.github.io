and software to bring out the artist in
you making it easy for anyone to create
three-dimensional art what did you think
Microsoft was just about stuffy office
products that's changing in the next
version of Windows 10 called creators
update coming as a free upgrade this
spring packed with a new paint program
that makes it easy to make 3d art but
first Microsoft will be releasing an
updated surface book laptop with double
the graphics power and 16 hours of
battery life that starts at 2400 dollars
and it arrives in November there's also
a brand new product the surface studio
is an all-in-one touchscreen PC with a
crazy thin 28 inch LCD monitor that
easily folds downward and flat so you
can work on it like a drafting table
Microsoft also created a new puck
accessory called the dial turn it to
cycle through different settings or
place it on the touchscreen and you can
open up a new menu such as a color
palette for artwork this surface studio
starts at about 3000 dollars and can be
pre-ordered now with a limited supply
arriving mid December the dial it cost
$100 extra it also works with other new
surface computers pair it with a pen and
suddenly you have a whole new Windows
creative experience here's how Microsoft
executive Yusuf Mehdi explains this new
phase we feel we're on the cusp of a new
wave of creativity and so we're really
going to get after with our devices in
our software and back to that Windows 10
software Microsoft wants to turn you
into someone who consumes a lot of
content into someone who creates a lot
of
and it's also easy to share that content
scan an object in the real world with a
phone app then import it into the new
paint 3d to create something unique your
masterpiece can be shared in a community
posted online as a video or even viewed
virtually with hololens or virtual
reality headsets Microsoft is working
with partners to get more affordable VR
headsets on the market that are easy to
use starting at three hundred dollars
but it's not all about drawing easily
create your own broadcast of a video
game you're playing or create a
tournament with friends and message your
friends in new ways with playful emoji
or create your own emoji shoulder taps
are a way to ping your close friends
they'll see it on their desktop screen
you could say Microsoft wants Windows to
have a personal touch in more ways than
one reporting from the Microsoft event
