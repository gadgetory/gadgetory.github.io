today or USB see now of course you know
yours fee the port on the computer that
allows you to plug in your smartphone
your external hard drive your keyboard
your mouse etc via USB cables I have a
few of them here and this one is a
standard USB 3.0 cable standard we could
have two ends the distal end here called
type a that we mean the same and this
end here is called high B that changes
based on the device you use with for
example this one here is the standard u
speed 3.0 type B and this one here is a
standard micro USB 3.0 cable type A the
same type II Micro USB 3.0 and this one
here is the regular USB cable for a
printer type a the same type B regular
USB and here this one is the mini USB
cable tie by the same type II mini USB
as you can see you have to always fumble
around to find the right cable the right
end of a cable and then the right
direction to plug something in because
if you flip the cable around it's not
going to fit anymore
let's think about it if you're in a
hurry and this kind of dark good to plug
something into something else it's not
going to be easy and that's where us PC
comes into play take a look at the cable
here this is USBC cable both end at the
same and this one here is the USB C port
on the computer you can see you can plug
in any other way you want any other
anyone on the other end you can always
plug in the device very easily as you
can see I can do that with that even we
are looking at it now that's more though
your specie can also deliver must pass
the speed up to 10 gigabit per second
and must more power for that reason it
can also be used to chart much larger
device such as this laptop right here
but there's more take a look here at
this end of this use PC cable the logo
that's right that is for Thunderbolt 3
you guessed it tampon 3 now moved to use
the same port as us PC in other word
every Thunderbolt report will also work
as USB C port and every turbo 3 cable
will also work as a USBC cable
and vice-versa make sure you get good
cables done and finally that's now a new
audio standard for us PC and that means
it will soon see the disappearance of
the good out 3.5 millimeter audio jack
on the smartphone and when that happens
if you truly be only one port and one
cable to connect everything that's
pretty cool I guess but the idea of not
having to carry all this cable or it
turns me on big and the blogging thing
into each other nicely easily and neatly
it's just another extra bonus that I
can't wait to do and that's because I'm
down low and this is strictly about USB
