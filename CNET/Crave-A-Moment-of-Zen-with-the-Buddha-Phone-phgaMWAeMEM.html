dead I brought something what I brought
the eight gigabyte nokia n95 this is
like the n95 that everybody loves was
that 8 gigabytes of internal memory so
how do you like them like would you keep
it i would if i could afford it yeah
we've talked about the nokia if I like
to death here at sea now has been so
many iterations but it's kind of nice to
see them black it is alright so slowly
one of the things that I've got is USB
jewelry and I know what you think about
this but there has been USB jewelry out
there but now they I'm kinna with
cufflinks yeah for guys that's like two
gigabytes totally like the fashion
accessory for techno sexuals if you know
any I don't you don't yeah okay okay
that's good I thought you're gonna say
like I know you I have the monocycle
basically like a motorcycle but it's got
a cabin so you don't get a helmet hair
on your hair Oh after you break I'm glad
you I know that now so I can advance
upon eraser now yeah okay I looked at
its pretty sleek it looks very jet like
right yeah I would you would you roll
not I think I'd try it give it a shot a
little training wheels that retract out
now next thing that I brought to the
table is the Buddha phone it's phone is
like plated in 24 karat gold plus it's
been blessed by Buddhist monk hat how
can you turn that down it's kind of ugly
it will it'sit's they try to make it
look cool it's like totally two minutes
to blitz to bling it's got like jade and
like diamonds on the back
I just want to know like if you have
road rage if you put that phone next
year will it take a moment of Zen all
right well that was all the things that
we crave and if you guys have anything
that you'd like to tell us about just
email us at driving me crazy at cnet com
now time where we do our crave trivia
because we like to take care of you guys
so Bonnie you have the question I didn't
how many different rooms at Brian
mentioned in last week's hamster wheel
segment that's right now did you watch
it sure I did oh well maybe what was
another item on Craig call awesome
thanks for Shane we really appreciate it
now the first three people with the
correct answer are going to get these
cool cases from power support it's a
skin case for your nano with like a
plastic stand so that's really cool just
email us at driving me crazy at cnet com
and now you guys know what time it is
it's all about do not crave celebrity
endorsed and themed products are nothing
new I mean remember Beyonce's be phone
but here's one that caught my eye now
NBA superstar Allen Iverson is getting
his own zune is it me or did it just get
real quiet well here's the details a
limited edition 8 gigabyte soon we'll
have an etching of a eye on the back
still not tempted oh okay well I forgot
it'll also come packaged with a pair of
shoes called the answer 11 zune special
edition now look at those things they're
gross they're disgusting like Allen
Iverson is one of my fav players of all
time but there's no way in hell he'd
wear those shoes and Rocco zune at the
same time well lucky for us they're only
producing 60 of these bundles but even
if you're a hardcore collector and an
Iverson freak don't do it we just got to
say not great so what do you think of
those shoes I'm not going to say
anything very decorative they are there
I'm very Decker unique and I'm a little
afraid of Allen Iverson sir all right
well thanks for coming down to the show
and I just remember check out our site
at krave cnet com and we'll see you guys
