Samsung's note fit in there and all the
legal news our little brains can
understand all that more in this week's
edition of welcome I'm Justin Eckhouse
lancs high bitch gia mark BTW hello
hello and special guest Emily Dreyfus
hello guys hi hey thanks for joining
thank you so much for having me so we we
invited you on because you're awesome
but also because you have an android
phone yes that's true that is a fact I
have a very old android phone that is
not even running Gingerbread the first
incredible my past phone I'm very
familiar with it now you have the same
problem I have which or had which is you
you can't I upgrade it because of this
weird space issue yeah so it tried to
give me gingerbread the over-the-air
update and I was very excited about it
because I thought I was going to get all
these other apps that I was missing in
blah blah blah and then what happened
was that my phone didn't have enough
what I what I learned was it was dialer
storage whatever that is was taking all
this space on my phone and because of
that there was not enough room to update
at all but it took me like two months to
figure that out and it kept saying you
need to delete apps you need to make
room so I offloaded all my photos all my
videos and deleted basically every
single app except for the apps that I
need to live like Pandora and Yelp and
this one right so I had like four apps
on my phone now it was not even a
smartphone it barely did anything and it
still wouldn't upgrade to Gingerbread so
I marched in to verizon and then they
explained to me this is a really common
problem that Incredibles are having an
all android phones actually will
eventually have this guy claimed event
once you've had it long enough I don't
know that was true or not and that is
that it stores you're all your dialer
information every phone call you've ever
made and that actually takes up all the
storage and it's not easy to access
yourself when you go in to make room to
get to the dialer storage so he deleted
it all since then my phone is I don't
have half my phone numbers things are
totally messed up and I never got all
the apps again that I was missing and
you still didn't get you to and I still
cannot get ginger read this yeah they
actually have kind of
solve this problem with ice cream
sandwich so the problem is they sort of
partition the storage into like this can
only be used for apps and this can only
be used for data and this can only be
used for XYZ and they have got rid of
that in an inn in the sorry ice cream
sandwich okay which I think does solve
that for a lot of people it was so
annoying like because I actually have to
check my work email all the time to see
if like breaking news is coming out and
should I be putting it on the homepage
and when this was happening when it was
when it's tyler chargers fully would not
send me emails it was it was like I was
living in the dark ages it was really
frustrating and upsetting and terrible
so what is your next phone so i'm really
at an impasse i don't know what to do
because there are so many android phones
that I'm actually kind of overwhelmed
about all the options and I don't want
to do that you did which is get the
Galaxy Nexus and then find out that a
better one is coming out in three weeks
let me tell you the secret okay that is
always going to happen I know so then I
think then I'm part of me is like well
maybe I should just get a windows phone
because then i will be very contrarian
and then there won't be a better one
coming out because there are like seven
you might be on the wrong show if you're
good you can start a new show you want
the news today will help you figure out
which phone to buy okay so what we're
going to talk about some upcoming phones
excuse me so let's jump into the news
here with a google wallet which I was
very excited about one of the reasons I
bought my galaxy nexus because it has
NFC and doesn't really come with google
wallet because of screwed up I don't
want to get into it just makes me mad
but Google Wallet great idea just swipe
your phone to pay for stuff I always
want to use the NFC on my phone to like
you know get into the elevator in the
morning here I wish I didn't have to
carry my key card around I could just
swipe this like uh you guys know in my
pocket we know you guys do yeah but we
were talking about how if it was really
gonna replace your wallet you need to
also do other things like have your
driver's license we're on it well I kind
of I don't have my driver's license on
it and I suspect if I took picture of my
drivers life since then I got pulled
over and I was like hey look here it's
for it he's fired
I work here but I do have this app
called card star which lets me like get
all my loyalty cards into their you like
scan the barcode and it stores those and
I use on all the time when I go to CVS
or whatever because I hate those loyalty
card programs but anyway Google Wallet
so there was actually two cracks flash
hacks that came out for Google Wallet
one was a very complicated way to crack
the Google out pin which you know was
not practical but to just show that it
could be done in a second which came out
shortly after was a way to get access to
the prepaid card which is tied to the
phone and not necessarily to your
account so you could just go into Google
Wallet app clear settings and then it
would prompt you to reset the pin and
you could use the prepaid card those in
there so not cool so dumb how could they
not have thought of that whoops yeah
yeah no it sucked um but they they first
I'll say a little bit kind of blamed
users and they're like well sure but why
don't you have a you know passcode on
your phone if you had a passcode on your
phone then this wouldn't even be an
issue which i agree i think everyone
should have passcode on their phone in
general but I you know I think sort of
that's no excuse yeah exactly secure
exactly Google come on especially yeah I
mean they're dealing with your money
they need to be as secure as possible
and also there's lots of problems with
phone locks because you can trace the
swipes of the fingerprints and slena
grease on the phone it was gross but
true mmhmm yeah no that's definitely
true so they did act quickly and they
sort of said like hey if you have any
issues as cause we'll fix this for you
you know I think like all credit cards
you're probably not liable for more than
fifty dollars but then they did first
they stopped issuing new prepaid credit
cards for a while and then they fix the
issue and they have sensory in able
prepaid cards I mean the bigger issue
with google wallet is currently you can
only register one credit
like citibank mastercard i think you
know which not everyone the world has or
you have to use this prepaid sort of
work around where you get this prepaid
mastercard which you have to load up
with another card which is just this
long process that i'm sure most people
including myself don't do also because
the only way to get google wallet on the
Galaxy Nexus since you cannot download
it from the market because verizon
doesn't want you to have it is to
download the apk separately so may this
hack doesn't even matter because nobody
well exactly we were talking about this
one rumor has it yesterday really
quickly just because actually Maggie
Reardon was saying that maybe this hack
is really poor tending the death knell
of Google Wallet cuz no one's using it's
not easy to access and they have this
they had to take it offline to fix this
who's using it besides you I don't know
I mean I did it because I thought it was
cool and cuz they give you ten dollars
free when you install it oh that's kind
of cool you know I can't resist free
money yeah I don't I think when sprint
comes out with their Galaxy Nexus which
will have the Google Wallet
pre-installed or at least accessible i
don't know if it's pre-installed una
that may change things as more NFC
phones now it may change things I don't
know the google wallet will you know we
necessarily but i think some wallet
solution is going to win out i really
care what it is yeah i just needs to be
easy yeah cuz the point is here exactly
right yeah so maybe the hacks like this
are sort of the next step into improving
these services alright well wait and see
what happens so we're going to mix
things up a little bit here and we're
gonna take a quick break right now and
when we come back we're gonna talk about
more samsung stuff stick around a lot
about prizes new 4G LTE right you should
be it's verizon's fastest most reliable
4G network where 4g LTE you'll get
speeds up to 10 times faster than 3G so
what does that mean well let's say
you've got the new HT
see vulnerable or even the LG vortex you
can hook up your HTC or your LG to your
4g LTE and you'll have Verizon's 4G LTE
in over 190 cities and 118 airports so
it's faster the new Droid Razr by
Motorola or the HTC reason or even the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus you're chucking 4G
LTE on almost our entire 3g footprint
one song for sex the song is for second
one movie one out download a 10 megabyte
PowerPoint presentation in 15 seconds I
really don't know what that means are
you a business owner no i live off a
settlement you're Native American
officer got it one thing you were
starting a small business and you want
to run the entire business from your
smartphone well I wouldn't want to do
that like your droid razr HD series n or
easier Samsung Galaxy Nexus less sounds
time here's your 3g network let's put it
this way if you aren't 4g know that you
have to buy a droid binarize samsung
strap or a pantech breakout compaq mini
hippo or the droid xyboard tablet and
what if i drop it in the toilet it
breaks immediately verizon it's an old
person's nightmare uh i love it it's
funny cause it's true yeah i mean this
is the issue we deal with all the time
here is like when you're like oh what my
mom wants know what phone i should buy
most of us even android hardcores are
just like just get an iphone I can't
explain this to you that's too hard ah
but then I did that I recommended one of
my like older friends get an iphone and
then the other day she said could you
please write me an email with the
step-by-step instructions of how to get
one of my photos to Facebook and I was
like it's really easy oh my god I don't
even have an iphone but I know it
probably takes one click a bison that
just pre-integrated ya allah i also love
that they use all the real product names
yeah and it yeah yes they even got the
worst name of the year and they're the
cyborg oh I hate that the only reason
they changed the name to the cyborg is
because they didn't want to call the
zoom too because everyone had such bad
associations with the zoom oh that's
that's my take on it I
even realize it was like the same as the
zune yeah I mean it's pretty much is the
zoom too but it's you know the zoom was
so delayed and so underwhelming when it
came out and the SD card didn't work
until I don't know three or six months
after it came out and 4G came out six
months late for it and it was a mess Oh
like a thousand dollars too yes faster I
don't know I it's as I board is good
right let's talk about some real
products the samsung galaxy note we took
a look at this at CES actually had a guy
from Samsung come on and demo it and you
know the basic deal here is it's it's a
big phone first of all right 5.3 inch
not a tablet phone because a megaphone
and make someone calls but it it you can
write on it right it has a stylist a pen
the s pen and you can write on it
because that's what you want to do with
your phone right and where does the
stylus go drink a little pep pocket in
the back okay yeah um yeah I mean we we
talk we've talked about this before and
I am definitely very negative of this
concept I'm with Steve Jobs who's like
you know you were born with the best
stylist ever your finger um that's what
she said hey maybe have flies on your
show anyway generally I feel like yes
the the great thing about android the
Android ecosystem is that if you want a
phone with a pen you can get that I
don't understand why you'd want that but
it's your choice yeah because there's a
million choices you have every size
every color yes yeah and I think the
argument is that it's really just
another mode of input you know I mean
you can you can do all of the
touchscreen things that you can do on a
normal phone but if you happen to get an
app that supports you know writing then
you've got the stylus or the illusion
Jessica dog-cart brought it onto dialed
yesterday and she's actually showing how
she was taking notes and meetings and
stuff and it looked kind of cool i mean
when you take notes in a meeting you're
like sitting here trying to find the
button press the button she was just
scribbling stuff so it's kind of neat
like that that's cool yeah you know what
else does that a pen and paper just
saying yeah yes it's a lot cheaper
doesn't crash but can you email the
paper yeah I can take a picture in it
yeah nobody stands anything anymore did
you take picture pictures all the time
and like I've white boards and stuff she
also says that in the review the
response is kind of delayed it seems
like if this is the core feature of the
phone is the drawing to have response
blade is kind of bad and require some
training oh because I was gonna say that
that would be fun for kids you know like
if they're in the back see the car you
could give it them and they could draw
on it but if there was a delay and they
have to learn how to use it exactly
intuitive yeah and I think I think in
the review that she also posted a
picture of the character recognition
which was not so great so it tried to
you know transcribe some of what she had
written right i mean this this has
always been the problem I'm the guy who
bought the thousand-dollar Newton when I
was in college because I was like Newton
it's so awesome it's going to change the
world it was terrible waste of money um
and then I had the palm which the only
way it was usable like instead of this
was this is kind of my favorite solution
ever instead of fixing the handwriting
recognition they just reinvented the
alphabet there yeah just use graffiti
yeah you so this is this is easier do
you know about this gravy so is
basically a new alphabet that you had to
learn those way easier for mom to
recognize expected you to change the way
you wrote yeah yep I had one of those
two and had like a little lesson thing
in it earlier I would show you like
different moves you'd make to make
different letters and it so did you
really did you guys actually I learn the
whole thing and it worked great and
you're still fluent and it's a couple
years they actually have a graffiti app
for Android for all of those people who
missed that I don't know who those
people are yeah I think I don't want to
reminisce more about technology and
expose my how
old so yeah I mean it's great that they
have this I think for people who want it
but I wouldn't expect it to be sort of a
breakaway success I mean it's just all
so alien eating for people like me who
have tiny little hands I could never get
that phone as you can tell it barely
hold the pen oh the size of the phone
eyes of the phone yeah like I couldn't
reach around and get the buttons it's
just no it's not gonna work for me how
are your pockets though yeah also too
small also too small yeah well then you
will not want to get the 10-point n 1
inch version of this either secondly
will not so there's rumors that at
Mobile World Congress Samsung will
release a temple in one inch version and
to be clear to be fair it's not a phone
it's a tablet which makes a little more
sense to me like I could see drawing on
a tablet a lot of space that could be
cool or fun and graphic designers could
use it if you're thinking about
professional people right professional
people most like I'm like us you know
right there headlines I like that I like
the artwork in this post here yeah yeah
very well done that is about the level
that I my artistic skills are at so I
don't I would expect the tablet to do
better than the phone the problem with
all of these are technologies that are
really just sort of based on one
manufacturer like there was the dual
screen kyocera echo stuff is that
developers probably will not they won't
get wide support from developers
anything when you have these special
features you need a bunch of apps to
take advantage of them and if you is
it's only on samsung phones or it's only
on LG phones or whatever then you kind
of struggle to get that mass adoption
from the developer community yeah unless
you could build it in such a way that it
actually could just kind of work with
already existing apps and apps enough to
change but what can you really do with a
stylus on including angry birds from
Anja exactly yeah fruit ninja
that'd be good that would be good yeah
we are solving problems sword-shaped
stylist I think would you good for that
there's a market for that hmm you should
make that jaimer heard here first all
right well we're not going to stop
talking about Samsung because they're
just so cool and interesting they have
released or unveiled i should say it's
not out yet the samsung galaxy tab 2
which is follow-up to the you'll guess
guess this samsung galaxy tab 17 inch
tablet which we have here are played
with a bunch i'm not a big fan but it
this the tab 2 is basically you know
everything you would expect faster
android 4.0 3g Wi-Fi you can get a Wi-Fi
only version blah blah blah we're not
going to talk about that we're going to
talk about the price because that is
what i find interesting the price is
high don't avoid reporting reportedly
yes this is thanks for keeping me
journalistically and tap in check here
the Wi-Fi only version is rumored to be
419 450 and the Wi-Fi + 3g is a rumor to
be 523 to 568 that surprise across
several european countries so we don't
know what the US one will be necessarily
or if these are real but my question is
a 7-inch tablet starting at around for
20 when you compare that to the kindle
fire at 199 I mean yeah and the ipad
which is bigger and is only fifty
dollars more right or 80 right yes so is
that does this make any sense at all no
and I go out on a limb here folks some
say no why would they do this please say
this isn't true Samsung does it does it
have a better screen is that part of the
rumor it does say that it's gonna get a
pretty good screen right i mean i think
it is higher res i mean it certainly can
maybe it's a comes and models from eight
gigs to 32 gigs so it has more memory
it's faster but if you think yeah I mean
it can come and 3g if you want but the
Wi-Fi only one starts at 419 is
reportedly so the question is what do
you do with your tablet like if you're
just watching movies reading books
checking email why would you buy why
would you spend more than 199 when so
the fire does all that exactly
especially when it says that it boasts
that it's going to have the video hub
which will have over 1000 films but like
amazon has way more than that one is
unlimited and like if you're part of
prime you have the free ones i mean ya
know exactly you can't compete i mean i
guess if you want to use your own media
i think it's probably better for
streaming off of your own servers or
doing all sorts of illicit stuff but um
oh they're marketing this book criminal
it could be another niche yeah I mean
Samsung could be argued to be a criminal
by some people so I know this doesn't
make any sense to me and left for again
for a small set of use cases if you're a
gamer and you just need a high-power
tablet or I don't know you're
recalculating a hundred thousand sale
spreadsheets on your 7 inch tablet then
you're doing it wrong to start with but
I guess you want a faster one but again
these are just reported prices from a
blog called Sammy's hub are you saying
that's not credible I'm not saying
anything I'm just you can go to your own
conclusions from there in front of LG
hub LG hub okay that's good I'm lucky
gold star host rock eagle 30 p let's
move on to our last samsung story of the
day is it i think it is yes i believe so
um actually i think there's a little tip
that coming up but forget I said that so
what are talking about hero legal battle
so none of us are lawyers let's just
preface the store with that and nor do
we normally know what we're talking
about
consult a lawyer in preparing for this
right but we do know how to read each
each of us does know how to read is up
for debate stroke a translate sort of so
a couple things here we've been talking
about the ongoing legal battle with
Samsung and Apple for two decades now
the latest is the the samsung galaxy tab
10.1 was banned in Germany because they
say it infringed on apple and Apple has
been fighting this you know in every
country around the world that it's for
sale and it seems and so Samsung
modified the samsung galaxy 10.1 and
release the 10.1 n which i guess was
different enough that it cleared the
german courts and is now going to be
available for sale in germany so good
job samsung except as we reported last
week or possibly two weeks ago the
European Union Commission European
Union's European Commission that's a
little repetitive I want to google it so
not the European Union the American
Commission no no no no not at all just
likely yes thanks for clarifying that
announced Dave they have launched a
formal investigation into whether
Samsung has used its wireless patent in
patents in an anti-competitive way and
this you know potentially is related to
the apple store we talked about last
week where Apple was forced to take down
any of their devices I guess no this is
not related it's related in that
Motorola at force them to take down
their devices because they had patents
on 3g and so app allowed to take down
the 3g stuff and then they had to
license it from motorola and you know i
think samsung it's sort of back and
forth between like we own this ten
percent of your product and you own this
ten percent of our product and it's well
in any way heads but maybe it is related
because it to do with the licensing like
motorola got the apple products taken
off but then the rule is that you have
to license the technology so they did it
and then Apple got their products back
and now this story is about how
Samsung is in violation of the licensing
rules I appreciate you making the me
miss big spoke in the actually accurate
no thank you she's right also I looked
up on what the European Union's European
Commission is and it's not a typo it is
actually just it's called the European
Commission is their legislative arm of
the European Union your pin yin yin yin
yin you you you you so yeah I mean I
think this is going to be continuing
back and forth we talked about Australia
last week I think there's a new claims
filed by Apple against Samsung in the US
this week it's it is going to never end
no but you know at least we'll have
something to talk about every week all
right so we're going to take a real
break this time and we'll be back
talking about some magic app
welcome back because they were taking a
picture and then looked at it later and
been like who is that guy in the
background every single picture or have
you ever been that guy you're just
walking down the street minding your own
business and you realize you just walks
through someone's picture I absolutely
try to be that guy your photo bombing
now um yeah I normally do that and then
I go up to them and say did you want to
meet autograph David Duke don't know why
I don't try to promote that anyway so
there is this a app or technology from a
company called schelotto that lets you
sort of take a picture and we're going
to roll a little video demo for those of
you on the video version of you know in
this case your lovely girlfriend
standing there with weird people walking
by and then after the fact remove those
weird people from the photo to expose
the background so awesome and almost a
little unbelievable totally is this real
it's like when that there was that ad or
that video online of the guy with his
phone in Times Square and he would put
it up to the big screens in Times Square
and suddenly what was on the screen and
there was a big video never like that's
so cool i can't wave that come out how's
it working good and then it was just a
hoax just fake yeah this may be this is
real well there's a company behind it
yeah that's not nothing and then
produced a video promoting it so we
don't have details about when this is
going to come out there's some rumor
saying they will announce something at
Mobile World Congress which is what next
week's like februari 27th or something
like that yeah so States banya so
they're supposed to demo it but they say
that it may not even come out to the to
the android market it may just come
pre-installed on certain device oh right
reportedly reportedly anyway I want this
so
get it for me what's it called Oh skulls
Schelotto brave Schelotto all right so
next up we are going to talk about
following on the sort of Barcelona
Mobile World Congress theme what
interesting devices we might see out of
there and generally we don't like to you
know go into the nuts of bolt of every
little piece of hardware but there's
some interesting things HTC for example
is set to release the HTC Quattro which
you know to no surprise is a quad-core
tablet with one gig of ram and ice cream
sandwich so good job there guys and then
Emily's favorite company lucky goldstar
no that's not a grocery store guys that
is an LG it turns out he goats ours
either that or it's like a pet food like
a pet store yeah where you can get stuff
for your goldfish exact yeah I just have
no idea that LG stood for lucky gold
star blew my mind and LG's a Korean
company right yeah yeah we tried to
translate this to see palace spoken and
it turns out in Korean at least
according to google translate you know
which isn't always right it's pronounced
lucky gold star except with a better
accent than that there you go anyway so
lucky gold star is theoretically or
rumored to be releasing the LG optimus
view which is kind of interesting
because it is again a 5-inch screen we
keep saying as bigger screens which I'm
not a fan of I mean mine is big but it's
actually too big for me 5-inch screen
1024 x 768 resolution and an unorthodox
4 by 3 aspect ratio so way to go the
unorthodox route there LG thing I would
wish LG would have a great smartphone I
have like very fond feelings about LG
because i used to have LG flip phones
and they always made so well and
beautifully and then I feel like once
everyone's made the switch to
smartphones they haven't been they
haven't had a hit ever I think that's
true
maybe this optimist view will be it
it'll see because us anyway the other
fourth three aspect ratio is may be good
for general usage but not great for
watching movies most NTV which is you
know all 16 9 and this one's supposed to
have gingerbread right yeah I mean no
maybe that would suck yeah don't do that
don't release any more phones are
gingerbread you're that lucky gold star
yes you're that listen to me especially
because we've been talking about ice
cream sandwich for so long now and it's
not even out on that many devices and
I'm already totally sick of it I want
the next one yeah exactly jelly bean I
think you need to get yourself to
Gingerbread what am I on company honey
go oh honey come is 30 yeah and that's
for tablet yeah you're uh I don't know
I'm gonna get back to you on that froyo
right yeah there you go Oh God alright
so Samsung i know i said i was going to
talk about that anymore but it looks
like they have delayed the galaxy s3
which is kind of a bummer because I look
like a cool phone but uh tell us Justin
teh mind release the Samsung Galaxy S
Plus which is a faster version of the
galaxy nexus cuz they just want to piss
off all people that just bought this
phone okay this but one thing I would
just point out to you is isn't your
phone already blazingly fast or are you
not showing off to me how amazingly fast
it isn't your content it could be faster
actually I won't really care about it if
it's faster but if they come out with
phone whose battery actually last
through the day yeah I will be pissed
you hear that pissed is that a lion
because it sounds like a Rottweiler that
isn't a very upset just ingenuous
exactly anyway you will see what happens
here I don't have many complaints except
for the battery about my phone and it
has rebooted by itself a couple times
which is never a good thing to see from
your phone
yeah I mean they did this with the razr
maxx too which was also stupid yeah
alright let's wrap things up here with a
quick story about the where's this
google google rolla so we're calling
this gorilla sounds like a fruit roll-up
for a tootsie roll mmm I made them last
night but they're vegan so it's okay and
celebratory for Valentine's Day right so
the google motorola merger has been
approved finally by the US and europe
which according to this story since all
the other countries just do whatever we
tell them is basically gonna wrap this
deal up so China Israel and Taiwan do
have to approve it but they are expected
to just follow suit so we will see all
core kinds of crazy Google rolla things
as a result of us I guess oh good bad
world domination yes um I don't know
what will happen well I think that
Motorola I mean they keep saying there's
going to be this firewall between the
two but I don't believe I don't buy into
that I don't think think that um that's
not true and that Motorola's going to
start making the galaxy the Nexus phones
and that you know I almost hope for
better integration between the OS and
the hardware yeah isn't that the whole
point well I think the point it depends
how you look at it but I think the point
is patents really was a patent play not
hardware play um but I don't see how
that could be I mean once you buy it
you're like oh look this company
actually makes good phones they made the
original droid and you know they make
the cyborg they say they won't i say
they will i think one of my predictions
for this year actually had to do with
that and it was on the I don't believe
Google front um alright we have a lot of
email so we just jump to email sure that
cool let's do it all right first one is
from Roy who says on last week's show
you mentioned
problems with fragmentation however you
only mention software issues such as OSN
custom overlays I being a samsung moment
omen owner rooted of course know that
fragmentation and hardware is far
greater problem with Android ultimately
the internal components of the
individual phones hinder Android
developers I know my phone is way at a
date hardware wise but many others don't
have dual-core processors dedicated
graphics chips blah blah blah blah blah
so he's basically saying it's difficult
to write an app when you have to support
10,000 different CPUs speeds and types
and hardware and we were kind of talking
about this before in terms of the
samsung note and the kyocera echo and
yes I think this is definitely an issue
compared to sort of other os's we're
sort of other platforms like iphone
where there's you know for phones right
the sport and there are changes but
supporting for changes compared to 20
million is different so I agree Roy um
let's see what's next here oh this is
from Kevin great show and welcome to the
new co-hosts I guess that's you I think
that's me uh we didn't know how to
pronounce your name its difficult one
the new coach G Marlins I noticed the
last week's show there's no mention of
Google's new privacy policy is this a
new policy going to affect any of Google
services on Android how they're going to
be used he basically says we didn't
address it and he's right we didn't
address on last week's show but I think
we addressed it three weeks ago so go
back three weeks and listen to that is
there an ad blocker for non rooted
devices such as a browser ad blocking
plugin i personally use adblock plus
blah blah blah blah you know i don't
know but all of our paychecks are paid
by ads so stem yeah I can't help you
with that but you know let us know you
find out if you want to steal my steal
money directly from the three of us
that's all I'm saying and then lastly
kevin says an app that the show hasn't
mentioned
it is google currents it has really
slick magazine like interface and cnet
news is one of the included publications
not sure if this is tablet only i only
have an android tablet at the moment no
phone it is not tablet only it's not
it's not tablet only that's true I don't
I think we may have talked about it at
some point but yeah my team actually
manages our relationship with google
currents and we spent a lot of time
making it look good there and i think
it's on a you know not just android
phones and tablets but also iOS devices
and you know check it out a great show
look forward to hearing your input from
the new co-host in the future game r-ga
bar there we go so this we talked about
google voice was the last week and how I
wanted to make phone calls over Wi-Fi or
VoIP calls with google voice and I was
mad about that and we got a couple
emails including this one from LD who I
can only assume is Larry David isn't
that the obvious assumption here yes uh
suggest to imagine him like writing a
new podcast that was pretty great yes
Larry David if you like to come on as a
guest on the show you know just send us
another email cool like that happen but
he suggests sipdroid CS sip simple and a
couple other things to sort of make VoIP
work on your phone which I definitely
heard of but I also read that Google
didn't want you to do this and they may
shut down your account if you sort of
used these ways to subvert them and use
VoIP calling so anyone who does do this
do it at your own risk and he sort of
speculates that maybe it's an FCC thing
why they don't do it I honestly think
it's an FCC thing I think Google just
doesn't want to piss off all the phone
carriers by saying like hey we give
everyone a way to make phone calls and
not use your service haha love the show
thanks Larry alright the next one is
from Stephen Colbert yes you guys have
really made it that BTW i know it's
awesome so Stephen Colbert I'd like to
be a new your show I don't want you
just keep that money you need the
Colbert bump if you think it really
helped out love the show and she wanted
to add my two cents I'm a retail
consultant what I didn't know you had
two jobs um at sprint and have to solve
this for a lot of customers who got the
nexus s 4g Gingerbread and later vanilla
Android does not support facebook sync
it was removed from the OS and it only
supports Twitter now we talked about
this last week someone asked about this
and Google had sort of banned them
because Facebook violates the terms of
service for how you're allowed to sink
or something like that yeah lame
probably a privacy policy thing from
facebook or google is also an awful
experience for most users because
facebook sucks on mobile true for real
not to say you can't sink though several
apps sync pictures and contacts these
are like third party apps but other than
that you can only sync with sense which
does a pretty good job as maybe yeah
yeah and your phone and I believe
TouchWiz I don't know about blur but
frankly I doubt anyone cares love the
show and keep the Android news coming
Stephen Colbert the thing is I gotta say
I know Stephen Colbert has an iphone oh
you do yeah well secretly he has endured
Navy that's what I choose to believe
that wasn't this is when um when Ryan
Seacrest went on some key note to talk
about some certain phone or former
co-worker Ryan Seacrest exactly but then
he had actually revealed that he uses
blackberry by sending a tweet right
beforehand on blackberry or maybe that
was his manager sending between on his
behalf from his blackberry inside that
way someone was lying um yeah search for
Cena TV classic if you want to see
Andrew Ryan Seacrest on sanity I've
never watched style decision check it
out uh uh all right what to read this
next email jamer okay uh this next one's
from mark it says I've noticed that
Jamar has a soft voice which is not a
problem in and of itself but he
compounds the problem by frequently
maintaining a large distance between
himself and the microphone mark I have
no idea what you're talking about
I think I mean thank you for your free
feedback but i think i got it all under
control no but really thank you mark
Donnelly is a problem in here with the
microphones were when you get the like
appropriate distance here if you then
turn to gesticulate you rot you like hit
your face I hit my nose exactly it's
really your problems kind of dangerous I
helped a little there yeah thanks for
email all right I think last one here
from bill I am a couple episodes behind
what is the deal with that bill really
catch up keep up yeah come on but I've
been hearing recently about Justin's
comment on battery life of his Galaxy
Nexus I also but do I complain about
that much it doesn't seem like that I
also bought one the other day when they
were released and got the extended
battery the current version of ice cream
sandwiches for point no point to since
that version was released google has
updated the sort of open source code to
4.3 with several fixes in order to get
so it he basically says 403 hasn't been
released you know as an over there
update to the phone however he routed
his phone and installed a new rom that
does have four point oh point 3 and that
he sort of saw a massive increase in the
battery saving what I'm trying to say
our efficiency i think is the word and
that he went from sort of getting like
six hours to was he say 17 hours of use
per charge which is huge right so it's
true I don't really I don't know I i
feel i have rooted my phone in the past
and put on new roms but i always feel
like it's a struggle and that for right
now I'm just staying with stock but i
will be excited when they actually
release this because if they could just
fix that battery life issue or like
increase it by two or three fold and in
software that be amazing and make me
less angry about the Galaxy S Plus all
right that is our show for today oh oh
so much for having me on I had such a
great time
thanks for coming on we will have you
back no doubt thank you when I get a new
phone or when I root mine and make it
work better yeah I look forward to
seeing that we can root it on air we did
in whatever early shows we actually had
Darren kitchen on and he rooted his
phone on the air and I think maybe that
Antoine did it at one point as well yeah
I mean I actually would love that
because if I have to root it myself I'm
going to be an idiot about it and so if
I'm here in the loving supporting
helping hands of you guys you can help
me do it yeah all right there is a one
click root friend the incredible it's
one of the easiest phones to root I will
tell you that see I needed that I didn't
know that tada open people every day
