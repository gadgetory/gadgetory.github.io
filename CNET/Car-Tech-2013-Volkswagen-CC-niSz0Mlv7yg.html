the 2008 Detroit Auto Show thought this
is a great-looking midsize sedan but now
they've updated it for the 2013 model
year some things have changed but not a
lot let's go inside and take a look at
what's new
see C stands for comfort coupe but you
can see this car has four doors so not a
coupe in the traditional sense but
following along the idea that
mercedes-benz set with the CLS of having
a four-door coupe and they can get away
with that because it has this really
sleek roofline that follows back it
starts at the trunk lid here then goes
forward in this nice contoured design
all the way to the front for 2013
Volkswagen updated the look of the front
of the CC they went for a common design
language with some of their other
vehicles like for example we've seen
this grille on the front of the Jetta we
also get these LED parking lights around
the headlights they have a nice tan a
hook design and you see that on the
Tiguan as well
VW also added standard these bi-xenon
headlights to the CC which give a nice
bright white light thrown forward and I
like this navigation system we've seen
it before in other Volkswagens it's what
books are in calls it's RNs 315 but it's
surprising to see this navigation system
in this fairly expensive car
Volkswagen also uses it in their Jetta
and their beetle and some of the other
lower end vehicles but most look it has
a more upscale navigation system called
there are NS 5 10 that actually shows
things like traffic along with this
navigation system is they have this menu
system as well and I really like this
semicircular kind of menu thing it works
really well it's easy to find your menu
icons you can either just scroll this
little wheel here and pick everything or
you can punch these this touch screen
and touch the little icons and make it
react like that but one thing I don't
like
and too many auto makers do is
Volkswagen puts the iPod port all the
way over here in the glovebox pull this
little orange tab down which pulls this
whole array down pull the cord out plug
my ipod in and close the whole glove box
at backup when you're using route
guidance one thing that's nice in this
car is they've got a display in the
instrument cluster and this display will
show you pretty much everything it'll
show you audio information your phone
information and it'll also show your
route guidance there's also a voice
command in this car
accessing the different functions it's
as button right here it's got a little
mic symbol on it but the problem and
this kind of bugs being a car this
expensive this only works with the phone
system it won't let me access navigation
it won't let me access the music service
nothing else
now Volkswagen fits the CC with its dual
shift gearbox the DSG this is a dual
clutch transmission it's actually a
manual transmission or it's what they
call an automated manual and who can
choose sport mode or regular drive mode
and leave it to shift automatically now
under the hood we have Volkswagens psi
2-liter four-cylinder engine 2-liter
sounds like kind of a small engine to
power this mid-sized car but TSI means
turbocharged stratified injection that's
a technology beep Volkswagen is used for
the last decade if meat really means
it's a turbocharged direct-injection
engine it's so good that every other
automaker is ruling out similar engines
BMW and Ford all have them now VW is has
its engine for so long it's getting a
little bit long in the tooth they could
probably get more efficiency out of it
certainly the other automakers are
getting more power out of similarly
constructed engines but this does give
this car an average of about 25 miles
per gallon which is not bad even better
it gets the card at 60 miles per hour in
5.5 seconds which for a car like this
it's impressive
the CCS dual shift gearbox doesn't act
like a normal automatic transmission I'm
gonna put it in Drive it doesn't want to
creep forward I actually have to give it
a little gas to make it move
also it has electric power steering and
you can really feel that the way this
steering wheel feels you hear a slight
whirring sound which is the sound of the
electric motor making the wheels move
and giving you that that boost
transmission has the sport mode which
will keep it in lower gears and keep the
RPMs up and give you a decent amount of
power and will leave and let the rpms
ride all the way up to redline let's put
it in this manual mode by shifting the
gate over one and there you can push
forward to upshift pull back to
downshift and because of the DSG it
really grabs those gears pretty well you
don't get the kind of lag you get with a
torque converter transmission you also
get better fuel efficiency - which is
why bucks wagon went with the DSG in
this car I do like the ride feel in the
CC it's pretty comfortable although I
don't know if a lot of people would
really think it's much different than
say a Ford Fusion or a Hyundai Sonata
it feels pretty stable in the turns and
it handles the bumps pretty well 2013
volkswagen CC starts at about $30,000
for what they called a sport trim
everything you've seen here this is the
lux trim and that goes for thirty-five
thousand three hundred fifty five
dollars you can even get this car with a
v6 option in a higher trim level that
comes close to forty thousand dollars
for that kind of money I'd get a BMW
3-series or a mercedes-benz c-class or
even spend five thousand dollars less
and get a Hyundai Sonata or a Kia Optima
Turbo
