something like three televisions in it
these days and I'd wager most of those
are working just fine which if you're a
TV maker is not great news how do they
get us to buy another one two clues
OLED and 4k job says it's the best
design TV they've ever produced this
model here shows it cut away so that you
can see what the speakers will look like
it has four times the pixel resolution
of a standard 1080p television you can
see some more fanciful concept frames
that LG might start making here's the
bottom line
in 2012 LCD flat panel TV sales were off
one percent globally but all TV types
combined were off six percent and a big
18 percent in all the developed markets
and cratering in tech saturated but
economically cool Japan couple that with
the fact that every survey and every
user knows we're gonna be watching less
television on televisions going forward
and the TV makers have got to make a
serious play with new technologies this
is the XBR 850 a series at Sony's least
expensive 4k TV to date the Sony's
triluminos display technology it also
has Sony's dynamic edge backlighting so
and all we expect this to be a really
good performer some of the interesting
features of the TV it features a front
firing speakers set with a subwoofer and
also includes an upscale ER for all of
the 1080p content that you already have
given that there's no 4k already this is
the company's first use OLED technology
that allows the TV to achieve superior
picture quality compared to current
plasma and LED TVs unlike those standard
TVs this one has a curve and that's one
thing you can only get with OLED 4k TV I
think could be a bit of a crapshoot
first of all it's primarily a fidelity
argument in a nation that is not
composed of a bunch of video files it's
waiting for more really for any 4k
content to really flourish and that may
be a while before there's a fat pipeline
of that couple that with the fact that
one of the big benefits of 4k is being
able to sit closer to the TV get more
immersed in the picture and not see the
pixels that's a conversation that really
hasn't happened in the market yet so
these are all challenges to you really
wanting it I think OLED could be a
different story the core technology
organic light-emitting diodes emit color
and luminance on their own without any
backlight behind them that may sound
like a technical nicety but it actually
makes three important very obvious
things happen first of all black when an
OLED TV wants to show black it shows
black and that makes a big difference
because then all the colors around it
have that much more saturation and high
contrast the colors leap off the screen
like no other TV then there's thin
because OLED TVs have no backlight and
their technology is very thin to begin
with the overall finished television can
be as little as a third of an inch thick
front to back
they look fundamentally different on a
wall or in your living room consumers
buy TVs almost as much from the side
these days as the front so this is
important and finally there's green
consumers mostly give lip service to
this more than wallet service but OLED
TVs have the potential to consume very
little power though the initial models
are not that power stingy oh by the way
I find the curved screen on some of the
initial OLED TVs to be a bit of a red
herring I mean it makes a mockery of the
technologies innate thinness turning a
third of an inch panel into about a six
inch deep finished television I think
it's mostly there to let this technology
stand out in the store and a sea of flat
black panels a key point
OLED televisions can work pretty much
all of their magic on the content you
watch today where 4k TVs are sort of
waiting for their knight in shining
resolution in the form of native 4k
content
bottom line 4k + OLED will likely merge
and be what you buy in three to five
years making for a television like Noah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
