season here at CNET appliances and we
are testing out some robotic floor
cleaners that want to mop up after your
message and this here is the tech Oh
made smart made our s11 eight it's a 250
dollar robotic multi cleaner that has a
sweeper and a vacuum as well as a
mopping mode unlike the irobot braava
and iRobot scuba the techno made smart
maid doesn't have a water reservoir so
you're not gonna put water in it you're
not gonna have any water automatically
going down into your cloth you're gonna
need to use a wet damp cloth one of
those disposable wet wipes or just spray
to mess with some cleaner before you
start cleaning it's not a very well
designed machine doesn't have a lot of
the specific bells and whistles you want
from a robot vacuum can't schedule it
can't program it it doesn't really have
a smart way of navigating it's kind of
guessing and going randomly about the
room and that kind of works if you leave
it going long enough it will eventually
find its way across the entire floor
space but it does take a while
it won't know when it's done it doesn't
automatically stop when it's decided
it's finished it can't decide it's
finished so it's just not a very smart
smart maid and it's not much of a maid
either the cleaning was a little under
par not as good as the braava
not as good as the scuba it's got no
filter on that bin and that to me is a
bit of a deal-breaker and it's also just
not that powerful it's not a great
vacuum when it comes to the mopping side
of things it's kind of useless that the
mop is on the back end of the machine it
can't get up against the baseboards that
well and really can't get into corners
so you're really only gonna clean the
middle of your room and also it has to
be said you turn this thing upside down
it's a sad clown and I can't unsee that
I mean he's even crying if I press
sweeper plus it turns blue it's one of
the more comical designs I've ever seen
in a product no cleaner has really
perfected the category of wet robotic
cleaner it's still kind of in
development the companies are working on
getting that technology just right and
making it practical and usable it's not
quite there yet but the best we've
probably seen so far is the iRobot scuba
and the irobot braava is not bad either
considering that that only cost $50 more
than the $250
techo made smart made I probably go at
that instead Christina I'm right Chris
