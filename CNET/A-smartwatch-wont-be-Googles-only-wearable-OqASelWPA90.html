google issues for everything google that
we can pack inside of a show each week
now wearables is the new product
category for tech companies in 2014
google really pushed it forward with
glass and rumors of a nexus watch
indicate we could see some sort of
announcement for that in the next month
and just to give it a little more of a
push reports say google's android and
chrome chief sundar Pichai announced at
South by Southwest that a new android
sdk for developers interested in
building apps for their wearables will
arrive in the next two weeks now they
didn't mention any specific products but
Pichai said the new Android software
development kit for wearables will
incorporate wearables beyond just smart
watches he also added that Google's
approach to android on smartwatches will
be like their approach to Android on
smartphones translation put them on
everything which means my LED belt
buckle could eventually measure my heart
rate down there now more google news
from South by Southwest this time about
the chromecast so DARPA Chie said that
the googs is streaming media dongle will
go on sale in many more countries in the
next few weeks and they described us
sales in the millions without giving any
specific figures the chromecast has
expanded its support that now includes
YouTube Netflix Hulu Plus Pandora Plex
in a whole lot more but with the recent
release of the chromecast sdk online
streaming video service voodoo announced
that both its android and iOS apps will
add chromecast support very soon as
streaming will also be available through
the chrome web browser on Windows and
Mac now our do and beats music are also
expected to add support as well now we
told you about the asus chromevox a few
weeks ago and pre-orders are now open
starting out 179 dollars with an
expected release date of marks the 17th
it actually has three different
configurations but this is one of the
smallest chrome boxes ever and for those
of you who question how do you really
pronounced hay-soos well let me offer
the final word from them
asus repeat once again asus thank you
see it's not a sous or asus it's a sous
and you know i have to look that up
every time to remind myself i'll write a
little bit of samsung news Sammy's big
bad 12.2 inch Galaxy Tab is now
available starting at six 49 in black or
white with 32 or 64 gig versions this is
different from the Galaxy Note version
that's one hundred dollars more
expensive and includes a stylus this one
is stylists less now we've seen bigger
screens and phones so obviously we have
to have bigger screen size tablets to
also samsung launched their new music
streaming service called wait for it
milk music and it's powered by slacker
radio and available to customers of
select galaxy devices it offers 200
curated stations and the ability to
create your own based on an artists or
songs so what do you guys think you like
the name I mean everyone's going with
the melt does a body good reference but
i'm thinking more like the Milky Way is
part of the galaxy so Samsung's milk
music is part of the Samsung Galaxy SIII
ten people in a room actually had that
conversation now it's completely free
and ad free for a limited time and
available to download on Google Play all
right let's get to some quick stories
the pebble smartwatch has updated its
pebble app on Android and now allows
users to browse and install apps for new
additions like eBay and Evernote and
everyone loves new watch faces for
pebble as well also HP still in the
android tablet business has released
their new tablet called the HP 8 which
sports and all new design for HP that
looks exactly like an iPad Mini and
appears to be using an almost identical
7.85 inch IPS display at a friendlier
170 dollars and also the best quiz game
on planet earth really in my opinion
quizup is now available on Google Play
featuring over 400 topics real-time
online play rankings and chat and it
finally comes to android users so get on
that it's worth it and yes guys I will
end this with an obligatory leaked ACC
One m8 photo for the week see there it
is but even better website Android
he has all the full resolution
wallpapers before the phone even comes
out so you can have something like this
serene lake very nice or waving grass
which is kind of cool or colored lines
it's really your pic alright that's
going to do it for this week's show we
want to hear from you so email us at
Google issues at cnet com or just tweet
