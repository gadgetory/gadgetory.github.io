Facebook's Cambridge analytic a scandal
it only took him about five days give or
take plus the two to three years
Facebook knew about it and we didn't but
who's counting let's break it down
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted a
lengthy blog post on his profile page
where he says the company has quote a
responsibility to protect your data and
if we can't then we don't deserve to
serve you unquote he then dives into a
timeline of events involving Cambridge
analytical and its unauthorized access
of about 50 million Facebook users data
Zuckerberg also explained how Facebook
plans to better protect users going
forward first pointing to changes
already made in 2014 to limit app access
to profile information and then listing
off these three planned initiatives to
secure user data one investigate any app
that had access to large quantities of
information before that 2014 change and
make sure there's nothing shady
happening there to further restricting
app access to user information in a
variety of ways and three launching a
tool in the near future to help users
understand which apps have your data and
exactly how much on top of Zuck
explaining what happened from Facebook's
point of view two other posts went live
around the same time chief operating
officer Sheryl Sandberg posted a shorter
statement on her page outlining the
ideas put forth in Zuckerberg message
and Facebook itself posted an official
press release also detailing what it
plans to do to keep user data safe going
forward so what do you think of
Facebook's plan is it enough or is it
too little too late drop your thoughts
down in the comments we have tons of
Cambridge analytical coverage on CNET
com if you need more information about
this very crazy thing I'm Ashley it's
gotta be good humans</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
