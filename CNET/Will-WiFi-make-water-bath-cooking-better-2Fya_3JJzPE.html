the United States but Innova wants its
precision cooker to really connect to
your lifestyle the company's latest
precision cooker has Wi-Fi capabilities
now the last model just had Bluetooth
that you could connect to an app and it
was pretty useful but with Wi-Fi they're
hoping that you can take your cooking
remote so you can control your precision
cooker at work from the car or anywhere
you like
unfortunately the app isn't quite there
yet in terms of all its functionality
it's pretty limited and basically all
you can do is set the temperature set
the cook time and monitor the
temperature of your precision cooker
from a distance I know this latest
precision cooker works with the old app
and I really like the old app not only
does it have time and temperature gods
but it also has some recipes to help you
with sous-vide cooking especially if
you're new to the cooking method you
know it's great that the latest Innova
cooker works with the old app but it
gets a little clunky having both apps on
your phone and both giving you push
notifications when your food is ready
yeah I know but I want those reminders
but I don't need them two times over
fortunately the company is going to
integrate the apps so there will be one
unified app and I think this will be a
great move for the company in for this
cooker in the meantime I might hold off
on the Wi-Fi model until we see what the
Wi-Fi app has to bring to us I'm plus at
$199 you might want to make sure that
you really want this addition to your
kitchen what I really like the Innova
for is cooking meats like burgers or
sausages I found that the meat was
always super moist and juicy when it
came out of the water now one of the
downsides of sous-vide cooking is that
you have to dry off your meat and then
sear it on a cooktop with a pan not the
most convenient type of way to cook but
not too bad either if you get a good
steak or sausage out of it to learn more
about the Innova precision cooker with
Wi-Fi check out my full review at
