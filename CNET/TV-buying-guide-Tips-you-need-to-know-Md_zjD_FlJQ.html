a lots changed in the TV aisles since we
last talked about a year ago
I'm Brian Cooley with the things you
need to keep in mind when you go
shopping for a TV now perhaps the
biggest news is plasmas gone Panasonic
was the first to get up the ghost in
mid-2014 LG followed late in the year
and samsung says 2014 walls to me their
last year of selling plasma TVs in the
u.s. so here the technologies you're
looking at now LCD now today that means
typically LED LCDs that means a liquid
crystal display on the front like on a
computer monitor or most televisions but
then in the back it's lit by
high-performance LEDs like the
light-emitting diodes you see in
flashlights today but specially tuned
for television production then there's
Oh le D organic light-emitting diode
these televisions tend to be very thin
have amazingly deep black saturated
colors low power consumption and in fact
the best TV in the world to our eyes
right now is an OLED TV the downside is
this is a maturing cutting-edge
technology so you're gonna pay quite a
bit if you wait a couple of years you'll
probably get a better more refined OLED
TV for even less money but if you're an
early adopter go ahead and jump in
they're amazing
now the next technology to be aware of
is resolution the current TV mainstream
is called Full HD or 1080p that refers
to a thousand eighty lines of picture
counted from top to bottom this is the
vast majority of TVs out there and that
also matches very well to the majority
of content and player devices that exist
out there
then there's the much talked about 4k
which is a TV with twice the lines and
twice the columns of pixels and
therefore four times the resolution of
1080 now that doesn't mean it looks four
times as sharp but in a really large TV
it can make a noticeable difference the
TVs are coming on market and good
numbers the content is one of the big
questions though there's not a lot now
though it's growing fast you'll
typically find it on streaming platforms
actually Amazon and Netflix for example
the satellite guys are beginning to get
into 4k distribution in a limited way
and there's also talk of a Sumer
blu-ray Disc 4k standard but you have to
ask yourself do you really want to rebuy
your library of discs now 4k TVs as I
mentioned are coming on the market in
good numbers and the prices are starting
to fall rapidly as well which is a
hallmark of the flat panel TV industry
however we're still at the earlier stage
where not all models are considered very
good or better so make sure you shop
carefully and check our reviews in
detail before you lay down some money on
a 4k set here's where it all comes
together the bottom line is the best LED
LCD TVs in the market right now are also
4k models so you may end up buying a 4k
TV even though you don't necessarily
want one but it's good future proofing
and they're all also excellent full HD
televisions finally streaming
everybody's streaming video these days
so make sure you've got a good plan to
get to that in your new television just
about all TV's arrive with some form of
built-in streaming in the television
itself however we remain big fans of the
add-on set-top boxes like a Roku box or
an Apple TV there's an inexpensive class
of add-ons that you've called the sticks
if you will streaming sticks like Google
chromecast and Amazon fire TV that work
really well are very cheap and a great
way to gift someone into the streaming
era if they're not really up on it just
yet also the first TV just arrived on
the market in 2014 with built-in roku
technology their interface their
streaming and their library of content
some final thoughts first curved screens
they've been on the market about a year
now and a year in we still need their
basically gimmicks
don't sweat buying one and when it comes
to brands I'm sure you think about the
big boys like Samsung LG Vizio Panasonic
but don't leave out some of the upstarts
that are making some very interesting
products they would be companies like
TCL and Hisense and higher you can find
