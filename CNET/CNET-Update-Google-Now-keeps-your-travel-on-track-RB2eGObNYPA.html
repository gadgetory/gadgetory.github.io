things in your life I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update Google's
rival to Siri called Google now is
adding more information to be of
assistance when you're traveling Google
now does more than answer your spoken
questions it has these information cards
that pop up to tell you relevant
information about what's going on in
your world today for example there are
cards that let you know about upcoming
appointments or the best route to take
home after work but now when you're on a
trip users could see a card with details
about car rental reservations and
directions to the rental center it knows
this information based on what's in your
email and calendar if you're going to a
concert your ticket will be ready to
scan if you take public transit Google
now will inform you of the last train or
bus so you won't miss it and when
leaving for work it can send a message
to your loved ones that you're on your
way home is with a setting called
commute sharing it also is adding NCAA
scores for college football fans and if
you're watching TV it can listen to a
few seconds of audio to tell you some
basic facts about the show right now
only android users can get these extra
cards in the latest version of the
Google Search app a few updates are
coming to social networks you'll now
have more control the next time you use
the login with Facebook button on a
mobile app now mobile apps must
separately ask for permission to post
anything back to a person's Facebook
account so you can log in with Facebook
and never worry about it posting
anything to your profile you don't want
if you so wish and LinkedIn group pages
are getting a fresh redesign among the
changes is the ability to toggle between
popular and recent updates there's a new
type of wearable gadget that is asking
for your money to become a reality but
it might make you uncomfortable it's
called capture it's a wristband that
records audio around you 24 hours a day
if you thought Google glass was an
invasion of privacy anyone with this
wristband is recording what you say at
all times it gives you the power to get
an instant replay on what was just set
around you maybe you want to save or
share a joke a friend told you you want
to save the audio of something
funny your kids said or you can even
share proof of customer service gone
wrong it'll send the audio snippets to
an app so you can edit them or save them
before sharing to social media this
product is hoping to raise money on
Kickstarter on September third but it
could cause some legal complications
several states have laws that say you
can't record a private conversation
without both parties knowing they are
being recorded if you're not in a public
place and there's a reasonable
expectation of privacy some people might
get in trouble with sharing these
snippets of audio on social media that's
your tech news update for more details
