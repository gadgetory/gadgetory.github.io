to tap that app the show where we
rundown the hottest applications for
your mobile doohickey or whatever this
week it is all about Thanksgiving here
in the United States and for a lot of
you I know that means you're starting to
panic maybe you've never made the big
turkey dinner before maybe grandma's
coming and she's gonna judge your gravy
you need help our sister site chow com
has created the thanksgiving dinner
coach app it's free for the iphone and
ipod touch actually i downloaded it onto
my ipad and i made it big because i like
to use this for cooking so hopefully an
ipad version is next also speaking of
cooking thanks to chow for letting me
shoot this in their Test Kitchen I'm
never leaving anyway dinner coach app
lets you choose from nine recipes here
pretty basic thanksgiving fare nothing
that's going to scare off your picky
eater friends you can delete whatever
recipes you don't think you'll use
except for the turkey actually so
vegetarians you might want to look
elsewhere anyway once you choose the
recipes you want to use let's see green
beans turkey gravy yes it creates an
entire shopping list for you now what I
really like about this shopping list is
that it also includes the gear you're
going to need like the pitcher the whisk
the frying pan the roast or that kind of
thing but anything you already have you
just tap it and then it disappears from
your list off you go okay then and this
is where it's really helpful it creates
an entire cooking schedule for you by
day so what you need to do on Monday
defrost your turkey what you need to do
wednesday and what order you need to
cook things so you can have everything
ready all at the same time this is a
super useful organizational tool now
this is a pretty basic app it's probably
best for people who haven't cooked
Thanksgiving dinner before or who are
just interested in keeping things simple
and organized for example I wish that
you could import other recipes from the
child database there's a lot of good
stuff there but in this case you're
pretty much stuck with these ones here
if you wanted to customize you might
want to try something like I feast
thanksgiving or you could combine this
with the turkey recipes app in the
itunes app store that's got 38 different
turkey recipes also i would love it if
there was a way to email someone the
shopping list so that you could send
someone else to the store or maybe even
print it out
all in all though if you're nervous
about Thanksgiving dinner or you just
want a good way to stay organized this
app is dead simple to use and it's free
so you know if you can take the stress
out of cooking that means that you can
just serve a good meal sit back and go
to your happy place while Aunt Alice
criticizes your housekeeping again for
