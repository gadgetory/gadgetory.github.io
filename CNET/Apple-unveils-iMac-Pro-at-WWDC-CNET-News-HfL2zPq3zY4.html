features the same great design as our
27-inch iMac but it's in this seriously
badass face gray finish and with that
stunning new color and gorgeous 5k
display this is without a doubt the most
beautiful iMac we've ever made the iMac
pro has a greater than eighty percent
increase in cooling capacity so that
means we can deliver unbelievable
performance while still maintaining the
quiet operation you'd expect from an
iMac so the iMac pro is going to ship
with an 8 core Xeon processor it's also
going to ship with a 10 core Xeon
processor and then we thought you know
we've gone this far let's get really
nutty so we're going to offer it with up
to 18 4 so the iMac pro is going to use
AMD's Radeon Vega graphics this is their
brand new workstation class graphics
architecture it features a completely
new GPU core and high bandwidth on
package memory it's going to be
available with up to 16 gigabytes of
vram and over 400 gigabytes per second
of memory bandwidth because our
implementation is going to offer up to
11 teraflops of single-precision compute
power that's three times more than the
best GPU and a mac pro so that means the
imac pro can deliver up to 22 teraflop
of path decision computation this is a
really big deal for things like machine
learning development so we're going to
let you configure it with up to 128
gigabytes of ECC memory that's twice
what you can do in a standard 27 at die
max
and up to four terabytes of three
gigabyte per second SSD now the I'm I
Pro is also gonna have a full complement
of high performance IO including four
Thunderbolt three ports and for the
first time ever in any Mac built in 10
Gigabit Ethernet so you can hook up to
5k displays and two high-performance
raid arrays no iMac before it could ever
do that and when you combine that with
the internal display that means the iMac
pro can drive up to 44 million pixels
there's so much more we don't have time
to get into things like a 1080p FaceTime
camera a user-configurable VESA mount
option two times wider AVX instructions
and even a UHS 2 SD card slot well this
is the starting configuration of the
iMac pro and we're going to price it at
just 49.99</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
