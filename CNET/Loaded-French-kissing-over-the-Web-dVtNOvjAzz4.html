and it's time to get loaded are IM is
going to start using bing research in
motion's blackberry world conference had
a surprise guest mr. steve ballmer he
says bing search and bing maps will be
built into the operating system of our
IM handsets in the future the two
companies have been direct competitors
for years but they've also been losing
market share in the smartphone industry
I don't think Bing is the answer though
EA is buying firemen this is the company
that brought popular games like real
racing 2 and flight control to the iPad
fireman's games were among few that
stayed in the top 100 apps list since
launch the deal is expected to close
within the next four weeks macrumors is
saying the new iphone will not hit in
june or july according to an AT&amp;amp;T
customer care rep Apple has officially
told AT&amp;amp;T a new iphone will not launch
during the usual june-july timeframe
reportedly a customer noticed that
eligibility for his new iphone upgrade
was pushed back several months said
person called the carrier and was told
the new version is coming just not in
mid-summer the flipcam may be no more
but the olympus LS 20 m is a good
alternative the pocket cam captures
1080p shoots 30 frames per second and
records audio in 24-bit the LCD is 2
inches and it supports a feature that
allows upside down recording just
because it's due out in june for three
hundred dollars and if you've dreamed of
frenching a member of your MMO guild
you'll be rooting for this project the
university of electro communications in
tokyo is working on a kiss transmission
device it uses motion sensing to record
your tongue movements and then sends
that information to a machine that will
translate your tongue message into a
partner's mouth it's also pre-recorded
so multiple persons can access the same
french kiss nothing says I love you like
giving the same kiss to five different
people that's your news for the day I'm
Marco say Oprah cnet com and you
