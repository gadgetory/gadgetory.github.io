2 now we ordered the International
unlocked version because the US model
won't be available until the end of the
month we hope but I could not wait to
get my hands on it now the original note
became a little bit of a cult hit you
know it's the huge I know I'm not
supposed to say phablet but it's like
phone / tablet so everybody started
calling it that and it was horrible but
it kind of caught on and it comes with
this at whatever I want to get inside
the box let's see what the new one looks
like instead of talking about the old
one now we just got this box so I'm
actually hoping that the note 2 is
inside and that we somehow didn't get it
screwed up oh yeah alright let's see
let's get to the good Samsung Galaxy
Note 2 note the resemblance to the Apple
packaging I'm just saying no reason
alright
all right whoo all right this one is
white so you can see it looks actually
quite a lot like thick Samsung Galaxy s3
let's get it out of the box just for you
unboxing fans we'll see what comes
inside the box we have our Quick Start
Guide charging cable comes with ear pods
I mean headphones these are kind of the
in-ear style and they've got volume
control on there and it looks like maybe
some phone-answering that's a nice touch
because you are never going to hold that
phone up to your ear it's good to have
these alright we have our battery that's
good oh look it even comes with like a
bunch of different year buds I gotta say
preferable to the ear pods which are one
size fits all and we have ah there's all
kinds of stuff in here we got our power
brick kind of an interesting design
there so this note is actually a little
bit bigger than the last model although
it's definitely lighter of course I
don't have a battery in yet but the
width seems to be about the same it's a
big phone don't get me wrong I laughed a
lot when I heard that there was gonna be
bigger because I thought to myself yeah
you know what I really want the note to
be bigger nevertheless here it is
okay a real question is where's my
stylus oh there it is it's at the bottom
am I too stupid for the stylus I get
this thing out of here oh oh okay
stylus fits nice and snug let's get the
battery in here we have our SIM card
slot it also takes a microSD expandable
memory I'm a big fan of that hopefully
it's at least a little bit charged up
this is the danger of the true unboxing
okay let's see if we can get an artless
guy to come on there we go
Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and after a while
with this three I have to say it doesn't
feel that gigantic it definitely feels
bigger but it's not so shocking as the
original note which really felt like why
are you doing this
alright let's get to the specs on this
bad boy as I mentioned the screen is
slightly larger than the original it's a
5.5 inch HD Super AMOLED screen with a
1280 by 720 resolution the original note
is 5.3 inches it runs Android 4.1 jelly
bean that is good news there's a 1.6
gigahertz quad-core processor in the
international version the original was a
dual-core processor it also comes with
that redesigned stylus the s-pen it's
now more ergonomic and has a thicker
longer body than the original it comes
in 16 gigs 32 gigs or 64 gigs and it has
2 gigs of ram on board there is a
microSD slot and it's expandable up to
64 gigs if you just get the 16 gig model
there's an 8 megapixel camera with an
LED flash and a 1.9 megapixel
front-facing camera it also has a 3100
milliamp battery which means it should
get decent battery life you're gonna
want that with this big screen now the
one complaint that people have about a
phone this size other than the problem
with the pockets is that it's also a
little bit awkward to talk on although I
don't think that's such a big deal
um can you hear me I know I'm not
totally sold on that I'm not totally
told sold on the stylus but I'm willing
to give it a try
unfortunately I won't have that much
longer with this phone because we are
going to torture it I hope it survives I
kind of want to know what life is like
with a phablet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
