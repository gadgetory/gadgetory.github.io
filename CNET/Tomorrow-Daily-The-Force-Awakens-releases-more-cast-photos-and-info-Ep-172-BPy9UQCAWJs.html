Star Wars stuff that is tomorrow
greetings citizens of the Internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I am
Ashley sceva and joining me as always

waste any more time let's hit deadlines
may the 4th be with you elf and with you
always thank you so it's May fourth may
the 4th has hat it's happening right now
it's star wars day and now this is like
an official thing this is official Star
Wars now it's now I feel like Disney
took it on it's like okay it's
officially star wars day everybody
starts selling special star wars of
merchandise indeed but more importantly
today we got some really great reveals
from Star Wars Episode 7 these are their
images and also a news article that came
out in Vanity Fair of all places I'm so
so here's the cover we get to see some
of the cast we get to see up Chewbacca
Han Solo Chewbacca has not aged a day
I'll be all again he looks like he's on
on heartbeat or Tiger Beat yeah he's on
he's on wiki beat yeah so let's talk
about the reveals that we got to see um
first off here check this out this is a
stitch together picture of all of these
like crazy of like critical critters
that are in aliens that are going to be
seeing if every animal Oh practical
which is exciting this is like from a
star wars fan point it's not cg there's
no Jar Jar Binks is in there so that is
art that's our first photo of like what
its gonna look like what a set piece
looks like oh look at this heroic okay
so this is oscar isaac as he is the he
Poe Dameron yeah Cameron Poe Damron this
is my man crush monday uh so that's
that's er that's a reveal kind of
without his helmet I don't think we'd
see less camellia ok what else we got
next yes we got off a favorite yeah so
yeah I don't know how to pronounce
her name lupita nyong'o okay Oscar Oscar
winner yes he's playing a CGI character
named maz kanata and it's gonna be CG
and she's also a space pirate which I
can now die happy because one I love her
she's an amazing actress and to uh
Lupita Nyong'o is a space pirate is
pretty much the epitome of all my dreams
in life this is I've I mean literally
there is no better character I could
imagine her as and I can't wait to see
what her mocap what her alien actually
looks like little dots on her face is
gonna be so detailed but no reveals for
that next photo okay that's set photo
that's uh that's not none on kylo Ren's
jakku this is Ray Ray Daisy really scary
yeah yeah so there's ray on her little
little speeder this is uh it's not
Tatooine jakku it's jakku is a planet
yes Jack oj ignite you uh and and the I
like that these characters sort of
remind me of Tusken Raiders kind of like
Sam people but not quite I'll either way
all the practical effects look amazing
next photo okay there it is okay so this
is the big reveal in my opinion which is
the character kylo Ren and this is Adam
driver this is the villain that we see
with the weird red lightsaber that has
like the three points and also he has
the mask on but he is actually this is
apparently with his secret hideout which
is on a frozen planet cookie Hoth might
not be could be good enough maybe some
misdirect like touch it like we all
thought the jock who was tattooing we
all thought it was tattooing now maybe
this is Hoff maybe it isn't but this is
our first image of him and actually our
big reveal that he is playing the
villain I'm so excited about this oh he
looks terrifying oh yeah and then the
brain trust is they're saying I have
Kerris yeah there's um JJ Abrams kappa
kappa dat a composer um got his name is
slipping Collins John William sorry yeah
yeah so it's pretty cool that's that's a
great but it's gonna be known forever as
like the themes from his movies he's
gonna change his name to songs yeah he
just things like what's your name and
he's like Bennett but I've ever bet that
I've ever met there yeah his wife has to
do that every time caroline is like
so there you go again if you pick up the
issue of vanity fair think it's coming
up next week next to the 12th on
newsstands and then if you have a
digital subscription it's the 7th so
it'll be out they don't really want to
crack into it but there's some really
great quotes that are out including one
where JJ Abrams reveals that he kind of
wanted to put a dead Jar Jar in the
movie hate that you wanted to put his
bones in there and a lot of other really
great quotes so go check go check that
out hopefully you get a chance Morgan
I'm gonna buy I'm gonna buy that yeah
one hundred percent they've trying to
decide if I wanted on the iPad or if I
want an actual physical copy cuz I feel
like having a physical copy would be
more fun oh yeah I'm like dude all the
layouts and stuff so i might get that
i'm gonna get an actual news damn well
guess what Ashley that's our that's our
hashtag of the day ok so it is a TD
force use the Force what is art what do
we want to know we want to know what
plot line do you want to see in the new
Star Wars movie like what is it what's
the what's the problem it doesn't have
to be a main storyline either it can be
anything like bb-8 invents uh I don't
know for like fried chicken and waffles
in the Star Wars rebirth whatever it is
like I want to know what plot line you
want to see in the force awaken here's
what i want to say okay i want to seal a
I use the Force you want to see ladies I
want to say goodbye I want I want layout
it like just even if it's cuz I know
she's not gonna be like a hero the movie
even if she's just like like force you
know mind control somebody or just like
like move something to somewhere else
like even just a small thing will set me
off everybody really liked the nut what
do you want you want some look wiki
battles you want to I would like to see
Chewbacca actually rip the arms off
somebody after losing and Paula chest
like see that and Anna and then I as a
secondary i would also really like to
see Lupita nyong'o's character the space
pirate have a I would like to see her
fly the Millennium Falcon oh no you want
as you want a space and maybe and maybe
I'd like to see Han Solo past the
Millennium Falcon down to her give it to
her cuz she's a space pirate its kind of
roguish maybe rush like Han Solo I might
want to see that that's all I'm saying
all right maybe that's why guys are good
so TD force tell us for us tell us what
you want to see him Star Wars Episode 7
very cool
Oh some other crazy spacy statistics are
happening in real life ok so Amazon did
is doing what okay well first I have to
tell you about power wall also amazona
be the last one so power wall is Elon
Musk's new crazy idea of like he's
always had these great ideas but awesome
actually not so crazy it's pretty
impressive so last week on Thursday Elon
Musk announced power wall so there it is
you can see it's like a little sort of
unit that mounts on your wall on your
house and what this is is a battery
backup product and so you mount this on
your house there's 14 houses and one for
industrial use and what it does is you
have solar panels on your house it
stores electricity from those solar
panels so they are see you can see oh
look it's like filling up and then so
it'll fill those up during non-peak
hours so it may be like you know later
in the day or earlier in the morning you
get Sun it'll fill this up and then
during peak hours when people use the
most electricity your house will draw
power from that pack from from power
from power wall so that way you're not
paying as much because obviously during
peak hours that's when your rates are
the highest and then on top of that it
would help during a blackout so if there
was a blackout or a lot of times in
California when it gets really really
hot we have rolling blackouts because
the state the grid cannot handle
everybody running your air conditioning
well this would sort of alleviate some
of those problems especially and also
potentially bring this type of
technology electricity in almost a
generator kind of sense to maybe
emerging markets in the future so this
might be something that a less-developed
home might be able to have going at some
point in the future obviously this is
gonna be really expensive at first but
in the future we might be able to see
people have electricity and a little bit
more of a consistent way in more
developing countries so pretty cool
stuff there's no reason not to use solar
energy yeah i would i would a lan if
your I know you're watching clearly a
huge fan of the show uh i would suggest
maybe doing some starter demos and like
have some people enter a contest and
maybe some lower income housing they get
it first so they can try it out they'll
get to save money you'll get to have
some good PR on your hands and also you
know try it out so I
know a lot about solar power and how
people sort of use it i guess one of the
things is that's kind of problematic is
when you have seen these solar panels a
lot of times they will sell that extra
energy that excess energy back to the
power company first for like a wholesale
rate but then it gets sold back out to
people at at retail cost which is not
really efficient the other thing is is
like there's a sort of illness is kind
of looking again cut out that middleman
so this is a really interesting it's
like a bank it saves it rather than yeah
your banking energy Dinkin for when you
need it the most which is either when
your power goes out or during peak hours
so which is pretty cool um certified
installers are gonna be able to buy
these there are two different versions
there's a seven and a 10 kilowatt hour
version and they'll be 3035 hundred
dollars for installers to buy and then
of course they'll have to turn that
around like then you go to a certified
installer say I'd like to have this in
my house and so they would they put it
in your house I don't know i don't i
think that is not including the cost of
also having solar put in your house
which it's kind of a big deal but of
course you get like um you get rebates
and things like that from the government
and for you know doing putting putting
your house in a sort of green energy
state so that's helpful they're open
source patents once again open source so
anybody can improve upon this technology
just like Tesla released the patents for
their cars their larger cars and someday
maybe homes with solar panels would be
grid independent they would not need the
grid that would be amazing which would
be pretty cool so um limited production
later this year and then as soon as
they're giant like gigawatt battery
factory or whatever it is in Nevada
opens up they'll go into like full
production modes next year nice crazy
stuff yeah gimme so okay so talk about
Amazon please okay so it's not quite
amazon it's just the co-founder bands on
Jeff Bezos it accounts for me is he was
in the news this last week unfortunately
i wish i could tell you they were
launching amazon space where they like
deliver like two day prime to the ISS
but no it just takes know they send your
package to space and it's a pre i'm
gonna get yeah exactly um so he
announced last week that his spaceflight
company which i didn't know he had his
face flight company i don't think
anybody really did Blue Origin blue
origin is his spaceflight company they
had completed their first space flight
test with a new space
vehicle which you're seeing on the
screen right now called new Shepherd
this spacecraft is attempting to do the
same thing SpaceX is trying to deal with
his dragon rockets so they're trying to
create a reusable rocket they want to be
able to land these things and relaunch
them which is pretty interesting it
carries up to six people its first test
flight was last week and everything went
according to plan except for the landing
which of course the rocket crashed so it
didn't quite make it I think that sucks
right now is the workout but but I love
jeff bezos really trying to like spin it
in a positive way and he was like if
this were a traditional mission it would
have been a rousing success because you
know Rockets crash at the end of
traditional missions and they're trying
to make this reusable so um so
everything else went according to plan
but unfortunately not the landing did
not but they want to fly it again soon
they said they are making more
propulsion modules as we speak and as
soon as that's ready they'll be able to
try again and they want to do a test
flight every single month for the next
couple years who do you thinks gonna get
there first Oh blue origins gonna get
there first do you think Elon Musk kind
of get there it's gonna be I think it's
gonna be speeding SpaceX yeah okay tell
you what you take SpaceX and I'll take
margin I'll take Blue Origin and not
because I believe that SpaceX isn't
gonna make it I just think we need to
split the data center I'm gonna give you
a piece of information that might you
actually might feel excited about that
might help your cause blue origin is
thinking about using a particular type
of kind of reusable where it's the best
way to describe this they would actually
like catch it in midair and instead of
trying to land it they would like kind
of catch it in midair and like attach a
parachute I like I was reading it's like
super vague the way that they described
it there there is some mid air reusable
theory that they're gonna try to do at
some point I don't know if it's with
this particular rocket I don't think it
is but there's some technology that
they're considering with some new I
think engine that they want to do sort
of mid air rescues of like these Rockets
as they come back down as opposed to
trying to land them vertically on to
Terra Firma so that might help your
cause maybe it'll help your guns okay so
blue origin SpaceX a sex let's do this
team dragon team dragon um but that's it
for the news that's it for the headlines
we will be right back with a
with a VR headset that might add a few
more senses to your virtual reality
experience and of course your TD tat
user feedback which was amazing and our
photogra for the day so don't click wit
smart daily but before we go check out
this labyrinth coffee table
welcome back to the show we've returned
it's a Monday which means it's time to
take a look at a crowdfunding effort and
decide whether or not we'd give it our
money it's time for back at her hackett
we've all seen tumblers of like people
using oculus rift people using VR
headsets can you can you there you go
that's that's the look yep that's the
one it's really wait do or on time there
we go great um I just want to make sure
people have that for a gift that face is
glorious so um if you haven't felt
ridiculous using an oculus rift or any
other VR headset both of us this is
going to add to that because this is the
feel real VR mask and this thing
attaches don't say to your mouth via
magnet to the bottom half of your face
and adds wind heat smell water mist and
vibration to your VR experience it is
very weird hot air and cool air like you
look like it probably makes you look
into super villain do they show you look
like you're in def Punk actually the
hell there's a whole helmet will get
some good so it uses batteries it
connects to your computer via bluetooth
there's a microphone in it it has
removable smell cartridges up to 7 yep
there they are there's smell cartridges
so you can put out like coffee or like
other weird smells uh there's a neat
what they're calling an easy SDK for
developers to integrate this headset
into their games and apps they're saying
it will only take a few clicks like and
you'll get you know Bailey put it in
there they works with actual perfume
like incent companies to get these
cartridges right apparently like this is
sort of a thing and then also they have
some software called the feel real
player which will let you open up a
movie and add your own feel real VR
effects to films so you can wear like
the mask whatever oh yeah this is where
I was up in Big Sur and it smells like
pine here so i'm going to add pine scent
okay so here's the vert headset the vert
headset you put your phone in there and
this is sort of the top-of-the-line
model as 3d video to the micro projector
inside it's a little micro projector I
mean it's a little bit insane
as I'm down with the full helmet
downsville helmet okay so there's
there's actually multiple products in
this Kickstarter so there's the mask
which is the bit the base thing and then
there is a helmet which is the full
experience and then verte is the top end
model with this like micro projector in
it so um yeah that's uh that's happening
okay so that's a Kickstarter we can we
go to cost now or I mean like how much
you have to donate to get we okay they
want fifty thousand dollars which is it
bad not a lot of money yeah currently as
I'm looking at it on the website they
have 8802 dollars they have 23 days left
maybe okay okay uh starting off if you
want the consumer version the early
consumer version of the mask so not a
dev kit early consumer version it is
three hundred dollars okay and it comes
with a charging docking station a demo
the feel real player and 3d game with
all the way what's with the sexy image
uh yeah there's a lot of that it ok
anyway continue sorry sorry if you would
like the helmet the early consumer
version of the helmet docking station a
demo feel real player and 3d game with
all effects that is six hundred dollars
and if you would like the special
edition VIP consumer version of the vert
helmet which is the one with the UM
projector micro projector and it he'll
have your engraved name in it it's
special like matte black and red design
all the stuff seven hundred and fifty
dollars estimated delivery by the way
October 2015 let's keep in mind that
oculus rift is not even available right
now and may not be until next year we
don't even know if oculus is going to be
ready to release the rift in 2015 we
have no idea hololens says this year we
still don't know there's no release
dates for anything except smartphones so
just as an FYI this says October 2015
and we don't know when anything else any
other major headset is getting released
okay so go ahead i love i love the RNA
are yep i love the idea of us pushing to
further immersion
and i love that these guys are doing
this microphone microphone the audio
there's still so many there's with the
but there's still so many hurdles we
have to overcome before we need smell
like we need to get 360 sound which
we're still working on huh-uh we need to
get the actual feeling of immersion but
I'll never been like I want to get but I
I never get excited about smell like
they never get Avengers like I don't
want to smell the Hulkbuster fight I
don't know it's like charred bodies and
the Hulk is probably not he doesn't seem
like you would smell very good and then
it's like metal and burning and lasers
like I don't want to smell that I don't
want to snow I like the idea that but
the thing that excited me was the idea
of going to full helmet where it starts
controlling everything around you cuz ya
the VR headset on you can still look
slide your phone and you can have the
helmet and it like blows on your hair if
you're like sailing through the air
that's kind of cool okay so I say oh
it's only 50,000 they want they only
want 50,000 they're not even at ten they
have 23 days left and they want at least
three hundred dollars just for the lower
mask and 600 for the full face mask oh I
don't pack it I spent it on Hackett can
I go middle ground can you say
tentatively placed on hold like support
placed on hold until further notice like
I'm just I'm gonna cautiously watch from
a distance I see okay so not hack it but
just maybe a little maybe a little we'll
just keep it Barry okay what about you I
think I'm the same actually I'm just
gonna say no like I'm gonna say I'm out
I don't I don't need this um I mean
listen guys I'm all about smell-o-vision
and weird like 1950s b-movie technology
made into like futuristic technology but
I I don't there are so many situations
and games and movies that I feel I do
not want to smell not even that I would
be interested in wouldn't like it but
just i I don't I don't want to be there
like I don't want to be in those stitch
I don't want to be placed even further
in those situations I think it would be
gross like if you did a drastic world
one you'd smell dinosaur poop probably a
lot I know he went straight to poop but
yeah but I say look at this drastic
world I mean that would be
like one of the top smells in that park
am i right because they're giant
creatures probably dead carcasses are
harvested great to poo poo like you
would not want it's not even going to
see it let me explain it this way you go
to SeaWorld and there's not a lot of
good smells there you go to any zoom but
it's like fish it's not proposing any
zoo there's not a lot of good smells
there where is it wait so Ashley
actually goes well if I'm gonna try VR
headset and it's gonna have
smell-o-vision definitely gonna smell
poop cuz you will assume you're like oh
that's his out if I experienced Hulk and
you'd smell Hulk poop like I'm saying he
would be stinky he probably smell like
sweat he's his smell sweaty seems like
he lifts that's what I'm saying fair
enough what have you went to like a
simulation where you're flying through
the air or okay fine like like Soarin
over California Disneyland yeah great
sign me up but then you fly over poop
but then what if you fly over a cow farm
that's what I'm saying sometimes
smell-o-vision is not a thing I need in
my future technology that's all I'm
saying that's all that's my final word
on that all right but yeah it's called
the feel real it's all one word feel
real virtual reality mask you probably
don't smell poop but there that's
probably not but you know what I bet you
someone will make a cartridge for it
yeah it does come tomorrow yes so there
you go and you can probably prank your
friends yes very true um speaking of
friends we have friends that's you guys
so it's time for user feedback
last week we talked about that really
awesome tattoo that came to life the AR
tattoo I'm of that yeah that was soo to
the comic creator for modern plexus ok
so we asked you guys to use the hashtag
TD tats tell us what tattoo you and
gettin how it would come to life you did
not disappoint as always Aidan wrote in
and said i would get Pikachu from
pokemon doing Thunder shock or a one
from Harry Potter illuminating that's
very cool brilliant um Neil wrote in and
said hollow lens with tattoos and have
to dear etro platformers with levels
based on your body hashtag pants must be
worn shakti tap Joseph wrote in and said
I would get a QR code so that if I had
to go to the hospital and was
unresponsive they could scan the code
and pull up my info that's actually uh
it's not a thing but it is something
people have talked about is these sort
of these little kind of like medical
code that you'd be able to scan in and
then if something happened to you they'd
be able to sort of tap into an in case
of emergency sort of thing but I think
the big thing is is like if you're
walking around with a tattoo you
wouldn't want other people to scan it
and get that info so kind of but I
totally know what you're talking about
it's a good idea um Daniel wrote in and
said I would have a tattoo where it's
8-bit Mario but I can play the game by
holding it up to a nap oh wow like that
all right um yeah little 8-bit Mario
that comes to life uh an ultra super
wrote in and said my teen eat at would
be shaped like Shrek and when i unlock
my phone with it the phone would say its
all ogre now hahahahaha shrek is love
shrek his life I like it then we got a
couple emails Rob said I'd get the Star
Wars logo tattoo including a space
sleeve and when I waved the phone of the
logo x-wings would fly out and shoot TIE
fighters and lead up to the blowing up
of the Death Star all this is happening
while the space animated in the
background of the Star Wars theme played
that is intense that's like a living
sleeve you're gonna get sued the
illustrated man yeah you're gonna get a
CMD know it's a that's a good idea and
then Nick wrote and said hi Kailen
Ashley that's the guy who wrote in the
lawn Kaname Melly said I promise I'll
keep it short this time a tattoo of a
small train on my wrist with AR the
train would come to life and chug its
way up my arm and down the other my
hometown is famous for train so it'd be
like having a little piece of home with
me wherever I go and then the second one
I was a wolf on my leg when viewed as a
are the wolf had come to life and do my
bidding similar to tattoo from the movie
Elektra what at home he could terrorize
my cats and see assuming they haven't
feel feline AR devices I simply
Kickstarter opportunity and away from
home he could be sort of a bodyguard he
brought me wouldn't be too effective
today if he starts growling I would know
I need to start running haha keep up the
good work nick- 500 points for electro
reference electrode I know exactly what
scene you're talking about but but also
now I'm er I remember plus a thousand
points for AR goggles for cats so we
said well he said like assuming they
invent feline a our devices i smell a
Kickstarter opportunity I feel like
maybe a our headsets for cats might be a
thing ya think we never really had to
play them they could just give them like
augmented reality ball of twine they can
check a laser pointer they could chase
any time there you go what are you some
money huh yeah yeah our goggles for your
kid here you're shut up tribute to talk
about cat singers turbulence shut up
turbulence leave me alone get out of
here first problems go check your
netflix and my cat I don't have time to
play that I gotta bite an AR head inside
your goggles ridicula that that image
sounds really cool though I'd love to
see a vision with it that'd be pretty
awesome little iron man cat a little
higher man catch a baby um all right
guys we got to talk about our last piece
of user feedback which is always our
phone talk for the day
