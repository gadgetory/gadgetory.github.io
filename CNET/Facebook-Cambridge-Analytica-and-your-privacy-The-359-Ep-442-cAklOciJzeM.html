all about the suck and to do so we got
Ben Fox Ruben and special guest rich
Nieva hey rich get that great to have
you back
hello thanks for having me suck yeah
thanks for being here you saved that all
morning just to do that now didn't I did
that's the only reason I invited Red
John so I can I can drop the mic and
leave now it feels a feel that felt so
good either way
rich is visiting New York and during his
time here we figured it would be a great
opportunity to just kind of do a
retrospective and talk a lot about your
reporting on Cambridge analytical all
the different Facebook scandals
so definitely send in questions related
to that and we also wanted to end with a
story that's been percolating this week
about Google tracking people's
information even after you turned off
location tracking I have to admit I kind
of suspected this was happening already
but people seemed pretty upset about it
so we'll jump into that too yeah
either way sending your questions and
comments bvg we'll get to as many as you
can at the end of the show and let's get
to the podcast and here we go we'll see
you guys back in the chat in 3 minutes
and 59 seconds from 3 to welcome to the
359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben and with me is
special guest rich Nieva cns reporter
covering all things Google and Facebook
and I would argue the nicest guy in tech
huh
today well today we wanted to focus on
the biggest but certainly not the only
scandal troubling Facebook this year
it's about Cambridge analytic a
political consulting company that gained
access to millions of users Facebook
data and used it to target and used it
for targeted political advertising did I
get all that right yeah yeah it's been
quite a year covering Facebook I'm
pretty busy for you I'm sure so one of
the first things that I want to ask you
about was have you seen anything change
with Facebook or Mark Zuckerberg like
are they chastened or do they kind of
like have a different way about them
after the Cambridge analytical scandal
it's not like Facebook didn't have
scandals before but this one was really
significant
yeah I mean this does feel like the
first one that actually like really
stuck and when you asked me to be on
this today I was thinking back about how
how long it's been it's been five months
so and it's still going on but yeah it
does seem that like this has actually
affected the company their executives do
seem kind of a little bit more
introspective about about their role in
the world about and of yeah I'm kind of
realizing that maybe Facebook isn't like
it's like isn't always this this beacon
of goodness and you know kind of like
connecting people like whenever i watch
f/8 that's like the thing that they
always talk about they're like we want
to connect the world and it's this like
vaguely World Peace kind of thing and to
a certain extent it kind of feels like
they're at least admitting that like
look this is a giant platform we created
it's broadly used for advertising that's
how we make our money and sometimes it
can get gamed and to me it seems like
there's at least an admission that
things could go wrong there sometimes I
don't know if I'm totally right about
yeah definitely yeah I mean Facebook
executives have said that like look
maybe we were a little bit too
optimistic about this and and we didn't
how refreshing and we didn't realize how
terrible some some people could be they
didn't say it in that in those words but
but yeah you know it's a step in the
right direction I would have met right
and and now they realize that they have
to actually you know they have to
prevent abuse in in a way that they they
probably didn't think of before yeah one
other area that I wanted to touch on was
so you were in DC earlier this year for
the Zuckerberg hearings and kind of tell
me a bit about like what it was like to
be there what did what did you see what
was it like but you know watching
Zuckerberg get you know kind of peppered
with questions
oh yeah well it was it was a circus it
was it was over two days and it was a
combined like 10 hours of testimony and
it was well first of all you're sitting
you're sitting in these tables like
right behind him and it's
it's I don't know how many reporters are
in the room but there were a lot and I
just remember him walking out and
photographers taking photos of him for
like like a minute a good minute when he
sits down and like yeah before he sits
down and like people taking pictures of
the empty desk
I'm surprised all that flashing didn't
short-circuit his his brain or something
I weigh I also wanted to get really
quickly to another story the AP reported
this week that Google is still tracking
your location even if you turn off
location tracking Ritchie told me ahead
of the show you can actually fix this
problem is that right yeah so it it's
it's kind of a it has to do with the
settings there's a setting called
location history where if you turn it
off Google is still tracking you
according to this story
it just won't have your location show up
in your Google Maps timeline but if you
toggle off another setting called web
and app activity then it you know then
it'll start to be better yeah it's so
nice that they make this really easy for
us to prevent some of this stuff but
anyway if you want to read more about
these stories check us out on CNN I'm
Ben Fox Ruben I'm reaching Ava thanks
for listening
and thanks everybody for joining us for
the recording of the audio podcast rich
thanks for such detailed reporting you
see a lot of the media hype surrounding
stuff like Facebook and Cambridge
analytics and it's nice to see somebody
get serious about it and get analytical
and not just make jokes you know that
being said that's what we're here for
the first question the first question is
what kind of oil does Mark Zuckerberg
take mm-hmm
yeah we want to know well yeah yeah what
kind of oil to like make sure all the
gears work he's a robot
rich it's a news show but you gotta
loosen up a little buddy
so anyway send in your questions and
comments and I'm gonna do my best to
filter through the crap and get
something good to keep the conversation
going oh god I want to know you use the
phrase beacon of goodness when
describing Facebook what does Facebook
ever a beacon of goodness it was a
satisfying distraction at best well it's
it's more like how exactly does does the
platform promote itself right you know
like it's a type of situation that like
any company that markets itself and
talks about itself well obviously try to
present the best possible foot forward
and the way Zuckerberg for the longest
time and still at f8 this year if I'm
right about this talks about connecting
people and how that's really important
and and they kind of got back to that
too with their advertising where they're
like you know thank you for the friends
yeah you came here for the friends and
stayed for you know the the Russian
election influencing but they there was
still kind of this undercurrent of we're
here to connect people and you know in
connecting people we hopefully are
making the world better even though I
would argue you're just making people
jealous of everybody else's vacation but
you know yeah the longest time they're
there their mantra was make the world
more open and connected and then they
changed it amid all this to bring the
world closer together so
it's not that different but yeah I I
mean it's it's by the way one other
thing that we didn't get to because it's
a four-minute podcast you also did like
pretty deep reporting on Zuckerberg like
his background is in his history you
went to his old stomping ground in
Westchester County where I'm originally
where I'm not originally from there I'm
from Philadelphia but I lived there for
seven years so can you kind of give us
like some of the highlights about what
you learned on your reporting you spent
like months looking into you know kind
of like what it was to build the
Zuckerberg robot and how we got to where
we are today yeah I I went to Dobbs
Ferry New York and which is where he
grew up
visited his old high school I tracked
down his old fencing teacher you know
his fencing coach and one of his
classmates and just in you know saw
where he grew up it's it's this big
white house on the corner of a quiet
street wasn't one of the things that I'm
kind of curious about too is when you
talk to some of those folks like for
instance the fencing coach was there any
awareness when he was going through high
school that like yeah this guy is this
guy's gonna be a big deal you know
sometimes when you know somebody is
really different
or perhaps so brilliant it's it's pretty
quickly identified very early on is that
something that you know maybe people
told you about they did yeah I mean so
he was the he was the captain of the
fencing team he was like the co-captain
and one of the things that I remember
his classmate telling me who was also
his fencing teammate was that he was
really he was really quick and he was he
was physically a quick fighter like he
could parry and adjust like super not
see exactly right right aren't you
telling me this story about him like at
a match and all I keep thinking about is
their their their old mantra which is
move fast and break things right that's
pretty funny which is like one of the
kind of one of the things that that
critics
used upon that philosophy as to why
they're kind of in this mess now yeah I
had no idea that mantra related to
fencing very interesting it does hitting
I'm kidding
all right anyway let's get to questions
BVG let's uh let's see what people want
to talk about yeah coming in from Ricky
B could Facebook sue CDA for damages to
its image that's a great question let's
let you field that one hmm I don't know
it hasn't really come up I'd be
surprised they have teams of lawyers why
wouldn't they like III guess you could
sue anybody if you wanted to but as far
as you could tell this isn't something
that's really been on the table or been
discussed by Facebook at this point yeah
I mean it would be it would be a bad
look you know it's like to sue Cambridge
analytic oh well string Facebook is is
kind of the behemoth here you know it
would it would look like a you know a
deflection I think that's a dresser I
hadn't thought about that
and they're you know they're their big
thing this year has been we're gonna
take more responsibility for for for our
role in this and so to do that would
kind of you know maybe negate some of
the work that they've been doing to
their image yeah
also Cambridge analytic as a company
really no longer exists and I was hardly
any money there so what exactly they
would get out of it I'm not really sure
but either way that's a really good
question that was an interesting
perspective mm-hmm
Josh Boyd are coming in with for the
location tracking doesn't Google use
that for live traffic in Google Maps
already I think that is one of the
aspects yeah I think the primary concern
for people was that you're supposed to
when you turn off location history the
assumption is is that they're no longer
tracking my location the problem is and
and this was why I assumed like this
wasn't really all that surprising was
that it's still especially on a phone
for the phone to work you know your cell
phone provider and Google and Apple like
they have to have some awareness of
where the phone is located or it ceases
to function as a phone so I don't know
that wasn't that was my impression
obviously people are you know
justifiably annoyed that you go into the
settings
you think you turn off location and you
didn't right I think that's part of the
reason it struck such a nerve is that
people think it's a little disingenuous
something called location history you
know you'd think you turned it off and
they would not track that it went one of
the other things that I've been hearing
from you know Google and I think
Facebook to this year is that like you
know we're gonna do a better job helping
users with their privacy and deleting
some of their information
however they always mention it's gonna
make these services worse or it's gonna
make them more difficult what do you
think like how do you think users are
responding to that are they okay with
that balance I always wonder like do
people even care are they digging into
the settings like I don't know that they
are I wonder if people even know yeah I
mean I think that's the the the thing
that's kind of hit home here is that um
there was a story a couple weeks ago
about Gmail and third-party app
developers being able to read your inbox
which would for people for people like
us who follow us every day like that's
that's not really surprising but like
people are actually starting to
understand how these companies work I
don't know I feel like that one's kind
of icky like I'm not that crazy about
that one either
but yeah like people find out about it
and they're like huh not cool yeah
anyway more questions Mike Shaw asks
should Congress step in when it comes to
Google tracking and I think maybe we
should stay away from the word should
and say could Congress step in I think
that they I mean every time one of these
kind of privacy debacle breaks a
debacles breaks out there are Congress
people who make statements another
another call I saw the other day was
privacy experts asking the FTC to be
involved so yeah if this if this kind of
blows up more for Google that's
something that can be that could
discussed I remain skeptical that
Congress is actually gonna step in and
do anything about this stuff it's pretty
difficult for them to like even pass a
budget on time these days so I would say
don't hold your breath
when it comes to this kind of thing but
it might get to the point where they
would have to step in if it just
continues to worsen and this year is a
really good example or they'll talk
about it or they'll tweet about it
probably tweet about it yes Alex
Mitchell asks does disabling the
tracking feature save on battery and if
so do we know how much I would say
probably it probably saves on battery
but simply any kind of background total
app like that saves some sense a battery
but I don't think we've had our hands on
it long enough to tell to measure it
right it's probably I don't think that
you're gonna notice a huge difference
it's like if your phone honks out at 3
p.m. every day from heavy use if you
turn off location tracking it's not like
I have no idea if like what you're gonna
get an extra half hour out of it or
something but I can't imagine it's gonna
like change the the viability of your
phone significantly that's that's just a
guess it's it's a good question but it's
also technically pretty difficult to try
to figure that out
yeah Michael Brown first of all welcomes
rich to the show he's never seen it
thanks Michael right on do you think
these big CEOs like Larry Page Tim Cook
Bezos do they use Facebook Google Amazon
etc well I know Zuckerberg uses do they
use it themselves or do they have it you
know like a team like a social media
team do uniform I do know that Facebook
has people to help with their executive
pages best as I can tell Jack Dorsey is
the one responding to people on Twitter
and I kind of feel like it would be
disingenuous if he wasn't it seems like
it's him but I don't know well there's
there have been reports about Zuckerberg
definitely having a team of people to
help curate
is his Facebook page in his image when
he travels he travels with a
professional photographer so when he
went on that big trip of the US last
year that was all documented by a by a
professional crew right and the guy is
like a major executive he's one of the
world's richest people you would accept
it you would expect that kind of thing
about Zuckerberg where they're really
carefully curating that that message but
yeah if Jeff Bezos has a Facebook page I
mean like I've never I've never happened
upon it and if he does have it it's
probably pretty private you know like he
posts Bezos posts things on Twitter
every now and then when he's walking
around with a robot dog or he's in a
giant mech suit but in general Bezos
doesn't tend to tweet that often
Oh he also tweets a lot about Blue
Origin and Rockets so yeah I always
imagined that the celebrity type have
fake accounts fake names so that they
can log on and screw around without
being hunted since they they have their
own they have like fan pages or even if
it seems Comey James Comey is a perfect
example of that James Comey was kind of
like chilling out on Twitter for a while
until I think it was a reporter it
Gizmodo yes that right ended up like
tracking down like connected the threads
and figured out that it was it was James
Comey and like he eventually was he at
like at Jimmy Co or something like I
don't know it was like something like
Nostradamus or whatever theologian that
he put it that he wrote his thesis
honors yeah yeah yeah so it was it was
something that if you were paying really
close attention you could you could
figure it out and it was pretty clever
now he's he switched that name to James
Comey and I think he he now has a
verified symbol and everything but yeah
like you you're probably right that some
people are kind of like lurking on
Twitter there's also like a good example
is Elon Musk where he's tweeting
constantly all the time and you know
just kind of like raging about stuff so
you've got you know the whole gamut as
far as like tech CEOs and how they use
these services but I imagine like any
celebrity somebody else runs their
official fan page for people to follow
but then they create the fake names
that they can go and play like candy
crush or whatever mm-hmm yeah got to
play candy crush or if you're Kevin
Durant you can we are running out of
time I'm gonna paraphrase a little bit
and a conversation that's going on in
the chat for a minute now we've been
concerned about these little cameras in
the front of our laptops and on our
phones and who or what has immediate
access to them whether you've tried to
disable them or not is that still a
concern do we and do we ever think that
Facebook has like gone down that path
well it's certainly a conspiracy theory
that that people always talk about and
during the last congressional hearing
with Zuckerberg he was actually asked
that if Instagram spies on you I don't
know they at least with your with your
with your microphone I don't know if he
was asked directly by the camera but he
dispelled that he was like no we don't
do it yeah I've heard that more than any
other conspiracy yeah it's a really like
long-running one yeah it's like I'm
thinking about a lawn mower and then
I'll get like an Amazon yeah at about a
lawnmower so and whether or not it's
true I mean that it won't go away that
the theory won't go away kind of tells
you something about how people are
thinking about these companies yeah and
with the Google location tracking thing
it's a perfect example why people aren't
aren't as trustful of these companies as
they used to be I thought I turned off
my location history I didn't you know
like there's there's good reason why
people are kind of being a little more
skeptical about how these companies are
treating user privacy these days yeah I
would say so yeah I would I don't know
this is a new computer but usually I do
just block my webcam unless I'm using it
so yeah I feel like people do that a lot
more often these days yeah several
people in the chat have pointed out that
it has been documented that Zuckerberg
himself covers his webcams we have seen
that too every time that elaboration has
there been there's been a photo I think
like he posted a photo of him in his
office and there was a there's there's
something over the camera and over the
mic yeah it's I think at the time
people were a little surprised about it
but I kind of feel like at least in the
tech world more people do it nowadays
it's just for peace of mind type of
thing so a good example if that is is
like Google came out with a bunch of
kind of like those those like kitchen
counter tablet kind of things they're
like smart tablets or smart displays is
what they call them and they come with a
little shudder to close the camera and
Amazon doesn't provide that for its
Amazon echo show and because they're
like oh it works it works all the time
you're not getting hacked so like why
would we include a shutter but for me
personally like I would prefer if they
just had the shutter in there then I
know for sure that you know the camera
is not watching me when I don't want to
tell ya I take a little bit of Solace
and I know like by and large the entire
concept that you're being spied on is
horrifying and terrible but I take a
little bit of Solace I kind of want it
to be true just because like I talked to
myself a lot during the day and my phone
is 99% of the time in my pocket until I
get angry at something and then it
becomes my punching bag and I whip it
across the room ask anybody here in the
office you that they've seen it and
between that and and like if I'm gonna
be crass for a second like I fart so
like the idea why somebody like
listening in on my phone and seeing like
the inside of my pocket and then fart
sounds I just like enjoy that buddy good
luck with that try to tell me depends or
something I would love just some guy in
a room yeah
first of all if there was a subscription
service to like kind of like Truman Show
but Bryan's life I I would be paying for
it
second you don't need to wear it depends
if you just fart I have to admit I'm
just trying to all draw that line
because you say that oh I thought I
thought about a lawnmower and then
Amazon tried to sell me like a lawnmower
blade or whatever what they would try to
sell me if they just heard me
you know rip ass or something yeah yeah
I don't know sometimes I just kind of
feel like I'm being watched like right
now it's kind of weird we're man is a
weird feeling Billy ocean so in kind of
closing thoughts you know
I'm trying to find the right way to
express this between the spying and the
cameras and the false information and
the listening and the aggregation and
the algorithms and what data is more
valuable for them to secondo up how much
can they turn that around and is there
ever a world that we live in where
they'd give it all up for the sake of
the greater good whoa
well okay I can answer that last part
absolutely not no like that's how they
make all their money is through user
data and as far as what's more valuable
than nine I would probably say the more
types of information the more data
points they have on you the better so
whether it's age location home address I
color family members like the more data
that they have to kind of build a
biography around you the better and
that's why Facebook is such a powerful
tool because it's basically a user
survey that they then use to target
advertising and you give all your
information to them you tell them this
is this is a you know like my political
leanings my religion it depends how much
information you want to give them but ya
know a lot of people do actually fill
out that info yeah and it depends on the
advertiser to you like if somebody wants
to sell you a skateboard you know
they're gonna target a skateboarder
right yeah yeah they're also gonna look
for people potentially in certain
certain states or counties yeah age
groups you know and and Facebook has all
that information they can google to a
certain extent I does too they just kind
of get it differently right books yeah
these books able to do it because we're
basically just give it to them yeah and
that's what I'm everybody I do think
they're gonna look for a certain
demographic for an in Facebook can
provide all that information so I think
yeah holistically it's all important to
them it's all important and they're not
gonna give it up you're not giving it up
no that's how they make all their money
let's rewind like 15 years before social
media and
data mining was really a thing III I'm
not trying to pretend like I know
exactly when we could pinpoint this
became a concern because I'm not a
historian I'm just thinking like back
before the time of Facebook back before
the time of the any of this controversy
and vulnerabilities
we're headline news what kind of
information would you have volunteered
just get philosophical with me for a
second what kind of information would
you a volunteer to advertisers because I
don't mind being trying like somebody
trying to sell me something that I want
and there's a tiny little piece of me
that's like I don't know I guess cookies
in a weird way can help somebody help me
find something that I would want in my
life you know I would totally volunteer
information so that they could try me
try to sell me better booze you know I
don't mind entertainment you know Hart
movies at me games at me that kind of
stuff what about you guys I don't know
they weren't already mining the data out
of the cockles of your search history
and trying to learn what kind of human
they are as human you are as the robots
they are what would you volunteer I I
think the power of Facebook is in that
they're not like they're selling point
is give us this information we'll
package it for advertisers they don't
say that overtly ever they don't but but
that is their business model and that's
why people are so willing to hand over
their info and to share their lives on
Facebook because it's kind of like the
whole ad model is somewhat hidden from
the user interface but that's that's
what I'm trying to say take the hidden
part out of it if there was like a
survey like welcome to the Internet what
would you like to buy what would you put
in those fields
I kind of feel like if a company was
that upfront about it people would
really yeah would be unwilling to
provide most information you know I
think so so as it good for instance eBay
does more of this than they used to or
they ask you about your interests and I
filled out that survey because they're
like what what kind of stuff would you
like to buy on eBay you know like do you
want Philadelphia Eagles gear yes
absolutely do you want like a like a
cool leather jacket with a skull in the
back no that's not me camilo no I would
look great yeah I would look pretty
in that so I think in that regard on a
shopping site if they want to ask me my
interests that's fine but I kind of I
guess I get a little bit weirded out
with like more personal information but
you know that's that's where a lot of
the internet is these days yeah yeah
what about you I don't know if if I saw
a guitar like like a guitar ad on
Facebook you know I would not be upset
so I don't Facebook does have little
controls on on each ad where it's like
is this ad relevant should you know
should we not show this to you anymore
and that stuff kind of helps to eat out
the stuff that you're not gonna you're
not gonna be into yeah but on our way
out the door
everybody anybody chime in here or on
Twitter let us know if you would want to
participate in voluntary ads what kind
of information you would get like the
volunteer for it I see life improvement
might be on board with it anybody else
out there just curious this is you know
that it'll never happen but I what oh
great news is moving so so this is this
is a pretty useful corollary as is you
know would you pay for Facebook so
that's an area that a lot of people are
talking about now to where if they had a
totally different model where they
didn't have to make all their money
packaging your information to ads for
advertisers would Facebook being a
better place and would it just be the
place where you could share your cat
videos and your baby pictures and that
kind of thing so I'm curious about what
what your kind of perspective is on that
and whether that's gaining any attention
at Facebook or in general well they've
talked about this and they've been asked
about it
Sheryl Sandberg their CEO has said that
there will always be a free version of
Facebook and I think Zuckerberg said
this too which has begged the question
are they you know are they thinking
about subscriptions and yeah I don't
know what would I would you would you no
no of course not why would I pay for
Facebook you know but I guess as if you
option I mean if you could use Facebook
and
have them not collect information about
you how much would you be willing to pay
for that yeah that's that's a better way
to package that question I think I would
have to noodle on that one I don't
really know the answer to that
immediately so but that's that
definitely got me thinking sorry I got
distracted I was thinking about ways to
troll the Facebook ad algorithm anyways
we do have to go where at the end of the
show let us know if Google was listening
to you and if your devices start trying
to sell you cool leather jackets guitars
skateboards or dependence garments
undergarments the only of those things
and then yeah thanks everybody will see
