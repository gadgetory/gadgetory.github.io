are we still taking do you mind I'm sure
so what was your this is just take a
second you guys can you know chime in on
this Josh you love your take two what
was your role in cloudy one of the
investors of founding desert one in the
first money yeah tell me about this and
and you know chime in here tubing clout
I Isis on honors we are recording and ok
and we're broadcasting if you want us to
turn it off we will see but I thought
this might be an interesting follow up
for later yeah of course a separate
discussion uh I I have a cloud score of
I don't know 64 and I look at it and it
goes up and it goes down and I'm like
what that why do I care now I will say
this i did get a windows phone out of
this digit I got one of us but other
than that I mean what is cloud and and
why is doesn't matter so here's why it
so for me social search it was as an
investment strategy was interesting so
again four years ago I started following
things I did aardvark first I loved art
walk over exactly so I was one of the
angel on that and then I was looking for
something else and then Cora popped up
which is also really interesting in that
space did you put money of course no no
I'm just a fanboy and then then a cloud
came out and i met joe and it fit
exactly with what I was calling people
rank and what I mean by that is that the
way Google searches is fruit page rank
and the links within pages and the
algorithm and all of that put together
it comes out to what is called page rank
and that's a really important part of
their algorithm for figuring out what
what should be how things should be
ranked on the search page again what I
was saying is that people rank will
actually people's influence will
actually matter you know much more in
the future of where we're going into
social web and mobile etc and we needed
something as an algorithm to kind of
begin to bubble up clot was the
beginning of that Joe got that and for
advertisers is actually pretty pretty
you know important because for them they
want to be able to get to the
influencers and we can reach their
audience in an effective way so the
beginnings of that is I mean the reason
you got the android phones because
you're an influencer and you know these
are pretty classic things they don't
change over time it's just the
technology is helping us filter and
optimize how wait to me though it does
seem that cloud is yet another metric of
another way for me to feel bad about
myself because chasing the numbers is
really all I ask you a question let me
get those changes perspective here yeah
um you also feel bad about yourself if
you put in your name yeah your first
name and you don't come up first you
come up like the tempers yeah you're
gonna feel bad about that you're like
why why am I not come in at you or if
you I have another I don't know other
people in the world are like this but
I'm years who I am a friend who has a
name yeah I won't say his last name is
his first name is Jason there's another
guy who has the same first class and
they're both entrepreneurs and then what
happened was one guy's company you know
get started getting hot and this you
know this thing you know lifted up and
became the number one search and he used
to be number one and you know that that
feels bad right I just made the names up
but I mean it what I'm getting at is you
also felt bad in those scenarios cloud
is just it's it's not a cloud specific
problem that's just oh but but but clout
distills it down into the essence of I'm
not a cool kid that's transparent go
ahead put a lot of people hit on cloud
because it's not necessarily totally
accurate yet but you know they're
working for the long term yes it's not
perfect yet you know I've even said so
in articles my only problem is when they
purport it as being very accurate so far
accurate enough to say you know a few
points in one direction or the other is
the difference between someone deserving
a perk or not or saying one person is
more important than the other I think
it's all kind of cloudy still but
eventually it will get better and better
with time and it will be something that
companies can really use but what
happens when people start to play to the
score I mean you know it's one thing to
play to facebook to get props from you
know ex-girlfriends that see
cool you are whatever is that see me
playing the rankings on Google yeah but
was all is that always gonna but with
clout see with with clout I think that
people some people like me uh look at
that score and say I need I need to be
better than Michael yeah so I'm going to
start being more of a smartass on
facebook because that cloud measures
that yeah or Twitter or whatever and now
i'm just playing to the perk it'sit's
craven but that's this is human behavior
it's I don't think again it's not a
cloud thing its humanity and you go your
neighbor buys a new car and you're like
oh crap I'm not as good as my neighbor
I'm gonna go get it you know it's just
it that that it's classic all right Josh
I agree i think it's a sort of a natural
outcome but I you know it's I guess it
lady said it's the same as pagerank you
can try your best to game it but the
whole point is that these algorithms are
kept secret so that nobody exactly knows
and they change over time so you think
you've gained them in one way they
discover that you're doing that they
change the algorithm and you shoot back
down so it isn't it's more difficult to
game it then people really just I just
picture cloud as a company run by a
couple of mean high school girls like
he's cool he's not mean girls thanks
