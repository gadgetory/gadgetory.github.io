entry-level model in its expanding line
of premium Bluetooth wireless headphones
at $300 I wouldn't call the Biot play H
for a bargain but it did surprise me
with how good it sounded and I think it
matches up well with the competition at
this price point both in terms of design
and performance for a full-size
headphone it's fairly light weighing in
at 8.3 2 ounces or 236 grams and is
quite comfortable to wear the ear cuffs
swivel and fold flat so the headphone
sits comfortably around your neck when
you're not wearing it on your ears
however the headphone doesn't fold up or
come with any sort of carrying case
which is a bit of a disappointment
considering the $300 price tag unlike
the step-up Bo play 87 which features
touch controls the h4s integrated 3
button remote is located on the right
ear cup along with a microphone for
making calls battery life is decent at
19 hours at moderate volume levels as I
said I was impressed by the sound this
is a dynamic headphone with a lot of
energy in the base good detail and
clarity for a bluetooth headphone anyway
and natural mids
I didn't notice a significant difference
listening to it in Wired mode but the
included cord plugged in this headphone
is compatible with the Bo play app for
Android iPhone and Apple watch the app
allows you to personalize your listen
experience with preset sound profiles
and other sound tweaks as well as
receive software updates over the air
while it's missing some features such as
active noise cancellation and that
aforementioned carrying case the Bo
plate h4 is nicely designed perform as
well and fits comfortably it should be
in the conversation if you're
considering a full sized bluetooth
headphone for around $300 I'm David
