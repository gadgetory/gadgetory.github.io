features now let's take a look at five
that just aren't worth it here we go
starting with door and a door
compartments LG made the feature popular
over the past few years and Samsung
quickly followed suit but I still just
don't get it
it's not any more convenient to open the
front panel of the fridge and access the
shelves than it is to just open the door
of the fridge like normal and access
those shelves and in some cases it's
even less convenient because you've got
a plastic barrier blocking those shelves
off from the inside
worst of all none of these compartments
ever help the fridge stay cold they
actually tend to make them warmer number
two excessively spill-proof shelves now
don't get me wrong I'm a big fan of
shelves that have spill-proof rims
around the edges but some fridges take
the idea too far I'm thinking
specifically of Electrolux models like
this one that have these curved
spill-proof glass shelves that bend
upwards at the rim
they look fancy I guess but it eats up
so much space because you can't put any
items on that curved part of the shelf
number three in fridge temperature zones
now if you watch our favorite fridge
features you know that I like zones in
the fridge that have their own dedicated
temperature presets
I just prefer compartments and drawers
that are outside of the body of the
fridge and kept separate from that cold
environment they tend to perform a lot
better drawers like this one that sit
inside the body of the fridge are often
ineffective number four king-sized ice
makers now you might disagree with me if
you throw a lot of parties or you have
some other need for excess ice but I
much prefer a smaller icemaker that's
more compact and takes up less space in
the body of the fridge at the end of the
day of those big ice makers that sit up
on the top shelf are eating up space and
if you're asking me to choose between
space for groceries and space for ice
I'm going to choose groceries every day
of the week finally smart fridges now I
know I put smart fridges on my list of
the favorite fridge features but that
doesn't mean they're worth buying into
right now we've only seen one or two
models we actually liked and prices are
still prohibitively high it wouldn't
surprise me if someday soon we see every
manufacturer offer some sort of flagship
smartphones born out of that kind of
competition I say wait well there you
have it five fridge features that we say
are not worth it for more check us out
