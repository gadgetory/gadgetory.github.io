standing beside the sauna clean VT plus
this is a vacuum cleaner that you might
have seen marketed on TV or through a
online YouTube ad but it's got a unique
approach to getting dirt out of your
carpet what it does is it uses vibration
to create what it calls sonic cleaning
technology and all that means is this
got a vibrating bar in the bottom of it
beside that brush roll that vibrating
bar is gonna buzz and it's kind of shake
dirt up out of your carpet and into the
bin a lot easier so sonic lien says now
taking a look at this thing I don't like
the design it looks dated to me it's
trying to look futuristic it's got sort
of a robotic coat of paint looks like a
Star Wars droid extra but that said
minimalism has its upside there is a
nice lightness to this vacuum and only
weighs about 11.25 pounds so if you want
something light and easy to push around
your living room this might be the
vacuum for you that doesn't make it more
maneuverable though because it doesn't
have that rotating neck or that ball
design that Dyson uses so it doesn't
turn quite as easily it's pretty old
fashioned vacuum in that regard
something else to keep in mind is that
the VT plus uses bags and not canisters
you'll need to change these out and keep
purchasing them going forward so let's
take another look at that
sonic cleaning technology that vibrating
bar on the bottom now my question as I
started testing this was does that
vibration agitate your carpets in a
different way than the brushroll which
spins brushes through the carpet fiber
already does does that add anything new
and to test that out I got this glass of
water here will show you if I put it up
against the brushroll and let the
brushes spin against it not a lot of
movement there if any but then if I take
the glass of water and hold it right up
against the vibrating bar you see some
t-rex style ripples going through the
surface of that glass so pretty unique
pretty different there's something going
on there that you don't get with a brush
roll
so does that translate the cleaning
performance well actually it performed a
lot better than I expected in the
Cheerios and pet hair test it did among
the best of any vacuum we've tested the
problem though was sand and to be honest
that's the test I expected the vibration
technology to have the greatest impact
on it didn't this vacuum finished in the
bottom compared to vacuums like the ork
touch in the dyson DC 65 the sonic P and
V T plus retails online for $200 plus
about 30 bucks for shipping and handling
I don't love the design and I'm not
convinced that vibrating technology adds
a whole lot that Santa's should have
been better if that was the case but it
did perform well and at that price point
it's not a bad deal so I say give it a
shot if you like what you see for CNET
I'm right Kristy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
