it doesn't turn into a robot a really
really cool and interesting look at what
hollow lens looks like from the
perspective of the wearer and legendary
pictures releases a VR app that frankly
is much better than the reality we're
living in I'm not true of most VR true
tomorrow Neely
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show known universe I'm Ashley
skala joining me today special guest I
fancied man-about-town brian bishop
that's me thanks for using my full name
yeah fancy man about town I mission I
wanted to make sure I got all the
honorifics in there ya head tunes um so
for you've been on the show before we've
had use a guest before thank you for
coming back I tried me back I must have
done something right you might have
we're not done something less wrong than
the other people you didn't burn the
place down that that qualifies you for a
return visit yet yet yet um so tell
everybody really quickly uh where what
you do who you know where they can find
you and then we'll do more of that at
the end too yes for sure i'm a
professional podcaster you can hear me
on the adam carolla show as well as my
show the film vault and if you're
interested in hearing more of my
nonsense i wrote a book called shrinkage
that is very proud of it so check it out
if you're so inclined and it's not what
you think no do you think it's excellent
it's great oh is that what you're
thinking yeah I surprised with
everything I think it it's terrible no
it's really good um okay so we have some
really cool stories talked about today
some why it's VRA our transformer trucks
all that stuff so let's at the headlines
so we've talked a little bit on the show
about what it looks like through a
hollow lens so microsoft hololens and
microsoft made this sort of partnership
that they've been talking about we heard
about it a little bit at build a few
months ago made this partnership
official with case western reserve
university and they're going to be doing
these sort of medical teaching
applications inside hololens so students
could actually look at a full sized
human body and like peel them away in
layers and see how muscles attached to
below muscles attached to the body and
how everything works the nervous system
all that stuff anti-money on cadavers
definitely saves money on cadavers the
cadaver but just gonna go way down the
cadaver stock is plummeting immediately
so what about the Traverse stock please
so but one of the things I thought was
really interesting about this video that
Microsoft released was that it actually
gives for the first time a really true
view of what how you view things through
holland so we've discussed what a narrow
field of view the hololens
okay and for smaller things like if
you're looking at the human heart and
everything like this is rad this looks
so so cool there's something out of my
nightmares let the floating heart that's
chasing brother I'm beating floating
living heart floating around the room
yeah somehow still beating but yet
disembodied at the same time indeed
indeed and and so one of the things that
I thought was really interesting is that
it shows you exactly how narrow that
field of view so you'll see it starts
cutting off at certain points and it's
not your entire field of vision and I
think that was the one thing that a lot
of people had trouble kind of describing
okay to people who hadn't tried on
hololens sure so we saw a halo
experience at three and people would put
on Hollins and they could see these
these people were like okay Spartan like
let's go you know let's get you loaded
out and all this stuff but it was a very
narrow field of view so it was like you
felt like you were looking through a
little window and I think this video
kind of illustrates that perfectly okay
which is pretty interesting but I love
this idea of being able to use instead
of a live experimentation on a person
which we can't do anymore because it's
wrong and terrible they can actually you
know make a holographic living person
and have people study it like that which
is pretty neat and you could actually
add diseases to to these people
conditions differ yeah right broken
bones like Amy you could do that and
people could look at a body and diagnose
it in real time which i think is
brilliant I mean I think this is a great
way to to kind of push forward medical
education and in a really great way it
is brilliant and all joking aside you
know medical stuff they call it
practicing medicine for a reason because
very few people know no one knows
everything about you know something and
they practice they get better they learn
and this is a way for people to share
knowledge and learn a lot of knowledge a
lot of times if you're whether you're a
patient or a doctor try to become a
doctor a student trying to come a doctor
you're at the mercy of who you're
learning from where you're at or where
you have access to and if this opens up
the whole world of medical knowledge to
the whole world we could train people in
other countries and remote areas in
Google station in the north and south
pole which would be fantastic be
fantastic so I'm all for it one thing I
am NOT all for connecting this to WebMD
no you're no cuz people are gonna be
like oh yeah let me see what I have let
me see ya
I'm all this going on in here they're
gonna be so upset and they're gonna
they're gonna run to their doctors you
like I'm dying yeah everything's wrong
sure good noise hypochondria actually
have a new hobby exactly exactly but
hypochondriacs either feed your
hypochondria by buying hololens or avoid
by not going hololens because you don't
want anything like this but I thought
this was so cool and and I'm curious you
guys can let us know either on Twitter
or in the comments on YouTube does this
the field of view thing does that change
your position on whether or not you're
excited about hololens because I think a
lot of people have been really curious
to see exactly what it looks like and I
think some people might be turned off by
the fact that it's a very small field of
view but that seems like something
that's going to become it's going to
improve with time right yeah I'm the
fact that the technology exists it's
only gonna get better i would assume so
but it could be years before i knew a
really new headset with full kind of
full field of view is how it oh how
impatient we've gotten it might be years
before we can see trying tiger feel the
video oh that's what a terrible thing
what a terrible terrible thing um but
yeah I just I thought that was really
interesting and I love the video I
thought it was great and if you guys
have a chance you should definitely go
over to microsoft research as site and
and start looking at they've got more
hollow on stuff up so which is really
needs pretty name um so from a r to vr
you're talking about legendary legendary
pictures announced so they've released
three apps correct for three different
movies looks like a single app with
three different folks are single
experiences in it so you can like
download each one it's pretty sweet you
were showing me with your with a
cardboard earlier yessum through this
fancy viewfinder edible cardboard oh no
that my childhood is dying one new
awesome thing at a time I was just like
a few master oh yeah it's just like a
viewmaster you think I you're flying
with her the world of warcraft yeah no
it's pretty awesome there there's apps
where you're flying on the back of a
what i can only assume is an eagle oh
yeah the Griffins for Emma yeah it said
all of the great Griffin's and said
listen guys I don't play alliance in
world warcraft i'm a horde so I don't
fly on Griffin's but apparently you guys
do so there you go yes I Anna Griffin
over stormwind this will be a wonderful
experience for many of you but it was
pretty awesome it's one of those things
where you put your phone in the thing
and it allows a turn the app on allows
you to look literally what do you call
that not through nor sick if its
spherical it's all I can turn around
everywhere
jus got down the artistry there's just
the time must have taken to go into just
making the clouds and the buildings and
the detail I only imagine what kind of
Easter eggs are like planted around yeah
I'm curious about that too so we have
some footage of like the different okay
so here are the different phone just
talk about the warcraft on the right to
the warcraft so the warcraft one was
like the one that I really liked because
we haven't really seen anything from
more crime yeah I saw some stuff at
blizzcon but uh which was amazing okay
but but generally sleep let stuff they
haven't released yet we're assuming that
the full trailer is gonna drop this week
ok so at comic-con so this is one of the
screen caps yeah so this should be I
mean it's this ice looks amazing it's
just a matter of time until we get a
really good calm excuse me a really good
video game movie it's just a matter of
time to write I don't think there's
really been a great one Super Mario
Brothers I thought you didn't let me
finish aside from the iconic Super Mario
rubs there's not been a great video game
movie I guess just a matter of time
someone's gonna crack the code no pun
intended the director of this movie
Duncan Jones I don't know if you've seen
his other two movies o moon my favorites
moon is fantastic but you guys have not
seen moon track it down it's a brainless
Sam Rockwell brilliant yes bling he also
did a movie called source code that Jake
Gyllenhaal really good was much better
than it should have been I remember
seeing the trailer and thinking this is
not gonna be good ended up being really
good ended up being really that's always
a good sign for a movie or a director or
a future movie when the guy is making
good movies out of ones that maybe
shouldn't be so good okay scripts yeah
well yeah kind of ridiculous concepts or
oh no concept you're like I get it I get
it but no it was a good movie so any
other a plays world warcraft so it was
like he's the guy wide open this could
this can be the thing be the one this
could be it and i'm really excited to
see this trailer like I'm curious I'm
scared like what if I hate it but they
also have they also have not only
Warcraft they have a crimson peak adjust
we barely touched on the other ones oh I
can't wait to see this movie I'm
obsessed with Guillermo del Toro and i
also have a great truck i love gothic
horror so this is right up my alley a
lot of great actors in this and its
really cool so like Tom Hiddleston
narrates this thing and you go into
crimson peak or to the manor and there's
like a scary monster it it's really cool
and then there's also a Pacific Rim
right jaeger
experience what it was kind of weird
you're inside the the jager and he's
looking at you that's a pilot during the
Nura handshaking and at you and
addressing you it's pretty cool I make
you an i er of different opinions of
Pacific Rim I think you liked it a lot
more than I did I just like fighting
giant fighting robots and I like you
know the human yeah I know what I have
some room for me was is okay what's not
quite as good as I hoped it would be I
know boy I think shows a huge fan but ok
I think I have a sweet though I think
that they're absolutely some issues of
that movie like I can understand why
some people weren't like oh my god this
is the greatest movie ever like i I'm
like well i think i would have liked
some other things from them excited get
there were elements that were sweet
great somewhere else that were sweet
injures elbow number one yeah he's
always great just the best and you're
welcome it was good Charlie day like
yeah come on I just calm Charlie's just
like those guys are many so good um but
yeah you can download it it's on iOS and
Android right yes and download wreck
them out go around the room and look and
explore things it's pretty cool and if
you don't have a cardboard you don't
need one it'll it'll ask you do you have
cardboard and you could be like no and
it just lets you hold your phone and
look around just like we're serious is
the way to go though right because I
think so the full immersion if you have
cardboard do that or a gear I think a
gear VR probably work too so yeah really
cool stuff from legendary alright last
but not least I have to show you this
might be better than any RV I've ever
seen including like luxury RVs this is a
castle truck it comes out of New Zealand
this couple built this truck and here it
is transforming so it is completely
road-legal when it's out in the road Wow
yes I start out of the truck yeah starts
out as a truck and it turns into a tiny
castle that you can actually live in so
that's that is it it's a house so here
they are building it there's a whole
bunch of whole bunch of these great
pictures of them building this house
over time this is clearly Hobbit
nonsense right I like leftover that's
what happens when you live in New
Zealand you get inspired by Hobbit
nonsense and you start building Castle
trucks so yeah here it is this is the
finished product it's insane so this
thing folds out into two rotating
turrets so there's the turrets right
there the turrets have a composting
toilet a shower and a washing
chain in them so you can use the
restroom in there you can shower you can
wash your clothes it has a grid right
it's like it's solar one hundred percent
off the grid runs on solar power and
caught rainwater they catch rainwater
that are drought oh yeah well in New
Zealand it feels like it probably right
um don't bring it to California you'll
die do you have to dig your own moat oh
uh I would really i think they should
well I think that's maybe that's like a
recommendation deal breaker for me it's
optional optional and then there's a
retractable roof so there it is up there
and it's got its got a hammock up there
it's got a kitchen it's got a kitchen
sleeping quarters it's got I mean this
is insane it's got a bathtub up top is
this for resale this is for competing
buy this or is this just they're showing
oh this is just they're just showing on
this is that this is overachieving
overachieving via what did that meet
their raises up and putting me cute
little castle that they made out of a
try me this is it same I love it so much
well the short hours later you got a
castle I know right it's like absolutely
insane I mean if you don't like putting
up a tent in the it to go camp down this
is the sound of you is not for you
that's a full living space look it's
like a full kit they got off kitchen I
got a whole thing going on here and like
and then like I said they can do this
before they open it up and this is after
that's uh that's lovable and it's gonna
be a while away some hours in there
there's gonna be at some point someone's
gonna be shooting a movie some stars
gonna be shooting any easier in yeah in
New Zealand I want that I look I got a
happy trail track my trailer is the
castle so unfortunately does not
transform into a robot it just it's a
transformer but it transformed into a
house which is still pretty amazing um
but yeah super cool totally love this
idea um hat like happy to see people
just making weird stuff that's rad
that's all right let's artwork right
there man it's someone doing something
they love vat of something that is
otherwise no one's a useless but an
ordinary item you know I mean they're
making something totally good um okay so
and before we go I just wanna let you
guys know the hashtag of the day today
is still going to be hashtag TD sdcc 15
I know it's a lot of TD letters sdcc's
videocon 15 um and we want you guys to
tell us you have a whole weekend now cuz
it's Thursday and when we come back on
Monday you guys can tell us what you
thought of either kill
coverage he's over on yahoo covering san
diego comic-con you can tell us what you
thought of the show was there anything
you missed was there anything you
absolutely loved you could can't live
without what was the best or worst part
of comic-con for you let us know that's
your that's your mission should you
choose to accept it so on that note
we're going to take a quick break but
before we do we're going to reach out to
our friends at siena to gamestop and
talk about what games they're playing
right now is to play this we'll be right
back it's a slow period for new releases
right now so following up on Square
Enix's announcement of the Fallen
Fantasy 7 remake I'm going back and
playing the original this week I've been
playing the red solstice which is a
top-down shooter with some RTS element
so right now I'm crossing off one of my
games of shame when game I never played
in the past and always meant to and
that's the original Shenmue news for the
dreamcast
as you know not many video games are
released during the summertime but it
doesn't matter exempt still playing The
Witcher final fantasy 7 might not look
like much today compared to like modern
graphics but I still find that it's
really charming and the story in
mechanics just you know keep me coming
back year after year this is probably my
fifth time playing a game I'm level of
26 I think I'm pushing a hundred hours
now makes it cool is that it plays up to
eight players co-op online so that's
pretty neat you can get seven of your
buds to all go to Mars and shoot much
aliens I like that I don't know quite
what I think just yet but it's sort of
like a train wreck in that I can't look
away right now so I love to Witcher i'm
probably gonna be playing to which all
summer so if we talk next week again
it's probably good
welcome back to the show once again kale
is not here if you couldn't tell he's
down at comic-con so I brian bishop here
the film vault Adam Kroll show
best-selling author shrinkage all
correct so far all those things don't go
on fancy man about town that's right uh
so it's Thursday which means we like to
talk about the things that are making us
crazy in all the best ways so this is
into it brian bishop regale us with what
you are into this week i will so iím a
podcaster i do podcast and all i do is
listen to podcasts i've given up on the
radio I don't listen to to any of the
apps and music apps I just listen to
podcasts all the time because I like
being talked to and informed and
entertains and all those things yeah and
my one of my favorite podcasts which is
not exactly cutting edge because it's
been around for a while it's very
popular but just in case your listeners
aren't into podcast do yourself a favor
check out stuff you should know this
stuff that I listed all the time Josh
and Chuck are fantastic the good guys
had the opportunity to meet them when
they came to LA and it's live shows oh
yeah I remember that yeah and they are
the show is great super fascinating
stuff super fascinating not a lot of
production you're not going to be wowed
with whooshes and all the stuff on the
radio of the Stingers and the whooshes
and all that stuff which for me is great
because you actually get information the
guys talk to you and they talk to each
other and they have this great chemistry
that's great chemistry that's not forced
it's very easy and you're going to be
like I said entertained you're going to
learn some stuff you'll be informed and
you're going to be a conversation with a
friend and your and they're gonna be
like oh what's the deal with blah blah
blah like actually I know that I can
tell you what the deal is it that dollar
45 minutes about it which is really cool
and I like I always like how and then
they always do like a special Halloween
episode which is always entertaining and
but for me I'm timely stuff to the often
really timely that's that was just gonna
say the one thing I really like about
them is that if they see something in
the news or something that you know is
maybe a little confusing for people to
say okay let's do an episode on this
like
so how does comic-con work yeah and
they'll do like a whole episode about
like the history of comic-con and and
what it is now and why people go there
and why Studios go there and why people
might not go there and it's great they
are so great yeah they do it on bitcoins
am I recently that right because a lot
of people are like how exactly does this
work and they explained where I came
from how it works what the risks are
what the benefits are it's a really
interesting really interesting show
really well done i recommend it for for
listening and it's not a terrible time
commitment either the like half an hour
yeah they're 40 minutes 40 minutes give
or take let much less than an hour it's
like around like 30 to 40 minutes and
you're like an ass hundreds of episodes
so you feedback can get into it you're
gonna learn a lot yeah so I also i will
recommend that as well wait I do love it
that's on my podcast list and pocket
casts okay so I am into this week I I
feel a little bit psychic and a little
bit validated because I predicted during
our comic-con preview up so that they
would announce an app for Star Wars okay
and sure enough that's exactly what
happened and I downloaded it and it's
great it's even better than I could have
imagined so this app has literally
everything you ever need if you're a
star Wars fan this hey this is a massive
hub it's not only facts about stuff fun
facts about Star Wars ioerror rating
news yet like kind of the holocron is
sort of thing they have going on on on
the website on they have augmented
reality stuff you're able to do like
these cool augmented reality things they
have a force awakens countdown so they
have this day in star wars history they
have a weather hub so you can say like
oh it's 75 degrees that's like the
weather on Endor like it'll tell you
what whether that's like so here it
would be like oh it's 105 degrees that's
like tattooing do they have dark days in
star wars history like the day you
realize episode one sucked oh that was
the day you saw it pretty much been
walking about you Jace I rock out of
here and there we can I recreate that
crestfallen sensation ever want to know
what it feels like again but they've
gifts they've got a sound board in there
they have videos they have a selfie
section where you can like add in like
you take a selfie image like Yoda
behinds ething bus cost like ten dollars
it's free but uh it's totally free and
it's it literally when I say it is
jam-packed I mean it is overflowing
imagine a Dagwood sandwich
guys no no damages your you're literally
like 50 years too young to know what a
dad what is but a giant sandwich is
overflowing with stuff you take a bite
of it just stuff falls out that is
literally the Star Wars app you take a
bite of it and use explosion of stuff
just everywhere messy and delicious
messy and delicious a hard percent and
it's totally free it's really cool it's
designed really well I'm really
impressed okay I'll check it out if
you're just if your Star Wars Star Wars
being a person and you release an app
you're up to a high standard because
because your star wars it's caturday
yeah you're the you're the crown jewel
and then the movie geek demand you got
to be pretty awesome with your app i
think i think i like is it doesn't feel
forced it's not like hey good look at
how cool we are like horse horse um but
it's not like a not like hey guys we're
so cool like come you know we're trying
to be young appeal it no there's no
that's just like look guys it's Star
Wars take it or leave it it this is
pretty great stuff here you go I've at
it and it's there's something for
everybody in there so I I really enjoy
it that's what I'm into you right
download that right now I'm still
exploring the app like there's so much
stuff in there a lot of ground to cover
yeah and they're gonna add a bunch of
stuff I guess leading up to the force
awakens and of course like going forward
I'm sure they'll add more so so um so
yeah it's really really great so that's
what I'm into now speaking of Star Wars
we have to talk about your choices for
the young han solo movie that is going
to be coming out so let's hit user
feedback
okay so I'm gonna ask you first things
you weren't here okay who's your choice
for Jung Han Solo young haha what age
range are we talking I think 20 to 25
could play 20 to 25 it has to be that
age good yeah i feel like the obvious
answer is chris pratt only cuz he gets
every role second he's the same age that
Harrison Ford was and he plays along
first i don't want chris pratt we
excluded him from the thing like no
Chris Pratt okay a little old but he's
okay because he's he could pull it off
with the acting chops he's legitimately
a great actor who people aren't quite on
to yet as a great actor just a very good
actor Joseph gordon-levitt would be my
choice to play young jgl you know what I
like I brought up before our friend pin
who's a friend of the show rights and he
actually suggested jgl as well he's a
great actor for me he will be an Oscar
winner at some point in his life
absolutely nasty young bruce
willis and looper and was fantastic so
good yeah so you got the shops he can do
it that's a good choice and he is a
young face like because i feel like he
could totally pull that off okay that's
a good choice okay so now we have some
other folks some reviewers Walter Rodin
said who can play han Solo the actor
can't be too young thomas dekker comes
to mind okay I have not heard of that
person really thomas dekker is Thomas's
got a joke I don't know gov our face
with thomas dekker gosh Walter uh and
then Dustin wrote in bed this is only
why there's only one correct person to
fill the role the anonymous han Solo and
that is of course Cale anonymous very
youthful looking Kelly oh yeah no he is
he could play play Jung Han Solo uh and
then Frank wrote and said a young CGI
Harrison Ford because Harrison Ford is
Han Solo hashtag irreplaceable I feel
like that's what George Lucas would have
done he would have gone with it with
this easier right completely personal
charge are sold off or like that young
Jeff Bridges intron yeah open like that
I'm a little bit weird to smooth young
Al Pacino and cappuccino uh young young
Michael Douglas and ant-man to be there
said vitac oh well it ain't over yet
guys yeah young young Michael Douglas
yeah the young persons were creeping me
out uh Neil Ronan has said Anthony in
Gruber played young Harrison Ford an age
of Adeline his peers his Ford impression
and he sent us this YouTube video so
check this out there's that's him he
does in fact look like a young Harrison
yeah he does actually thats goods got
that going for me and he already played
young Harrison Ford so I'm gonna tell
you right now that guy in his agent are
anxiously waiting by their phone yeah
did you get our email see ya phone calls
and fix yeah I called you I lucasfilm
call me by the way this is this is still
the thing for the phone like the kids
even know exist anymore like this like
this right yeah it's this or like like
