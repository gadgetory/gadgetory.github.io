today we're gonna take a look at the
Vizio CA 27 a 1 now you might know Vizio
for making low-cost TVs but this is
actually its first desktop PC among an
assortment of computers that came out
with this year so this particular model
is an 11:49 desktop it comes with a 27
inch display and some interesting design
choices around some of those accessories
and as well as the overall design of the
system so the base of the unit is very
small Vizio has really gone to great
effort to make this sort of a minimal
piece of hardware there's some
sacrifices that come with that though
which are kind of for better for worse
now the riskiest decision Vizio made
with this PC is to ship it with a
touchpad instead of a mouse now it comes
with Windows 7 right now but of course
you can upgrade to Windows 8 when that
comes out later this year and that's a
much more touch oriented operating
system now we can't report on the
windows 8 experience with the system
right now because what touch comes the
whole series of gestures and that
software is not available yet but I can
say at least in Windows 7 the touchpad
really doesn't cut it as a mouse
replacement you can put it's just far
too laggy and not precise enough that
said the problem is easy enough to fix
by supplying our own mouse now of course
it also comes the wireless keyboard it's
a pretty good design here it feels nice
and sturdy with some interesting buttons
at the top here in particular is Vizio
button it brings up sort of a support
page the others is video input select
button now the system comes with two
HDMI inputs which means you can connect
a cable box or a game console or any
other external video source and use this
system is sort of a home entertainment
hub now it's a great feature that we
like to see in all in once and Vizio has
certainly gone to good effort to put
that at the forefront of this PC now the
third input device is this remote
control it's a pretty straightforward
piece of hardware it has a power button
that controls just the power for the
display so that's useful now you might
notice this big box over here now that's
not only a subwoofer and it puts out
decent audio but not really more than we
expect from $1000 desktop but it also
doubles as the power supply which is
kind of good and bad it's good because
it means as base unit can be nice and
small it's bad because you have the
separate subwoofer power supply thing
connected to your computer and a power
cord from the PC has to run through it
in order to connect to the wall now the
last real risky decision that Vizio made
the system was to leave out an optical
drive entirely of course you can add an
external optical drive whichever kind
you want through the USB ports
with no DVD or blu-ray drive built into
the system it sort of has some
compromises if you want to use it as a
home entertainment PC now granted not
everyone will miss DVD drives not
everyone uses blu-ray and you can easily
replace that functionality with a game
console or even a standalone optical
player now if we look at on the base of
the unit you'll see some pretty familiar
looking PC ports you've got some USB 3
inputs which are great a couple of HDMI
inputs like we mentioned it also has an
eSATA port here in the back and if you
look on the right side it's got an SD
card input as well as another USB 3 jack
comes with a reasonably fast Core i5
chip so it can keep up with any
application you want to throw at it
it also comes to the lower end Nvidia
graphics chip a g4 640 ml a chip but you
may notice that with some more advanced
PC games or when you bump up the image
quality settings performance is not
quite what you want it to be there is
one minor compromise in terms of its PC
hardware it only has four gigabytes of
RAM now six and eight are pretty common
at this price range and with four you
may be lose some power in terms of
multimedia editing particularly in more
recent versions of Photoshop Visio put
some clear effort into the design of
this system and it also took some
interesting risks for better for worse
if you're willing to go along with those
risks or if you're willing to add your
own hardware to sort of make up what
they lack this system actually could be
pretty good if you're looking for a
budget large screen all-in-one for more
traditional PC users we probably
recommend a system from someone else
sorry much Brown this is the Vizio see a
twenty seven a one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
