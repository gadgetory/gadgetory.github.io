backseat I'm the Hyundai Veloster
because I can't get out of that side one
of the keynotes on this vehicle
asymmetrical doors to here one over
there that one's longer this one's small
there's a lot more to this car than just
that strangeness let's try the 2012
Hyundai Veloster brand-new model for
them and check the tech
two things struck me about the Veloster
the first minute I got in first of all
this seven-inch color LCD is standard
though it doesn't always have nav that's
an optional package we'll get to and it
has acres of nasty plastic hard plastic
everywhere with kind of a I don't know
if that's something in between a faux
carbon fiber and a little sort of a
herringbone but it's not real attractive
but bare the car's price point in mind
and around 18 grand to have this full
head unit you got an option up for the
tech package mm more and it requires
something called the style package which
is $2,000 as well so let's say it's 4
grand to go CNET style like I'm going to
show you
I like the Hyundai head unit I have for
a long time all your favorite media
sources are the am/fm no HD radio
satellite radio is XM you get traffic
from that as well when you're in the
navigation this is a nice looking map I
think this is one of the better rendered
out there and for a car at this price
range that's saying something it's a
touchscreen of course and quite
responsive I don't find that it has any
lag to speak of and the buttons
basically react the way you want them to
when you hit them you got an optical
slot right here for your CD and there's
also a USB aux classic hyundai-kia stuff
they just about all have this which
gives you your iPod USB and anything
else by an aux jack with the nav package
we've bumped ourselves up to $2,000 tech
package we also get bluetooth streaming
I don't believe that that's in the car
without that package you get decent
controls for bluetooth streaming no
advance or backtrack and minimal
metatags
and notice it does have support for a
Pandora app on your smart phone through
bluetooth streaming as well and you've
got the backup camera here again that's
part of this navigation or tech package
pretty basic just gives you some
distance markings it also includes rear
sensors the style package the $2,000
package you've got to have before you
get the tech package which is kind of
tricky stuff brings you the dimension
audio system like 450 watts it's
actually sounding pretty darn good for a
car in this price class now this car has
Hyundai blue link kind of an OnStar on
steroids including pio I search and
download with agent assistance the usual
SOS and roadside help valet boundaries
and stolen vehicles slowdown and
tracking you can share your location via
Facebook use voice command to compose
SMS text and with an app on your smart
phone lock
unlock remote start and blow the horn
put the lights off and on you see we
have the six-speed manual here that's
your base gearbox you can also get a six
called dual clutch a DCT for 1250 more
yes there's that telltale click it's a
direct injection car gas direct
injection those turbos honey nonsense
like that 1.6 litre kind of small in
fact about the smallest di car I think
we've tested and one of the smaller in
the industry gets 138 horsepower 123
foot-pounds of torque the car only
weighs 2,700 pounds so those numbers
aren't as concerning as they seem you
get to 60 in about eight and a half
seconds while delivering 28 40 mpg with
the manual 40 is the magic number these
days if you get the DCT you lose that
headline and you end up with 29 38 so
you pick up one of the city but lose two
on the freeway now let's go see what
it's like on both well the first thing
you notice in this Veloster is there's
not a lot of velocity in the Veloster
two words gun let's unfortunately the
numbers on this engine don't lie it's
lacking some power that it really kind
of needs so that's a little
disappointing
beyond that the gearbox is a nice one
the handling is fine it's not
dramatically sporty but this isn't a
sport trim car but they'll add a turbo
sort trim later and the steering is a
little bit technical shall we say it's
electric power steering and certainly
around town as you're driving and
nibbling around or if you're out on the
road it's it's a little numb it's
precise in a clean linear sense but it
doesn't give you any road feedback all
in all it's a perfectly nice car to
drive if it had more under the throttle
it really doesn't it sort of doesn't
answer when you get on the pedal not
with anything convincing that's the main
theme I take away from driving the
Veloster
okay the philosophers about an $18,000
ride but to get it seen that style you
got to add the style package for two
grand which is mostly panoramic roof an
upgraded audio all the other tech comes
in the tech package mm more but chapter
the style pack is to get the tech
package so assume you're gonna add four
grand and buy this guy for about
twenty-two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
