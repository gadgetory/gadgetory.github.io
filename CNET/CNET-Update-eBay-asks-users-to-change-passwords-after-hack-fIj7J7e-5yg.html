again I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update ladies and gentlemen it's
time to play the hot new cybersecurity
game change your password our next
contestant is one of the largest online
retailers in the world ebay nearly 150
million lucky ebay users will now have
to reset their passwords due to a
massive hack that happened three months
ago but we're just getting warned about
it now hey announcer voice Dan would you
tell our ebay users what they lost you
and your loved one can spend the next
month checking your credit report for
fraud now that hackers have your name
address birthdate phone number and email
address this all-inclusive hack also may
result in target of scams over phone or
email thanks Dan okay let's get serious
I think this game of resetting our
passwords every other week is getting a
bit tiresome Yahoo snapchat AOL they
were all hacked recently exposing
millions of accounts heartbleed had us
all resetting our passwords last month
and of course credit and debit card
information was stolen from Target
stores and that impacted 110 million
customers ebay does not know how many
people were impacted but everyone's
password is reset as a precaution the
good news is that this does not involve
any financial information so paypal
credit card info that still seems safe
just keep in mind that even a company as
large as eBay cannot be trusted to
protect your password so use different
passwords on every site if the hacker
gets hold of one it won't unlock other
accounts now to keep your passwords
extra safe you may want to look into
using a program like LastPass it gives
you an extra layer of protection and you
can find a tutorial on how to use it at
cnet let's switch gears to social media
there's a new way to share what you're
up to on Facebook right now if you want
to tell folks about a show that you're
watching or music you're listening to
well you'd have to type it in your
status update maybe you'll also add in a
fun icon to represent the activity or
the mood but now you don't have to tell
Facebook what show you're watching it
just knows by listening to the audio in
the room the facebook app will listen to
the background sound and recognize a TV
show or a song that you're playing and
you can link that information in your
status update post you can turn this
feature off but facebook says it won't
store any audio for your privacy it's
coming to android and iOS facebook apps
in the coming weeks that your tech news
update you can find more in these
stories at cnet com from our studios in
New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
