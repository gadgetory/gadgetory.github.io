hi-fi man a chi 400 I ate $500
audiophile headphones it's actually a
relatively good value because headphones
with this type of sound quality
typically cost significantly more
sleeker looking headphones from
companies like Sennheiser Bowers &amp;amp;
Wilkins and Bayer dynamic use drivers
that work like miniature cone or dome
speaker drivers while the Aichi 400 I
uses thin film planar magnetic flat
tires to produce clear and more
dynamically alive sound
these guys are primarily designed for
use at home with a receiver or headphone
amplifier due to the drivers increased
weight they can work with portable
devices though you may find yourself
wanting a touch more volume well it's a
larger headphone it isn't super heavy
and is very comfortable to wear and
steadily built with thick detachable
cables the one issue some people might
have with it is that it does have a
fairly short cord it's only about five
and a half feet and that may be a little
short for home use from a design
standpoint the other drawback is that it
features an open back design so the
headphone leaks sound in a major way in
other words it's not a good choice for
an open office environment
well the 8400 I is expensive it's an
extrordinary headphone the sound is
significantly more transparent and vivid
than Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins flagship piece 7
headphone for example the four hundred
eyes clarity shouldn't be confused with
mere brightness or hype treble it just
lets you hear more deeply into your
music is akin to looking through a
cleaner window hi-fi man also makes the
step-down he4 hard which has come down
to price and now cost $300 it's also a
good value but this model is a better
sounding headphone with more
transparency and better to find bass
it's also got a new design to the
headband which makes it more comfortable
headphone from a standpoint you get
better transparency a better defined
bass it's also a bore efficient
headphone and is better suited to mobile
device use I'm David Carr noise and
that's the hi-fi man 8,400 I thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
