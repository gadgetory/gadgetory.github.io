is gonna be on TV yeah on it's actually
gonna be on the internet it's gonna be
on cnet com so do you think that the
iPhone 5 is going to have a bigger
screen I want to buy wow that's a big
question I was thinking that they are
thinking of a smaller screen use they
are using a smaller screen that you can
pick up oh wow i'm guessing pick up you
know everything despite its dismal but
my thought now is white why can't they
not have a big screen if Apple you know
can be a TV or what that's even more
more good to have a big screen like you
know life size screen or medium stream
or what that's the best thing that can
happen to up alright yeah ok so you
think it will have a bigger screen
probably why not if Google is thinking
of another kind of you know where they
can have a channel and everything went
get up compete with a one you know big
screen google I think that's the right
answer i agree with you i mean i think
so that's what I think pin if Apple can
do that why not so I was wondering what
your thoughts are on the next iPhone and
whether you think it'll be bigger than
the current iphone like bigger in size
yes um no you don't think so no I don't
know how come uh
uh because it's not that kind of thing
like they want to go smaller and smaller
great that's right thing to nokia thank
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
