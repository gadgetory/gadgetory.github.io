Jason Cipriani is seen it how to
contributor and today I'm going to show
you how to control which system services
have access to your location in iOS 5 to
control your location settings for
system services inter settings location
services here you see your normal list
of location settings for each individual
app that requires your location once you
get down to the bottom you'll see system
services and here you're presented with
a list of services on your phone that
require your location from time to time
you could turn each one of them off we
want on whatever you prefer and feel
comfortable with you can choose to do
just by tapping on the toggle switch and
it'll turn it on or off if you scroll
all the way down to the bottom you'll
see an option for the status bar icon on
or off what this does is it will
actually display the location icon on
your top status bar when one of these
system services are actually accessing
your location turn it off if you don't
need to see it each time one of these
services or act is accessing your
location that's all there is to it as
you can see Apple is really going out of
its way to ease any fears over location
tracking in iOS 5 for more great tech
