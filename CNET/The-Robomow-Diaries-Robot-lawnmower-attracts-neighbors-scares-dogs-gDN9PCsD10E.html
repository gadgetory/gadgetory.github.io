afternoon so I'm really eager to give
the robo-moe another try this time with
dry grass and a real chance at success
to see how it does here's the state of
my yard right now after Robo mows first
turn basically it looks like a squiggly
asterisk that some kid thought was funny
or maybe a crop circle basically it
doesn't look great the most interesting
thing to happen during this mowing is
how much the robo-moe scares dogs
specifically is a dog of a neighbor who
was walking by the robo-moe he quickly
commenced it freaking out jumping on her
being really scared and I don't blame
him my own dog is currently in the house
as robo-moe advises you should lead
animals and small kids out of the way
while it's doing its thing there's a
sensor on the front that is supposed to
detect when something you know runs up
against it but better safe than sorry
current status inside my house it
started raining it's sprinkling a little
bit but the robo-moe is still going as
the book says that the robo-moe should
be able to detect rain and I'm assuming
will automatically go back to the dock
itself so we shall see how it does one
thing that is pretty cool about the
robo-moe is it's giving me a chance to
meet new neighbors specifically a
gentleman named omou who was playing
with his kids who were on bikes and they
came by just to see how the robo-moe
worked it will make you the talk of the
neighborhood I'll give you that which
but I'm fairly new here so it's kind of
a cool way to get to know my neighbors
and there it is the robo-moe found its
way home it did indeed since the rain
and it mode for about 30 minutes before
it finally stopped and now it's going to
get a rest in a recharge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
