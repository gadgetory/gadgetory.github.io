man's sky is it is a very ambitious
space exploration game that kind of took
the gaming world by storm if only
because people kind of projected these
may be unrealistic expectations on what
this game is gonna wind up being
including david katz mine so excited
he's very excited to play taking off
right at the show running home and
downloading it cuz the steam is actually
able now so on Twitter people are asking
people to go to their houses and
download the game for them so it's ready
when I really work yeah okay it's not
that big of a game gonna be one of those
weekends yeah yeah I've been playing it
for about 15 hours it's it's different I
think for a lot of people it's a game
that they weren't expecting and again
that is not a throat that's not throwing
shade at the developers I think this
game kind of got away from everybody and
once that big sort of e3 demo happened a
couple years ago it kind of blew
everyone's minds and completely changed
the perception of what this game
actually is and what people kind of
wanted it to be so I get that knots
understandable at its core no man's sky
is really just a resource survival Matt
of a survival game inventory management
game I know that was that's like the
trio kiss of death there are moments in
this game that you will literally you
know not believe what you're seeing yeah
but after a while you kind of understand
what this games about I feel terrible
saying this because I'm sitting next to
someone who is very excited to play for
the first time I am still excited
regardless of how many times yes which
is great and you should be because the
first couple hours are great i will
offer my own disappointment ya know like
I died and i think it was sat on monday
when i come in she's gonna rest for you
the Holy See version might take
advantage of better specs
yeah they're usually really that's that
might be but the game might look better
yeah that might be it though it's not
going to change gameplay it's not going
to bring you to a level you're like oh
this game offers a different feature set
on PC at least not at the beginning I
mean it i don't know if there's modding
or whatever but at the end of the day
these guys are also saying they're going
to improve aspects of this game a big
selling points for me was like that
there it's a community it's a vibe
basically like a big mama por even
though you can't actually you know
interact with people right environment
wherever there's so many cool things
about the game that made me really
intrigued I mean it's it obviously the
biggest thing is every planet you go to
is spontaneously created for you which
is kind of cool and right and for me
like that like the reason I'm going to
go back and play some of that again this
weekend is because I just like rolling
the dice I just like seeing what the
game spits out it's something
technically no one else will ever see so
that's kind of fun just the notion of
like hey the math that this game is
relying on allows it to create stuff
that odds are no one else will ever see
so you know you have dice so it's like
you know you roll a six it's a blue sky
you roll a 1 it's a yellow sky putting
it on down the line so it is party or
beef it is not enough dice there's not
yeah stuff that can be different about
each world like is it too similar to
despite the fact that they say there's
whatever 19 quadrillion possible worlds
that people can get to and that's yes
simply put like yes that is the
complaint it's because the the asset
pool that this game continually draws
from doesn't allow and I get it like
it's in it it is an achievement what
these guys have done at hello games like
this is a technical achievement at the
same time though because of that and
what they did you know the game does not
allow for the variance that people kind
of project where it's like Oh every this
could be anything like it's just not
that there's different terrain the first
time I landed on like what was mostly a
water planet was pretty cool yeah um so
I think like that's what you got to kind
of keep in the back your head because
after you play for about five six seven
hours to see the same kind of
you get it you understand like what's
happening here every now and then I'm
like I like that is uh there's this here
yeah that's interesting okay again the
sense of scale for me is the best part
of this game this game treats you like
you are this small a comic little thing
in a gigantic seemingly endless endless
universe so for me that sense of scale
they nail it I email it's so interesting
cuz that's like the thing that video
games kind of have done recently like I
always think a Witcher is like largest
game world I sure experience where you
you're like all of a sudden you're in
this other island that's huge right and
and some dudes went out and made all of
that by right every little turn on the
on the trail as you're riding along and
and even the dlcs gigantic right at game
and it's so big that i still haven't
explored every part of it and i'm
wondering you know it and it seems like
every time you go there's something new
and different right with this it's
obviously infinite basically yeah it's
essentially infinite and when you look
at something like the witcher you're
right every square inch of that map was
drawn and render and put together and
preconceived shy can and a gigantic
where no man's sky it's sort of just
like hey here's this you know blender we
have let's stop it and see where it
stops and that's kind of like the best
way I can explain Harold's wondering if
you guys think because it'll be too
taxing on pcs which your to discover did
you think it was just texting when
you're playing on ps4 there's a couple
times where you hid some pretty
significant frame rate frame rate dips
pc it's gonna be fine it's gonna be fun
it's not you know it taxes the ps4
hardware and i think at points you're
like okay yeah maybe Neil will do a
better job with no man's guy but i don't
think the way to think about it is like
oh this is going to run super smooth on
pc either i don't think the the sort of
like ecology within the game is open to
like very variable perform you know sort
of improvements just based on the
hardware running it I don't know that's
sort of the vibe we get there's a lot of
like texture drawn that you'll probably
wind up seeing in the ps4 version that
maybe you won't see
in the pc stuff i don't know yet and
it's a ball usually a pc release you
know there's gonna be bugs sure no and
there's buggy a peaceful yeah exactly so
I'm not expecting a totally smooth
weekend yeah because obviously there's a
huge day zero path right i think it's
baked into the steam it's definitely
bacon so like i want to worry about that
but you know it's it's still not gone
thing it's going to be the smoothest
experience I don't expect most day one
games to be perfect yeah I'm we spat
rooms I'm definitely curious to hear
what you're saying Monday morning yeah
sure there's a few people asking about
availability for the games that they are
wondering about them if it was available
on early access for steam ID no and
consoles which is ps4 it just ps4 and PC
that's so Xbox announced right yeah I
would that's gonna power not be a thing
really yeah that's crazy i could i
remember reading that going wat why
that's yeah I don't know you got you can
infer what you want maybe Sony paid for
some of that development that's just
speculation and hell followed up peace
was wondering if it's essentially a
pretty walking sim uh you know you're
walking for some of it in the beginning
but then it's kind of like flying soon
mm-hmm for a lot of the rest of that
game warping sim it was that warping
sent warping sent warp sales in yes so
there's a no man's sky if there's
anything else or no do you guys think it
was overhyped one of the persons one of
people earlier our chat was wondering
why are we doing so much news about no
man's sky and it was a very big a very
big driver of news this week do you
think over the course the last three
years it was overhyped versus what you
were playing now definitely everything's
overhyped like let's not it's not
exclusive to no man's sky everything is
overhyped it's the things that supersede
expectation that really are the
remarkable things right most things are
overhyped goodness to assess what so I
feel like you have to really take it for
what it's worth like this game I think
it's more remarkable that this game had
that reaction and again like we talked
about earlier you can't fault anyone for
it like you can't look at the developers
bill you guys made something that seemed
to cool you should have talked down your
games ya can't believe in joyed the
the roller coaster that was you know
leading up to the release no was it over
hyped absolutely so you're saying not
game of the year it isn't I do not
believe that will be game of the year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
