today we're talking about extension
cords but this is seen it though you
know it's no regular extension cord
let's take a look at the Robo reel which
is a motorized power cord management
system the body of the Robo reel is
about the same size shape and color of a
basketballs a big sphere it's held in
place by this sort of plastic frame that
also doubles as a carrying handle when
you want to carry it around somewhere
it's got these sort of rubber points
where the it actually meets the ground
so that combined with the fact that it's
really low means you don't really have
to worry about knocking this thing over
when it comes time to use it now the top
half of the sphere spins freely through
360 degrees so you don't really have to
worry about snagging it on anything you
can just kind of whip the cable around
where you want and the cable itself
pulls freely from the center of the reel
now at one Dan you get this sort of
heavy terminal you've got three standard
outlets all of those are about one
hundred ten hundred twenty Watts fifteen
amps of power and about 1,800 watts of
total energy can come through here
before you start running into problems
we also got these indicator lights to
let you know that you actually do have
juice and at the other end you've got
your standard sort of male outlet that
goes into the wall that's fused so you
don't really have to worry about any
sort of surge issues the cable actually
pulls freely and there's no sort of
spring-loaded pull back so you have to
worry about it snatching the tool out of
your hand
when you're in the middle cutting some
wood or something like that when it's
time for you to bring the cable in you
tap this button one time to shut off
power to the Robo reel unit touch it
again and a 100 in 80 volt electric
motor actually holds the cable back in
automatically let's say to stage motor
so it pulls pretty quickly at the
beginning but over the last couple of
feet it slows down a little bit so you
don't get this sorted in whipping around
all unsafely and users can customize the
point at which it does slow down so if
you wanted to slow down a little bit
sooner you can do that it also has some
safety features built in including
thermal protection so you don't have to
worry about it bursting into flames
you've got surge protection you've also
got an automatic cut off feature so if
you're working on something and this
cable gets severed the
power to the whole unit instantly shuts
off no fear of electrocution there and
when the cable is being retracted if it
gets stuck or snagged on something it
automatically stops the drag back so you
have to worry about knocking over all
sorts of things in your house a garage
so we've actually got two drawbacks that
I kind of want to talk about here the
first one is kind of small the other one
kind of big the small one is that the
Robo wheel is kind of loud you're
drawing the cable out it makes a lot of
sort of electrical motor whirring noise
and when it's time to draw the cable
back in it makes even more noise now if
you're in your garage that's probably
not that big of a deal but if you're
using this thing around the house where
people can be disturbed by the noise
you're gonna want to keep an ear out for
that the other minor issue is the price
this thing is two hundred and seventy
nine dollars now that's a lot of money
for an extension cord even one as
advanced as this one but if you've got
pockets deep enough to swing it perhaps
it's worth it to never have to coil a
cable again you can check out the full
review of the Robo reel over on cnet.com
until then i'm antoine Goodwin and we've
been taking a look at the Robo reel
