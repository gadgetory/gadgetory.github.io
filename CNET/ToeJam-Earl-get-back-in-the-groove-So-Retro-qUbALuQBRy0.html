independent game developer I run human
nature studios and we are making a new
version a reboot a new game is called
toejam and Earl back in the room that
it's a very sort of chill game much
slower paced and a lot of games are it's
got a lot of memories for people this
time we're gonna do a true reboot of
game
toejam and earl was originally released
in 1991 second game came out in 93 that
was called panic on funkotron the
original game came out for the Sega
Genesis sort of a byproduct of my
background I think I grew up in the 70s
with a lot of funk music I know I don't
really look it now I'm half half white
half black that's what I look like in
1977 that's that's me with the fro so
toejam and Earl are african-american
characters yo what's up my name is
toejam you know it's my homeboy big Earl
you stay what's up Earl you were so that
was just kind of came out because that
was my world I made the game with my
business partner mark force anger
co-creator it was just the two of us we
had this idea that we were gonna do a
dynamic split-screen when two players
walked a part of the screen would split
and then they come together again and it
comes back together and we mentioned
that to Sega they said mmm
flowery there's no way the hardware's
gonna do that just can't do it
thankfully mark is a little bit stubborn
and actually managed to make it happen
see a whole pile of original artwork
here this is some of the very original
art like this is one of the first
drawings ever of toejam we did a
turnaround you got to do that of course
when you're designing a character from
all angles and these were like really
really early sketches Wow that goes way
back
the new game is kind of a mix of game 1
elements and gain 2 elements and then a
bunch of new things to that we've
brought in so it feels old but it's just
better
we ran Kickstarter campaign I think our
bar was 400 K we came in at 500 a little
bit over we added a bunch of new
characters in this game there's now 9
playable characters instead of 2 you can
play toejam and Earl in their new forms
and in their classic forms we have the
rhythm matching that was in Game one now
you can create your own beat
and and that's particularly fun when
you're playing with other people because
then they have to match the beat that
you've created you know I wasn't going
to do the voices for this game initially
and then we started getting feedback
from some of the fans on the forum a lot
of them said no no no we want the
original voice we want to hear it again
the insane dentist I had to do that one
when everyone else left the office had a
cackle that went like the music is
exactly the same
it is like very very pure old-school
funk we're gonna be out on PC and on
consoles I just want people to love it
in this case I want people to feel like
we did justice to their memories to feel
like it really is true to the spirit of
the original games if people feel like
we did that like we succeeded at making
them feel those joyful memories again
then I'll feel like we did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
