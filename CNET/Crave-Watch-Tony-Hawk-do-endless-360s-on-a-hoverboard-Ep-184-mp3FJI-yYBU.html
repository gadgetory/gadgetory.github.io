here's what's happening this week on
that's great some musicians see sound in
colors and waves and others like new
zealand-based musician Nigel Stanford
produce a video that amplifies the
visual aspects of sound waves Nigel
teamed up with director Shahir Dowd to
produce a music video which showcases
sound waves visual using six different
scientific experiments that are known to
produce visual sound waves they set out
on a sonic journey to capture these
visual sound experiments on video as the
band performed the song cymatics named
after the study of visible sound the
song is part of Stanford's newly
released albums solar echoes and was
written based on these sonic
visualizations
each instrument was represented with a
different visualization for instance the
keyboard uses a chelada knee plate which
is a thin metal plate that vibrates when
sound waves were run through it causing
patterns to form and sam sprinkled over
the surface the bass track was
represented by a thin dish of vodka
placed on the speaker the sound coming
out of the speaker causes the vodka to
ripple and wrinkle which looks very cool
make sure you watch the entire video on
the Craig
a Kickstarter campaign is raising some
serious money in a quick pace to send a
robotic probe to the South Pole the moon
we're able to drill into the surface and
bury a time capsule now this sounds like
I can get pretty expensive which is why
they want you to pay for it capitalizing
on the popularity of the Rosetta mission
and the success of the fillet Lander a
UK based team lunar missions limited has
launched a campaign to send a robotic
probe to the surface of the Moon where
organizers hope that the robotic Lander
will have the ability to drill between
20 to 100 meters into the moon's surface
in a location where no space mission has
explored the time capsule is only a
small part of the mission because the
lander will also study the geology of
the moon's rocky layers hopefully giving
scientists on earth more insight into
how the moon was formed as well as
unlock some secrets about our local
solar systems backers of the Kickstarter
campaign during later fundraising phases
will have the option to include a
digital text message or video to be
entombed in a separate private time
capsule that will even include strands
of human hair to your DNA can forever be
entombed within the moon the pan
telligent intelligent frying pan is a
smart frying pan that will turn any
terrible cook into a four-star chef
without the help of a screaming Chef
Ramsay isn't anywhere near foods founder
chef and MIT engineer Umberto Evans
designed the frying pan to be so easy to
use that even the Swedish Chef could use
it possibly okay I'm out of Chef jokes
pan intelligent is simply a frying pan
you use it just like a frying pan you
put it on the stove and cook your food
what's cool about it is that it contains
sensors within the pan that send data to
an app on your smartphone or tablet
which help guide you through the cooking
process the pan telligent app contains a
database of foods for you to select
before you start your meal let's say we
want salmon tonight simply select the
salmon and follow the directions you can
tell the app the size and weight of your
piece of salmon so it can calculate
proper heat and cook times that are
specific to your portion to connect the
app to the frying pan you simply tap the
handle and it's pair intelligent will
tell you if the heat is too hot or cold
old and it will even tell you when to
flip your piece of meat clip the salmon
Thank You theory the app will send
notifications to your phone or smart
watch if you get distracted while
cooking and the best part is that you
will never burn or ruin your precious
dinner which is the most important thing
eating is good i like to eat you like to
eat so why not get smart about it read
