net this is a quick video review of the
Philips AE a 7100 wireless microphone
and Bluetooth speaker combo so this is
really two separate devices the first
part of it is a simple stationary
speaker dock with a 30 pin dock
connector that's for all your iOS stuff
like the second gen iPad and iPhones up
to the fifth version it's also Bluetooth
powered which means you can stream music
from those same devices if you don't
need to get a charge out of the dock it
also comes with this wireless microphone
here and that's where the second part
comes in the wireless microphone is
accessory to the star maker karaoke app
that comes bundled with the unit now
Philips partnered with the creators of
the Star Maker karaoke and auto-tune app
to release the dock but you could still
use the app separately if you want to
keep costs low and don't mind just
singing into your iPhone now I'm always
down to do karaoke and the app is
definitely worth a download if you are -
it's a lot like other karaoke apps in
that it tests your vocal skills by
simulating a performance of popular
songs as you harmonize along with the
vocals the difference here is that
thanks to a partnership with some of the
major music labels the Star Maker app
offers over 500 songs in their catalog
that range in genre and decade some of
the popular ones on here include a bunch
of tracks from bands like One Direction
Rihanna
uh sure and Blake Shelton but there's
also a bunch of throwback hits like oops
I did it again by Britney Spears as long
as you love me by the Backstreet Boys
and I'll make love to you by Boyz you
can either sing by yourself or sing in a
battle mode with a friend but it only
comes with one mic so we'll have to pass
that back and forth or just get really
close together and if you're not great
at staying in tune you could still be
just as good as those real pop stars
with an auto-tune button that forces
your really bad voice into the right
pitch as you sing unfortunately since
the app and the hardware are made by two
different companies you'll still have to
pay for the songs and you can either pay
for individual songs that range from 25
cents up to 75 cents or you can buy a
VIP pass that opens up the entire
catalogue for $1.99 a week or 25 bucks
for six months the other
option those two earn credits by
competing and public competition with
other karaoke fans online a star maker
has set up a site at star maker studios
calm where you can upload your songs get
votes on a leaderboard and if your track
reaches the top of the list you'll earn
tokens that you can then use to buy more
songs you can download the app for free
right now and it works with any iOS
device but this Philips dock is really
meant for the iPad version here's the
thing though you're not always gonna use
the speaker for karaoke in the app and
when you're just listening to music it's
really not that great first of all it's
a hundred and eighty bucks which is a
lot to ask for a speaker that can't go
with you and only has two five watt
speakers inside you can get something
like the creative d100 for a lot less
that's an older Bluetooth speaker but it
still does everything this Philips
speaker can but at more than half of the
price the Bluetooth microphone is pretty
cool and this will make a fun party
accessory for diehard karaoke ears but
everyone else can still have just as
much fun just downloading the app for
free and putting your money toward
buying more songs in the catalogue
you could check out more details in my
for view as well as more Bluetooth
speaker reviews on CNET I'm Justin you
you just took a first look at the
Philips AE a seventy one hundred star
maker wireless microphone and Bluetooth
speaker thanks for watching
