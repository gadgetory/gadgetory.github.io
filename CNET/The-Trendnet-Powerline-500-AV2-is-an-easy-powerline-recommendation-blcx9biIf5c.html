new TRENDnet powerline adapter the TPL
4:08 e2k no say the only ones it's a kid
because there are two units now this
here work basically as the two ends of a
physical network cable that in this case
is the ethical wiring of your home now
basically you plug these two into one
socket and what happened which we two of
them is magic and by magic I mean the
adapter here turned the power wiring it
was something that also transmits data
and that means from one room to another
you don't need to run that long network
cable and risk your wife you kid or
yourself tripping over it
it happens now you still need network
cable to connect this adapter to devices
and to short one are included here you
first connect one of them to your router
and the other one to a device such as a
computer and voila you done now the
adapters here work with AC from 100 volt
to 240 volt and that means they work
basically anywhere in the world except
for maybe North Korea where they are not
many power socket to begin with that's
surprising but hey I came but the people
that is now when it come to power light
you need to adapter to create the first
connection but only one for each
additional connection and that means
it's very important to have security
because they can actually tap into your
whole network by using an adapter of
their own
now the good news is the trend out here
comes with a very easy to activate
security feature now you see this sync
button right here when pressing on the
button on the adapter when they are
plucking of course it would create a
secure condition between them and they
will not work with any other power
adapters now powerline adapters are not
new but this trend out here is one of a
few that support the new AV 2 500
standard and that means offer up to 500
megabit per second in my testing it
actually register the sustain will will
speed up some 33 megabyte per second or
some 270 megabit per second now that is
very fast about three or four times the
speed of a regular Ethernet connection
all one thought
I'm a gigabit connection in fact this
kid here is one of the fastest I've ever
seen
now that's all good and well but how
about the price well it happened to be
also one of the most affordable costing
just about $75 for a kid up to or only
$45 for a single unit now for more on
the trainer kid here check out my full
review set calm basically if you want to
extend your whole network to a spot
where the Wi-Fi can reach such as a low
low basement get this kid here and feel
spoiled by me that's because I'm down
low and this has been the first look at
the trend add a V to 500 powerline
adapter kit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
