fighting on the internet recently that
was mega BOTS versus kuratas and I am
here with David Isaac's the head of leaf
development for mega watts Inc which is
gonna be starting a robot fighting
League that I would like to know much
more about and also megawatts eggs VP of
business development Jake coos Rach
thank you so much for joining us thank
you all right so let's talk a little bit
about the fight and then we'll talk
about the league so how do you guys feel
I'd make about Cink about the very first
mega robot fight first of all it's
amazing to have been able to bring this
to people we have so many people coming
up to us and saying thank you for making
my childhood dreams come true and a lot
of people realize how much technology
how much R&amp;amp;D went into this so it's
really amazing to us to have finally
been able to pull it off yeah and
winning was nice winning is always
always good so you are in charge of the
league and its development could you
tell us a little bit about how you plan
the league to sort of work because giant
fighting robots are a lot different than
say football the idea is really that we
have teams teams can come from
individuals cities teams can come from
companies and teams can come from other
countries and we're going to bring them
all together and have fights here in the
United States in arenas and around the
world have tournaments awesome um so if
in terms of the very first fight if
there was anything that you guys at mega
BOTS could do differently is there
anything that you would have changed or
is there anything based on maybe
feedback from the internet or or just
internally is there anything you guys
would have done differently yeah I mean
we really wanted to host it here in the
US I think that's gonna one of the big
things and I think another thing is you
know obviously for people they have
different expectations when they think
about giant robot Fighting's they've
been looking at CGI and of course and I
think people I like the people that
actually looked at our videos before and
really knew what they were getting into
it is super hard to pull off giant robot
fighting and what we did really for
people who understand the technology is
amazing we had a tremendous number of
viewers who saw it so I think we're
proud and excited what we did and I
think it's just the start
it's
just the minimum viable product it's
just the proof-of-concept and we go from
there will will there be a rematch of
megabots and kuratas do you think that
would be a thing that we might see Never
Say Never
but I think we are thinking forward
moving on from cratis different
competitors so far do you guys have a
specific list of competitors or who what
types of teams or people do you look for
how does anybody even get involved if
they want to build a mega robot maybe
they have one in their backyard and
they're like I'd really like to be
involved in this league so we have I
think 21 applications right now to
participate in this league Wow and we
have to vet them because we know how
hard it is to build giant robots and
frankly there are a number of them that
we're like well they may build a giant
robot but it might take them five years
but what we're trying to do is figure
out who actually has the technical
capability the financial wherewithal to
pull this off and then let them go build
robots and compete against us in our
league we are going to produce more
robots so we see ourselves as actually
producing many many robots that we could
brand differently and we can produce
them for other team owners so imaginable
so we see that as part of it and we also
see other teams coming in and bringing
their robots you may have seen Monkey
King from China challenging us we've had
a lot of interesting challengers for us
now that part of it is to figure out you
know who's for real and who can show up
at an arena at a specific date and
really fight and as part of that as part
of the development we need rules and
procedures and regulations and so that's
really what we've been working on was
seen what worked what didn't work as
well as we'd like what things do we need
to and how do we set that up so that we
have fair but really exciting fights
yeah one of the things I thought was
really interesting that a lot of people
on the internet were bummed out about
was not being able to be there in person
to watch the fights and obviously there
is an element of danger involved you
never know how a robot part is going to
fly off if it gets hit or if something
malfunctions how do you how do you keep
people safe but enable them to sort of
watch these things or will they be a
little bit more pre-recorded and
packaged
in a really professional way like is
there a plan either way forward we are
heading towards live live great that's
really the plan and I think very shortly
you will see announcements from us
really that will make clear exactly how
quickly we're planning to get there
great um so some people have suggested
that pilotless robots might be more
exciting in terms of the damage the
robots could do to each other because
obviously you don't want to put a human
person in danger piloting these robots
even though it was dangerous for them to
be piloting them in the first place even
though you made it as safe as possible
is is that a consideration well do you
think that maybe the league will have
rules about you must have a human pilot
or maybe there doesn't need to be one I
think we love this idea you know and
frankly it's something we're testing you
know we have you know two robots so we
are playing with some formats we're
trying out different combinations of man
versus unmanned just to see how it goes
and we want our fans to respond we want
to hear what they have to say what they
want to see cuz at the end of the day
that's what we're trying to deliver I
mean personally you know someone who
helps start the UFC I like the human
element inside the robot but I am you
know safety is a primary concern and so
I think we have to balance those and so
it may be that we have two different
classes of robots with two different
types of fighting it may be that it's a
developmental process where we move from
unmanned to manned robots but I we're
still in the really early stages of this
we do want to make sure nobody gets
seriously hurt and you're and when you
see the size and the speed of these
robots I can person you you understand
this is heavy equipment and moving very
quickly we need to do things in a very
in a proper manner to make sure people
really don't get hurt so you mentioned
UFC and you are one of the cofounders of
UFC you did that for a really long time
did you just wake up one morning and
decide you know what fighting robots is
the future I'm gonna go with that what
makes fighting robots more compelling
than fighting humans I don't know if
they're more compelling I think there's
there's a similarity though between when
we first started the UFC and people saw
it and said I can't believe I'm allowed
to see that and when they see giant
robots fighting for real I think they
think to themselves I imagine that this
might exist at some point but I didn't
know I would ever get to
for real and that's what's really
exciting for me it's kind of like the
next level giant fighting robots and
people really love giant fighting robots
I know that you guys did some great
things on your twitch channel could you
elaborate a little bit more on that Jake
yeah we did we actually had the largest
non gaming stream larges following since
2015 so huge accomplishment for us
million viewers actually million viewers
total yeah well over that and yeah it's
which is definitely gonna be kind of our
platform for you know putting a lot of
live content out there doing a lot of
tests doing a lot of weird demos so yeah
we start doing that
starting this week so check us out on
twitch at mega byte Inc yeah sweet and
then last question if you had to choose
two fictional robots to face off against
each other your dream matchups what
would they be Jake what about you that's
a hard one I mean it's it's when we talk
about talk about at the office but I
think you know honestly I just saw blade
runner so maybe a Ryan Gosling bot
versus the girl from ex machina that'd
be pretty cool pretty ooh I like it
that does seem evenly matched a sexy
fight that's yeah that would be yes like
not only for just robot supremacy it
would be also who is the most attractive
Ryan Gosling that's a really good that's
a great one I like that what about you
David
yeah I'm not as interested in a fair
matchup so I probably take kind of a
David versus Goliath approach so maybe
one of the Gundam BOTS gun tank or
something like that versus maybe the
Arnold Schwarzenegger t1000 The
Terminator robot so like let's see what
happens when kind of a more humanoid
form robot takes on a giant robot and
let's see let's see how he takes him out
it's a very compelling sports story you
seem like you know what you're doing so
I'm really excited to see what megawatts
has going on you guys can check out
megabots online there megabots dot-com
you can see all of our YouTube videos
you can go to the twitch channel I mean
there's a million ways to find them on
the internet we will be keeping tabs on
megabots put your ultimate robot
showdowns in the comments and we will
see you guys next time vegan humans
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
