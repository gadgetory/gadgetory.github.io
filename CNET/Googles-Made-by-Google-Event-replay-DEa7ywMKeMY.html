here for the new 2017 made by Google
event in the house here at Cena live
joining me mr. Patrick Hall in hello
hello across from you the lovely Vanessa
Han morning guys and the man run in the
show mr. Stephen bucho alright everybody
so this is we're going to get into
Google's keynote we will be actually
showing the livestream so you all can
check it out do we have a shot inside
right now
no all right we just want to give you a
look inside this is the San Francisco
jazz center just a few blocks away from
our headquarters here in San Francisco
California so it looks like a shot of I
don't know if they're on the bleachers
where there's little risers in the back
but that's kind of where everyone is
gathering right now in anticipation for
the event that will start at 9:00 a.m.
Pacific time 9:00 a.m. Pacific time so
we're about 20 minutes out or so we got
a little late start we also wanted to
let you know if you want to get your
calls in just before this show the phone
number to call is eight four four eight
one one nine five six one we have this
new system if you want to make a friend
today you can call us we're gonna talk
about what we expect to see here and
obviously there's been a lot of rumors
and things leaked but let's get to it
I'm gonna we'll leave that number up so
you guys and gals can all call in if
you'd like to be a part of this show
well let me open up here to the floor
obviously the big thing that we are
expecting to see here one of the things
are the new pixel to phones oh and yeah
see I like how you shake your head there
because I agree I thought the pixel to
our sorry the original pixel last year
was actually although I do have an
iPhone as my daily driver it was my
favorite front of the year because it
did things unique and different that
that phone had before it had the best
camera and it had the voice assistant so
that's what stood out to me that made it
a special phone and you've got to do
that in today's day and age with phones
I just want to open up to you guys Oh
what are you what are your what do you
feel about these phones the problem with
the pixel last year's you couldn't get
it because of the production issues that
they had
I got it oh you ha what's it was it that
hard to get was yeah the excel
definitely want that exhale well and
then well know where I was totally
immune to that problems with production
at first and I think Google because of
those production problems miss the boat
because you know the note was exploding
everybody wanted the pixel and nobody
could get it that's so funny I honestly
was no no wasn't because I was special I
just pre-ordered it literally the day it
came out yeah I think I mean it
definitely was an unexpected hit for
Google I mean I think they were
expecting it to be a hit but I mean to
not have phones even a few months ago
they were see yeah well the Excel I
don't you know what that's like ramping
down for ya what we're gonna see today
or not but the phone was a it's a great
phone it it takes great photos I really
like the daydream VR stuff on there I
never really got into VR before and I
found myself using that all the time
yeah I think that people that watch this
they'll be like but you do the Apple
bite I'm not saying that an iPhone is
not a great phone either I just thought
it was the most unique and special phone
of the of you of last year in in my mind
now that's so funny I was so immune to
the fact that these were hard to get I I
just figured oh I got that cell doh and
I just throw it in my bag
no but you talk about that like that
like it I think that what's cool is is
not only running like that beautiful
pure clean version of Android yes that's
the best part about it and but at the
same time there's the phone itself just
has like this delightful like soul and
quality so it's not just specs and gloss
it's there's just something about that
you want to pick it up
is it the sexiest phone heck no no it's
not in design wise no per especially I
don't like the fact that the half glass
half metal in that I don't even feel
that
I broke the black at the back glass on
the on the phone while I was testing
this that way that's why I don't like I
like the glass idea I thought it just
it's just a different look if you look
at everything about this phone was
different than what was out there at the
time we know that phones have evolved
come you know literally just from over
here it's all about everyone is obsessed
with the bezel this phones now too
but um you know we we wanted to bring up
the pixel but I'm also want to talk
about the pixels that we were expecting
to see here today we've seen leaked
images a Beecham if you have a chance to
go to the stories that we have droid
life really leaked about like ninety
eighty to ninety percent of what we're
expecting to see you we are still
expecting to see some surprises here
with the pixel phones but um there
really is no surprise if you type in the
term on the internet you've probably
looked yourself they're going to be here
from what we know the biggest thing and
we'll see how they sell this feature is
the fact that this year's camera where
all the top-line cameras now have dual
lens and I know both of you have jumped
into just the photography aspects of the
phone's does what will they need to do
to convince you that it's still a great
camera without dual lens and his dual
lens really necessary I'll start with
you Vanessa
well I I particularly like the dual lens
set up on the iPhone and the note just
because I have a child in a puppy so
portraits are big for me not for a lot
of people the original pixel was great
at photography in general it was amazing
at low-light it even out out
photographed the iPhone last year so I I
don't think the dual camera is a must if
they're able to perfect their soft work
which is kind of what made their their
photo so great last year and in
low-light particularly so I think they
can still beat out the note and the
iPhone if they really refine some of the
features in the camera in their main
camera Patrick well it's funny because
we talked about like beating out phones
and specs and stuff like that and I
think we're getting to a place in the
camera industry and the phone industry
that is actually camera industry really
mm-hmm
that you actually can start using phones
depending on stuff like looks like
sometimes if you're doing a photography
you might get a Canon because it's a
little bit warmer in color you like the
way the lenses are and it's not saying
that that brand of camera shoots better
than some like a Nikon but I feel like
the pixel created beautiful photos but
then the videos were kind of like yeah
we're sorry we forgot about that a
little bit so I'm hoping that we hear a
little little bit more about what
they're gonna do for that even though if
it has dual lenses I think
kind of fun because of zooming zooming I
think is so underrated yes we all love
portrait mode portrait mode okay great
black rounds bring it on
but I would take one camera that shoots
really good photos and really good video
over a dual camera system yeah
even though cuz you don't maybe zan
puppies I know the thing is like
portrait portrait mode is cool the other
thing is that the general population
hasn't been exposed to having the
portrait feature that much it it's still
you know in the tech world it's like
this is hot when you've used it it is
hot you don't use it all the time unless
you have babies or dogs but quite
honestly if you talked about that to
your general user they're not getting a
phone because of portrait mode to the
general general user really they're like
it's a hot don't get me wrong I love it
yeah but it's not something that is
going to be used for the most part every
day on all your photos so remember like
like four five years ago and filters
started like being like oh my god you
can put a filter on this really easily
and that was like then everyone used to
filters I think this it's gonna be like
portrait mode everything is gonna be a
blurry background for a few years and
it's like oh wait it doesn't always have
to be blurry actually check out Sharon
Profis Instagram feed sheet she portrait
modes everything everybody takes shout
out to Sharon love you but yeah she
portrait modes pretty much not just
puppies and babies but her food books
items you're right it could be the the
next filter or even it is yeah it's just
that people aren't exposed to it yet
enough and something you saw this summer
at the Google's developer conference was
they talked about this thing called
google lens which is like machine
learning and AI and stuff so I'd like to
see if they're gonna bring that to this
this pixel that we might see announced
today and how it how it works because as
much as the hardware hat matters like a
single camera go camera is that
processing we just saw Apple launched a
slew of new phones and all of them I
would dare say the underrated feature is
all this analysis that's doing on your
video and your photos to make them look
better it just shoots HDR mode full time
like the pixel did last year and the
photos and videos look really good
especially in low light but it's using a
lot of computer processing to make it
look good versus just hey we'll put a
better lens and we put two cameras it's
it's it's the underrated thing that
isn't isn't talked about like you said
the guts in
that is driving all of this technology
so what we have right now is we have a
call directly from Alexi ceviches inside
inside that's a jazz Sena what's up Lexy
welcome inside make it about 20 minutes
ago I was sitting down are you able to
say around are you able to swivel around
and get us kind of a look of what the
whole building looks like right now
so this is a view from my seat right now
we inside the auditorium at the jazz
center in San Francisco and we have a
little bit more seating than the Google
event glove box gia Red Badge seating
which is press and media we've got like
three curved screen and guys take a look
at this we've got two DJ's with jamming
and rocking out there up in the corner
that looks like totally doing that thing
oblivious to the fact there's a crowd
here just grooving on out and you can
see the venue let's see so we've we've
talked it we talked a lot about the
pixel so we don't want to bother you
with that question but I did want to get
your thoughts maybe specifically on
rumors we've heard of a Google home Mini
and maybe a Mac's coming but I just
wanted to talk about the Google home
platform in general for you well what do
you want that what do you want them or
what do they kind of need to do we know
that really the battles between them and
Amazon right now but what are you hoping
for them to show off here today to make
a jump up huge stake in the market they
have around 70% of the market according
to some of the latest stats and so
Google has a lot to do when it comes to
making some products that are kind of
gonna make people jump into the end to
the Google ecosystem that haven't
necessarily got a smart training device
and you know Amazon has so many
different devices on the market they've
got the show they've got the little
alarm cross that they just debuted last
week or so so there's a lot of I mean I
guess you maybe you can call it
fragmentation in the echo market there's
so many devices to choose from but it's
quite smart because they're making a
product
pretty much everyone who might be
interested in a voice assistant Google
at the moment only has the home we know
that there according to some leaks
anyway that there may be a couple of
other devices announced today including
a mini which looks to be a competitor to
the dot so that will get Google
especially the lower pricepoint edge
because at the moment the Hori me is you
know 129 dollars around and sorry still
an investment and so if you like amazon
has you know a $49 or even sometimes a
$29 dot like why would i go all the way
like full-blown and get that one or $29
google home when it offers pretty much
the same functionality so at least
you're taken off of something at a lower
price point maybe they'll get some more
people into the google assistant crowd
and google assistant it's really you
know really useful it's got a lot of
things that it can do you know a
lecturer and the assistant are kind of
on par but the google is this has a
couple more things that tie it really
closely into your google account so
that's really useful like looking
quantites things that you can do
directly rather than say like the alexa
where you have to use and add on skills
comfortably so is there anything that
you're hoping to see the most here just
for you personally Lexi yeah I'm really
interested to see what they're gonna do
if the rumors are true about the people
having no Jack's I really want to know
like how they're going to address that
you know is there going to be if they're
gonna be something on the market like to
make people aware that like yeah you're
gonna have to use like you know the
cheap headset you know Apple have the
airport's I don't know if Google is
going to do something similar we're just
gonna have to wait and see I'm saying as
you can see let's see before we go like
are you a little disappointed they're
not playing jazz at the jazz center is
that like a controversy that we need to
talk about all right Lexi hey thanks so
much we'll be looking for your coverage
out there and we appreciate it so enjoy
the show as it gets ramped up pretty
soon all right
thanks guys bye all right we'll see ya
we should've told her to check under her
seat for a pixel goody bags so here we
go guys and gals that we're about ten
minutes out we're gonna start hitting
through the phone lines because all of
you have been waiting so patiently while
we have been jibber jabbering so if you
guys want to talk about the stuff that
has been leaked out or any questions
about the event coming up we will get
you let's start off with here our friend
Jason Jason wants to talk about the
pixel to the XL is that correct that's
right what's up welcome to the show yeah
I think what's up man I think you know
it's going to be in a matter of who has
the sexiest product the pixel up to
excel is gonna even though it sounds
like it's gonna be a delay just like the
iPhone x10 is that someone's gonna you
know we're gonna see who's gonna be out
first with the sexiest model we're you
know that's who's gonna win this more
for the next model so I think what do
you think well I think that depending on
who you are whether the model with
whether the iPhone I love how you say X
cuz everyone calls it X we all know that
but whether the iPhone X or the pixel XL
comes out first I still think it's gonna
be tied to ecosystem loyalty these days
right there are there's a small group of
people that are going to might choose
which phone comes out first but I still
think the majority of people are locked
into that ecosystem and that's really
gonna determine what they want there's
still plenty of Android users that want
the best pure Android experience and we
know there are plenty of users that are
on iOS and they're not gonna get any
other phone other than an iOS phone that
that's where that's where I think but I
don't know what you guys think yeah and
I think I also like going back to kind
of wiping came from with Lexie like you
know with all their home environment
stuff like that and how everything is
starting to interconnect and near buying
a phone it's not even we're buying in an
ecosystem now yet I always think about
that I'd like my son to be phone to be
shining bright I would like to ask a
bigger question if the iPhone X is 10
with the pixel X I'll be 40 the pixel 40
would that be right Roman numerals this
is a really important question Jason you
were gonna say something real quick well
I think Google's is make
the ecosystem and I think their Seco
system is getting stronger with the home
with this Holmes puck whatever is going
to call it and was I think one thing
that that I think everybody is really
excited about in the Google ecosystem is
that lens you guys talked about if they
can actually make a software or a
feature that actually is worse gets
people always will searches they're even
on iPhones and and this Google lens I
think is to being really transformative
because you can take a picture we're
using our phones for cameras you take a
picture of what you want to see and
actually it's gonna be good for schools
going to be good for kids but it's good
I think that's a really game change a
piece of software that's going to be
coming out that Google is really gonna
have to show that it works and I think
Jason you have a point there because a
lot even iOS users still have a gmail
account you still have some kind of
share in the Google ecosystem and maybe
what you were saying some of these
features some of these products may
convince them to go Google all the way I
know I kind of you know dabble in the
Google ecosystem even though I'm
predominantly iOS just because my
Gmail's I have my gmail account and I
use that for everything and I still I
mean I still have a stake in the Google
in the Google ecosystem so maybe maybe
there is a feature that would sway me to
move over it's really fun to see it I
think in the next couple years we're
gonna see who's gonna be stronger or
whether iOS or Google and there's gonna
be the best out there hand it were
finally seeing the fruits of it but I
wish sometimes they'd wait maybe a
generation for a new phone I know they
were in for the money I mean Google
bought HTC's or some of HTC stuff but
there it if an opponent every year it
becomes boring that making befoe maybe
every you know 16 months or some like
that that actually is transformative
might make people seem more of a better
device yeah Jason thanks so much for
calling man we really appreciate in we
can tell you you you read your stuff we
know dropping the HTC knowledge on its
he's like he's like when they let me
just dropped so hey Jason thank you so
much I think he makes a great point it's
just all so hard in kind of keeping up
with the Joneses
if every main every major manufacturer
is releasing a phone every year and
their users typically whether they're on
a one-year or two-year upgrade cycle get
that phone you kind of got to play along
you don't now these days you don't have
a choice in really it was it was kind of
Apple who started this year trend they
they were the ones that first came out
with the phone every year and then
Samsung started doing it and then
everyone else started doing it there was
a time where it was like a phone every
two years it used to be I'm like you
were like on the S cycle at the NHANES
cycle right yeah but they're not so
think it's kind of starting to bite you
know bite a little bit because we want
you if we get a lot of Christmas when we
had with Apple last year with a seven
and not necessarily the seven pluses
they were kind of the same phone
dismally iterated and same with the
eight yeah and the thing is like had
they taken you know that time I don't
think it could happen in the industry
but yeah what kind of and more
innovations are we gonna see are there
gonna be more things like the iPhone 10
or what Samsung's doing which is pretty
exciting too I think with the s8 and
definitely then no date this year well
and I think something we haven't talked
about which gives Google an edge could
be that price point because this year we
had a lot of great phones from Samsung
and Apple with that iPhone 10 flash X
but we haven't talked about the price
point these are really expensive phones
I mean the note starts at $900 and the
eye for the iPhone I mean at least the
one you really want right let's be
honest
starts at $1000 so Google might have the
edge for that that consumer that still
wants the cutting edge but is not
doesn't want to pay that premium for a
phone that you know it'll it'll still be
a lot though I mean Excel estimations
starting are like eight forty nine ish
so a forty nine nine forty nine hundred
dollars cheaper ish but still not like
two hundred dollars cheaper right which
would make a difference I'll trade you
tell me you said like gonna we're like
I'm a cyclist seventy a lot of people
you know if you're not buying your phone
outright you're just paying that little
subsidized fee or you're paying that
financing to a carrier and hey I'm
paying you know seventy bucks or eighty
bucks or month and I'm just gonna keep
on doing that and I'll get my phone when
it's time to upgrade so I think for a
lot of people it's not they just heywhat
phones are out there when it's my my
contract is up got any contracts
nowadays I'm done paying my financing on
my whatever phone I have do I want to
get a pixel do I want to get in this
eight there's so many good phone
the other part is we talked about these
release cycles and here we are in fall
and we've had four major phones fall in
the last last month boom all right let's
uh let's jump into the lines cuz there's
plenty of people that want to talk to us
before the keynote starts at 9:00 we're
gonna go to our friend Karl Karl is 16
calling about the Google pixel vent Karl
what's up welcome to scene alive
hello guys thank you for I've been
waiting for a while Karl are you really
excited Karl are you really 16 or is
actually our our system said you're 16
but you're not actually 16 he's smoking
at 16 what's up Carl so yeah I'm calling
because I've been waiting for a chance
to switch to Android for a while now
I've been almost bought the BlackBerry
key one I was like this is amazing
I'm just waiting to have a chance to
like go on the Android board but they
haven't whitewall me for a while now so
I'm just really excited for the pixel to
we'll see what they do $1,000 for the
iPhone it's pretty a lot and I'm just
waiting to see what can they do why me
the wire factor for Google Carl okay
what do you guys think what phone do you
have currently girl I have a 6s Brooking
screen I'm not on a contract so yeah
you're ready to roll oh yeah you're
ready roll you're ready roll so does let
me ask you this question because there's
a lot of hype around bezel-less bezel is
bezel is it doesn't look like that the
Google pixel 2 is gonna be a bezel this
phone does that bother you you care you
want really are more concerned about the
features it has it's more about the
features I don't really care so much I
mean it's a gorgeous screen first for
sure but it's just about the future
because it like you said we just talked
on the ecosystem so I was like okay how
can I I really hate Android but I don't
like how can I give it a chance
kind of thing Oh Sears you just want to
get you just want to give Android a
chance open mind open mind
we like that so
you gotta you gotta begin when you're in
detect yes it doesn't thank you thank
you very much if only everyone thought
that way and was 16 all right hey thanks
so much for calling buddy thank you
alright see ya the Google keynote is
still expect to start at 9:00 is we're
gonna we're gonna jump we will jump into
it once they actually start but I'm
gonna try and take one more call because
people are waiting patiently brian
mchenry in the house what's up Brian
McHenry thanks for waiting so long just
curious if you thought the pixel two
would be exclusive to Verizon if I
decided to get through a carrier I just
honestly we just this morning it had
been leaked out that Verizon will be the
exclusive carrier of the Google pixel to
that that's the story that I saw just
earlier right before we started this
show so I would say yes unless that
change is that it's not an official
official word but that's what has been
leaked out but if it's like last year -
that doesn't mean you can't get the
phone through another retailer or
something like that and it's still funny
to them and stuff but yeah Verizon right
okay am i right okay hey thanks Brian
we're gonna jump to the keynote everyone
here will do the show will do post show
afterwards all right thanks so much as
we were preparing for this event we were
all devastated by the news coming out of
Las Vegas as I'm sure all of you were
and that's coming off a challenging past
few weeks with hurricanes Harvey
Irma and Maria and other events around
the world it's been hard to see the
suffering but I've been moved and
inspired by everyday heroism people
opening up their homes and to first
responders literally risking their lives
to save other people our hearts and
prayers are with the victims and
families impacted by these terrible
events we are working closely with many
relief agencies in affected areas and we
are committed to doing our part it's a
true privilege to be a des of jazz
center it's a great
American institution for jazz
performance and education and it's
really good to see familiar faces in the
audience as always I want to give a
shout out to people joining us on the
live stream globally from around the
world since last year and since Google
i/o we've been working hard continuing
our shift from a mobile first to an AI
first world we are rethinking all our
core products and working hard to solve
use of problems by applying machine
learning and AI let me give you an
example recently I visited Lagos in
Nigeria it's a city of 21 million people
it's an incredibly dynamic vibrant and
ever growing city
many people are coming online for the
first time so it's very exciting unless
you happen to be in the Google Maps team
and you have to map the city and it is
so it is changing so fast and normally
we map a place by using Street View and
doing a lot of stuff automatically but
it's difficult to do that in a place
like Lagos because the city is changing
you can't always see the signage clearly
and there are variable address
conventions things are in sequential so
for example take that house there if you
squint hard you can see the street
number there it is number three to the
left of the gate that was relatively
easy on to harder problem now that house
you know that's what we see from street
view I think as humans it's probably
pretty hard maybe one or two of you can
spot it out but our computer vision
systems thanks to machine learning can
pick it out identify the street number
and start mapping mapping the house so
we approached Lagos completely
differently we deployed machine learning
from the ground up and just in five
months the team was able to map five
thousand kilometers of new roads fifty
thousand new addresses and hundred
thousand businesses and it's something
which makes a real difference for
millions of users there
as Google Maps is popular and we think
this approach is broadly applicable
let's come closer to home in a parking
in San Francisco I don't even try it
anymore but for those of you who try it
we again use machine learning we
understand location data we try to
understand patterns our cars circling
around and the color shows the density
of parking and we can analyze it
throughout the day and predict parking
difficulty and in Google Maps give you
options a simple example but it's the
kind of everyday use case for which we
are using machine learning to make a
difference the best example I can think
of what we've taught before is Google
Translation I literally remember many
years ago
adding translation in Chrome and making
it automatic so that if you land in a
page different from your language we do
that for you fast forward to today with
the power of machine learning on our
neural machine translation we serve over
2 billion translations in many many
languages every single day to me shows
the power of staying at a problem
constantly using computer science to
make it better and seeing users respond
to it at scale this is why we are
excited about the shift from a mobile
first to a AI first well it is not just
about applying machine learning in inner
products but it's radically rethinking
how computing should work at a higher
level in an AI first world I believe
computers should adapt to how people
live their lives rather than people
having to adapt to computers and so we
think about four core attributes as part
of this experience first people should
be able to interact with computing in a
natural and seamless way Mobile took us
a step in this direction with
multi-touch but increasingly it needs to
be conversational sensory we need to be
able to use her voice gestures and
vision to make the experience much more
seamless second
it is going to be ambient computing is
going to evolve beyond the phone be
there in many screens around you when
you need it working for you
third we think it needs to be
thoughtfully contextual Mobile gave us
limited context you know with identity
your location we were able to improve
the experience significantly an AI first
well we can have a lot more context and
apply it thoughtfully for example if
you're into fitness and you land in a
new city we can suggest running routes
maybe gyms nearby and healthy eating
options and in my case being a
vegetarian and having a weakness for
deserts maybe suggest the right
restaurants for me finally and probably
the most important of it all you know
computing needs to learn and adapt
constantly over time it just doesn't
work that way today in Mobile you know
developers write software and constantly
ship updates but you know let me give a
small example I use Google Calendar all
the time on Sundays I try to get a
weekly view of how my week looks like
but once the work week starts say on a
Monday or a Tuesday I'm trying to get a
view into what the next few hours looks
like I have to constantly toggle toggle
back and forth
Google Calendar should automatically
understand my context and show me the
right view it's a very simple example
but software needs to fundamentally
change how it works
it needs to learn and adapt and that
applies the important things like
security and privacy as well today a lot
of us deal with security and privacy by
putting the onus back on users we give
them many settings and tolerance to
improve those but you know AI first well
we can learn and adapt and do it
thoughtfully for our users for example
if it's a notification for your doctor's
appointment we need to treat it
sensitively and differently than just
telling you when you need to start
driving to work so we're really excited
by the shift and that's why we are here
today we've been working on software and
hardware together because
it's the best way to drive the shifts in
computing forward but we think we're the
unique moment in time where we can bring
a combination of AI and software and
hardware to bring the different
perspective to solving problems for
users and we're very confident about our
approach here because we are at the
forefront of driving the shifts with AI
three months ago at Google i/o our
Google AI teams announced a new approach
called Auto mo
Auto Amal is just our machines
automatically generating machine
learning models today these are
handcrafted by machine learning
scientists and literally only a few
thousands of scientists around the world
can do this design the number of layers
weight and connect the neurons
appropriately it's very hard to do we
want to democratize this we want to
bring this to more people you want to
enable hundreds of thousands of
developers to be able to do it so we've
been working on this technology called
Auto Mo and just in the past month for a
standard tasks like image classification
understanding images our auto ml models
are now not only more accurate than the
best human generated models but they are
more resource efficient so it's pretty
amazing to see we are now taking it a
step further let me talk about another
use case object direction when we say
object direction just a fancy name for
computers trying to delineate and
understand images being able to draw
bounding boxes and distinguish between
all the way vehicles their scooters
mopeds motorcycles and even pick out the
bike in front it has a lot of practical
use cases the Street View example for
Legos works based on object direction
google lense which you'll hear about
later as well as our photography in
pixel use this object direction this is
really hard to do the best human
generated models we have only have a 39
percent accuracy
but our Auto ml models as of the past
couple of weeks have have reached around
forty three percent accuracy they're
constantly getting better so the rate at
which we are seeing progress with AI is
amazing which is why we are really
excited about combining it with our
software and hardware to bring it
together for our users let me give you a
concrete example
I was recently very inspired by the
street from a journalist who was uh
turning the Little League World Series
as you can see there are two little
leaguers here one from Dominican
Republic and the other from South Dakota
and they are talking to each other using
Google Translate it's a great example
but I looked at it and I feel like we
could do a whole lot better computing
needs to evolve where this happens in a
more natural seamless and a
conversational way and later today
you'll get an early glimpse of how we
can push this experience further by
thinking about AI software and hardware
together I couldn't be more excited by
the direction our Hardware team is
taking and approaching their work here
so to give you a lot more insights let
me welcome Rick onto the stage thank you
hi everyone I want to welcome everyone
here today Google fans the media in the
front row we have some of our top sales
reps from Verizon and other partners
it's great to have you all here yes
welcome welcome
we've got a lot to show you today
including a few surprises so I thought I
would quickly set the scene and explain
what we've been working toward and just
how it ties into the vision that send
our outlined a year ago we stood on a
slightly smaller stage and introduce the
world to Google pixel home and Wi-Fi
chromecast ultra and daydream view this
is the first generation of hardware made
by Google so much has happened since
then and we've made tremendous progress
in our first year for starters our team
is getting a lot bigger we're bringing
on 2,000 very talented engineers from
HTC along with some important IP it's an
amazing team that's created a series of
industry first innovations and by
working more closely together we'll be
able to better integrate Google hardware
and software and our products have built
up a lot of momentum going into our
second year let's take a look ok Google
ok Google ok Google Play the soundtrack
to spaghetti for Pepe we will set to
hold a product event at San Francisco
there are a few announcements Google
new hardware the spics atleast the fix
it's called Google home a new way to
make your home a little bit smarter
Google debuted a new virtual reality
headset
that's a daydream viewable I absolutely
feel like I'm saying that the Google
pixel pixel is my new favorite camera ok
Google take a something off that camera
pictures of Madison are credible Google
you chromecast polska 4 stars and
editor's choice ok Google show me a
video of a kangaroo in my book there I
said it
my mom now can save every picture
unlimited space Bhama got a new toy they
can recognize each voice enter who the
assistant let me see what else my guru
assistant can do hey Google carry them
as you watch me buh-blabel balls that's
your question one isn't dog I don't want
to blow your mind
it can be okay google what's next
we're still in the early days of our
hardware line but we're off to a great
start we're thrilled to announce that
they're now 55 million chromecast
devices around the world Google Wi-Fi is
the number one selling mesh router since
its launch in the US and Canada and in
the last 12 months alone the assistant
has gotten a lot smarter thanks to
Google we've added more than a hundred
million new unique featured snippets
from the web video results from YouTube
and new local places in Google Maps and
a lot more and pixel had a great year I
just wish we had a few more of them to
go around
but user satisfaction among pixel owners
is among the highest of any Google
product ever industry analysts and the
media gave pixel rave reviews to our
performance scores led the industry and
pixel had the best and top rated
smartphone camera we're really proud of
how well the pixel did for our first
generation smartphone in such a
competitive space well you all know this
better than anyone but the playing field
for hardware components is leveling off
and I don't envy those of you who have
to write reviews for a bunch of
smartphones with very similar specs
megapixels in the camera processor speed
modem throughput battery life display
quality these core features are table
stakes now Moore's law and Dennard
scaling are ideas from the past to be
honest it's going to be tougher and
tougher for people to develop new
exciting products each year because
that's no longer the timetable for big
leaps forward in Hardware alone and
that's why we're taking a very different
approach at Google as I said last year
the next big innovation will happen at
the intersection of AI software and
we're smartphones might be reaching
parity on their specs but as we just
heard from sundar we're seeing huge
breakthroughs and the kinds of
experiences were able to deliver to
users and it all starts with reimagining
hardware from the inside out AI and
machine learning have helped us to do
this across our products for one pixel
completely revolutionized the end-to-end
photo experience for users and removes
all of the hassles machine learning
works throughout the experience to make
your pixel photos more vibrant to smooth
out your videos and to make all those
thousands of memories easy to find on
any of your devices we did the same
thing with home networks Google Wi-Fi
uses machine learning not only to keep
your signal strong but to reduce Wi-Fi
congestion while you're moving
throughout the house your router is
intelligently transitioning your devices
to the best Wi-Fi point and placing you
on the right channel when you're using
the assistant on Google home you'll
notice it can pick up your voice even in
a noisy room our deep learning
capabilities and neural beamforming help
Google home locate the source of sound
and hear you accurately so we can do
with just two microphones what others
normally need 6r8 to do and this is what
it means to design hardware from the
inside out it's this combination of AI
software and hardware working together
that provides a helpful experience for
our users and that's where the big leaps
forward are gonna happen in the next 10
years we're still in the early days for
our hardware line but we know what it
takes to build great products in a
crowded field we were at first with many
of our most successful products Gmail
Chrome Android and even search but in
each case we succeeded by doing what
we're best at reimagining the experience
to make it radically helpful for the
user and as you'll hear today our next
generation of devices is radically
helpful - they're fast they're there
when you need them there
simple to use and they anticipate your
needs everything is designed for you to
keep the tech in the background and out
of your way
interact with your device's naturally
through your voice or by touching them
and by building Hardware around our AI
and software we're creating products
that get even better over time they're
constantly getting faster and more
helpful the more you interact with them
thanks to machine learning as a family
made by Google products represent the
ultimate Google experience today we're
going to show you how we're creating a
family of products that are there when
you need them at work at school and on
the go but we're gonna start with the
most important place your home so let's
hear next from Rishi Chandra who leads
our home team over to you Rishi thank
you Rick it's been a really exciting
year for us Google home was the first
product to bring the Google assistant to
the home and we've been constantly
learning from our users so that we can
make the assistant radically helpful for
you for example as Rick mentioned in the
last year we can answer over 100 million
new questions and the best part is you
know the talk like a computer or teach
Google home any new skills it just works
now we're really happy with a positive
feedback thus far but we know this is a
journey so I've been working hard to
bring Google home to more people and
more countries this year we launched in
five new countries and we're happy to
announce that we launching in Japan
later this week now bringing the
assistant of people all around the world
is no easy task
we had to make sure we can understand
people of different age groups genders
and accents so we trained the assistant
at a scale that only Google could with
over 50 million voice samples from
hundreds of different ambient
environments we've been investing in
voice search for over a decade which is
why we have the best voice recognition
in the
world now earlier this year we had a
major breakthrough with the ability to
recognize your voice we call it voice
match with your permission we build a
model of your voice by looking at dozens
of different voice characteristics like
vocal constructs pitch and tone this is
a really big deal
Google Homes great for the whole family
but doesn't mean I want to get the same
answer to every question an assistant
can only be truly useful if it knows who
you are and with voice match where the
only assistant that can bring personal
help to each individual member of your
household so he asked a question we
match your voice and we respond with
your calendar your commute and your
personal reminders now voice matches
already become one of the most popular
features on Google home today over half
of all queries are from people who've
trained the assistant to recognize their
voice and starting today we're rolling
out voice match to all seven countries
Google home will be available now
another popular feature is hands-free
calling you can use your Google home to
call any landline or mobile number in
the US or Canada for free without any
additional apps or accessories it just
works and I'm happy announced they'll be
bringing hands-free calling to the UK
later this year and starting today you
could call out with your own personal
mobile number so whatever you're calling
will know it's you
you just need to verify your number to
the Google home app and of course with
voice match we can recognize your voice
to make sure we call your contact with
your personal number a hands-free
calling also has the intelligence of
Google built right in just say hey
Google call the bakery on 24th Street
okay calling Noe Valley bakery we do the
hard work to figure out which business
you want to call thanks to Google's deep
expertise in local search making a call
has never been easier now we have a lot
of great news to share with you today so
to kick things off I like to welcome
Isabelle Lee designer for Home Hardware
Thank You Rishi I'm thrilled to share
with you how he thinks design is
redefining technology in the home you
heard Rick mentioned earlier today that
everything in a hardware line is
designed to fit into your life the home
is the special intimate place and people
are very selective about what they
welcome into it you don't want to fill
it with black plastic complicated
buttons and random blinking lights our
vision is to build simple helpful
solutions that work in the background
helping you when you need it and staying
out of the way when you don't so here's
what that means to us we design for the
spaces our products live in and we take
inspiration from the materials and
colors that people already use to make
their home more warm and inviting second
when designing for real hopes form and
sites really matters for creating
something that actually fits into any
room or on any surface and lastly the
way you interact with our products has
to be so intuitive you never even have
to think about it and so simple that the
entire household can use it with that we
are introducing mini the newest member
of the Google home family
the first thing you might notice is the
striking simplicity of the design its
sleek and smooth
with no corners or edges and it's small
enough to be placed in anywhere in your
home it makes Google home more
accessible to more people in more rooms
and as you can see almost the entire
enclosure is made out of fabric
and it's not just about aesthetics its
core to the product experience that is
why we created this material from
scratch right down to the yarn it needed
to be durable soft but also transparent
enough to let through both light and
sound this perfect balance allows for
all of mehness technology to be
thoughtfully tucked away underneath the
clean simple enclosure so the four LED
lights under the fabric are there when
you need them
lighting up to show you that it hears
you or it's thinking and you can control
it by touch
give the fabric a quick tap to pause
your music adjust the volume or talk to
your assistant we thought a lot about
how to get great sound with such a small
product - we embrace mini circular shape
to project 360 degrees sound so it's
really crisp no matter where you stand
in the room you'll be surprised how
amazing the quality is and if you want
bigger sound you can easily connect mini
to any chromecast built-in speaker
wirelessly we created many in three
beautiful colors coral chalk and
charcoal color really matters in the
home this is the place where we choose
our drapes and carpets and pink colors
with so much care we brought that same
level of care for many for the chalk
color alone it took us 157 tries before
we found the perfect shade of grey so
that's Google home mini with all the
power of the Google assistant you can
make it
sous-chef in the kitchen your white
noise machine in their nursery your
voice remote for you TV in the living
room or your alarm clock in the bedroom
or all of the above
many will retail for just $49 in the US
and it and it's gonna be available for
pre-order online starting today and in
stores starting October 19th from major
retailers we're also really happy to
announce that mini is coming to all
seven Google home countries so with that
let's take a look at this ad that will
launch later this week with this little
thing
well it's who's a little bitty you put
it in your house and control it with
your voice hey Google Play my fun
playlist okay playing now it's also a
remote control an alarm clock and a sous
chef let it cool for 10 minutes they can
play this on TV or that on the internet
it can tell you the weather or if your
flights delayed because of the weather
and it knows the difference between you
I and your husband hey so if you go hey
Google call Alex it won't call your
husband's friend Alex it'll call your
friend Alex calling Alex hey how are you
okay got a call girl anyway it's made by
the same people who help you find stuff
on the Internet
so you know no biggie it's smaller than
a doughnut and weighs less than a
full-grown chipmunk without the nuts
it's powered by the Google assistant so
it has Google Maps Google Calendar it
gets through to all your music floppy
your favorite shows all of YouTube and
lots and lots and lots of other stuff
you love all for less than 50 bucks
yeah it's Google Hill Mini a little help
at home like only Google can
thanks Isabelle we can't wait for you to
try out mini we also want to share how
the Google assistant continues to get
better over time from the start we've
been helping everyone people with their
everyday routines for example one of my
favorite features is my day which gives
me a personalized briefing of my
important events of the day and with
voice match each member of the house can
get their own unique start to the
morning routine well soon we're gonna be
extending routines in two important ways
first we're adding more routines to help
you with those everyday moments like
getting ready to leave for work coming
home in the evening or turning in for
the night
second we're adding additional actions
to the routines so now when I say good
morning I not only get my personal
briefing but I also can turn on the
lights start the coffeemaker and even
play my favorite morning playlist this
kind of help is exactly what I need to
get my day started
now another ritual for me in the morning
is I'm always looking for iPhone before
heading to work
well the Google assistant can help there
to just say hey Google find my phone and
will automatically ring your Android
phone even if it's on silent mode and
for iPhone users we just give you a call
it's good it saves me 5 to 10 minutes
every morning
now we're also working to make the smart
home work better for you the Google
assistant can now voice control over a
thousand different smart home products
from over a hundred brands and even more
importantly we brought our deep
expertise of natural language processing
to make it easier to voice control in a
more conversational way so for example
if I want to change the temperature
I shouldn't have to remember the current
thermostat setting I should pseudo say
hey Google make it warmer okay warming
up the living room your system knows
what warmer means and we'll just take
care of it for you now voice control is
just the start we believe the next
evolution of the smart home is to bring
real intelligence to the home so it can
behave in a more thoughtful way your
home should smartly adjust to you not
the other way around
so Google and nest are working together
to reimagine the smart home to tell you
more I like to welcome Yogi CTO of Nest
Thank You Ricci a nest
we like to talk about the thoughtful
helm one that takes care of the people
inside it and the world around it we
recently took a big step forward in
achieving that goal by doubling our
portfolio by shipping six new hardware
products what I love about mascara in
ecosystem is that we combine the
best-in-class hardware and machine
learning to help make people's life
easier and your nest experience reaches
a whole new level when it's combined
with Google product let me show you
three examples of how we can provide you
with even more help a help with nest cam
Google home and chromecast we can help
keep you keep an eye on your home just
with your voice so if you hear some
unexpected sound and by the front door
and I'm in the back with the family room
without my phone I can just say ok
Google show me the entryway ok streaming
the entryway and then I realize it's not
an intruder but my pet pig cayenne and
she's found the leftover lunch in my
son's backpack sadly this has happened
more than once and if I want to keep it
for later for my kids I can simply say
ok Google save me this clip to show them
why we don't leave food in our backpacks
with our new video doorbell nest hello
we can also start to solve some of our
common pain points through Google and
nest integrated computer Technic
impaired of vision technologies of
course most of us want to know who's at
the door before we get off the couch
through a feature called familiar faces
nest hello we'll be able to recognize
the people that you asked it to remember
so when the doorbell rings and this
hello recognizes the
person at the door it will automatically
broadcast that information to Google
home devices in the house auntie Susie
is at the front door and you don't even
have to ask
and if Nestle doesn't know who's at the
door you can just say ok Google show me
who's at the front door and we will
stream your camera feed right to your TV
this is another great example of what
Google and Ness can do together and this
last one is my favorite your home can
soon get ready for the night just with a
simple command as Rishi mentioned you
can personalize your routine to include
actions for nest products so all I have
to say is hey Google good night ok let's
get ready for bed I've armed your
security system your first calendar
event is tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. your
alarm is set for 7:00 a.m. sleep well in
the background my assistant my assistant
is also turning my security camera on
adjusting the thermostat and turning off
the lights this really simplifies my
life and gives me the peace of mind that
I cannot get any other way
together nesting Google deliver an
ecosystem a product that makes your home
more secure and energy efficient more
connected and entertaining with the best
home assistant experience our close
collaboration make this product work
seamlessly together and help us get one
step closer to a truly thoughtful home
on that now to tell you more about
Google system let me welcome we see back
on stage Thank You yogi you know making
it more thoughtful home it's just one
way to help make our joyfully hectic
family lives a little easier you know
the Google assistant already provides a
lot of help from using your voice to
order more diapers playing a lullaby in
the nursery checking the traffic to
those piano lessons or easily giving
grandma a call now if you're like me
it'd be hard to gather the household
together for those family moments like
dinner time or movie night
well the help we're launching a new
feature called broadcast it's really
easy just say hey Google broadcast it's
time to leave for school got it
broadcasting now the assistant will
broadcast a message to all the other
Google home devices in my house it's
really great parents are gonna love this
feature
kids kids are gonna hate this feature
but that's what makes it useful speaking
of kids we think Google home has a lot
of potential with to help kids and
families voice interactions so simple
and easy to use kids are naturally drawn
to it
so we want to be thoughtful about what
it would take to deliver a great kids
experience we conducted research with
hundreds of parents and kids from across
the country from different backgrounds
so first we're announcing support for
family link accounts on Google home
these are Google accounts that parents
can create for children under 13 they
can manage it within the family link app
and as well know kids have their own
unique way of speaking sometimes it can
be a little hard to understand even for
us parents well fortunately we've
improved our voice recognition accuracy
for kids so the assistant can understand
them too and finally we're introducing
over 50 new experiences with the Google
assistant to help kids learn something
new explore new interests imagine it was
story time or just share laughs with the
whole family so let me show you how my
kids and their friends had some fun this
weekend
ready to see their musical champion
which was the first planet to be
discovered using a telescope to
sweet-tempered girl whose name was
signora I can tell you as a parent it's
great to see the kids without their
screens and sharing experiences together
it's easy to get started just say hey
Google let's learn to play science
quizzes or talk to an astronaut or try
hey Google let's play a game
to play musical chairs or tackle a
riddle and finally hey Google tell me a
story to your classics like Snow White
or original story it's like the chef's
to love potatoes now to bring this to
life we've partnered with Disney will be
bringing exclusive experiences to Google
home featuring Mickey Mouse Lightning
McQueen and Star Wars we're creating
many other top brands in the family
space including Warner Brothers and
Sports Illustrated kids and starting
today we're opening up the actions on
Google platform for developers to create
experiences specifically for families
and kids all these new family features
will be rolling out later this month
across all Google home devices ok
finally I have one more exciting edition
to share that's coming to the Google
home family
for the ones who
say hello to max our biggest and best
sound at Google home ever
just like the pixel reimagine the camera
will do the same with sound with a
combination of great hardware and
software powered by Google's machine
learning capabilities now it starts with
a strong foundation of great hardware
the first thing you'll notice is how we
obsessed over the base its 24.5 which
will first have 22 millimeters of
excursion an extremely high range for
their size
that means these Wolfers can move a lot
of air allowing max to really hit those
low frequencies and max can play loud
really loud it's one of 20 times more
powerful than Google home so to fill any
room in your house with amazing audio
now great hardware alone isn't
sufficient for great sound the challenge
of speakers today is that they're tuned
for ideal acoustic conditions but they
fall short in the real world that's why
it always sounds different in the store
than in your home to sound great the
speaker needs to adjust to you and your
home so today we're announcing smart
sound a new audio experience powered by
Google's AI it allows max to adapt to
you your environment your context your
preferences so for example if you set up
a speaker near wall on a shelf in a
corner fairly common places it could
dramatically change the sound balance of
the speaker and make the music sound
muddy and the vocals lose clarity well
with smart sound we automatically tune
the speaker to correct for this effect
using a machine learning model trained
with thousands of different room
configurations and what's really cool
this is all done dynamically so if you
decide to move max a few feet it'll
compensate within seconds and overtime
smart sound will automatically adapt the
sound to fit your context lowering the
volume in the morning raising the volume
when the dishwasher is running or just a
jus adjusting the tuning bass the type
of meteor
- whether it be music podcasts or news
it's about delivering a consistent crisp
thoughtful sound experience one that's
tailored to your home and your moments
now great sound only matters you can
play a lot of great content well YouTube
music you'll have access to the world's
broadest catalog of songs remixes and
covers and we also support all free and
paid Spotify users along with other top
music services just use your voice to
start playing your favorite tunes max
also supports cast Bluetooth and stereo
aux input so you could play anything
from your phone or plug in that record
player to breathe new life into that
vinyl collection and of course max has a
Google assistant built right in we made
your assistant can hear you even when
the music is blasting using our unique
microphone placement and Google's neural
beamforming technology and with voice
match the assistant can become your own
personal DJ we recognize your voice and
we can play playlists and music stations
personalized to you and Google home max
is designed to be incredibly versatile
and fit naturally in your home you can
stand it up vertically place it
horizontally whatever it makes sense for
your space its base magnetically pops
into place so when you change Max's
orientation there aren't any rubber feet
where they don't need to be we thought
through every detail and finally max
works seamlessly with the Google home
family and hundreds of chromecast
built-in speakers so you can use multi
room to sync every room in your house
with immersive sound Google home max
will be available starting December for
$399 and will come in two colors chalk
and charcoal edition launched in the US
with more countries coming early next
year and make sure you have an amazing
sound experience out of the box we're
providing a free 12 month subscription
to YouTube red which includes YouTube
music ad free we think you're gonna
really love the newest members of the
Google home family along with the
updates to the Google assistant they
represent a big leap forward and type of
helpfulness fun and sound you can expect
from Google in the home and the clothes
we gave max to a music lover too
their thoughts let's take a look
I'm a producer in a DJs I'm not
classically trained but I'm obsessed
with music I listen to music all day
long I'm constantly being critical of my
own music music gonna here watch this
hey Google Play particular by Major
Lazer sure particular by Major Lazer &amp;amp;
DJ maphorisa here it is on YouTube every
room I haven't set up to play music my
bedrooms the living room hey Google turn
it up
they told me everybody see the different
kinds of it's beside of it at the shop
hey Google play the song that goes
rhythms like bend it all right
no no better by Major Lazer here it is
on YouTube you can find the periphery of
walls and where it is located at in a
room have that technology to understand
where it is and to adjust appropriately
is amazing that sounds great that's this
is if people can actually hear what
we're giving them from when it leaves
our studio that would be amazing that's
what any producer artist would love hey
Google turn it all the way up
you know know
as you just saw there's so much amazing
innovation happening in the home space
and at the same time our phones have
evolved become the most trusted devices
in our lives but you ever wonder why the
laptop experience has been basically the
same for the past 20 years so while the
laptop experience hasn't changed all
that much how we use technology in our
lives
definitely has we live online we create
and collaborate more than ever we use
tons of apps every day and we're
constantly jumping between our phone
tablet and laptop to get things done and
have fun shouldn't we be able to do
whatever we want on whatever device is
in front of us we think so we worked
hard to combine the most helpful parts
of a laptop a tablet and a smartphone to
fit how we use technology today meet
Google pixel book the high-performance
Chromebook
pixal book reimagines laptop experience
by marrying the best of premium
performance hardware the speed
simplicity and security of Chrome OS the
smarts of the Google assistant and all
your favorite apps pixel book is the
perfect example of how we combine the
best of hardware and software with AI at
the center we'll start with a stunning
versatile design pixel book is the
thinnest lightest laptop we've ever made
at just around 10 millimeters thin and a
kilogram light in fact it's so light I
find myself constantly checking my bag
to make sure I haven't forgotten it
pixel book easily adapts with a 4 in 1
design so it's built for the many ways
you want to use it when you're at your
most productive
it's an incredible laptop fold the
keyboard underneath and easily watch
videos or play your favorite games use
pixel book as a tablet to catch up on
the latest news or read a book it's the
first convertible laptop that actually
feels natural to use as a tablet prop it
up into tent mode to share your screen
or follow along with a recipe in the
kitchen use it however you want because
the pixel book adapts to fit the office
the classroom movie night or even a long
flight pixel phone fans will appreciate
our signature glass inlay on the lid
giving it not only a refined look but
improved wireless performance the twelve
point three inch touchscreen display is
gorgeously higher resolution with
vibrant colors deep blacks and enough
brightness to use outside even on a
sunny day we developed an extremely thin
keyboard that's comfortable to use with
soft touch keys and a backlit design
that helps you work from anywhere and
pixel books trackpad uses touch
processing algorithms that improve
accuracy and palm rejection with Intel
Core i5 and i7 processors pixel book
packs a punch
it offers plenty of RAM to handle your
multitasking needs and gives you up to
512 gigs of storage the long-lasting
battery provides up to 10 hours of use
from a single charge and plugging in for
just 15 minutes gives you 2 hours of
battery life you can even use your pixel
book charger with your pixel phone
giving you one less thing to carry
around and in moments when you don't
have access to Wi-Fi pixel book is smart
enough to automatically connect through
your pixel phone we call this instant
tethering it's so much simpler than
setting up a hotspot on my phone and
then manually connecting to it on my
laptop now let's take a further look at
the software experience inside pixel
book this laptop is fast it starts up in
seconds
stays fast throughout the day and won't
slow down over its lifetime Chrome OS
provides a more secure computing
experience with multiple layers of
security and automatic updates no need
to worry about manual downloads or
annoying security patches to keep your
machine safe and your most important
files are available on your local Drive
and securely backed up with Google Drive
so you can access them from anywhere
online or offline we're also excited
announced that pixel book is the first
laptop with the Google assistant
built-in making it radically helpful
just like you can with your other
devices you can check the weather before
heading out for the day
control your smart home set reminders
check if my packers on your Sisson is
there for you no matter what you're
doing and we've made it easy to interact
with the assistant in all the ways you
use pixel book when it's intent or
entertainment mode and the keyboard is
tucked away simply say ok Google Play
future me
and that exact music video I had in mind
starts playing on YouTube other times
though it's not the right moment or
place to talk to your computer like if
you're sitting at a coffee shop or out
the audience right now so pixel book has
a key that puts the power of the
assistant right at your fingertips
letting you type your request and when
you're using your pixel book as a tablet
it's easiest to show your assistant what
you need help with on your screen that's
why we created the new pixel book pen a
smart responsive companion for your
pixel book just hold the Pens button and
circle an image or text on the screen
and the assistant will take action when
you're browsing through a blog and
discover a new musician you can circle
their photo and the assistant will give
you more information about them from
there you can check out their Instagram
page go to their YouTube channel get a
list of their songs and more or if
you're doing homework
the assistant can help with your
research like if you get stuck on a
really unfamiliar concept just circle
the word and the assistant will give you
everything you need to know the pen is
also handy for moments when it feels
more natural to write draw or take notes
like when you're using your pixel book
as a tablet the experience using a pen
should be like writing on paper to bring
that experience to life we partnered
with the engineers at Wacom and together
we build the fastest most responsive
stylus experience ever with just 10
milliseconds of latency 60 degrees of
angular awareness and 2000 levels of
pressure sensitivity pixel pixel book
pen uses machine learning for
handwriting recognition and demonstrates
how performance Hardware combined with
our expertise in machine learning
delivers a user experience that just
works better and shouldn't the apps you
know and love on your phone also be
available on your laptop with pix
look they are pixel book fully supports
google play so popular smartphone apps
are now available on a laptop in fact
it's never been easier to put the final
touches on your favorite photos in Adobe
Lightroom and then post them straight to
Instagram you can listen to music from
Spotify or download netflix shows and
movies for viewing on the go pixel book
is also perfect for creativity apps like
Evernote AutoCAD and more snapchat is
already one of the most popular apps
among early users and we're thrilled to
announce that the snap team is working
with us to bring an amazing snapchat
experience to the larger screen on pixel
book in addition to these amazing pixel
book experiences you've seen so far
there are many more developers building
for the larger screen now let's take a
look at how pixel book will fit into
your life ok Google Play discover weekly
on Spotify ok
three bodies
so that's a first look at pixel book a
radically helpful laptop that combines
the best of Google's AI software and
hardware we think you'll love the
beautiful versatile design high
performance hardware and software new
ways to access the assistant and all
your favorite apps it's available in
three configurations so you can choose
the performance memory and storage
that's right for you
pixel book starts at $9.99 and the pixel
book pen is $99 both products will be
available in the US Canada and the UK on
the Google store and at over a thousand
retail locations including Best Buy
pre-orders start today and they'll be in
stores beginning October 31st we can't
wait to see how you use pixel book to
work play and create next mario is going
to come out and talk about our pixel
phones
at Google we believe in questioning a
status quo asking more from the world
around us is in our nature after all
Google was built on a single question
what if all the information in the world
was available to everyone everywhere a
big question for us is what if
smartphones got smarter and simpler we
set out to design of phone ourselves
because we believed we could make the
smart phone experience better the first
pixel phone delivered a clean and fast
UI put the Google assistant in your
pocket and brought you and brought you
the best camera ever in a smartphone and
we didn't stop asking big questions or
working to solve big challenges for
users today we're proud to introduce the
Google pixel to designed for you with
the best of Google built in we've
created the new pixel in two sizes a 5
inch and the 6 inch XL with thoughtful
design elements and improvements to the
UI throughout we're bringing you more
Google assistant capabilities we've
added new smart experiences to the
camera and will continue to deliver the
best photography plus we're introducing
some innovative new products to
complement your pixel experience we do
all this by bringing together the best
of hardware software and AI let's begin
with the design we've evolved the pixels
iconic look to be even bolder the all
aluminium body with a premium hybrid
coating gives it a sleek and clean
profile the soft sculpted back with a
distinct side band feels comfortable and
secure in your hand the refined visor is
made of sturdy gently curved colored
glass and transitions seamlessly into
the metal body we've placed a
fingerprint sensor where your finger
naturally Falls it's extremely accurate
secure and it unlocks faster than
any other smartphone we also added a
small pop of color on the power button
for a bit of playfulness over on the
front pixel two's front-facing stereo
speakers are precision tuned to deliver
the perfect balance of volume clarity
and frequency response we placed them so
you can comfortably watch videos in
landscape mode without muffling the
audio with your hand if you prefer
headphones use your existing analog
headphones with the included adapter or
your digital USBC headphones for the
highest resolution audio all the way to
your ears or avoid cables altogether
with your upgraded Bluetooth 5.0 support
and hi-fi's X the smaller 5-inch pixel
too features a full HD OLED display and
it's as smart as it is beautiful the
display intelligently selects which
specific pixels to turn on leaving the
others perfectly dark for a 100,000 to 1
contrast ratio that's twice the
resolution and more than 10 times the
contrast ratio of phones in its category
with LCD displays pixel 2 comes in three
colors kind of blue just black and
clearly white you love picking the color
names so let's talk about the display on
the XL the 6-inch pixel to XL was
designed with innovative P OLED display
technology we elegantly curved the glass
to bring the display to the edges for a
full screen immersive viewing experience
the screen supports 18 by 9 q HD plus
resolution with over 4.1 million pixels
which equals 538 pixels per inch for
amazing detail we tuned to display to
take advantage of the wide color gamut
for vivid and realistic colors we've
integrated a circular polarizer which
lets you enjoy the screen even while
wearing sunglasses and we've optimized
the displays on both phones for virtual
reality they're both daydream ready the
pixel 2 XL comes in two colors
just black and the stylish ly simple
black and white feel free to choose
whichever size pixel you prefer because
you'll get the same great experience on
both we don't set-aside better features
for the larger device both devices both
devices are ip67 water and dust
resistant and have an all-day battery
the charge is super fast you get up to
seven hours of charge in just 15 minutes
now Sabrina from the pixel product team
is going to take us through the new
pixel 2 UI and some cool and useful
features thanks Mario we're constantly
working to make a smartphone experience
easier and more helpful and you'll see
improvements throughout the pixel twos
UI that helpfulness starts before you've
even unlocked the phone let me show you
the pixel twos new always-on display you
can see important information like the
time date email and text notifications
and reminders all without pushing any
buttons or unlocking the device and
there's more than just notifications on
your always-on display have you ever
heard a song you loved and wondered what
it was called
with now playing you can just glance
down to see the song name an artist on
your phone
what makes this feature so special is
that the music is identified without
your pixel to sending any information to
Google on device machine-learning
detects when music is playing and
matches it to a database of tens of
thousands of song patterns on your phone
in this example you can see that pixel
recognize the song perfect places by
lowered from here I could tap on the
sign title and I'm taken to this google
assistant I can add the song to my
library in my favorite music service
like google play music or Spotify search
the web for the song or even watch the
video on YouTube this features brought
me some delightful moments over the past
few months and I'm finally learning who
sings my favorite songs okay so let's go
to a live demo here we are on the new
pixel to home screen you can see here
I've selected one of our live wallpapers
this is from our new collection called
the living universe and if you look
closely you'll notice subtle movements
like the waves crashing on the beach
11th at the top of the screen there's a
space called at a glance where you can
easily see the latest updates on your
day we're starting with calendar events
today with traffic flight status and
more coming soon in this case I can see
that I've got a mysterious meeting
coming up not sure what that's about
we've placed the goal quick search box
at the bottom of the home screen which
we found that it's easier to reach and
we're making it even more powerful it
stays with you as you swipe across your
screens of apps and widgets a quick tap
into the search box can help me find
anything that I need as I start typing I
can see web search results at the top
but also contacts and apps from my phone
I can even drag an app from here and
drop it right on
home screen we've also made it faster
and easier to get to the Google
assistant on pixel 2 with a new feature
called
active edge just give your pixel a quick
squeeze where your hand naturally holds
the phone and ask for whatever you need
here's a quick demo I just I just
squeeze the phone take a selfie one hand
no buttons help me out front row our
research team investigated dozens of
ways to trigger the assistant but
squeezing the phone felt the most
natural satisfying and efficient after a
lot of work in machine learning we're
able to accurately identify an
intentional squeeze we're really proud
of how it turned out and it even works
when your phone is in a case so your
assistant is just a quick squeeze away
making lots of common tasks on your
phone fast and easy from calling and
texting friends to controlling your
smart home to enjoying your favorite
music and videos and having the same
assistant at home and on your phone
means the experience is connected across
devices for example I can say to my
phone ok Google broadcast hey I'm almost
home with the pizza so get ready for
dinner and my voice message is shared
with my family through the Google home
in our kitchen the routines Rishi
mentioned are coming to the phone as
well and we've also customized routines
specifically from when you are on the go
the one I use most is when I'm on my
commute I jump in my car drop my phone
in the cup holder and say ok Google
let's go home sure let's go your commute
home is currently 27 minutes with heavy
traffic if you take US 101 south you
have 1 unread text message it's from mom
it says we'll bring dessert to dinner
tonight here's where you left off in
fresh air
have a safe drive I'm Terry Gross with
fresh air super useful all from one
quick command I love how it resumed its
my podcast right from right where I left
off my assistant even adjusts the volume
so I can hear clearly on the road and
automatically sends a message to my
husband letting him know I'm on my way
like all the new routines that the
assistant will support you can customize
this one based on your preferences so
with a quick squeeze useful routines
on-the-go and an assistant that keeps
getting smarter
pixal continues to be the most helpful
phone around pixel to will launch with
pure Android Oreo with features like
notification dots picture-in-picture and
many more if you already have a pixel
you recently received the Android Oreo
update and we hope you're enjoying all
the improvements as a pixel user you'll
always be the first to get OS and
security updates without having to do
anything your phone becomes faster more
capable and more secure all the time
next up my Aparna is going to share some
smart helpful new ways to use your pixel
to
have you ever asked yourself what kind
of puppy is that or I want pillows with
that pattern our phones can help us in
many ways
but sometimes the questions we have are
difficult to describe into a search box
as you heard sooner talk about we
believe that as computers can understand
what you see it unleashes a whole new
kind of assistance that's why we started
working on Google Lenz a way to do more
with what you see you're super excited
to bring a preview of Lenz to pixel
phones this year so let's see it in
action say you see this flyer for piano
lessons as a guilty mum I've done this
as you know the email addresses on them
are always so long my best music teacher
sf 2001 at gmail.com now you can simply
tap on the lens icon grab the right
information and fire off that email this
also works for phone numbers websites
and addresses here's another example
you're at your friend's place at a party
you see this nice print and you wonder
who's the artist now you can just lens
it you can also follow up with what else
did he paint you can use lens to answer
many more questions like is this movie
worth watching
it totally is how good is this book from
Zadie Smith tell me all about this album
that my music hip friend Rishi send
screen shots off what was the tempo from
our trip five years ago look across all
these examples there are a lot of things
happening under the hood that are all
coming together so I'm gonna geek out
for a moment and take all out a few
things the computer vision systems we've
had some major breakthroughs in deep
learning and now they go from pixels in
the photo to things in the scene the
power of Google search helps us train
these algorithms with millions and
millions of images across the entire web
the power of Google's knowledge graph
with its billions of facts about people
places things we put it all together and
now you know this Buddhist temple in
Kyoto was built in the year at 12:36
80 who would have known now this has to
work in the noisiest of conditions you
know these photos can be taken at
different angles different times of the
day different weather conditions
out-of-focus pictures shaking hands you
get the picture
to be clearer sometimes computers do
trip up especially when things kind of
look similar like this let's take a
moment is this a muffin or is this the
Chihuahua you tell me it's early days
for Lance but you know this is a
familiar journey for us when Google
started our search index contain about
25 million pages now it's in the
trillions when we started working on
wise recognition our algorithms couldn't
always catch what you are saying
especially with an accent like mine now
we have an accuracy rate of more than
95% that's as good as humans we're just
getting started with helping you do more
with what you see be the photo from five
years ago or something right in front of
you in time we want to bring lens
everywhere but super excited to bring a
preview of lens to pixel users first so
you'll start to see this icon appear in
google photos and soon Google assistant
we just talked about how the phone can
help you understand the world but it can
also help you place things into the
world that's right
that's augmented reality we see it as a
powerful way to bring the physical and
the digital together that's why we
started working on a our core our
augmented reality SDK for Android and we
see that developers are already using it
to create some amazing experiences I
want to show you a few examples here so
let's take house they're bringing the
show room into your living room using a
are with League of Legends you can watch
one of the most popular
eSport games on an AR map built by grab
games and with Lego my favorite you can
build virtual models with characters
that really come to life all the fun
no LEGO pieces to step on we at Google
are also making some fun things and our
teams have been working hard to create
this new experience we call it a are
stickers it's built right into the
camera and it's exclusive to pixel with
a are stickers you can express yourself
with playful emojis like this one food
characters here there's lots to choose
from and more will be added over time
our partners are also making some fun
stickers here and I want to show some of
them to you right now so let's start
with the Netflix origin over my favorite
show stranger things can wait for season
2 ready to see it ok time to set the
mood lights please okay here's Lea using
the pixel camera we're looking at the AR
stickers
we're in the stranger things collection
yes okay
so let's pick a character let's pick
Demi Garden and place him right next to
me you need to have a cup of coffee ding
notice how the creature is not just
sitting around where you put it and it's
not a dead sticker it's moving it's
reacting to what's around it it's alive
we really pay attention to the motion
the physics the lighting we want to make
it feel like it's actually here is it
let's talk some fun this is a great
photo or video by the way
fees but let's have some fun here
Lia can be dropped 11 into this
alright ok this is getting interesting
now we have two characters in the scene
and notice how they're not just reacting
to you the environment around them
they're reacting to each other if they
know each other's presence that's a big
reaction these interactions make some
really interesting moments here Thank
You Leah now you can be the director of
all kinds of stories and share with
share these with your friends you have
more AR stickers to play with your
favorite characters from SNL YouTube the
NBA and just in time for episode 8 Star
Wars I've been playing with these
stickers are so easy to use and they
look great and this is because the pixel
camera is specially calibrated for
augmented reality it allows robust
tracking even in low-light conditions
it also supports 60 frames per second
rendering of AR content
you saw how the camera can help us do
more with what we see with google lens
you saw how the camera can bridge the
physical and digital with AR but the
pixel camera also takes awesome photos
so to tell you all about it we'll have
Mario back on stage
thanks Aparna we hear every day from
users of the first pixel phone that the
camera is one of their favorite features
you can see why in the amazing photos
that people post with the team pixel
hashtag last year pixel received a DxO
score of 89 that was the highest rating
that DxO mark had ever issued to a
smartphone with pixel 2 we have
reimagined smartphone photography
through great Hardware and unparalleled
imaging software tuned by our engineers
and researchers today we're proud to
announce that DxO mark has issued pixel
to an unprecedented score of 98 that's
the highest score of any smartphone
camera let's talk about how we achieve
that and it starts with great hardware
the pixel 2 has a 12 megapixel F 1.8
aperture rear camera with optical image
stabilization we've integrated these
components with our HDR + computational
photography for every photo we take a
burst of shots with short exposure times
to avoid blowing out the highlights
within a line and combine each pixel
algorithmically for optimal color and
contrast all of this happens instantly
with zero shutter lag the results are
stunning with high dynamic range even in
challenging low-light conditions this
year we've increased the dynamic range
and improved texture and sharpness and
combined with a new autofocus mechanism
an optical image stabilization to reduce
blur from shaky hands you get amazing
shots every time like this and this
pixel - also brings you portrait mode
but we're implementing it a little bit
differently we're applying Google's
unmatched computational photography and
machine learning portrait mode lets you
take professional-looking shots with a
blurred background to make the
foreground
like what you might capture with an SLR
camera other smartphones do this by
combining the images from two cameras
pixel to does portrait mode with just
one camera and machine learning what's
unique about pixel 2 is that it can
generate a true depth map with a single
lens so you get beautiful portrait shots
without needing a second camera the way
this works is that the pixel to camera
includes a dual pixel sensor technology
this means that each pixel in an image
contains a right and a left view the
difference in perspective from those
pixels combined with machine learning
models trained on almost a million
photos means that this works on really
hard cases like a busy colorful
background and yes this does work with
objects too and there's more portrait
mode doesn't just work on the main
camera because of the quality of
Google's computational photography with
a single camera you can also take
portrait selfies through the front
camera on both the pixel 2 and the pixel
2 XL the pixel 2 takes amazing videos -
we're applying optical image
stabilization simultaneously with video
stabilization at the same time other
smartphones do optical or digital we do
but don't do both at the same time
during video recording on a pixel - the
OIS Hardware actively corrects shake
artifacts while at the same time the
software based video stabilization uses
intelligent frame look ahead to
stabilize the overall video we call this
fused video stabilization and it's
another example of Google's hardware +
software + AI working together the
result is less motion blur even in
low-light your videos look smooth and
professional the pixel 2 camera also
supports a feature called motion photos
the photos you take with your in for the
photos you take your pixel captures up
to 3 seconds of video behind the scenes
removing uninteresting motion and
applying our unique fuse video
stabilized
technology - the result but of course
the proof is in the photos and videos so
we invited some photographers and
producers to test drive the new camera
and they were stunned but what they can
do with the pixel - Timmy mcgerr better
known as 13th witness on Instagram and
filmmaker Zac McTeague documented a
recent trip to New Orleans using just
the pixel to the film you're about to
see uses no attachments fancy rigs or
lighting all of the video footage and
stills were captured on pixel - phones
without any image enhancements or color
Corrections
playing machine fire
again each photo and video and what you
just saw was shot using only pixel two
phones no image enhancements or color
Corrections
now the pixel 2's camera is simple
enough and smart enough that your photos
and videos can look just as good so the
pixel twos photo experience doesn't end
when you take a photo or shoot a video
we want users to be able to easily find
them and store them securely without
having to worry about running out of
storage
after all simple storage and search is
part of what makes us Google so we're
happy to announce that pixel to users
will continue to get free unlimited
storage for all of the photos and videos
they capture in the highest resolution
including 4k videos and motion photos
this is a big deal this is a big deal
pixel users take twice as many photos as
typical iPhone users and store an
average of 23 gigabytes of photos and
videos per year in Google's cloud if you
had to use iCloud you'd reach your free
limit in less than three months with
pixel you can safely and effortless
effortlessly store all of your memories
for free with your permission Google
photos automatically tags and
categorizes those thousands of photos
and videos will take with your pixel too
you can search for photos of your
friends of a specific location of dogs
all without the hassle of manually
tagging or sorting finding your photo
the photo you're looking for is our
problem and not yours we're delighted by
what we've been able to achieve with
pixel 2 in terms of photography and are
so excited by all the moments that
you're going to capture so to recap the
smart and simple pixel 2 has everything
you'd expect from a smartphone and some
things you might not a gorgeous display
that brings your apps photos and videos
to life an all-day battery that charges
super fast plus water resistance and
security features to keep your phone and
your data safe easy quick access to the
Google assistant which understands you
and get smarter and more helpful all the
time fun and useful ways to use your
camera
Google lands and AR and the best
photography for a Manny phone for
brilliant photos and smooth professional
videos we're also making it easier than
ever to switch to pixel most new pixel
users will be able to transfer their
stuff from their old phone in less than
10 minutes including all of your photos
apps and even your eye messages so let's
talk about availability and pricing

best of Google hardware software and AI
we hope you'll love it as much as we do
all right so as you've seen we've spent
the past year reimagining a simpler more
helpful smartphone experience we've also
been working on some new products to
make your pixel to experience even
better let's start with the newly
updated Google daydream view our virtual
reality headset we kept everything from
last year that people loved and we made
it even better to start we have a new
lineup of colors that complement this
year's made by Google family we also
upgraded the lenses and the fabrics so
the headset has our widest field of view
yet and is super light and comfortable
of course
what matters most in a VR headset is
where it can take you last year we
launched with 25 apps and games and now
we have more than 250 high quality VR
titles we've also seen that people love
going places with VR videos so we're
excited to announce a slate of premium
video content coming to daydream
including multiple new original series
on YouTube VR and on Google Play Movies
you can experience new IMAX movies
available for free to pixel to owners so
you get to hang out with Tigers run
alongside elephants dive into the ocean
with some sharks and blast into space
with pixel twos new front firing stereo
speakers these movies sound as amazing
as they look and now you can even cast
the experience to the TV so your friends
and family can see what you're seeing
the new Google daydream view is the best
mobile VR headset on the market and will
be available for $99 today we're also
announcing a smart new audio accessory
that works perfectly with pixel - our
first pair of premium wireless
headphones they're called they're called
Google pixel buds our team designed
pixel buds for great sound delivering
clear highs and deep bass so whether
it's jazz house or a symphony it all
sounds incredible with pixel buds
controlling your music is super simple
because all of the controls are built
into the right earbud you simply tap to
start and stop your music or swipe
forwards and backwards to change the
volume now what's amazing is when you
pair your pixel buds with your pixel two
you get instant access to the Google
assistant we optimized the experience to
be quick and easy just touch and hold
the earbud and ask your assistant to
play music send a text or give walking
directions all while keeping your phone
in your pocket it can also alert you to
new notifications and read your messages
pixel buds work great with pixel they
even give you access to a new real-time
translation experience it's an
incredible application of Google
Translate powered by machine learning
that's like having a personal translator
by your side to show you how easy this
experience is I'd like to invite Isabel
back on stage for a conversation in her
native language Swedish so Isabel is
going to speak Swedish into her pixel
buds and all hear the English
translation out of pixel twos front
speakers and then I'll respond in
English and she'll hear the Swedish
translation in her pixel buns to
illustrate this today you'll hear both
sides of the conversation okay
hey Isabel how's it going hey Isabel
here I like it here okay pack what do
you think of these cool new headphones
what we can do under my colony near her
Ljubljana mitten the sign mother don't
say article make a mistake Oh blah so
while you're up here what color should I
get middle divine health we can fight
the evil yeah hmm Jethro dunce cap your
scallop ass today
all right truly a drama people came in
Oceania roughly and Alegre
Thank You Isabella so with pixel buds I
can use real-time Google Translate to
have a natural conversation in 40
languages we're letting you connect with
the world around you in a more natural
way by rethinking how a headphone should
work connecting it to cloud-based
machine learning and giving you access
with the touch of a finger
Google pixel buds come in a pocket-sized
charging case that provide up to five
hours of listening time with just one
charge and the case holds multiple
charges so you get up to 24 hours of
listening time when you're on the go
pixel buds are available in clearly
white kind of blue and just black -
beautifully compliment your pixel - and
they'll feel available in November for
$159 and pre-orders begin today we have
one more product to show you it's about
photography now we all love photos a lot
of our photos let us step back into a
moment with friends with family some of
our favorites are the candid ones like
this they capture the essence of a
moment but the problem is to get those
photos someone needs to be the
photographer on duty waiting to press
the shutter button at just the right
moment and we were thinking how do you
capture those fleeting spontaneous
moments while letting yourself be part
of the moment so we've been working on
that and I'm really excited to share an
entirely new type of camera that works
with your pixel we call it Google clips
and this first edition is specifically
designed with parents and pet owners in
mind so you'll capture more of those
spontaneous smiles first steps and first
tricks now clips has all the things you
would expect from a great camera a high
performance lens a powerful image sensor
it has a shutter button but that's not
what this camera is all about we
reimagine this camera from the inside
out starting with the software and
applying machine learning to build a
camera that takes photos for you so you
can enjoy the moment and instantly get
shots you couldn't get before thank you
how does all that work it starts with an
AI engine at the core of the camera
let's talk about what that engine does
when you're behind a camera you look for
people you care about you look for
smiles you look for that moment your dog
starts chasing her tail clips does all
of that for you
turn it on and it captures the moment so
you can be in the moment and because the
software is at the core of the camera
it's gonna get smarter over time we also
reimagine what camera hardware should do
for you clips is tiny it weighs almost
nothing so you can easily toss it into
your pocket and it's a hands-free camera
so you can get these amazing new
perspectives on your experience and get
yourself in the shot by attaching clips
to almost anything or setting it down
now from the beginning we knew privacy
and control really matter and we've been
thoughtful about this for Clips users
their family and their friends let's
start with the basics it looks like a
camera and it has an indicator light so
everyone knows what the device does next
it looks for stable clear shots of
people you know and you help the camera
learn who's important to you and finally
all the machine learning happens on the
device itself so just like any point and
shoot
thing leaves your device until you
decide to save and share it this
approach to designing and engineering
clips required some significant
technical breakthroughs to miniaturize
the type of powerful machine learning
that only a few years ago
needed a supercomputer let's take a look
at what Clips actually captures so
here's some clips I've captured with my
family at home now as you can see it's
not just photos that clips is taking
taking little snippets that capture the
whole moment we call those of course
clips you can save them as a motion
photo or choose any frame to save as a
high-resolution still it's like having
my own photographer shooting and
choosing the best moments for me and I
just have to swipe to save to Google
photos which can automatically make
movies out of your clips in seconds so
that's the new Google clips a new type
of camera that brings together at the
best of Google AI software and hardware
tell people more easily capture genuine
candid moments of family friends and
pets clips will be coming soon and
selling for $249 take a look at some of
these great clips from our earliest
users enjoy
hello again everyone what you just saw
in pixel buds and clips blends AI with
the best of Google software and high
performance hardware to create new
radically helpful experiences for users
this is our strategy for the Google
Hardware team and you've seen it come to
life in all of our new products the two
newest members of the Google home family
the beautiful new pixel phones and our
premium pixel book laptop and of course
the Google assistant is the primary way
we bring a eye to our users your
personal Google is ready to get you the
help you need when you need it
talk to it type show what you see or
just give your phone a squeeze it's the
simplest way to get things done and it
just works so here it is this year is
made by Google family
we've created them as a single set of
products that are designed for you with
familiar elements from soft materials to
curved lines and simple stylish colors
they look great together and they also
work great together and perfectly
demonstrate our approach of reimagining
hardware from the inside out
thanks so much for joining us today few
livestream viewers take a closer look at
our new products at a redesigned Google
store for everyone here in SF jazz
you'll get to see everything up close in
our demo area outside thank you so much
and enjoy your day
don't forget your umbrella
everybody all right we are back we are
grooving I gotta say those DJs we're hot
I was like I was like I was like doing
all like the chest stuff and everything
so what we have here guys and gals
Patrick Holland and myself are still in
the house
Stephen Beecham is running the show
we're gonna take your calls we're gonna
let you talk about it we're gonna talk
about it with you so many things to talk
about
but let's just get to the number that
you guys in gals can call and we're
sorry we had to drop the calls during
the keynote it just it was like two
hours so the phone number that you could
call is 1-866-376-8255
better product yeah I don't even have to
use it you can tell it's a better
product literally right off the bat and
you could no it looks amazing - I mean I
think I designed it's beautiful but when
he just did like hey what's that song
that goes like wow yeah it's like that's
me like every day that is like me every
day for most of my life and now
something's that are someone's gonna
build a reply to me and actually play
the music that my jibberish songs and
mouths make but I think that's just
impressive the technology but also the
way they're presenting it this very like
consumer-friendly it's very fun we're
not getting kind of bogged down
Inspectah factor at the beginning one of
the one of the Google execs I said you
know what all phones we're at like a
hardware like still me you know
everything is kind of like stagnant with
that and all that innovation is come in
at Google assistance coming in there
their Google lense and all these AI
things that they've been working on for
years and machine learning
it's so exciting yeah I just you know
there's there's subtle things that
happen at this keynote where it's
literally all driven by software and
machine learning and Google just they
just pepper these things you're like oh
damn and you're like no one has this and
that's what that's what gets us excited
about tech so the phone lines are
completely filled we go ten deep so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna spend the
next half hour so you're just grinding
down through this you know some people
want to talk about what they love some
people want to talk about what they
don't like this is all about you all so
let's start off I don't have the name
here in our screener but let's start off
with our first call I guess the number
area code is a little 202 they want to
talk about though what's up oh there is
hold on one second guys guys and gals
give me a second hold on yes it was get
that way I would still bump into that DJ
yeah okay is it gone now okay so we have
it is if you have that new pixel books
just written about in it this is what
I'm learning
oh here that was another one okay is it
gone now okay sorry guys you know I'm
watching the keynote okay you're our but
our buddy or our gal from the 202 first
caller in here that want to talk about
the lack of information about I'm not
sure exactly about a service but welcome
to the show seen that live here what's
up hey what's going on Brian this way
what a brand yeah what
to talk about the the lack of info on
Google Phi the cellular services that
Google has attached to the pixel you
know like we've we've seen it obviously
available and they've kind of catered
towards pixel users
I haven't they typically don't talk
about Google Phi at the keynotes quite
honestly because they really try to make
it a little bit more product focused but
yeah we didn't we didn't hear anything I
don't know what's what's the latest with
it quite honestly but yeah we didn't
hear anything from it were you looking
to hear something specific yeah just
wanted to see if then if it was like any
improvements on it because like right
now I'm calling on the the old pixel
with Google fire and it's just this the
big seller about it was the fact that it
switches between t-mobile US Cellular
and Sprint networking in Wi-Fi that's
open so you can save a lot on your bill
and all that so beyond just these the
other major the other major thing would
be obviously the free storage but the
Google five service is actually a game
changer when you think about it but they
never really go too heavy into it I
think in a weird way in this this sounds
bad but sometimes I think it it's not
that they don't think that we're smart
enough to get it but sometimes when when
they it might take the energy out of the
room when they want to show like sexy
eye candy and then talk about Google you
know that that that would be probably
their main reason for it but yeah you're
absolutely right about this service I
mean look it for example look at what
they did at the end of the keynote with
Google clips that just sucked all the
energy and excitement out of the room
that appeals to probably like 1% of its
user base I mean I'm not trying to hate
on it just wasn't something it didn't
align with everything else that you're
like yeah yeah yeah and so I feel like
if they did this whole five minutes
appeal about Google 5 it might have some
similar kind of letdown you feeling not
that it's not a great product right so I
that's why I don't think that we might
have seen as much in it but what do you
think about the pixel - I mean you're a
pixel owner so obviously you have an
experience with the platform all right
ok well it's ok we
I thought I thought it was I thought it
was great I mean I think the pixel two
is a special phone again well we'll have
to see how the availability of it comes
through Verizon exclusive from what we
have heard up to this point but like you
said it's like this I mean it's very
similar to how they roll up the pixel
last year but yeah will this will they
actually have the phones to sell and and
make it affected with that but also like
the features they have like it doesn't
also make the last year's pixel obsolete
like sometimes I feel like brands will
go other way to show you this amazing
new phone and you're like man this
iPhone 7 I guess this sucks now that's a
great point that's a great point I think
get that vibe from Google yeah yeah I
mean they're rolling out all the
software into the new pixel other than
obviously the advancements of the camera
which we'll talk about a little bit what
we're showing you footage right now is
actually from this is raw like on the
fly but this is live in the demo room of
Google's event over at the SF jazz
center so while we talk about these
things will kind of cut in between
they're actually getting shots for our
first looks but we wanted to kind of at
least when they're using it give you
some shots of it inside the live room
we're gonna keep on going through our
phone lines we're sorry about that ray
but we got nothing but love for you we
have another call here name is not
identified but we're coming to us from
the five five nine talking about the
show just now what's going on welcome to
see that live yeah what's up Allen
thanks for calling man great great so I
really like the bode show those
earphones are ear pods or whatever or
there was really cool in terms of
transmission stuff I found out with
amusing yeah absolutely
and I think that that hallmark is that
they read coffee Hoffa apples you know
the own stuff Apple Hobbs which is kind
of funny you know they had to come up
dead once they said that they were there
would be no actual headphone jack on
this phone it was clear to us that they
had to have some sort of a solution
quite honestly we knew about it but we
can't always say everything that we
unless it was leaked we don't want to
talk about you know we knew about it
before the keynote but we didn't
just spoil for anyone because that's
kind of fun but man to actually see that
translation in action I thought that was
that that was pretty special
yeah that's pretty special yeah it's not
a feature you would use um yeah you know
traveling a lot easier you go to foreign
country I mean it would be a feature
that I would have to use just even with
people that speak English sometimes I
mean they need to work on an English to
English translator for me sometimes
people are like what are you saying Tong
it's at least 10 years out my friends at
least I know we're working on it but I
liked and I thought that you were
universe noting that the price point was
very similar to the air pots as well if
not exactly the same yeah I mean yeah a
lot more functionality you know actual
functionality with multiple types of
controls the Google assistant prompt and
translation that's that's pretty awesome
so that was a you know I know people
gonna say oh it has a wire on it so what
there's still wireless they don't look
bad yeah they look good at it I like
that they have the colors that match the
phones as well yeah I like details like
that matter yeah absolutely so hey Alan
thanks so much for calling we're gonna
keep on cranking through the lines but
we appreciate you all right
no problem all right all the way from
Barbados man oh yeah we dig it he's got
he's got his priorities right they'll
call in like that that's what I would do
if I was in Barbados so a lot of people
um if I don't get to your actual name
it's just because you didn't say it in
our screening program but that's okay
I'm gonna just kind of do the best I can
to prompt you just let us know once we
get you we're gonna take a call here
let's see if I can get this we're gonna
take a call here from our friend from
the seven one eight
welcome to CNET live what's going on Oh
who's this what's up Alex would you like
to talk about today I think I'd like to
talk about the Google Translate how it
turns out to be very useful like notes
are days I guess cuz I'm really excited
about Google buds because I like to
travel a lot is it just in generally I
really liked it a lot yeah was there
anything else that stuck out to you in
the keynote it was the
stuck out to me that it was really
useful in a way how in the year but
incorporating the in the phone and they
just you don't have to t get to the
phone and then just you speak for you so
it was really nice and you know yeah are
you a pixel owner at all right now no
I'm not a persona I'm a Galaxy S owners
f8 so is that something that would
encourage you to switch over yes because
it has the pure the the thing that
people we know we're so used to the idea
of it it's a pixel phone but it's a pure
Android experience pure Android I can't
understate how nice that is
alright hey thanks so much for calling
us Alex we appreciate it
alright we're gonna keep on cranking
through this we're gonna go here to our
buddy
Darrell Evans just give it a second
Jarrell welcome to seeing that live hey
how's it going good good talk to us man
what would you like to see once again
the most amazing thing with the the live
Google Translate but I also had a
question about YouTube music it said
YouTube music for 12 months for a while
they were packaging what were the Google
Music Service and YouTube service into
one do you know if that would include
both of them they didn't make that clear
so you know unfortunately we just saw
the keynote same time as you we don't
always have all the details but did you
catch anything about they didn't mention
it but I know these referring to bass
before they get that it be a pack you
know so they didn't really publicize
that very well even before but I was I'd
be curious about that too I think would
have to but we don't know the details we
shouldn't speculate just our hope I hope
so is it is it Doral or is it Jarrell
I'm sorry
it's Giroux but see no you guys are
supposed to have the secrets we trust me
we had secrets before the key no but we
couldn't talk about him like if you
wanted me to spoil about the pixel buds
we could have but we were kind of told
hey unless it gets leaked don't talk
about it and look
don't you want surprises when you watch
these keynotes like your favorite or do
your favorite thing was actually the
translate from the pixel buds
if I told you that you would you would
still think it was cool but just not as
cool
so I'm looking out for you Darrell I'm
looking out for you my man the secrets
are out all right hey thanks so much for
calling good all right take it easy all
right we will go and jump over here for
a moment let's go check out and again
the number that the phone lines you guys
are beasts they keep on just filling up
Peach if you can leave that phone line
up we will continue to answer calls for
probably out the next 10 or 15 minutes
we are going to go to our friend over
here in the seven-one-seven that wants
to talk about I believe the pixel book
what's up welcome to see that live hey
it's an honor wait your name is it's an
honor it's an honor judge and honor your
honor my name I said it in the screening
process uh uh anyway no tell us I went
back there you go Zack Dolan's yeah I
don't know maybe it didn't catch that
ya know I'm a long time long time
watcher first-time caller
yeah I wanted to talk about the pig the
book let's talk about it what did you
what did you like what did you maybe not
like well I love the design I love that
it charges with USB type-c which is
something that I've been looking for in
a laptop for a while without you know
sacrificing power but the problem is is
Zack - Zack are you there oh man it
looks like it looks like the call broke
up let's talk about the pixel book for a
quick second I loved everything
feature-wise on that you know quite
honestly the biggest the thing about it
comes down to that's the biggest
obstacle is its running a Chrome OS and
so you have to talk about support for
full fledged apps right they did show
Adobe Lightroom
but there's gonna
you're living in the Google ecosystem it
I just need to sort of the way that I
use machines there I do need some
higher-end graphics applications but for
most people that was that 999 starting
yeah that's ridiculous for a
multi-function pen stylus based dude you
circle someone's face and it like pulls
up information about them I don't know
tablet hybrid - yeah it's a total
convertible tablet hybrid the coolest
thing I thought I saw about that whole
presentation was the pairing with your
phone being able to use the Wi-Fi from
your phone on the test it's amazing I
mean I've always wanted to do that and
it running the bus home it looks sick it
looks so beautiful with the the back of
that display I mean looks obviously just
like the phones which is the roaches
right kind of a continuity across the
problem that's what I was getting at
earlier yeah I didn't think that's so
thoughtful but it I just I was so scared
about that price and I'm like 999 is a
it's yeah right it's so perfectly we
were talking maybe it's we were thinking
12 49 or higher when they were watching
and we're like $9.99 and again it's
different levels it whether you're
starting with a core it comes with an
Intel Core i5 or i7 configuration I
think up to 512 gigs of ram up to our
sorry storage space up to 16 gigs of ram
so this is not a weak machine by any
means and I like to other integrating
you know that's obviously literally
straddling the line between a tablet and
a laptop but like you know bringing
snapchat on that's gonna definitely meet
sway some users I saw Instagram flash up
there too during the presentation but
you're just like yeah that's smart
that's smart and there are power users
who are gonna need like video and stuff
like that and at big editing tools but
something like Lightroom is not a very
light tool as well and that was shown on
there but man that just it looks so good
and the use and then there's the pixel
book pen yes
Wow I the thing that I you know stuck
out to us the most is look every company
has their own direction of what they
will what they believe the laptop or
whatever it is is going to be we now
have Microsoft who has killed it with
the surface I see plenty of surfaces in
the wild being used professionally when
I'm flying you know
Evelynn around I mean people are using
that product a lot we have apples
philosophy of no touchscreen whatsoever
no OS to support it it Apple came out
with the touch bar guys like that's a
it's a it's a mediocre interface at best
everyone that uses it yeah only Andriy
with you and only on its high end
laptops yeah what we're looking at is
we're seeing a laptop that's not it
looks high-end but its price for more of
an entry-level laptop but it has all the
features you want he has the touchscreen
it has the support of an amazing stylist
made by Wacom which is an amazing tablet
company and then on top of that you have
that Google assistant on there yeah I
think is gonna be a big I mean compared
to Siri yes and it doesn't seem like
it's gonna be sandbagged for it like
it's not gonna be able to do things
because it's on a tablet or on the pixel
book I think a lot of people that don't
care about it assistant on a machine hat
most people that say oh I don't care
about that serious good enough all I
have to tell you is try using Google's
assistant just a little bit and you'll
instantly be able to be like it's
smarter it's faster it understands me
better across the board it's it's just
really impressive and we didn't even we
didn't bring up a little quick mention
the actual pixel book pen has the lowest
latency out of any pen so right now with
the iPad pro and the Apple pencil they
have a 20 millisecond latency the pixel
book pen has a 10 millisecond latency
which is as close as pen to paper as
you're going to get and that's so even
faster than I think the Microsoft
Surface Urfa spins right yeah yeah yeah
so I think the surface pen might be
around 20 also maybe a little higher if
I recall I have to look it up we but uh
10 yeah it just it really if you've
stacked up Apple's flagship laptop
versus all these other flagship laptops
from companies it feels like what their
vision of and their innovation using the
touch bar it they they're missed they're
missing it I mean I don't know about you
guys but I am used to the idea of just
touching screens now and what it'll be
funny give it maybe two three years then
Apple comes out with some sort of level
of a touch screen type laptop which
they've been
resistant to but it's here already in
multiple formations we have the Lenovo
yoga line and surface and pixel book now
and plenty others wonder if this goes
our show if you make it you not only add
that feature but you do it well and I
think that's the other thing that you
know it we didn't always see Microsoft
Surface is it took him a while to figure
it out it didn't pass a coffee table
test but now you go in a coffee shop and
you see people on surfaces and I think
it's exciting because you know there's
always been that little bit of a stigma
around like a Chromebook - right and
that like it doesn't can't do all these
things but it just they they show that
you can and it looks nice and it's gonna
be a great experience I'm excited to try
it out yeah I just oh man that that was
what I think for me that next to the the
translation was probably the most
exciting part very cool
all right we're gonna keep on taking a
few more calls I know that the lines are
completely filled so just stick with us
sometimes the names have popped up in
our in our screeners software but we
will bear with us so let's go talk to
our friend from the five seven one come
on let's go baby
it's taking a moment so just bear with
me hello there welcome hello we're here
welcome to seen alive what's your name
alright and what you want to talk about
what do you say I'm not here we want to
repeat what he said very exciting it's a
very exciting idea but maybe not for our
lovely livestream podcast so I just
realized that after it took a moment a
process and understanding that you had
yourself a little bit of latency there
welcome to the show
six one three welcome what's your name
it's car over back Oh Carl we are back
yes sir yes you came back for more man
I'm oh you are so low on life I've been
waiting on the the bud first of all and
just flex tonality of the the go free
storage bro I know you like iPhone I've
been dying for the pie
couple months keep them recharging my
phone and like we switching store it
anyways
buds are amazing because I'm playing on
traveling soon and having that
translation all the time make it easy to
approach girls too
bro you need to do a video bro hold up
hold up bro I'll do a video but there's
gonna be a point in time where if your
relationship advances with these ladies
you're gonna still be wearing those buds
you're still gonna be wearing those bugs
son if you know what I mean that'd be
great video teach ya hiya now I mean I'm
just sayin you don't want to wear the
buds if you know very cool was there any
other any other things that stuck out to
you that you know might have surprised
you or that you liked as well everyone
loves like the button on the translation
I actually have to two things yeah I it
didn't mention that you actually get a
Google meanings with the phone if you
pre-order that's correct if for a
limited time you'll get a Google mini
four so a $49 kind of throw in with that
as well yes certain because I mean I'm
I'm in Canada so I don't know how that
works so I believe interest right here
called how to pre-order the new phones
now and get your what does it call
Google me Google yeah the Google how
many yes yeah I believe I swear Canada
was one of the countries that was part
of it yeah definitely Australia I think
- yeah so many and and my second thing
is I'm still not convinced on the Google
pixel I'm like the software is I don't
know I'm all kind of like a light gamer
so I'm like I want to have that power to
push have to be able to gain especially
overwatch but looking like as long as
you got overwatch
I'm good you're like you just get me get
me my overwatch all right hey Carl
thanks so much for calling again alright
no problem all right take it easy we
will jump over to our next caller let's
try and talk to Phillip Phillip Saunders
is that correct
no it's Kenneth
that's you know what I'm just gonna
ignore this Auto scream fake name stuff
that it makes up I apologize
welcome to the show oh no problem no
problem yeah I was actually really
impressed with with this press
conference and it's really interesting
that on how Google is really starting to
get the mind share of hey you know we're
advancing technology forward and I
really love the fact that even you know
with the Google Translate with the buds
they're really trying to compete with
Apple on on a higher level and saying
hey we can compete directly against you
and I honestly feel sorry for the other
head handset manufacturers you know even
including the Samsung that now Google is
taking approach to saying hey you know
we're tired of you all bubbling our
reputation for our Android and now
finally we are taking over and we're
going to do what Apple is doing to
provide the consumer the best experience
and and and now with the pixel with the
camera oh my goodness that for to get
that kind of rating is absolutely
awesome yeah yeah absolutely sorry keep
on going sir keep on going yeah and and
and and the fact is is that you know
with the with the keynote that you know
it I feel that it is it was more
exciting what what Apple presented and
even with you know iPhone 10 it's going
to be interesting with those two phones
really kind of competing against each
other and what people are good actually
gonna you know go for but again you know
that with Google presenting hey you know
pre-order you get so many you know the
whole mini which is now starting to get
people in the mindset of like okay well
let me talk to my talk to my you know
speaker but it also gives a way of
Google really infiltrate a home to
really start the home automation and
really make that a priority and and you
know within the mainstream yeah you know
when Google first released the home as a
competitor to the Amazon echo what it
really came down to at the beginning and
we all kind of foresaw this Amazon echo
has great relationships with all the
third-party manufacturers they also
really opened up their API so almost
anyone could pretty much submit and make
apps and it's
started to build this great like kind of
community around it the Google assistant
and the technology behind it is smarter
than the Amazon echo platform but it was
trailing behind you know now you're
starting to see all the support for more
devices more smart home devices and that
we knew that gap was going to close but
now like you say it's part of an
ecosystem with the phone with everything
that you can do with it to the
chromecast to this and that so using it
to dial out from your actual phone
number that that was something that was
pretty cool like just great knowing
knowing that that connection is there so
there continued to to just kind of build
and build and to your point about the
pixel phone look I have nieces and
nephews and even they say that Google is
cooler to them than Apple like they know
that Apple is they like Apple but they
think that the pixel is more exciting
and I don't indoctrinate them at all I
just you know they know that I love tech
but they're like oh let me when we go on
trips bring your quick pixel we want to
use your pixel and so I think that some
of these little hooks and bells and
whistles that they're showing us is
changing that mind share you're seeing
it and also you know with we don't know
how these are gonna sell quite honestly
let's be real right the iPhone is gonna
sell more than the pixel but when Google
decided to go we're gonna control our
own software and hardware at the same
time much like Apple this is going to
enable us to do things we haven't done
with our phones and make them special in
our in our vision that was a big deal
and I don't I don't I think they made
the pixel the original pixel they were
they didn't necessarily care if it was a
success in the market but if it was a
critical success that was what was
important right actually having a
quality product that didn't bomb to the
critics and users whether or not it sold
a lot of units initially I think going
back to the presentation to I think we
saw a lot more discipline from Google
cuz we've always had great ideas and
some crazy products that have completely
failed but then on the flip side we saw
there's a lot more refinement to what we
saw on the products a lot more
thoughtfulness both in the design and
carrying that over from one product to
the other but also just that integration
and so now we're sitting there looking
at this not only as like a Google home
and a Google assist
and we're looking at a laptop we're
looking at phones we're the kind of
earbuds even though I didn't like that
Google Clips camera it's still
integrated into with their overall thing
and I think that's actually a little
more of a flashback of old Google like a
couple years ago like hey we got the
school thing and we're gonna throw it
out there's like no rules like do nobody
wants that it's so good you stayed on
the track and then you got off they
didn't need to do that at all so that's
what I think I'm excited about we're
just seeing a very mature
Google step forward and just own it and
this and yet that we had some it threw
some sand through some shaded Apple yeah
Turner's features on both phones not
separating that and that's fun and stuff
but on the flip side I think they don't
even though they are competing with
Amazon they're competing with Apple for
a long time they've been kind of
competing with themselves just to be
that disciplined like concise company
and it was just so exciting to see that
flow happen and all those products man
I'd except for the clips that we will
poop on the cliff and them that I'd say
I'm not trying to poop on the clips but
say I'm excited to try all them out just
to see how they work together - yeah
sokar so uh fill up any any other things
that you wanted to bring up before we
let you go like are you going to which
product are you most likely looking to
purchase out of what you saw today
don't say Google clips okay so it's
Kenneth sorry bad apple I am a Apple
person yeah and I'm completely into the
Apple ecosystem and you know I'm looking
forward to the home pod but I also own a
Google home and then also an Amazon echo
yeah my home was going off like you're
the whole quiet oh goodness I do realize
they say okay but what the product I'm
really interested in it is the max yeah
and it's really interesting that their
pricing is higher than Apple's home pod
and I'm because I'm a very like I love
you know sound I love music just like
how dippel's talked about listen to
music all the time and for me I'm I get
excited about well they're talking about
the sound quality well I got here it a
person you know what I'm afraid of
though is that if I'm gonna hear it at a
retailer like Best Buy whoever I might
not be able to get the best sound
quality I mean it may be a good
demonstration but you know how those
places they don't really let you you
know really play anything out loud the
way that you want but it's going to be
interesting on how you know I might go
ahead and buy that product more than
anything else because even like with the
the laptop the pixel book well I got an
iPad pro and I do everything on iPad pro
it does all my productivity the only
thing I can't do is develop on it but
the but the pixel book is good but the
challenge is like you all said before
how our developers going to you know
create apps for specifically for Chrome
OS and that is going to be a challenge
because user name mobile app you know
because it connects to Google Play and
whatnot is gonna require develops to
rethink their apps so that can't be
compatible with that device as well but
the good but the Google home max I'm
totally excited about that yeah I mean I
was fired up about right when we saw it
and they started breaking it down I'm
like this is this is better than the
home pod this I I just it's clearly
better so we'll see how we'll see how it
shakes out yep I think it's kind of like
buying a mattress to like you gotta like
just have it and live on a mattress for
a while but really no I mean this like
that's why we got returns baby but yeah
and so if you have like yeah all right
Kenneth I got you this time and thank
you so much for calling great talking
and uh love your insight and obviously
we can tell you're a tech fan you know
you're in the different ecosystem so
that's really great so we appreciate
that man here cool no problem
all right let's keep on going we're
gonna take I guess we'll take like a few
we'll take three more calls sorry for
everyone that
I I may not get to but we will talk
about they're still checking out the
Google pixel on site I looks like I have
Daniel hopefully are you there from the
five five nine yeah I'm here
welcome to the show welcome to seen it
live what did you want to talk about
today I just wanted to talk to talk
about the fact that the screen of the
pixel and the pixel excel doesn't
support HDR I didn't hear them talking
about HDR and supports since YouTube was
so fortunate year I'm surprised the apps
pools which is the pixel and a pixel at
Excel isn't true it's not supports in
HDR I'm just surprised yeah they didn't
say that I haven't looked at the
official specs that would have probably
been something they would have touted
people that are listening or can let us
know but yeah you're right I didn't I
didn't see HDR I didn't hear to mention
that and that is like one of those
little things that it's those little
things right like eight here which I
wouldn't say it's a little thing but
it's something that you're not gonna buy
you're not gonna go I'm gonna switch
this for that but it's nice to have it
and when you see a screen that has it
and you go back to its gonna dozen oh
man what a difference and it's
interesting because the pho the
photographer the photo the camera I
believe they did say it has built in HDR
capture right yeah it's like like the
pixels this is always capturing HD
correct so your plus I think it's what
they call correct so although they
didn't what's interesting is although
they didn't mention it and again sorry
that we you know we just got out of the
keynote maybe that it to me if you have
a camera that captures HDR these days
you want to screen that can display that
as well so what you're saying is I could
buy the pixel tool to take the picture
and then put it on my iPhone
ha ha 10 yes
there you go we've got a show up top
I've gotta show love to everyone so
sorry we couldn't get that straight
answer at the moment but we appreciate
you calling in Daniel right okay all
right thank you thank you thank you very
much okay let's take another one here
and another one look I'm gonna give some
love back to Ray because I think this is
the Ray where the call dropped off ray
are you there my man yeah yeah it's me
I'm back yeah
so the pixel you were asking you gonna
ask me if if I were buy the new pixel
but I don't think it's enough of an
upgrade from the first pixel to tell you
the truth
I'll probably uh probably just end up by
the the iPhone 10 I mean I got an iPhone
and a pixel right now so I'll press
update my iPhone you know what that's a
great point because what we need to
another you what we talked about is the
fact that pretty much all the software
rolling out is going to be just fine on
the pixel so you're not really losing
those features other than the actual
camera hardware you know you'll that and
they you know what they didn't I don't
believe they talked about the processor
but early rumors had said that they were
using the same processor I believe was
the Snapdragon 835 it was a 35 year
right there I think the RAM that it was
yeah it was using the same one so that
if that was the case again sorry we
don't have this all confirmed cuz we
just got in the keynote that would
completely support your point of like
you know what I'll just hold on for this
pixel and maybe wait for the next one
unless you really want the you know the
bigger batter screen on the pixel XL and
you haven't been and you didn't get that
but feature wise it's pretty balmy you
just don't want a headphone jack I mean
that's like yeah phone jack but it's the
one they're going to translate a little
bit to the Google Translate um because I
use that a lot over this last year um
the the pixel buds could you do the same
thing with any wireless headsets besides
just like when you said swipe did you
mean could you use the translate feature
with any other phone is that what you're
trying to say just any other any any
other set of wireless head headphones
could you use the translate feature I
mean it exactly because like right now
you can just pull up you can pull out
your phone and go into conversation mode
and you just talk in English say you're
translating in Spanish and you'll
automatically do that it's been doing
that for a year already correct from
what I gather they wouldn't have shown
it off like that unless it was specific
to the buds yeah and the way the way it
was real-time like and the other thing
that you notice he had the phone in her
hand too just to indicate that you had
it can't this be separated like that but
yeah
um that's a good question it is is it as
it is a good question yeah could you
could you deal with any headphones yeah
I don't I don't know we don't know we
don't know we don't know yeah we know
even though we don't know what you don't
know so all right right thanks so much
for calling buddy appreciate we got you
back you know when it drops like that
yeah we got you back so alright have a
great day
cool appreciate it you thank you thank
you okay let's go with one um let's go
with one more call I think these are I
think these are my boys Calvin and
Anthony are you all there these are the
brother brothers that like then they
they want to buy teach I'm telling you
guys I don't know why you aren't doing a
podcast yet I'm waiting for it I'm
waiting for that's what I'm talking
about I'm serious man I got nothing but
love for you guys what do you guys want
to talk about today Thank You Man you
know what Excel was going to touch on
the Google Translate as well as as my
man just said wondering if you know you
could either which is those or some
other headphones but it looks like I
just touched on that but other than that
was gonna say the Google home max is man
a lot more impressive as you guys know
I'm a word Apple fan but man bad that
blows the little home part out of the
water that's what I'm saying like I you
know I was although the home pot is
higher than I'd want I was excited to
try it and when I saw that Google home
max I'm like dude that's the one to get
that's how I fell now I'm wondering if
it's so notes is gonna kind of good
because you know just bad it was Alexa
into their products and I love the way
thrown up speakers sound but it would be
interesting to see this go up against
Ted and what's on also you know doing
the teacher to try to incorporate you
know assistance into their speakers as
well yeah yeah you know well well
obviously what makes this all fun as all
these companies are putting out their
products that go head-to-head we will
you know will Matt will match him up
boys it was that Calvin talking was that
Anthony talking no it going okay he's in
the background listening right now does
Anthony want to say something or you're
just gonna own this call you know what
I'm gonna call you don't get the perfect
[Laughter]
wait I understand that understand that
work a prime time one of us talks a lot
anyways that's cool is there any other
stuff that you liked oh you know what um
wasn't I like the pickle book the pickle
book was good Anthony we're in luck to
fix the book um the the pixels the phone
I wasn't too impressed with but other
than that everything else was just
Connor
seems good do you know develop your
concerns with some of it though I mean
that's a thing that's what I'm going to
ask you yes the privacy yeah so so with
the whole recognizing Oh like you're
adorable and everything in a recognizer
and who comes up and stuff like that
does that does that require the Google
accounts for you to store the
information and odor so what's
interesting is that nest right Google
owns nest or alphabet artist formerly
known as Google owns nest they released
all those products but that facial
recognition is actually more built-in
with nest I just think that they've
added whether you have a Google phone or
not but I think they've just added those
hooks because it's Google and nest
together or maybe it pulls tighter from
your actual contact list on your phone
instead of just living on its own
separate app a nest app with faces on it
so I don't you know again we don't know
exactly I was like but that has to be
they just kind of built that specific
hook because they both are run by the
same parent company and that brings I
mean the privacy thing is something they
had a little throwaway moment earlier
there wasn't specifically with the nest
but with the actual pixel to phone and
they're saying oh it will listen and you
can basically do you hear the music and
identify the song but they were saying
it does it all on device and they
emphasize they said the P word privacy
and I wish he had gone more into that
because I'm one because that's always
been the concern with the Google stuff
is hey they have everything about me
they have my pictures they have now a
camera that's filming me constantly they
have my phone and now that pixel book
and then you combine that with all the
nest products it is they have a lot of
information about you there and our good
friends at Apple
doubt it the other way where all that
stuff left on defy seeing the way that's
encrypted and stuff but that's something
I would have liked to hear google talk a
bit more about especially since we're
getting a lot of video and photos of our
faces their loved ones well you know
that and look at what their google lens
platform can already do and yeah you
know that it's weird because with Google
right you you choose to buy into their
system know almost knowing that they
know more about me than almost any other
company
yeah like am I gonna be like a hold up
and take a picture of you or they have
like your LinkedIn account pop-up and
like your baggage you will your criminal
record you know like I already do but
still that's like I think that's that's
insane cuz we are entering Minority
Report and a bit like that future that's
exciting when you saw it on the the
Buddhist temple that was really that was
really quick then you sitting there like
man and my goodness be a hold up like a
picture of this house and be like you
don't want to live here there was a
murder here it's like okay that's no I
will I will I will confess I do have a
jaywalking violation but it was actually
for riding my bicycle on the freeway to
go to the comic book store when I was in
eighth grade to retrieve my comics they
didn't have an actual violation for us
so they gave us a jaywalking one I lived
to see the next day my parents are
really mad that I did that but I did it
I'm a rebel yo I'm a rebel Google has a
long rap sheet on you Abed yeah yeah so
you know I it's to your point about the
privacy thing I don't know how much they
typically they like just drop two
sentences in the keynote about like this
is private or this is only on when blank
blank blank and then they just kind of
leave it at that and that's like they
said that there was an indicator light
so you know it's on but I mean people
can hack that I'm sure turned that
indicator light off so Calv killing what
phone are you on right now right now so
Dave we're gonna upgrade oh you're gonna
go tan tan tan yeah we'll see we'll see
who wins out that pre-order pre-order
contest like I think it's gonna be a
beast yeah we talked about that I think
it is and I don't get more I'm gonna be
sick
well then Anthony can take over then
Anthony can call in and you can be in
the background
exactly well the question is what color
are you getting I'm gonna get the space
whatever variation of black they charted
whatever the black color is whatever
that whatever fun name they put on it so
all right hey boys I just want to say
thanks for calling we appreciate it all
right thank you all right cool take it
easy we'll talk to you guys soon
I think let's just wrap things up here
because we've got we've got actual where
other work to do yeah and so we
appreciate everyone that came to hang
out with this I'm sorry we couldn't get
out all the phone lines but you guys and
gals are awesome for hanging with us so
remember you can stick with us on
cnet.com we will have other follow-ups
first looks in-depth reviews write-ups
opinion pieces you name it we got it so
he owes yes patrick thanks for hanging
buddy hey thanks for having always a
pleasure my man mr. Beecham running the
show like a champ with all eight arms
yeah that's gonna do it for this show oh
who knows there might be another Apple
event by the end of the year there might
they haven't actually dropped the whole
Bob but they should be shaking in their
boots after they saw that Google home
