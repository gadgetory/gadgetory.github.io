color-changing smart LED to look at
today the lifx bulb this is an LED that
we saw on Kickstarter back in 2012 it
asked for $100,000 from its backers and
it raised over 1.3 million dollars by
the campaign's end so a lot of interest
in this bulb about a year later in 2013
it started shipping to backers and now
in 2014 it is open for sale so you can
get this bulb right now for $99 but is
it worth it compared to other options
like the lumen LED or the Philips hue
LEDs well this is a very bright bulb
it's a 75 watt replacement that puts out
over a thousand lumens of light at full
brightness using 17 watts of power so
it's efficient it's a good LED and it's
very bright one thing that I really like
about this bulb is that it puts that
extra brightness to really good use in
terms of color what it does is it will
add those white LEDs that are typically
used for the natural tones the
incandescent yellow and white light it
adds that on top of the color light at
the top of the spectrum so you can get
pure saturated green light but then you
keep on dimming up and then you get
those white LEDs added on top of it and
you'll get a whitish light tinted with
green and that's a little more practical
a little more natural colored light the
lifx bulb also features a dedicated
spectrum of natural incandescent style
tones you get yellow light white light
hot blue light like the lamp behind me
whatever you want you can replicate with
lifx so we've talked a bit about this
bulb in terms of how well it produces
light but what about the smarts what
about the extra oomph that you expect
from a smart LED well if you look at the
lifx
app the color selector is this kind of
gradiated wheel and I like this a lot
more than the spectrum you get from
Philips hue or taboo with the lifx app
you just spin that wheel you can tap you
can drag it exactly where you want it
you can see what you're doing it's a lot
more precise it's a lot easier I'm a big
fan of it I've got to say though when it
comes to smarts I find this bulb a
little bit disappointing in its current
state it doesn't yet have basic
scheduling in the app you can't have it
come on and off at certain times you can
havoc come on at sunset very basic
things that smart lights should offer
you right at the onset that said this is
a young bulb it hasn't been that nearly
as long as Philips hue and that bulbs
got a head start right so it's been out
for a while it's got IFFT integration
now
with smart things that's the type of
stuff that I can see in this bulbs
future so it's got potential and it's
got an open API so you've got developers
doing cool things like developing a
double tap gesture for the phone that
you can install to turn it on and off or
even developing games that'll work with
the lifx and change dynamically as you
blow things up and go from night to day
so in spite of the fact that this bulb
has been in development for a pretty
long time it still feels a little bit
early to me the features that you want
in a smart bulb just aren't quite there
yet but I expect that they'll get there
but if you really like the
color-changing capabilities and you want
a brighter bulb in that field this is
about as good as it gets for seeing that
I'm right crist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
