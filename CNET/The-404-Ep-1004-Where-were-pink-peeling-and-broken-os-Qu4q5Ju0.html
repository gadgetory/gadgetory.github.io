a lot of changes in our lives today

in the sun and yeah your body isn't
always used to it yeah but when you put
on SPF 95 nicely return wider than
before you left ok I came back from the
Dominican Republic today but i'm i'm not
completely as pale as i was when i left

it's brady i'm i'm hoping at myself
right now on the monitor it i'm as white
as ever yeah and we actually darken you
up for the cactus what the f is going i
cannot get a tan for the life we did a
lot of sunscreen on to protect yourself
i did cuz that's what a smart very pasty
person does you little just put white
paint on your face so today the video is
not showing up oh there it is his phone
that's okay anyway Joey cominsky is here
to help us out uh Joe you actually did
get a tan you just came back from a jump

take off the Hat so we could see your
sunglasses yeah I want to see that
raccoon look at that that's awesome
that's ridiculous look like Kate oh
right now that's cool Thank You masked
man so you went on disney cruise right
yeah when I went to take my son on a
cruise for his fourth birthday was on
him his mother and myself we hit st. we
we actually docked in st. Maarten on his
birthday yeah then we went to st. Thomas
and then we went to cast away key
Disney's private island he owns in I
didn't know this either while you're
talking about your experience Oh show
some pictures of you look at justin is
on my facebook pimping out my son and
daddy larrikin alright cool yeah that
was actually a castaway key that's
Disney's private island which is really
nice I think I enjoyed that island the
most just because it was only you know
the people from the cruise ship on there
and the crew members so you didn't
really didn't take any money with you
you can use your key to the world
which is a card to give you to get in
your room to make any purchases on the
island they gave you a pet donkey hey oh
the donkey was actually in st. Thomas
the funny thing is you know the doggy's
name is lady gaga hahaha well I'm pretty
sure the guys change the doggy's name
according to who sits on it but my son
didn't want to sit on the donkey Oh
picture up action yeah it's right here
some didn't want to sit on the dock you
day that's that's my son Jordan I don't
blame his mother terrified I don't blame
I don't want to sit on no donkey yeah
the doctor's name was Lady gaga I'm sure
maybe in the 80s the donkey looks pretty
old it was Madonna right just a guess
okay from what I hear that guy's been
bringing a mule up there free for years
oh good I don't know man that's right
over that's over at magens bay that's
actually st. Thomas debts that's mom and
son and hammock on castaway key so
assume this is what you guys just did
the entire time right like oh god it was
really nice was on on his birthday
februari 28th the evening they had
pirate tonight I didn't put those photos
up yet but everyone dressed up as
pirates I kind of went lazy I put my hat
to the back and wore an eye patch with
an earring but my son was dressed as
Captain Hook his mom painted a mustache
on him right right and they had a deck
party with the Pirates of the Caribbean
then Mickey he he like he like um like
he cabled down right and he said I
promised you guys a party and that's
what I'm gonna give you and they played
I'm holding on for a hero and just
started blasting fireworks everywhere
this is so beautiful look like all the
character like I think this is a stitch
right from lilo and Stitch even stitch
here dressed up as a pirate that's
adorable and my son left with a stage he
was like daddy I want I'm slowly came
back no no no such a little holiday and
and since we have a kid with one of
these guys I think he's watch lilo and
Stitch at least four times oh yeah
alright so that's what your kid did what
about you do you get to enjoy anything
on these sort of things you know what it
looks like the worst thing I could ever
be the funny thing is that going into
the trip we didn't want to like leave
him with people we didn't know we were
very like you know it's his birthday we
want to spend time with him but they sat
us at a table with his family was a
mother daughter and her daughter so
grandma daughter
the daughter just happened to be my
son's age so we had a table for six they
were both four years old they got along
so well that's all that they have a kids
club and it's really it's really
high-tech what they do is they give the
kiddies little bracelet yeah they scan
the kids when they come in there's no
way out okay it's no way I mean like you
without passing like a counselor right
and there multiple counselors in the
room and Mickey pays visits or the room
interview yeah ok you can't leave that
room without your key to the world card
I can't leave you have to have the key
to the world car the chef ganda child's
bracelet and a verbal password what what
a good pass well there was a verbal
password they scanned your key card and
ok send your child's braced right so
there's no way and everything they bring
up they have facial recognition to it's
like Hello if they took photos of you on
the ship that you didn't have to give
your room card that facial recognition
huh and your pictures were in the
database that's cool so that's what made
it a little more trusting so she would
leave him with them occasionally maybe
go to the commie shadow and I would go
back to the room and get some sleep
because at dinner time I'd probably have
like two entrees yeah my kid oh yeah I
have a copy of every I was there really
nice to host a really nice to me I asked
for a copy of all the menus from each
right there is you want evidence well I
have all the menus because like some of
the drinks are really great ya know cuz
i don't i don't get drunk around my son
but you know your unit you gotta have 11
you got it up yeah had a couple drinks
it was it was it was amazing it was
beautiful I mean it does not his mom and
aren't even together and it she laughed
at my jokes yeah everyone everyone had
fun she sounds like a sweet yeah ah
that's awesome man cuz there's a lot of
you know I went on a cruise a couple
years ago I didn't really have a good
time yeah knows most of eating adventure
median and you right exactly i ate so
much though and that was definitely the
highlight yeah sure i'm 230 pounds right
now yeah before I left I was like 222
yeah the messed-up thing on cruise ships
is always the midnight buffet did you
guys have that where you just have to
wake up in the middle of night good well
this was the problem during dinner time
Jordan never wanted to eat because he
wanted to play right keeping him to the
table yeah so by the time we get back to
the room like eleven o'clock during it's
time for bed I want Froot Loops mmm and
that was another great thing in the room
there is fruit loop yeah well you can
get room service 24 hours that's the
best yes
but he he would be so awake when we get
the room because I since the Disney
cruise all the Pixar movies are on like
they're showing for Captain America for
the adulterer for the older kids then
they have like bald lilo and stitch or
III and there is a movie theater on the
ship that seats like 200 216 and there's
a theater there was an actual theater
that we went we saw like three Broadway
like shows on the ship right which were
great they were great was like villains
um there was a Cinderella story where
they changed it where Cinderella didn't
the slipper kind of song sounds like you
enjoyed this better than Joey I know we
watch I mean living through him yes I
watched him have a ball and he saw like
his favorite guy he literally tackled
Donnell but Donna was saying goodbye to
one kidney jordans return to go up cuz
it's a lot easier to take photographs on
the cruise course they scatter the
characters along the cruise he runs up
as damn Donald turns around he knocks
dawdle it was the funniest thing he's
poor Donald Duck yeah call it again
everybody just like it was at school
Marie what sounds like you'll be going
on another Disney cruise it was a lot of
winter without good with a George well
my son's mother was on my key card yea
which was linked to my debit card no the
good thing is everything is paid for
that thing is everything is paid for i'm
seriously those are be cleaning i'll be
having ramen noodles for lunch man i was
i was in dominican republic for four
days yeah and I mean I had a bless I was
there for a wedding there's a lot of fun
you were telling me before the show
started that you somehow were is able
you were able to conquer your fear of
flying yeah I'm talk about this on the
show before every time you go to Las
Vegas in January for CES you're always I
just lose it 10 quaaludes and like well
I wouldn't for quaaludes yeah let's
bring it down to reality but no like I
don't know how you're able to do this
flight from here to the dr with it's not
that far it's only three and a half
hours so that's not the length isn't a
problem I don't know I just sort of i'm
able to rise above and now right it's
and it's because of how much I've
traveling I've done through work hmm for
sure ya couldn't I didn't take any drugs
this time either look at you mind over
matter I I'm telling you man it's a
powerful organ I'll be there did you
ever drink on the ship on the flight no
I didn't even have a drink I just give
me a PS Vita and I'm okay now what you
doing the whole time up for a little bit
I
the little going out there cuz it was
really early anyway so as I'm out there
it's a great a lot of fun it was a
wedding i saw i got to hang out with all
my high school buddies what were they
for dr punta cana nice yeah real nice uh
we're at the Iberostar resorts a really
nice all inclusive and uh you know the
best part about is like everyone had you
know come to three o'clock it's like
pool bar time right yeah so I don't know
what it is whenever I'm at some sort of
tropical locale I need to have like the
fruity tropical drink you know anything
like what things you would normally not
have I need something like a cherry and
umbrella right just so I feel you know
and it's so odd I'm so free so not you
too it's I night in colorful yeah just
came in here I am just like you know I i
I'd never take a hat in song this is off
because i just need constant shade in
some capacity even when i'm in the pool
yeah again everything I am sure every
shower curtain but just you know just
the heads so I can cave in the pool bar
is definitely the best park is
everyone's getting a little drunk and my
first drink is always like a piña
colada you need that beautiful exactly
so i order and that was like so for four
days straight get me a pinochle i had
like maybe two or three before I switch
to hear the only serve Presidente beer
yeah that's all they serve in terms of
beer they have it here I'm sure I know
I've had it here but there it flows like
water you drink the water so drinking
this pina colada and I'm just like
housing I'm just like BAM knocking him
back yeah and you know I couldn't I
wasn't really paying attention to
whether or not I was drunk or whatever
so the last day I go up and I'm like
pina colada me and the bartender is like
would you like alcohol in it and I go
yeah the virgin pina coladas I was like
whoa i think you mean they don't they're
not mixed with alcohol to begin with
he's like no they're not what so i was
reading this whole time my buddy Jerry
thank you yeah it's unbeliev you feel
like psychosomatic Lee drew I didn't in
that we done you were like a tough guy
right now kick these back no problem I
kept saying in my dream my Kryptonian
metabolism based I mean they're all
really sweet really sweet so I was just
like man it's a great job at disguising
this out oh hey Gus whole frickin time I
mean don't get me wrong i switch to beer
after one or two of them yeah it was
like really i've been drinking virgin
piña guess where there are three
dollars oh it's all inclusive so I
didn't I think that kind of happened to
these should I what we left out of that
is really the born by odd and the only
reason why I really grabbed it cuz it
came in a Disney cruise glass yeah I'm
like would you like sure give me 10
that's nothing the arm the horn goes
huge like that when you wish upon a star
so like I'm sorry I would jump off this
boat but you would love it you a new job
Jeff dresses I don't and Disney know
what you would love it and such a
promise by the way Jeff your friends are
actually in the chat room right now
young ones in there yeah and I you say
that you were talking about how this was
the best pina colada you did to quote
right now no no regular bear Osito
Jarrett the funniest part though was and
then one of the bartenders comes up and
she kept calling me a baby yes I cuz I
cuz I guess they spoke amongst
themselves and were like oh he's been
getting pinochle alcohol and then she
kept calling me a baby in Spanish I
don't like I'm not a baby I my beer I
don't say baby its pinnacle you like me
no I was like poquito some like that
ever it is I'm just like I'm not a bit
you know I know like maybe seven and a
half percent of the Spanish right so I'm
like I know I know sort of saved Thank
You they've my new boo breeze I was just
trying to say something back there just
like and then you know I'm much better
hearing and understanding Spanish to
English and she kept saying hey there
little baby huh El Nino kept saying
she's like a bikini oh yeah she's like
oh don't have too much alcohol you know
shut up make it fun of me for having
virgin pina colada it was you got any
fun didn't get drunk you didn't know
what I drunk when he didn't get a tan
yeah that's clear definitely I was
drinking a lot but I did not get a 10 at
all but you know you keep lathering up
you got a man right I've had some way
too many bad experiences with some
getting sunburned and then the
subsequent blisters that then form from
stuff like that it is not a pretty sight
you do not want to be around me when i'm
sunburned yeah it's among the worst
things that can I don't think Joey or I
know what a sunburn that bad even feels
I've experienced one like I said like
Annie in like the 80s or nine right back
in the days 30 years ago yeah i mean
when i was a kid it would happen to me
and it's like it's like having the most
sensitive sandpaper rubbed on your back
constantly right right because it's like
getting tattooed right like dragging
around much more over a sunburn so much
i would rather get tattooed on my yes
that's that's me drinking a real drink
at magens bay beach lasse Thomas that is
a rum punch and he spiked it lovely for
me you sure that was alcoholic dude I
watched them you made mind separate
because I was tipping more than everyone
else I just did you not see my facebook
post I get love everywhere from the
bartender did yeah thnkx other so
embarrassed I was so bad yes I turned
red but not from the Sun was so
humiliating yeah and like you should as
my jaw literally hit the pool drinking
just shoot her all your friends knew
this before how they then it cuz I'm
like you know it's funny like eventually
me probably have been like dude can you
put more alcohol yeah that'd probably be
me well at least you weren't trying to
fake it by acting drunk right and that
one out of idiot oh my god you look
really bad yeah because I don't do crap
like right right keep it real well I
suppose you've gotten a sugar rush if
people thought you were drunk yeah I
don't know it wasn't like that all I
know is that when you drink in a pool
yeah you know once the alcohol started
flowing it's a lot different it's a much
different experience than being drunk
outside of right because you just you
just pee right in the balls yeah that's
not what I was alluding oh that reminds
me of hey would you said did you pee at
the pool yeah upd walnut no on the
cruise ship yeah they have a Mickey pool
hmm and it's the the the main area is
Mickey's head and the tooth there's two
smaller pools which or his ears okay so
Jordan it's in the evening so the pool
is not crowded is my son and this is the
girl that he met on the cruise and two
other kids and he calls me he goes into
one to Mickey series he goes daddy I
eating the pool yeah and I go at least
you're nice enough to move away from
everybody what you did it yeah I said
now stop yelling it out your daddy the
port step one is doing in step two is
getting quiet about right yeah I don't
want to tell them don't say but I think
okay okay daddy is okay so you're latina
pool is don't talk about it it's
terrible at least they didn't have that
died you know some pools have a died
when you know I've seen it roanoke like
a grown-up yeah exactly like that yeah
it's a real thing but fig iodine but why
do that like will embarrass and
humiliate people that you break this
code of moral because once I mean first
of everybody does it no that's not true
everybody doesn't do I mean I did it I
don't do that I I used to go to the ice
to be a member of the y and I've and
when I was younger I go to summer camp
yeah I got admit but one time it was
crazy and I couldn't believe this dad
everyone get out of the pool what
everyone get on the pool and they said
who defecated oh you don't I do not see
someone underwater blow me you don't do
number two in the pool that sounds like
that's like keep that Hattie Jack so I
don't think there's much closer quarters
into jacuzzi leave me I think that's
something save for maybe the bathroom I
don't know shall we um we got to take a
break when we come back we'll move away
from the conversations always have to
degrade to this time it's like s I'm the
anchor that draws you in yeah I don't
know what it is either way we'll get
away from it and get into some stories
of the day right after this to ground
this is the 404 mr effers the show where
we all sing song
you
welcome back to the 404 oh man all this
flying sons just get me home real
positive well you guys must feel great
because you just came back from tropical
places meanwhile I was in New York
suffering was cold yeah war the work the
weather wasn't that bad that's actually
really what it was a bit like it wasn't
bad right now I was fine it was like 40
s the entire time i heard it was like 60
when i came back side yeah i heard a lot
about our tornadoes in the midwest he
was like a buttload of tour know thats
right yeah that happened on friday
unbelievable yeah terrible about that
terrifying how's the dominican republic
a tornado's it rained for four minute
rain pinochle i was it the brain virgins
so it would seem to chat room blames me
for the feed because they said seeing
that needs at least a one minute buffer
yeah the filter my job we're not gonna
worry about the life we're gonna
concentrate on doing the show and we're
gonna concentrate on a couple stories
that are making headlines today yeah
well okay so you guys Jeff we haven't
done a show in a while but this story
came out on friday and i still want to
talk about it because i feel like it's
something you would personally be
invested in and when i first read this i
just thought of you immediately this is
a gun that japanese researchers had
developed that basically shuts people up
what I know people tame that thing at me
yeah I would out 82 it you would you
guys would shoot you point blank tell me
about this what is this I want one this
is really cool you first or Ackman who
would you shoot for you first definitely
i'll shoot you with this gun I'd way to
really got on a grenade wait for the
hahahahaha and load up the Glock for
hide and wait for the double barrel how
does this work because I need one right
now alright so this uses a effect that
psychologists call delayed auditory
feedback then daf acronym is basically
on it's like a sound wave so this this
machine project sound waves back at
people yeah but it basically records
what they say using it a microphone
attached to the gun right and then it
projects that exact tone right back
who's saying it yeah what
kind of confuses people so like I don't
know if you've ever liked Jeff you and
I've experiences before like through the
mixer something there's like immediate
echo like an echo even a cell phone
sometimes yeah echoes like on cellphones
happens in like it has left have a
second that's weird right like you just
stop talking because you don't like the
sound of something being repeated x rays
I feel like your brain just sort of
farts out you know you yes hearing what
you're saying right yet right it's like
a dog who hears a weird sound you're
like right it gives not enough time
passes between what you say and it being
repeated back to write like what what
we're talking about that's so cool so
they're exploiting that sort of like
brain defect or right and and make using
it to shut you up dr. Alliant but a
physical thing about it but that's
that's no different than when you say
something and I repeat what you say and
it drives a person crazy right but I
don't but the thing is is that this is
repeating it back so fast it's not
affecting me yeah it's not affecting me
good I'm doing a good job right cuz
you're not a computer microphone the
thing is is that the wife's island peaks
it back so quickly that it's if there's
a there's a small buffer zone for this
effect to occur I feel it right yeah
it's probably like half a second
whatever it any more than that right not
be so cool so is this something that is
uh is going to be used by like authority
figures or yeah you know like they're
saying that it can be used if you're in
like an assembly environment someone's
talking on their cell phone or something
but like see my problem with this is
that the the directional microphone it
projects the speaker back at you so it's
still making a noise you know it's not
like a silent thing where it's just
shutting you up like if you're trying to
silence an environment this is just
gonna create more noise back right I
think it'd be cool if you just put him
to sleep that's a real gun ok no no not
like not to sleep like like with the
fishes but I'm like you know yeah like
nap time right you just wanted to put
like a Taser or something because I
could phasers on stun you know phases on
shut the hell up yeah I would love to
take this down to occupy wall street
right like I'm they're saying that this
could be used in situations like that
drive controlling this image analysis
seem very fair no it doesn't I think
duct tape works a lot better yeah I'm
sure someone can make their own shut up
gun to ya
doesn't seem that hard that'd be cool
yeah that'd be cool a lot of microphone
that's all that's it this is actually
linked to another story that I wanted to
ask you guys about how you feel about
this jury about this guy in Philadelphia
that's been blocking people's cell
phones on the septa bus no this is kind
of cool so I guess he this guy went
online and he bought one of these
cellphone jammers right and these are
he's like a vigilante and he basically
bought this device that creates a cell
phone dead zone around a closed
perimeter cool he got sick of people
using hit their cell phones and talking
loudly on the bus he I like what every
morning she brought it on the bus and
he's just been shutting people up but it
turns out using these things is illegal
because you know police scanners your
radios and stuff use those same
frequencies so it doesn't just block out
cell signals again radio and and
everything Zack Wow deportable dead zone
that's pretty cool I don't know what do
you guys think about that is everything
I like if you saw this guy get on the
train or whatever any blocked yourself
on carpool buddy pissed I'd be pissed
too i'd be like what the hell you think
you're doing sir uh was he did he have
it out it was just like shaking into
people was he just like you know keeping
it on his back but I you know but in all
fairness it it depends on the person
like me if I'm on the bus I unless it's
important i'm usually whispering sure
right and i'll cut the call short it's
the people that don't know to cut the
show cut the call short right and who
don't not a lower their voice yeah no
yeah i'll pick up that cream for you i
don't want to hear this right turn it
down and then they're making another
call and their detects again they're
calling it yeah well you know the worse
is the ones are like playing music from
their phone allowed ah without even
headphones right there's a lot of
speakers plug some head you can't afford
headphones didn't you got issues don't
sit on the train or whatever playing
your music allowed I don't want to hear
that crap right people who do that
really shouldn't be allowed to like vote
yes something well you know she allowed
to reproduce it should be allowed to
create people think it's a
responsibility of the crowd around them
yeah you stop that from happening like
the other day I was on the train and
someone was playing music at their
headphones really loudly and this guy
everyone wanted to say something but no
digs they're afraid this guy bends down
right in front of where she was sitting
gets in her face in his like like us but
she was like I can have to listen to
that effing music the entire time frame
it was great you know that something
everybody wanted
a-and I felt like people wanted to apply
this man and she did it she turned it
down of course that's all it took was
one notice you have some people that
will actually comply they will turn it
out and you have them some people that
just do it because they want to
instigate right fun whilst I know some
people actually they have a bad day and
like I don't care they're gonna listen
to my stuff I want to make myself death
yes I ever you ever see like that that
the kings of comedy skit with Cedric the
Entertainer you go there you know
there's we you know like one group of
people like we hope our seats are there
yeah yeah like the the thug person we
wish i wish someone would be sitting in
my seat like you have that kind of
mentality when I wish somebody would
tell me to turn it down that's DAC with
it you know any other like I hope they
don't tell me turn is down i diss my
favorite song I'll turn it down it's
fall today is Jimmy Iovine and monster
creating headphones that leak so much
Saturday they turned up a little bit of
a leak they do leak intentionally yeah I
didn't leak intention that's what they
said i don't know they were covering
their said that monster i asked them
this person shows up his monsters
supposed to go F themselves it I mean
please explain it you you were talking
about like a marketing what I at one
point I go into like the the launch of
the HP beats edition laptop you guys
this is I'm we need to write the
headphones you're listening to right
headphones out right now they leak like
no tomorrow on as a matter of fact as a
matter of fact when i'm on the train I
turn them down but when I come in the
lobby to work every day I turn it up
because I enjoy getting a spark out of
Eugene cuz some of the songs on plays
like you I like that song out of gaza
doorman and he's constantly telling me
I'm gonna go deaf I'm like no my eyes
are going my hearing is perfect okay I
don't know man they intentionally should
it work Justin right to so is that I'm
gonna write yes that sounds like a great
story to me I can't really I mean when
you're the headphone guy to know how to
tell you I food I knew that they clearly
do leaks out cuz i've tested them before
but I didn't know as an intentional
engineering well you know you know the
brothers they like to rest it on this
the shoulders Alyssa to it well that's
different if you like any headphone that
you have around your shoulders and
blasting music at it but you're saying
when they're on your head they legal
yeah that's not baby going I mean okay
what's next after this they're just
gonna put speakers on the outside of the
headphones in speaker out species like
the dickhead engineering
know what I mean if you don't the pros
the pros have two headphone jacks right
so somebody else could plug into your
headphones I like as well that so maybe
so maybe that was their way of rail no
no no no sounds like I'm not letting you
off the hook no that is not why they did
that I wonder if they're intentionally
creating a gap see look Joe I mean
you're wearing a hat but you know like
up by your temples i'm wondering if they
intentionally create a gap right there
to allow sound to come out I don't know
there's a chance they need to go they
say they sit snug on my ears like I
think they just leave because I think
they're just so thinly insulated I hear
correctly this is just like blast we're
gonna break it and yeah this aggression
will not stand we will break the crap
out of this story right yeah blow this
whole I don't want my monster that's
terrible wow so pissed it here I hope
it's not true they said it was an
intentional I wish I remember that this
is a long time ago this is like when I'm
when the beats laptop first came out
we're like what that's like a couple
years now for her now yeah so this upon
that release and I had asked one of the
people there now could he have been
misinformed or just been saying that the
cover up a possible design flaw and then
I hope then I hope that's better that's
poor my hope they're lying yeah I hope
they're lying we're gonna do some
investigators everybody I mean these
these by far elite the worst of any
headphones I've ever that's unacceptable
yeah don't do yet I mean you we could do
it in room separate I can plug my phones
into a my iPad and play something if not
examine that's not surprising yeah the
intentional thing that pisses me off I'm
bump it I'm real pissed we're gonna
we're gonna fix this oh you pick if
you're gonna fix something critics fix
the fact that you know because you close
them so much yeah yeah really oh yeah
I've told this story before as if you
guys didn't know this already I have a
couple screws loose yeah literally if
you got a big head like Joey or myself
your beat your Dre no they're not even
excel if you guys are not watching the
video right now Joe is talking about how
there are four screws that hold the head
band together to the ear cups yeah and
you were tell me the other day that they
just fell out yeah I don't know where
just because you fold a costly folding
but that's the intended use though
you're supposed to be able to fold the
course you can't handle that over your
phone call from ansa with some screws in
the mail that's all I'm saying all right
those not your first pair of monsters in
my second
yeah my second I'm the one thing I one
thing I will give them credit for what I
I notified them i called him up yeah I
didn't have to use my seen that name I
went under just Joseph Kavinsky of it
I'd have to try to do any manipulation
to call it PR people I simply said my
headphones cuz they uh they had actually
cracked my first one right they'd crack
tom yeah of course right like all
original headphone and and I to on I'd
gone back to them and they'd and and it
gave me an RMA number and they sent them
back to me that's not that's not okay
though that's how it should be a court
when I what I'm just saying that they
didn't they you know it was brand new in
the box i think you had a second pair as
well they said right brand new in the
box so in terms of supporting their
product there or defective parts of
their products they have no problem
still I should happen in the first place
is why I mean I can ask you tell you
I've had a number of headphones even
Sony's the old md ours and when you'd
work out with them right the headphones
would be fine hmm but when you perspire
or you jog constantly with them and they
were the idea headphones arose because
they wrapped it on the back your head
yeah they were the in-ear buds the
housing would fray cause was so soft so
the wire would be exposed so I mean I've
seen you electrocute yourself and then
in the first generation v moda vibe
duo's when they came out for the iphone
that long stem because it was a
submerged said said they constantly got
shorts i went through a number of those
i mean i find flaws you go through
everything so I find the flaws of a lot
of advil breath the whole Mon cert fault
they're not the only one right like I
got you have and I have to say the
biggest genius idea for headphones and
Annie's headphone is the fact that you
can remove the wire have because they're
all hilarious right for forgetting a
short and the thing I'm a plug meta info
now for a second monsters have a
straight headphone jack and I went
through a few of them and now they have
the l-shaped one right actually
reinforces that resident used to go
straight it causes that pole they do
adjust all right still does not excuse
the fact that they intentionally
engineered the head to ignore the crab I
only been doing on page Georgia dollars
from on I got him I got a whole set that
craps not gonna stand yeah I want to
talk about the next iPad for the last
couple of minutes before we get out of
here talk about it talk about gonna call
the ipad HD it's coming out tomorrow
it's going to you think it will be
available tomorrow now uh supposedly we
are pretty much 99% sure it's called the
ipad HD obviously because it's going to
have the first ipad with a full legit HD
screen that enough to make you want to
budge off your current one not yet uh
four cores maybe quad-core gotta check
battery life we've got to see the
battery life with that and then 4G LTE
or gorilla glass maybe I was reading
something about that this boy you don't
know what does a cow make oh boo what
what do you think I mean is it enough i
don't know I let's see what the prices I
can't see them changing the price that
be terrible yeah I'm hoping for a big
design change right not it's not gonna
look here my dealer might be like that
she was not here I am I heard it might
be a little thicker yeah for the battery
maybe possibly a little difficulty the
4g maybe the better camera in there to
the delegates took a better they have to
the cameras horrible yeah cameras p
scratton have never taken one photo with
my opinon takes like he goes into the
photo he takes like those crazy x-ray
pictures of themselves yeah and I mixed
op wasting space because just keep
hitting the button like it's a fire by
my fire fire fire from like a hundred
photos of just him like stop motion
animation just moving with the right
what do you think Justin you I know you
have a touchpad right I haven't used it
in a while because it's a touch pad
right or you buy an ipad insti I
wouldn't maybe by one yeah you know what
I'm really hoping for is a bezel that
goes all the way to the edges hmm you
know like that something that I was
hoping for the ipad but you know but you
know what and I'm I think another reason
why they do that because it'd be hard to
hold because if you notice that some of
the like a new of the iOS 5 a lot of the
gestures are multi fingered so if you
already had a finger on the actual
screen is it may misinterpret your
gestures right not to mention i do have
a friend who has a verizon 3g Wi-Fi one
he dropped it on the edge mm-hmm and
it's it's the screen is fine it cracked
a little bit right here sure and I'm
sorry me turn this from it cracked a
little bit right here on the edge yeah
and the you know the aluminum bent a
little bit but as far as the rest of its
fine so I guess that's also a buffer if
you were to drop it yeah i mean i don't
know i think you make a good point about
misinterpreting touched
sures uh around the the the frame of the
device but uh I think it would look cool
and I think you could probably program
it so that you know edged gestures don't
pick up as as well as you know once
towards the center of the screen right
well let me know and also then then they
you know how do you manipulate the sale
of what color you want because now you
have the other Nestle you know get a
color but I have to say though with the
white bezel I don't actually my
fingerprints don't really show on right
fingerprints don't really show on it
when you hold the edge of it so if you
kinda just click through it it sounds
nicer what do you think smart cover
stuff too I think smart cover i'll work
on yeah they're they're making too much
money off of that to not have that
continued right i don't know i do think
the the the the hype is sort of not as
you know intense as it was for 41 and
especially to it was really bad thing i
I think it's a combination of things i
think the hype isn't so great because
the we know apples not going to make a
significant jump forward because then
they don't leave enough room to upgrade
the following year what's an annual
thing but I think also the fact that you
have a lot of steve job fans yeah and
you know rest in peace he's not going to
be presenting this device right and it
loses some ways it loses luster because
now you know you know i was asked a
question today do you think the price
will change i was like i don't think
they can afford to do that because
people don't want to see any significant
difference in the scheme of how Apple
does things right so recently after his
past right so they're gonna have to
follow a tight-knit line yeah and you
know may not even have been him who had
this impact over the past years with his
health conditions but they still want to
see the same kind of flow I was going on
when he was alive they have two days
after the passage yeah they have to
recreate the glitz and glamour of
previous keynotes and you know you can't
deny that there is something missing
from this sort of thing you know you do
you get you get Tony Robbins to present
the new iPad yeah Hey Joe I want to ask
you about this before we get out of here
sure we've been testing a lot of Apple
devices lately what do you think the
chances are that Apple might include a
Thunderbolt port on the ipad 3 you think
that's even a possibility um I don't cuz
that would I feel like would be I don't
know for me I don't know if they'll put
a Thunderbolt port because I think
they're trying to minimize the openings
on the device Brett but you'd probably
be able to find
a thunderbolt adapter like you do for
the camera adapter or the hdmi adapter
so you might have something via
Thunderbolt that connection then then
they can maybe market that or some
software update or something that may
make it backwards compatible to a
previous version I just want ipad
updates to not take seven hours I that's
what I want yeah it's unbelievable i say
no tonight well the nice thing is now
you can do it from the device now with
iOS 5 right but still it takes way too
long I get you have to plan ahead for
updating your iPad it can't just be like
oh I'll do it now if someone does
download the update you just have them
give it to you this meant up the down
everybody's up the doubtless if you have
the same device my iPad to an ipad to
share me personally anybody is looking
to buy the ipad 3 if you don't have the
2 i'd say go for the three but i think
my my scheme is i'm gonna go to 46 I
think I was skipping awaited okay man I
don't know I don't know what I'm gonna
depending on if there's something where
it's like a game changer you know I mean
where I was like man my ipad 2
officially sucks in comparison I don't
think it's gonna happen well I mean I'm
sorry to cut you off but I was gonna ask
you you've had your iPad for a while
I've noticed that my tablet use has just
gone down a lot i just don't yeah i
barely use mine anymore it's not because
it's a touchpad i was joking earlier
it's just because i'd rather just go to
my laptop and actually have real ility
to save things yeah yeah I'm with some
ways it's been we used to be my go-to
was the ipad now it's my laptop again
right right i mean i just don't think
it's replaced my laptop it has it mine
doesn't replace my laptop but I have to
say where mine has come in big is I you
know I watch like a lot of sports like
basketball right it is great for when
those redundant commercials come on just
surf the web or you read an article
where you go back yeah it's like perfect
like boom it's fun I'll just are updated
facebook like how could I turn the ball
over right you know I like it as the
back and forth and I like some of the
companion apps you know especially video
games now have a lot of companion apps
they give you a map to give you a like a
move list or whatever it is I think
that's fun to have it's also good for
you know being in bed you know just
won't not really ready to go for yes we
gonna hang out for a little bit yeah
you'll go as well HBO go and it
definitely without a doubt change the
way
I read comics comic book scam comic
books are beautiful that's what it's all
about but you know I bought a kindle for
the dr and i read more on my kindle than
i did my eye i have to say that even on
even on the cruise the ipad would be
useless on the bench it's the weather
can i been to the beach and i saw a lot
of people with their nooks and kindles
on the beach because red sunlight just
you just can't huh I didn't know that
