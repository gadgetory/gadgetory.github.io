been the top dogs when it comes to cheap
burg good handsets however the
competition in the budget arena has
never been more fierce so are the new
Moto G 4 and G 4 plus handsets still
worth your time
let's take a look the two phones are
almost identical they both have 5.5 inch
full HD screens they both bright sharp
bol and perfectly suited to your
tweeting and snapchatting they both have
capable octa-core processors as well
come with 16 or 32 gigabytes of storage
and yes you can expand that with microSD
cards even better the handsets are
water-resistant so they won't shut down
the first time you spill your pint on
them the plus gets its name from its
improved camera which has 16 megapixels
rather than 13 megapixels it has laser
assisted autofocus and a fingerprint
scanner on the front it definitely worth
the upgrade if you're a keen
Instagrammer who wants to add a bit more
security to your phone both phones run
near stock Android marshmallow making
them very easy for even Android novices
to use 3000 milliamp an hour batteries
or keep them ticking over for the better
part of a day and you can customize the
colors wildly using Motorola's online
moto maker tools both the g4 and the g4
plus come with rock-bottom prices making
them both astonishing value for money
there really is nothing else at this
price point that comes even close if you
want a great all-round phone to tackle
all of your everyday needs and you want
to keep a close eye on those pennies
over the g4 or the g4 plus is the phone
for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
