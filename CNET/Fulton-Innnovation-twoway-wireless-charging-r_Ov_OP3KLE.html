taking a first look at Fulton wireless
device to device charging now wireless
charging is already available in the
market on some windows and Android
phones and that technology lets you set
down a phone on a wireless charging pad
and your phone will begin to charge but
what Fulton is announcing this year is
to wait wireless charging so now the
chip that's in here that allows wireless
charging can not only receive power but
send it to so in this example Fulton has
put this technology in this tablet it's
been modded and when I place this phone
on the tablet the tablet will begin to
charge the phone now this technology is
available from Fulton right now but it's
going to be up to the OEMs to place it
in their phones when this technology is
placed in tablets and phones the way it
will work is you'll tell the app how
much power you want it to send the other
device then it'll stop charging when
it's given that much power and as far as
charging speed it'll give the same
amount of power you would get if you're
plugged in with a wired connection I'm
sure this is a technology that lots of
people would like to get because nobody
likes to be left alone without a charger
and a dead device from CES 2013 you've
taken a first look at Fulton's device to
device wireless charging</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
