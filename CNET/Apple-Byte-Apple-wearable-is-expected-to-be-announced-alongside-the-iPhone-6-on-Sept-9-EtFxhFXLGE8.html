to the apple byte it's all the good and
bad inside the world of Apple and the
big big news this week well according to
Rico's John paczkowski Apple will unveil
its wearable device on sep tember ninth
alongside of the next iPhone that's
right if it wasn't already the hype
machine will be at an all-time high now
recode was the first to break news of
apples September announcement just for
the iPhone a couple weeks ago and the
new wearable will predictably make use
of apples health kit fitness platform
and home kit for connected devices but
they aren't really referring to it as a
watch now some of you are saying no way
we haven't seen any i watch parts leaked
out yet but if you remember the very
first iphone was announced in january of
2007 at macworld and it didn't end up
going on sale until june of that year
that's a six-month time period and all
those rumors of a release date in 2015
could still be true we know Apple will
have some final working models to show
off but six months is a huge window of
time before it hits the supply chain and
all those leakers get a hold of it now
they definitely have other projects in
the work that we haven't seen like I
shoes and you know how I know because
they already made I socks now I'm just
curious to see how they're going to make
it stick with consumers I'm still
looking for them to give me a real
reason to care about this i watch but
the 9th is going to be a big deal I
don't know how to put this but i'm kind
of a big deal and that other device that
will be announced on the 9th it's a
something called the iphone now there's
more evidence we might finally see an
NFC chip after images of the logic board
have leaked out a mac rumors forum
member compared the NFC chip believed to
be used with its 5 millimeter by five
millimeter size and it's 32 terminals
for connecting and found the spot on the
logic board for both the 4.7 inch and
5.5 inch iPhones where he believes the
NFC chip will go now you'll notice the
middle logic board which is the iphone
5s has no such place for this chip so
we'll find out soon if Apple does
include this and makes a push to be the
true mobile wallet I've been waiting for
it might be time for the
128 gig iphone to also see the light of
day after lee schematics by geek bar
suggests apple may be preparing to
release the highest capacity storage on
an iphone that people have been begging
for the past two years an accompanying
parts supply list shows NAND flash
modules for 16 gigs 64 gigs and 128 gigs
but no 32 gig storage size also we're
still expecting the big a to drop
another announcement sometime in October
for iPads and possibly some small
upgrades to the Mac line but rumor
reports say a couple of things will have
to wait until 2015 Bluebird claims Apple
is planning to launch the long-rumored
12.9 inch iPad dubbed the ipad pro by
all of us in early 2015 after recent
rumors said the project had been put on
hold now this tech unicorn has been
talked about as far back as mid-2013 and
that thinner 12 inch macbook pro with
the retina display will launch at the
end of this year or sometime in 2015
according to digit times who like to
throw out a report here and there to
keep their name in the news so think
about this they're basically giving
themselves a one year and four month
window for a product to come out nice
guys now this is something everyone
should pay attention to if you have an
iPhone 5 that has horrible battery life
and you kept complaining about it and
everyone kept saying you're just being a
big baby you're a big baby you aren't
now Apple has initiated an iphone 5
battery replacement program to replace
the batteries of a small percentage of
iphone 5s sold between September of 2012
to January of 2013 the coop town kids
say it only affected a limited serial
number range and you can check that out
for yourself at this website but come on
Apple it's clear you've known this for
at least a year and now you're willing
to do a replacement for those same
customers who are ready to buy a new
iphone 6 because of that battery issue
that's a bad apple
and for those of you on YouTube that are
giving me a bad apple because one of our
episodes uploaded twice do you think I
have control over that I don't so bad
apples on all of you really that's mean
and hurts my feelings but I do feel
better after seeing all the great
responses from all of you that took part
in the ALS ice bucket challenge and if
you took time to donate that's great as
well so thank you to all the Apple
biters because I know and you know that
there's really so much more to this life
than all these tech toys so on that note
i'm brian Tong thanks for watching in
will see you guys next time for the
Apple by okay Brandon's around oh sweet
let's see if I can get swing copters
good haha i love this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
