that may not be the prettiest on the
block but it's got a battery that won't
let you down i'm dan ackerman and this
is the acer iconia w4 now this is a
sequel to a system called e acer iconia
w3 that i reviewed last year and i liked
it as a good early example of what you
could do in an 8-inch tablet windows 8
but it really didn't quite hit the spot
and a lot of systems that came out after
that did a lot better in terms of design
in terms of price in terms of battery
life in terms of features here with the
W 480 actually catches up on a lot of
these things it's still a little thicker
and a little heavier than a lot of these
products it's got a 1280 x 800 screen
you know pretty responsive touchscreen
even though it's got that Intel Atom
processor although really any of these
intel atom or even intel celeron smaller
windows 8 laptops hybrids and tablets
they're actually all very responsive
especially if you stick to the windows 8
I love you and the apps that are kind of
custom optimized for that what really
helps this w4 stand out is that you get
a 64 gig SSD and that's about twice as
big as what you get with a lot of the
other similar systems like this even
though they keep the price down to
around 299 which seems pretty fair to me
you've also got some reports of
connections that a lot of the other
Windows 8 tablet so you get micro or
mini versions of HDMI USB and an SD card
slot all built right in here along the
edges which makes it fairly convenient
to use although you will have to carry
around some like you know dongles and
adapters if you want to make use of
these different ports one thing that's
very different about this system is that
it's got an actual physical windows
button down here as opposed to simply
the capacitive touch button that a lot
of other tablets have for their windows
button and you use that to get between
the different apps that you're reading
or using and back to that Windows 8
Start screen so even though there's new
version is a lot better than the
original 8 inch windows Tabitha days to
put out last year it's still kind of
clunky and think it's got this weird
sort of raised lip here by the screen
that just doesn't feel right in the hand
however the battery ran for more than
eight hours on our fairly challenging
test and that's the longest battery life
we've seen from one of the current crop
of Windows 8 tablets so if you need to
carry this around at work all day is not
let you down i'm dan ackerman and that's
the acer iconia w4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
