our favorite announcements so far at CES
2015 a robot that's going to beat you at
your favorite drinking game and a dress
that you're gonna have to see to believe
and some of the people in the audience
are probably gonna run when they see it
because of arachnophobia tomorrow daily
citizen to the Internet welcome to ja
real humans are here there are ruins in
the audience welcome to tomorrow daily
the best geek talk show in the known
universe i'm your host Ashley together
to me as always the man the myth the
legend the arachnophobia a thirsty
arachnophobia guy kill anonymous hey
how's it going I noticed you got a
little little device over there I do I
do LG is sponsoring tomorrow daily this
week at CES 2015 and they let me use
this fantastical LG g3 and it's really
really fun oh wow typical Ashley sit so
behind on the times I don't know if you
noticed but they announced the LG G flex
three knots Jesus like a few G flex 2
sorry but they will you know they will
maybe this is the G flex 2 so I don't
know if you've uh you've heard of that
well I'm a little bit jealous yeah be
honest with you I'm just gonna hang onto
this one for now if you want to know
more about it however you can go and
check it out we have some more
information on cnet gonna have to go jab
you guys mad because kayla took it kale
took my G flex 2 with taking selfies
like crazy well listen so we have a lot
of things to talk about today on the
show if you've been watching our
coverage all day this is going to be
kind of a little palate cleanser for you
we like to have a lot of fun here so
let's not waste any time let's hit the
headlines
so first up we always like to talk about
the things that we've seen that are our
favorites personally at CES 2015 every
year we see stuff that just makes us say
wow and we get really excited about it
we get really excited about so kill I'm
gonna let you go first you I know you
wanted to talk about what dish has going
on this year at all then ok so I'm a
cord cutter I'll admit that right now
are there any other cord cutters in the
audience I don't want to okay so the
only two cord cutters will change all of
you guys but basically what that means
we're getting we don't want to be on
cable we r you know with those kind of
people because it's really expensive
well dish announced something called
flex TV so check this out this has your
flex TV what it you're still on this
flex kale it's sleeting I'm sorry I'm a
flexible wing shot so a sling sling TV
has ABC ESPN maker studios TNT CNN TBS
Cartoon Network adult swim food network
HGTV charger you're gonna marry and uh
all of this for twenty dollars a month
obviously the big sell for a lot of
people is ESPN because that usually
costs for like an extra it's an extra
package cost whenever you buy cable it
was like a hundred dollars so I mean if
you add this up to you know HBO GO and a
couple of other you know things and and
what's important for me on this it's
available on Xbox one whoo he's the only
he said okay I call the deal five Iago I
bears the gamers you know what I really
liked about sling TV is that there's no
box requires a set-top box just a
subscription service you can subscribe
and then if you have a Roku amazon fire
TV if you have any of those devices
already your home which you probably do
you can connect to sling TV which is
pretty awesome like I think a lot of a
lot of us Millennials we might might be
interested in now so it wasn't on
another I wasn't excited about another
4k TV I know where I wasn't excited
about a phone that had you know like a
no bevel but hey I'm excited about this
fair enough fair enough okay what do you
got what are you excited about what's
your wow I have to say for me the WoW
moment was when Toyota kid they had a
a thing going yesterday and they brought
out a very notable it was it was so
great but the real big thing is they
showed this hydrogen car and they said
we're going to make this a generator for
your house so they plugged it in and
there was like this beautiful like oh
we're going to power your house for up
to a week because of so here it is that
we see it yet and the greatest part
about it for me was that they released
5680 fuel cell patents for everybody to
you everybody to work on you for you
guys for you if anybody wants to work on
that guy in the back nice not here ready
not no not on you not you definitely not
you we don't know what you're gonna do
with the technology sir we just don't
know we can't be sure but yeah they're
gonna they want to kick-start fuel cell
a fuel cell development and this is a
really exciting way to do that and I
think that this has kind of been a
little bit of a theme in the last maybe
year we've seen some patents get
released Elon Musk with Tesla and we saw
we're seeing now this with Toyota and of
course Oh SVR over a razor so and we're
going to talk about that in a minute but
a perfect perfect choice for our future
tech show true so tell me though about
the drinking game okay let's get down to
business so we got this robot uh yeah we
love robots we're big on robots we just
hope that they don't ever you know
murderous hate us so Empire robots a
robotics is working on this thing called
versa ball they announced it last year
it's supposed to it supposed to be
simple versatile and expensive and
gripper it's a little ball that grips
onto stuff and it can hold pretty much
anything well they're showing that off
this year yeah by letting you challenge
it to beer pong anybody else there to
base camp on never to challenge us robot
enough time in college working on beer
pong you can look at it on the screens
right now if you've ever seen one of
those stress balls that are kind of
filled with sand it's it grips in the
same way so it pulls air through and it
holds things thank you goes out that are
really fragile grip grip surround it
yeah that was the big thing that they're
doing they're trying to show off that
the device can handle delicate objects
and grip things constantly and then
obviously uh it actually shoots with
precision I was watching the whole time
I'm like this time it's going to miss
this time it's
right now this time it's gonna miss
right now it's gonna miss it's gonna
miss no it's not gonna it's gonna miss
it's not gonna miss see okay mess did
miss little miss next time okay but it
they're basically challenged I've
brought a bunch of professional beer
pong players to come and play against
this robot wait and it's happening now
like it's happening to all of CES there
are professional beer pump there's what
you want one I was not invited to the
league whoa I know really sad about this
you know its Vegas so you know we'll see
it up see what happens so yeah there you
go you can go check it out it's a it's
Empire robotics the different tech West
so if anybody wants to see that and the
first of all there it's for more than
beer pong I'm told it's to all things
hold things that you know that humans
maybe can't handle or they're a
challenge yeah there you go so there you
go robotics what do you got all right so
our very last headline today is
something that we are very excited to
show you we saw this about a month ago
and actually covered it on our show and
we were really excited to be able to
have it talk about it here at CES this
is a there's a intel has this robotic
spider dress and I don't know if any of
you have actually seen it quite yet but
it looks absolutely terrifying we have
video of it we have it there was a
teaser trailer that was released here it
is yeah this spider dress looks
absolutely credible is 3d printed it has
proximity sensors on it so when people
get a little too close like they'd like
to do here at CES it lashes out and the
most exciting part about it is we
actually have the dress with the
designer anouk VIP pricked right here at
our videos Harriet but I'm careful
everybody don't get too close it might
attack you I just want to let you know I
can we grab so we have them coming up to
the stage they're going to show off this
beautiful creation anouk actually has
designed on other designs and other 3d
printed dresses for SI unit so it's
gonna lash out I'm frightened Cael do
not touch the model okay really far away
right now model you will lose an eye but
if this is one of my favorite I like
when we combine different things so it's
like it's like future tech fashion and
you know robotic so can you tell us a
little bit anoka about the process of
designing this and also
um you know what your inspiration was in
creating this beautiful piece I open
okay sir yeah first of all welcome for
the invite and so what we have here is a
robotic spider dress is based on the
Intel Edison a small micro computer
module of Intel that's a tesco inside a
rebel industry so what we have here is
address as soon as you step into her
personal space which I want to try to do
here he's he's attacking you back yeah
I'm walking to her very closely know
like if I do that's a little bit faster
Wow so yeah basically the address is all
3d print sets in in collaboration with
philip h milk it's all 3d prints in a
technique called selective laser
sintering so that's a really cool way to
create this kind of geometry you see
here the mechanic legs there are several
base and in front of the dress you have
to proximity sensor so those are
measuring the the intimate space the
personal space social space and a public
space that she has around her body
that's really helpful when you're
walking around the intel booth freely
you like just stay away just photos only
photos only now can I can I get this in
a size 4 kale can we get one I think he
would look really good in them to waste
yeah I federal review in whites or in
black oh um I like white it looks so
angelic you've made a dress before this
this synapse tres correct that's the one
one that you wear it okay it detects
where you're focusing and what not where
do you want to go next um oh wow that's
a that's a good question we just
released this one this morning so it's a
very newborn baby so yeah well yeah due
to the use of the Intel Edison I'm doing
much more with wireless bio signals in
collaboration with the team at Intel the
new devices group working with a
wireless bio signals is really
interesting for me normally I use
proximity sensors a lot so my designs
were able to sense the surroundings but
they were not really able to sense the
body and to connect my interactions to
the body and her surroundings oh
yeah so working with that it really has
really yeah pulled off some really
interesting things for example Ebony's
using a restoration sensor here so as
Whitney is working in the intel booth
and she doesn't want to go in an attack
mode all the time she's just breathing
in deeply and her assistant goes to a
little bit of a breath mode sort of so
she can stop her dress being attacking
by her own body for example that is
fantastic I have one more question of
course what are the benefits and and
just the pluses of using 3d printed like
clothing um you don't have to sue
anymore oh there you go no no pokes in
the fingers all right I got you right
right i like that you just put it right
into a and how long have you been
creating 3d printed designs 3d printing
I've been basically it for four years
now materialized who is also at CES at
these moments I'm printing a lot with
them and they guided me into the world
of 3d printing which has been a very
fruitful it'sit's yeah it's super cool
you can create such did yeah complete
complex design sort of with its that
you're not able to do with your hands or
with sculpting or such things so so
that's really cool yeah yeah it's so
impressive anza if anybody wants to
actually see it you can go to the intel
booth if you're here at the show please
feel free to stop by she's walking
around and and you can take some
pictures of it and check it out I know
it's up on stage so she's not walking
around in the audience or anything but
BK at his speech of today that's 40 i
think that is BK of Intel you've also
highlights the spider dress in his talk
fantastic also so much thank you really
appreciate that thanks to thank you yeah
thank you for wearing that gorgeous all
right everybody those are our headlines
we will be back in after a quick break
are you a little bit scared kales afraid
of spiders so we will be right back
we're going to have Jessica Chobot
chobot from Nerdist she's here if we're
around a blushy we're gonna have her up
you're talking about gaming and VR so
don't click away it's tomorrow daily
welcome back tomorrow daily the best
geek talk show in the known universe are
at least on Cena you know no is it oh
yes at CES 2015 we're here we have a
wonderful guest today you might know her
from Nerdist news you might know her
from her podcast bizarre states hi this
is Jessica shook chobot ladies darling I
was our show bout shows that show your
hand around flaws I'll get myself around
the clock yeah like I'm sorry my sword
who's the spider dress so they're kind
of just like reeling from that yeah that
little it was gorgeous but unnerving all
at the same time it's a little intense
both wear that dress I would kiss okay
after some working out I would wear that
dress yes lose about half my body just
saw me in half and I could wear it maybe
that would be good I'm so you are you
are a big gamer like you you and I and
kale are all actually really big video
gamers we've all been playing video
games forever one of the things we
always love all three of us checking out
at CES 2015 is gaming and a big part of
this year's show is virtual reality so
we're finally like kind of getting into
a point where virtual reality is going
to be really exciting it's starting to
become an actual thing that consumers
might be able to buy so what have you
seen at the show yeah well you know I
mean just a lot of third-party people
are finally getting in on the act I
think one that we've been talking about
which is really interesting is the razor
what OS vr right virtual reality is we r
which is basically a dev kit for anybody
but still the fact that they're kind of
just letting that happen for the lack of
a better phrase the common developer I
know you drop you not just for companies
Indies is is going to be very
interesting because of Indies I think
you're going to see a lot of games
coming out of there that you wouldn't
normally see you know it's just a lot
very innovative and you're not going to
normally see that kind of portrayed in
your typical companies right I don't
want a name wasn't going to name a
single on ice point is really good at
two hundred bucks to get into VR
development and it's that the software's
all open source you can you can develop
at will as much as you want which i
think is great yeah I'm and then he's
kind of glazing over though is that it's
kind of Barker's you can take out the
little screen they have in there and
slip in a phone like so you can develop
for your phone
make it accessible to anybody what's
interesting about the phone thing to in
a different company is Samsung's milker
yeah Samsung VR I think what milk VR
calling a new so they have it they have
the gear VR which is the headset where
you can put in the note or the note edge
and they have that around the show and
then they've been talking about milk VR
as well but the one that everybody's
really familiar with consumers are is
the gear VR so the gear VR I went by
their booth I talked to them a little
bit about it it looks really cool it's
you know there's no wires attached it's
great that's that always is a big plus I
don't know if I necessarily want to
carry around an extra peripheral with a
giant headset and my father encumbered
yeah I talked to one of the guys that
there was there kind of promoting the
booth and he said he used it on the
plane and that it wasn't a big issue for
him I could that would be helpful it's
like you you know you're I guess what if
you're in a meadow or what are you doing
on a plane just like I'm in a meadow
like yeah I mean yeah oh yeah your dad I
guess for like super long flights great
idea I just don't know how how well it
would travel how well it would travel
make sense um I buy that I'm very
surprised to not see Morpheus on the
show floor we were to we were at the
sony press conference last night we
really thought that they would maybe say
something about the word Morpheus oh no
they're well they were trying to sell us
on Annie he was cuz they're all right
with me it was really gung-ho about
Annie you guys so if you apparently and
then kale of course you know encouraged
him by yelling Annie in the middle of
the press conference but I thought we
were at a monster truck rally just shout
stuff that's not how press conferences
work that's what I was really big fan of
Annie Sony's big push seems to be
stepping away from Morpheus for this
show and really pushing their
PlayStation now stuff yeah which I kind
of totally understand i was again
talking to one of the guys at the booth
there and they and i was trying to get
them to spill the beans on to why they
didn't have Morpheus at the show and he
avoided it fairly well but didn't
mention the fact that you know they've
been hitting everybody so hard with it
and VR is such a buzzword for the gaming
for gaming at the show that they wanted
to kind of step away let their own press
cool down and focus on a little bit got
it yeah they're other product like you
said we talked about the Slover earlier
III wait ether
is when they'll let it let it out yeah
well makes sense one of the other things
that we've seen our new in different
ways to sort of play games on your TV
we've seen a lot of you know Android TV
is going to be a thing where you're
going to be able to play android games
from your phone on your television you
stream it right to that you can use a
controller it's really really
interesting and there there are lots of
other Forge TV razor has um so so what
do you think consumers are really going
to be drawn towards in terms of and we
also saw that Sony as we've been talking
a lot about Sony but they mentioned that
they're going to allow Samsung to sell
TVs that have the ability to download
the PlayStation now app so you're going
to be able to play playstation I guess
for now PlayStation 3 games via
PlayStation now subscription yeah it
comes with the TV and I am some TV which
is such a I mean that just blows my mind
all of their smart TV for k's are here's
the thing that I find interesting about
that kind of deal that they've worked
out one they're accessing a whole new
demographic somebody like for example
maybe my father who dabbles in gaming
but you know he's older he doesn't
necessarily want to plunk down 600 for a
new console but if he does enjoy like
everybody else that I know of a good TV
in their living room so if he can get
that with it built in he actually might
be kind of a new person to step into the
gaming space a new demographic so
there's that but then on top of that
when it's already a 4k TV so if you if
and win I'm going to go mostly with win
and this is my own personal connection
because they wouldn't necessarily well
they do support that wouldn't tell me
this but you know it makes sense that
when developers start making games that
are applicable to 4k television Sony's
right there they already have it it's
there this instantly in your home on
this TV so that's I think a kind of a
pretty smart move I mean that's you know
I'm kind of gushing about Sony right now
but that's because they really are
making a very concerted effort to
literally get into everyone's home in
one way or another whether it's through
the TV or their PlayStation TV
or the remote play or however it is that
they're doing it I mean it actually gets
pretty confusing you have to just run it
through it yeah we're talking about that
playstation and then another word
playstation via places in no place
placing some sandwiches yeah playstation
samsung TV for game like i'm sure it'll
be some really long name but yeah we I
like it's very exciting time worth
looking at that's why we're talking
about how much they're trying so much
more and Microsoft isn't even here ya
know I was so surprised so I haven't
been to CES for at least what three or
four years i think my last one was when
i was here for g4 way back in the day
and they stuck me doing smart fridges
which is awesome but it's a rigid oh my
god does it order your milk for you I'm
so excited thank you Mike aren't you
yeah that unlike us leave this is
Arrowhead so you know but I'm all of a
sudden up on the show floor and there's
no microsoft and i was like what and lot
of changes yeah no yeah so we have a
hashtag of the day here on tomorrow
daily the hashtag of the day today is
hashtag TD CES games we want you to tell
us what kinds of gaming tech that you
are most excited about in 2015 jessica
we have really enjoyed hearing your
insights you are fantastic where can we
find you on the internet i know there
are many places as many places but you
should go to nerdist.com for Nerdist
