does it mean force toward us soon marks
in China and Japan doing the IPO book so
what do you guess my time I think well I
don't think he's in Shanghai busy me his
with his girlfriend's family about two
weeks before they're gonna go IPO so
that's probably not why he's in China
you think it's just a few weeks away I
I'm guessing weeks to single month yeah
I think it's a late April or May and
when we were doing the millennial IPO
the bankers are the same as Facebook and
they said we got to get this done by the
end of March I said why did him to march
they said we got a lot of other stuff we
got to hear me like wonder what they're
talking about very good yeah I mean I
think the rest of the what does it do
for everyone else does it increase the
mania does it increase the panic of the
email list evaluation probably cross the
pond my god how sir that's such a big
liar but I just meant for other company
the rest of the market feels like Oh
everything does it increase valuation
for companies that you didn't know
probably helps us with our company's
getting valuation probably hurts us in
terms of valuation for new investments
that we're doing it's good for probably
good for entrepreneurs I know I mean
they're gonna have a huge currency to
buy things with Randy's gonna motivate
other buyers but they're not regular
buyers there is a very anti acquisition
and when they do do acquisitions or
small acquisitions and attention and
they tend to screw the investors in the
acquisitions right they will move most
of what do you mean of all well then the
most the smart acquires all do this now
for the echo hires were you basically
but I don't think that smart acquire
screwing investors is actually smart
okay like the clever right the clever
lawyer thing are moving most the
acquisition price into the package for
the team and the investors get their
money back maybe with interest if
they're lucky yeah so I've seen a lot of
investors look at Google and other folks
are watching that might work for
individual angel investors for those of
us who are basically producing hundreds
of companies on any no basis note for
the record that will not be work thank
you I'm wondering if you guys have some
perspective on
the upcoming Facebook IPO and on the
facebooks need to go public they're
gonna make a load of money we all use it
gay like that's it we don't need to like
talk multiple times though I'm asking
hear me out my question is is if the
pricing and aftermarket performance of
the facebook IPO might set the tone for
future funding valuations for companies
down the road yeah maybe it's a factor
next Facebook's a big-ass company
they're doing really well they're going
to make a lot of money I think Dave
should have invested it didn't go okay
um I used to work for the guys who was
one of the biggest investors but what
America over a long time line the
venture business on average barely makes
money or loses money depending on whose
statue listen to this because that means
for every 10 or 20 or 30 billion made
into Facebook IPO it gets reinvested in
a frenzy in the startups los different
keep that in mind right well yeah that's
the effect i bet i think facebook is
distorting what's going on like Facebook
is this once in a decade really big
business that makes a small number of
people a large amount of money and the
actual trend is venture is getting a
little bit more scientific we're getting
smart about this business and it's
easier to create 25 to 50 million dollar
businesses with regularity like that's
what's really interesting and what's
going on and why it's changing the
dynamics because it's actually harder
for large funds to make money now
because it's easier for entrepreneurs to
exit early they own more of their
companies they're more efficient about
it like that's what's cool and like
crowdfunding is challenging seed
investors seed investors are challenging
around investors around investors are
challenging period investors like
there's efficiency throughout the whole
system that's going on facebook this big
anomaly that is more the old world not
the new world yeah so that's the most
interesting yeah people keep talking
about the facebook but like okay how
many people here really still obsessive
users of facebook or have moved on to
something else yeah yeah from from over
facebook you heard of here it's not it's
not over but it's gone so morning
facebook has gone so mainstream that i
think most people here have moved on to
a Twitter or Pinterest or whatever but
we're the thoroughly
yeah I get it but that's not saying I
don't think Facebook is that interested
in talking about here now like it's not
on the edge anymore</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
