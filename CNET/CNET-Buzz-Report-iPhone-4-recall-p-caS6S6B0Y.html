buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
the iphone 4 backlash nobody wants
office 2010 and this buzz report is now
diamonds but first it's the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week is the
samsung colon parentheses or is where
apparently supposed to call it the
smiley which i guess is better than
calling it the samsung colon parentheses
I suggest Samsung avoiding using the
word colon when naming a product that is
not medically necessary but anyway the
smiley is a cute little messaging phone
with a dedicated smiley face button so I
guess it's really friendly it actually
seems like a perfectly fine phone but
seriously we really don't need emoticon
names for phones if they come out with a
samsung less than three somebody's
getting punched although i would
consider the samsung omgwtfbbq that
would be ironic and now for the news as
you may have heard this week lots of
people are mad about the whole iphone 4
antenna not working depending on how you
hold it thing and some of them including
me have called for Apple to recall the
device even Consumer Reports is saying
yeah it's awesome but if we want to make
calls we're just going to get a iphone
3gs even apple's stock price has started
to suffer from the news personally
although i think apple should bite the
bullet i suspect the closest we're going
to see to a recall is steve job saying i
don't recall any antenna problem
Bernstein Research Analyst Tony saganaki
claims that a recall could cost Apple
1.5 billion dollars up like enough for
several MacBook Airs not only that but a
recall would cost Apple some credibility
admittedly that credibility is already
waning since Apple is apparently
sticking with the whole whole different
strategy which is like the high-tech
version of jiggle the handle we'll see
how that works out for them Oh hold your
horses everyone Apple has scheduled a
press conference for Friday July
sixteenth at ten a.m. pacific tune in to
cnet.com for ongoing coverage and
possibly just forget everything I just
said speaking of phone news the droid x
land
verizon stores this week and verizon was
promising that unlike the incredible
their will in fact be plenty of droid x
supply which would make it the first
serious iphone alternative that you can
actually buy in other news a new NPD
report says sales of microsoft office
2010 are lackluster yes that is because
google docs might not be awesome but
it's free and it doesn't include any
Bob's or paper clips or ribbons or any
other office baggage or maybe it's
because most of us don't need to update
from the version of office we already
have it's not like the new version
offers anything super mega cool like
word with telepathy or unicorns or free
and in other news remember last week's
clogging the tubes with pulpo paul the
psychic octopus well now there's an app
for that you touch labs new ask the
octopus app lets you put in a 2 choice
question and get an answer from paul see
now but what's funny is that i bet an
octopus could actually under the right
circumstances literally jump a shark and
speaking of clogging the tubes let's
have a look shall we it should come as a
surprise to no one that this week's
clogging the tubes is the latest
brilliant Old Spice viral marketing
campaign personalized videos from Isaiah
Mustafa basically he's responding to
questions and requests on Twitter
Facebook and YouTube and well have a
look Demi Moore tweets old spice guy I
want a special video response wow thanks
Demi Moore and I want to give you a
special video response pingchat tweeted
you started something big yes I did
pingchat yes I did instead of opening
the state of the union address with my
fellow Americans try opening with hello
ladies and end with presidential app
point man those old spice people are
marketing geniuses and actually if
Isaiah makes a personalized video for me
we won't send Old Spice a bill for all
the free advertising we just
of them by the way those videos are so
good that they actually took our
attention away from the double rainbow
man and the double down KFC parody of
the rainbow man so please go watch those
if you haven't already kind of also
clogging the tubes and that's the buzz
report for this week everyone I'm
mollywood and thank you for watching oh
my god it's full on double rainbow all
the way across the sky Oh delicious all
the way oh my god</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
