with cena and this is a look at the
fujifilm finepix f 600 X R and if you're
really into playing with different
shooting modes and settings you'll want
to check this one out
without getting too bogged down in
specifics its sensor design and
processor give you improved low-light
photos and better dynamic range than the
lower-end compacts and you also get
things like movie capture from Full HD
Loras high speed settings for
slow-motion clips as well as some handy
continuous shooting options though if
you're afraid of menus and just looking
for something to leave in Auto this
probably isn't for you as for actual
physical features it has an ultra
wide-angle lens with a 15 X zoom
high-res 3-inch LCD on back and built-in
GPS for geo-tagging photos but it also
does this really cool autumn nted
reality thing that will point out
landmarks that you might want to shoot
unfortunately it was slow to lock onto a
signal photo quality can be very good
but again you'll have to take full
advantage of all the modes and settings
to get the most out of it it shoots in
RAW and raw plus JPEG so if you don't
like Fugees processing you can always do
it yourself even still if you're really
concerned with how things look when
photos are viewed at full size on a
monitor you might want to skip this
model simply because shots tend to be
noisy and soft shooting performance is a
bit mixed too while it's not super slow
it's not always fast and so in the end
this is a nice compact mega zoom and I
liked shooting with it
but you'll have to be willing to really
dig into its features and settings to
get the most out of it I'm Josh Goldman
and that's the fujifilm finepix f6
