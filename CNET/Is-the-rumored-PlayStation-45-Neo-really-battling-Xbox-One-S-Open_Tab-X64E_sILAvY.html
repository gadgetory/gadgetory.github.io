event on September seventh in New York
City to announce obviously the
PlayStation neo this is the step up
console from the ps4 which was dubbed PS
4.5 nerdiest name I didn't do it our
newest name you do it no it's not your
fault not my fault he s five it's not
the PS five or point two five could be
it feels like it leave it like a point
three seven something like that so check
out the rumored specs or respects for
the PlayStation neo 4k graphics for
games in Ultra HD 4k blu-rays it will
write it will rock a 2.1 gigahertz AMD
presser processor with Jaguar cores per
hour which I guess we'll just that's
like the cat like yet quite leopard kors
right not we're not there ya know 8
gigabytes of gddr5 memory which is
pretty good well 16 would've been better
support for all current games existing
on the ps4 right now so you're not going
to buy this thing and not be able to
play a game that had been on ps4 and
vice versa I was super worried about
that thanks for clearing that up well
it's a big deal right it's a big deal
like people like oh I'm not gonna be
able to play a ps4 neo game on my ps4
know right don't worry they're all going
to work yeah the catch though is that PS
4.5 / neo games probably going to look
and perform better okay so there's that
the events coming up there's really not
a ton to talk about with that just
because we've known about this for so
many months going in my biggest question
is will this impact / improve
PlayStation VR and I feel like that's
something they're holding back the
messaging has been a little cloudy yeah
whether or not they're going to do that
so for me don't forget PlayStation VR
comes out October 13th what's that going
to look like is this going to be really
the system you want to play it on maybe
not so much on standard ps4 especially
the specs for oculus rift and H
SI vive or I think considerably higher
than what a PlayStation 4 if it I
support the peace absolutely our way
higher yeah so you would imagine maybe
that ps4 point five catches up it's
still nowhere near the modern
state-of-the-art GPUs but maybe it
narrows the gap just a little bit yeah
and and you got to say if they do make
it you know slightly better is that
going to be now immediately or develops
going to take a while right to implement
that extra VR horsepower and maybe Lee a
couple years down the road before you
start see differences between the two
totally and there's there's a lot to
unpack here it's not something we can do
in a few minutes we have here but but
the way you got to think about it is
sony basically told all the developers
who make video games they said look we
got this more powerful thing coming out
in a couple months they're kind of
decree that everything that comes out i
believe it's october or September
anything that comes out that month and
beyond must support both sort of spec
sets right so like this games got to
work a certain way I'm neo and it's got
to work a certain way on ps4 vanilla I'm
curious they can get it to actually make
regular games who cares what VR make
regular ps4 games look really good right
there's some like trick things like
backfill that yeah yeah I do what a
place a pc gaming rig can do right and
and just you know up the and and make it
better with 4k obviously sure take
advantage of the fact that stuff work a
resolution instead of just you know make
it look exactly the same as ps4 will see
how it all shakes out September 7th not
that far away few questions are coursing
same days the iphone 7 thing I swear to
god these guys just want us dead which
one's more exciting games I thought they
face is over that's the less what's the
lesser of two evils right there someone
Jerry wants to know if why should he
should he buy neo he doesn't own a 4k TV
which is a relevant question yeah it's
another question I think you're still
gonna you are still going to get
graphical improvements on your regular
TV like that's something that it's tough
to sort of suss out you know I think we
come out so we can test them yet with
that won't until we can actually look at
that yeah for sure um you know odds are
you're gonna get better performance are
coming from a ps4 to a neo that doesn't
necessarily mean you have to get
so what will sort of be able to suss
that out once we get our hands on it but
the on paper the reason you'd want to
upgrade is to get that graphical jump up
from a ps4 plus possibly future-proof
yourself if you do one day want to buy
their evoke a TV yeah we all do xbox
oriented gestures to agent wants to know
if you guys think Microsoft's right now
hyping up their plans for people he
doesn't want to go to xbox one s but he
I guess he's thinking about the one
after that for next year right then Nick
wants to know if he should switch from
PlayStation if the only Asian question
read those are machines so ever floats
your boat y alex you know switching
consoles that's kind of to you you got
to go by like the value and the games
really for me it's the games like if the
games that you want to play are on one
platform go to that platform and if all
your friends are on one platform that's
another big exactly being able to play
with them with your friends is a big
deal so most people like to play on the
same platform their friends are on ah
when it comes to what was the first one
if xbox is ramping up there if they are
try not high pop is by putting out like
yeah hey we're doing this but next year
we have this bigger system yeah it's
definitely strange that xbox one s kind
of was was out with the knowledge that
Scorpio is on the horizon I think their
hand was forced a little bit in terms of
having to be transparent about what
their roadmap looks like nevertheless
any kind of publicity for those guys
these days in this generation of
consoles is probably good they have not
been able to sell as many consoles as
Sony ass so yeah we're gonna do a good
segue right I mean Scorpio seems to me
like you know the question mark here
because it's still the one nobody's
defined yet right and that really is the
way it's sort of shaping up right the
landscape is Scorpios coming out late
next year the current xbox one is likely
going to drop in price playstation 4 neo
seems like it's going to be a thing this
year so it's like well how does it all
you know kind of shake out yeah i guess
another question we're getting a lot is
who should buy the xbox one s and
Donna said no nobody well they did it
the thing is we were talk about HDR
before so the xbox one is is currently
the cheapest 4k blu-ray player hmm so
this happened the ps3 it was the
cheapest blu-ray player right and it was
by far the best at the time and it
helped really make blu-ray decent you
know relevant format for a few years I
think Xbox one s doesn't really have
that same sort of opportunity just
because streaming is so much more
popular now than discs but if you're
that guy that just bought a 4k TV and
you want to have the best you know video
quality experience the xbox one s is
less expensive by you know 7,500 bucks
then the other 4k blu-ray player by
Samsung it's out right now so that's
that's one reason sure but it's a pretty
niche reason it's pretty nice reason and
you know you and I had certainly an
interesting time trying to get it to
work the right way took a really long
time to get HDR to play right yeah even
even things as simple as like getting
that 4k resolution to first sort of show
up yeah involved a bunch of updating and
unplugging and handshaking what not
playing in the settings menu something
there it's tough to comprehend you're
gonna have to dive a little deep it's
not very user-friendly right um ah you
know someone brought up before about HDR
in games and is that a thing it is but
Xbox is only going to have three games
that support it kind of out of the gate
and I believe that's forza horizon three
gears of war 4 and then next year again
called scalebound so that's three games
that are going to support HDR is that
worth the new TV the new xbox probably
not unless you have a kind of disposable
income yeah yeah so think about it like
that Xbox one s weird kind of system
it's the best-looking one they've ever
made there you go give you that so sexy
little box if you're into that so yeah
that's where we're at any other
questions yeah agent wants to post you
guys with so much news about the future
there's always room or speculation sure
going on who do you think would be the
victor if we can declare one I don't
it's a little early and does it really
matter in the long term future of gaming
well I think it does if your look
to see like where these companies go
next are they talking about a victor
between xbox ops project scorpio and neo
uh yeah let sounds like they're
targeting the future yeah well I mean
look you gotta look at the way it is now
these are not brand new consoles they're
simply step up consoles so ps4 right now
is the better selling console in my
opinion it is the better experience and
they do seem to have the better library
of games so I would imagine that trend
would would follow through in the next
you know four or five years however long
we're headed with this sort of uh you
know lifespan but the wild card and
Scorpios advantage is the fact that's
coming out later they can give it better
specs right and they can tell the
developers like take advantage of these
better specs and maybe we'll that
manifest more NVR right exactly which is
a big part of this and which is such a
crazy you know resource hog yeah I like
to make a good VR experience requires
you know crazy good hardware so yeah I
think at least there's that that xbox is
later release date with Scorpio gives
them a potential advantage on paper for
sure I think they are a little further
out yeah intern you know I think calling
it a holiday 2017 thing is sort of
wishful thinking I hope it comes out
then and it sees the light of day then
but if you're betting man no holiday
2017 I think it would really put them at
a disadvantage if they weren't able to
meet that um so so I'm out no matter
what I'm hoping it comes out even if it
doesn't have a fourth wall it doesn't
matter that bring that thing out David
about how much do you think the it's a
question from earlier but it bridges
over now somebody wants to get a
television that would take advantage of
the 4k gaming and they'd be if HDR color
and get into their how much do you think
they'd be spending about now they wanted
a TV well there's there's a huge range
so right now my favorite TV for the
money is a vizio p series that starts at
1,000 bucks for 50 inches and it's 4k
it's got both HDR formats great picture
the very best picture though is OLED
which is a lot more expensive LG's OLED
TV but man that thing is good I mean
it's so good you're like yeah maybe I
can't afford 25 maybe I should
remortgage yes so the 65 inch hole
is between you know five and six
thousand dollars yeah now for the for
this generation and spectacular picture
but way out of most people's price range
so let's we were buying LED lcds that
visit was really good you know like the
vizio there's a samsung that's pretty
decent a sony that i reviewed recently
to go on the website you'll see them but
yeah I mean all those TVs are as
future-proof as they can be they've got
the hardware there the hardware still
ahead of the software the TV shows and
movies at this point and the games you
just cited only three HDR games so you
know if you buy one HTV gon be set yeah
I mean and also I feel like we always
have to kind of like pepper in these
disclaimers xbox one s right now you
cannot play native 4k games that is not
a thing all that's happening is an
upscaling yeah so keep that in the back
your mind one other question we got a
bit more kind of it's a just but a good
joke um do you give you own a tube TV I
actually still do because it's the only
one that my playstation 2 will connect
to my parents have more than they should
in their house Wow yeah they have
lighting negative I think they have to
yeah and I've tried it's just a lost
cause with them just one day just take
it up to the curve and don't tell them
it's heavy don't you get out hey they
are man they've got like a 40 inch and
that's not light no 40 inch to that yeah
you she right yeah that's Mason crazy
without the largest television made i'm
pretty sure i was like turning into a
fish tank or something yeah i know that
thing that's that that's it that's you
can't even get that out of the house
right you just shut the lake house we
have to like start sawing it and happen
now taking it out by pieces that's a
beast it's crazy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
