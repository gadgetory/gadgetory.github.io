rollback net neutrality the Federal
Communications Commission voted
two-to-one on a proposal to start
rolling back the rules put in place in
2015 when the Democrats had control net
neutrality is the principle that all
traffic on the Internet should be
treated equal and those in favor argue
the rules are needed so big providers
like Verizon or Comcast can't charge
more for faster access opponents say
these rules stifle innovation and
investment in the infrastructure SEC
chairman argit Pei outlined his plan to
roll back the title to order in April
this year for those playing along at
home here's a Republican appointed by
President Trump I continually believe
that when it comes to broadband there is
no Republican affiliation or Democratic
affiliation to a particular idea Senate
has a comprehensive interview with Pi
conducted before the vote was taken you
can hear his opinions on returning to a
quote light touch Internet in the
Clinton era net neutrality is such a
contentious issue that even TV hosts
like John Oliver have jumped in his
segment on last week tonight encouraged
viewers to send in comments to the FCC
in support of the rules the show even
made a website go FCC yourself calm to
make the process easier shortly after
the FCC website crashed but that was
blamed on a flood of BOTS sending false
comments not on that website the FCC
will hold a final vote later in the year
and it's accepting public input on the
issue until August but it's almost
certain that the vote will pass as the
Republicans hold a majority on the
Commission</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
