behind the wheel of the new mercedes
benz glk 350 to take a look at their new
command system with the mercedes benz
that's integration you'll get to it all
right here from this new Mercedes Benz
app icon in the command interface we'll
just tap on that and you'll notice that
one of the first problems with the
system is that it's kind of slow
every time you select an option you end
up sitting and waiting for the data
connection to establish itself and to
download whatever data that it needs it
just kind of takes a long time to get
from screen to screen now the first
thing that you can do after you hop in
here is go into Google local search
we're gonna search where we are right
now we will pop in here to the popular
searches and let's say we're looking for
somewhere to eat kind of go to any of
these places we'll just grab one and you
can pop into the detail screen you can
also view options for Google Street View
like all Google Street View you get a
360 view just by scrolling around here
with a controller if you backup you can
also view the panoramio by Google which
is basically a database of geotagged
photos in the area of the place that
you're looking for again the load times
really kind of hamper this whole
situation and I kind of think it'd be
easier maybe to use your smartphone for
some of this stuff since you can't do it
unless you're parked anyway the next
option is news and that basically gives
you the latest headline from a number of
different topics you can kind of view
the latest headlines with photographs
assigned to them so we'll pop into the
story about the Mars landing and you'll
see that the entire story is right here
it's not really the kind of situation
that you'd want to you know sit in your
car and read it on the screen right here
so you can pop over into this option and
send the article to yourself
via email now the next really
interesting feature is the Yelp
integration and you get the list of the
most highly rated pizza places within
the area around us so we'll find hey
this place looks good
we'll go into it and you can see that
every one of those reviews has a one to
five star yelp rating so the option is
also here to download points of interest
and routes that you saved online using
Mercedes's embrace connectivity service
we don't have any definition safe that
we're gonna skip right over that and
jump into the left bit Facebook so
you'll notice that the first option on
my facebook is four places and I can pop
into there and I can find places where
my friends have checked in in the area
or I can also find Facebook places near
the current location and navigate to
them if I go back into the main menu I
can also view a list of my friends I'm
gonna jump down and find my fellow car
tech editor Wayne Cunningham and see
what he's up to okay so if Wayne had
lifted a phone number I'd be able to see
it right here and initiate a phone call
I can also see where he is I can see the
last place that he checked in and I can
also import him into a contacting to the
Maine hands-free calling and navigation
system I can also view his wall and see
his last couple of posts I can view
events in the area that I've RSVP to I
can view the details of the event here
and then I can also navigate to that
event if an address is listed you can
also change your status from right here
in the app it took me about seven to ten
minutes to input a simple 100 character
method so if I were you I'd skip all of
this data input and that pretty much
wraps up everything that the Mercedes
command app system does well that's been
our in-depth first look at the
mercedes-benz app system as part of
their new command system in the glk350
I've been inch one good one with
