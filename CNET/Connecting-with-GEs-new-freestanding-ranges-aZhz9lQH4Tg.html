GE appliances park I'm here today with
their first Wi-Fi connected freestanding
oven ranch this oven range connects to
their brilliant app which is available
on iOS and Android you can use the app
to pre-heat your oven when you're on the
way home you can control the temperature
from your couch if you love for work and
don't remember if you left that oven on
you can check and turn it off and get
that extra peace of mind but a handy
thing is that it comes with a couple of
extra security features to make sure
you're not turning on your oven when you
shouldn't be in order to start
preheating the oven you need to hit the
remote enable button so if you're
leaving for work in the morning make
sure you remember to do that if you're
gonna want to preheat on the way home
additionally if you have the remote
enabled button pressed and somebody
comes and opens the oven it
automatically turns off what that means
is that if somebody is messing with your
oven that you didn't know well then it
won't let you turn it on it's a nice
handy safety feature once the oven is
actually on you don't need the remote
enable button pressed to be able to do
things it's already heated so you can
change that temperature you can set a
timer and like I said turn the oven off
this brilliant app is already available
in their built-in double wall ovens but
those are very costly and you need to
have a lot of room in your kitchen in
order to be able to have it so I'm very
excited that they're finally bringing
this technology to a more standard
free-standing machine
so these freestanding ovens will retail
between 1600 and 2000 dollars they'll be
available in both gas and electric
ranges and they're all going to fit
within GES
profile series LG has a connected oven
that's only about 1300 but the brilliant
app does work better than LG's think you
and this thing isn't a slouch as a
machine just because it's connected it
offers true European convection
customizable rings on the top of the
stove to adjust size so connected
technology and all this is still a high
and very capable oven all on its own
