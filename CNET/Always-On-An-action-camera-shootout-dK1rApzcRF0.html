extreme i am at club moto in livermore
california with three motocross racers
i'm giving each of you an action camera
and i want you to tear it up with this
for at least a week mark you're getting
the contour roam to cody you're getting
the new Sony action camera a lot of buzz
on that one and Terry's our pro you're
getting the GoPro white edition all
right I want you to put these through
their paces really get him dirty all
right let's tear it out hi I'm Terry bas
tard I'm gonna be testing the GoPro
hero3 today
the stuff that we ride on is mostly dirt
track motocross lots of jumps or up in
the air or down I'm I feel like it's
pretty durable especially if it's in the
case most of the time when I'm riding
I'm kind of looking down so I'm going to
angle that camera up and once I've done
that I go ahead and I cinch this down so
it's tight and doesn't come off and then
I'm ready to ride
I do like the design it's really simple
to put on as far as the button I found
those to be pretty user-friendly and I
got those right away as far as features
we worked on the Wi-Fi thing you know
trying to get the angle and I did have a
hard time getting at it we couldn't get
it to turn on or off very well and it
would get stuck you know but taking away
the Wi-Fi option it works pretty good
the footage was pretty darn good it was
pretty clear I think that's the newer
technology coming out so I think they've
come a long way and so I was pretty
happy with it hi I'm Cody Thompson 17
years old I love to race dirt bikes and
today I'm testing out the Sony action
cam
I love riding it's really fun to me I
look forward every day I get to ride I
like the camera it's pretty good design
it films good but it's just not
acceptable it's hard to get the perfect
angle to see exactly what your eyes are
seeing when you're riding the features
on the camera came with two different
clips I've one right here and one right
here so I got to put him on my helmet
and I put one in a different spot on my
bike and I got a couple different angles
of me riding which is pretty cool it has
a sweet case that goes around it so that
when you get hit by dirt you know if I
can scratch the lens at all I got the
download the footage off my camera that
I took I really liked it it seemed to
come out really good had a wide angle i
got to see all the tracks that i was
riding the only down part about it was
the wind so you can hear the wind
hitting the camera and it just covers up
a lot of the audio
hi I'm Mark brain I'm 18 years old I
race motocross and today I'll be testing
out the console run to camera I've been
racing for 12 years riding for 13 ride
four times a week pretty much my life
the design is pretty cool it's slim it's
not that heavy on the bike so I can't
really put on your helmet all the time
we really feel it when it's on the side
which gets a little bit heavier but it's
nothing that doesn't have a case which
is kind of if he gonna riding because it
tends to get mud on it or dirt flung at
it the best part of this camera is the
record function slide forward to record
and slide back to turn it off it's a lot
better than all the other cameras
because it's it's not so much of a is it
on is it not on and the beep that tells
you get the cameras on is really loud I
can hear over my bike and through my
helmet
the footage pretty good it's got a wide
lens on it so you can see everything on
the side really the only thing I didn't
like about the camera is that it doesn't
have a case and that the mounting it has
a mount on this both sides but it
doesn't have it on the bottom it just
has a tripod mount which motocross if
you want it to be upright so you can see
over the top of the visor a little bit
that way you can see down I think that's
part of the reason why you don't see as
much as the bumps because it's not
focused right in front of you run across
maybe the camera's not the best but
definitely nice to have that one off the
lot across
they're just babies
the mud got all over and I was out now
let's see how they're actually getting
along with the cameras hey guys how'd it
go out there you're looking good all
right I'm gonna keep it short and sweet
cuz i know you spent a lot of time with
these cameras Terry you have the hero3
white edition is this a by or do not buy
for you get to buy for me to buy for you
all right mark how about the contour
roam to Concord ba5 had a car of course
me I'm like so not about no good on the
bike bomber it looks cool those look
cool all right Cody how about you with
the sony camera Autobot not abide not
like no hesitation not if I all right
how do you feel about any of the other
cameras would you argue the market for
an action cam the GoPro these do they go
pro on the GoPro don't bro no problem
I'd say that's a sweet for the GoPro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
