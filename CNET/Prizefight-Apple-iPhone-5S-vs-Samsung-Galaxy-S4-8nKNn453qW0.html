in the smartphone wars will never go
away so we're facing off the best of the
best
it's a prizefight butch out between
Apple's iPhone 5s and Samsung's Galaxy
s4 our judges for this fight are senior
editor Jessica the people stole court
associate editor Lynn Lala and myself
can't go wrong Tom will take all three
judges scores and average them out to
the nearest tenth each round the final
prize fight store will be an average of
all rounds using the same system let's
get it started
round 1 these two phones are the top of
their class and Apple still brings one
of the best design phones even if it has
a smaller 4-inch screen with a 326 pixel
per inch count for some people it's the
perfect size for others it's not and all
the hype about the gold iPhone in person
it's really not as gold as they make it
look in pictures now the galaxy s4 may
not bring us premium of a design with
its plastic backing but it feels salt in
your hand and the one thing we can't
ignore it's 5 inch AMOLED display with a
higher 441 pixel per inch count this
thing is the truth but it also might be
too big for some people it's a battle
between screen size and design and our
judges are calling this a tie at 4.3
points a piece next rounds controls
Apple brings ios7 with the visual
facelift but the same staple
functionality that has made it the
easiest mobile OS to use now if you're
looking for deep customization you won't
really find it here but control center
is really the biggest change that plays
catch-up to Android and it's the most
useful for Apple loyalists now touch ID
brings fingerprint recognition that's
optional and it may take an extra second
but it's a lot better than punching in a
passcode every time and it's the best
fingerprint execution we've seen so far
the galaxy s4 brings it snappy TouchWiz
interface running on top of Android 4.3
that's still rolling out it looks a lot
like previous versions except there's
even more UI bells and whistles tucked
in here pull down the notifications bar
and you'll see everything and I mean
everything from multi window use to
Samsung smart eye features that are more
gimmicky now you can navigate the phone
by touch or with gestures and we don't
think the interface is bad the UI is
still just as customizable but it's just
not as clean now there's just so much
more you can do here and today's user
demands more so the galaxy s4 gets a 427
and the iPhone 5s gets a 4.3 now for
average around the galaxy s4 leads next
round is Apple's iPhone 5s brings a
dual-core a7 processor and its biggest
new feature touch ID is a fingerprint
sensor done right but it has so much
more potential that needs to be unlocked
there's also an m7 processor for fitness
apps but that really isn't a game
changer Siri is better but still behind
Google Voice and Apple maps are better
but they're still behind Google Maps now
just like the name implies the 5s is an
improvement from the 5 but not a
groundbreaking device on the other hand
samsung's galaxy s4 is jam-packed of
features with its 1.9 gigahertz
quad-core processor so I'll tell you
some of the unique things it can do even
if you won't use them all it has a
replaceable battery and memory expansion
you won't find that on the iPhone 5s it
brings multi window support to run two
apps at the same time motion gestures
for zooming into pictures or scrolling
up and down a webpage with your eyes or
looking at pictures with the wave of a
hand like a box now watch a video turn
away and the video clip will stop until
your
eyes return to the screen it also has s
voice drive to keep your eyes on the
road and it can even be used as a
fitness device it also brings the
watchon app to act as your TV remote and
that's still not everything now can you
guess who takes this route the galaxy s4
gets out for point 7 and the iPhone 5s
gets a for next round is web browsing
multi media web browsing on mobile
phones is pretty much a push when you
can load Chrome on both phones as the
best mobile browser out there the galaxy
s4 really stands out though with its
enormous display that may not always be
as bright as other phones on its highest
setting
but web content and videos just look
amazing on it compared to the iPhone 5
SS or inch screen iTunes radio is also
one of the sleeper features that has
been great and I mean a great multimedia
add-on that a lot of iOS users are
asking Pandora who now when it comes to
photos the iPhone 5s is 8 megapixel
camera tends to take photos at are
little sharper and more saturated
compared to the s4 s 14 megapixel camera
low-light shots perform better with the
iPhone 5s and it's dual color LED flash
made a difference when compared to the
galaxy s4 s and both bones have slo-mo
video which is always fun overall our
judges preferred the 5 SS camera over
the s floors that was still very good
but we're going to give the slight edge
to the s4 overall with its larger screen
the Galaxy takes around 4 with 4.7 and
the iPhone 5s gets a 4.3 so after
averaging 4 rounds the galaxy s4 still
leaves the final round that side salt is
performed
both phones call quality will depend on
your carrier and area and in our test
they were both very capable now both
operating systems were snappy to use but
iOS 7's animations do tend to make the
OS feel slower at times now in seeing
its own video battery drain test the
iPhone 5s was able to squeeze out 11
hours of battery life compared to the
Galaxy s4 which squeezed out 10 hours
and 20 minutes of juice and the reality
is that a larger screen means less
battery now in the Geekbench 3 benchmark
tests the iPhone 5s clearly dominated
the galaxy s4 as well but the reality is
that both of these phones feel fast and
snappy in real-world tests now
performance matters and the judges are
giving the iPhone 5s a perfect 5 and the
galaxy s4 gets a 4.3 so let's average
out all 5 rounds and Samsung really put
the pressure on early and often and even
a perfect 5 in the last round just
wasn't enough for the iPhone 5s and the
galaxy s4 takes this battle 4 point 5 to
4.4 and is your prize bite winner it was
another epic battle but in the end these
are two cream-of-the-crop bones and the
final decision always comes down to you
i'm brian tong thanks for watching we'll
catch you guys next time for another
prizefight
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
