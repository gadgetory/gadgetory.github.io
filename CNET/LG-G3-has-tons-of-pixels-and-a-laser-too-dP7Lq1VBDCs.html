LG's latest phone the g3 and holding it
here in one hand that's a big deal
because LG wants you to know that a 5.5
inch screen phone doesn't feel much
bigger than a 5 inch and this is a 2560
x 1440 538 ppi screen that is a
super-high pickle bridge resolution
which they claim makes a difference over
300 PPI is there's a bit of a retina
super high pixel war going on and this
case here is an optional accessory it's
a circle case now it is pretty cool
because it allows you to look at the top
here and get a little nice clock and
cool circular effect maybe a preview of
Android wear watches and circular
screens galore to come you open it up
here and it also has a revamp camera on
the back 13 megapixels may not sound
like much but it has laser guided
autofocus that's like SLR level super
fast autofocus will be interesting to
see how that works in execution has a
Snapdragon 801 processor and it also has
a bunch of new context-aware apps
including smart security software and
smart notification software it allows
you to tap a little message to unlock
your phone use a knock tap code which
they claim is a different and more
secure way of doing it versus
alternatives no release date planned yet
but you can keep an eye out for the LG
g3 hopefully soon it certainly feels
nice comes in five different metallic
colors 20 a dimension it has a micro SD
card slot finally but the LG g3 does
have a removable battery which is nice
and has that micro SD card slot plus and
on the back you will not find a heart
rate monitor you will find a power
button a return to that design but it is
redesigned here to be a little easier to
turn on and off i'm scott stein this is
the LG g3 here in new york
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
