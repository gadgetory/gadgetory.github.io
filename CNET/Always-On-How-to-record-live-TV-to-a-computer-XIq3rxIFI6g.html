be able to take what I record on my TV
and transfer it to my computer well
until they fix that there is a solution
it's called an HD PVR
and today I'll show you how to record
live TV directly on to your computer but
before we continue you should know that
CBS Interactive does not condone or
encourage illegal duplication or
distribution of copyrighted content okay
with that out of the way we can get
started here's what you'll need you'll
need an HD PVR I got this from ho posh
on amazon.com for about two hundred
dollars you'll also need your source for
me that's my cable box but it can also
be your TV or even a gaming console
lastly you'll need a computer now let's
get everything linked up so first I'll
connect the HD PVR to my cable box I'm
using component cables because right now
you can't use HDMI component is the best
quality you'll get that will give me
720p video which looks really good on a
computer and on mobile devices so once I
have it hooked up to my HD PVR I'll hook
everything up to my cable box okay this
isn't rocket science we'll just match up
all the colors that's all set now the
last thing I need to do is connect my
computer to the HD PVR it uses USB 2.0
because right now 3.0 isn't available ok
everything is linked up and it really is
that easy now we should be able to see
what's on my TV on my computer screen so
I'll launch the software that came with
the HD PVR it's called Total Media
Xtreme as soon as I launch it there it
is I can see what's on my TV right here
before we start recording we have to
change a few settings so I'll go into
format settings and here's what's
important you want to take a look at the
max bitrate this will determine the
video quality and the file size so the
lower the bitrate the worse the video
quality and the higher the bit rate the
better for me I'm going to choose seven
megabytes per second that will give me
pretty decent video and a smaller file
size so that's all set I'll hit OK
lastly I'll choose the format of the
video I'm doing mp4 so that I can put on
my Android phone and in my Google Cloud
Drive but if you're burning it to a DVD
or a blu-ray you're going to want to
choose TS we're all set and we're ready
to capture so I'll hit play on my cable
box and the video and the audio come
rolling through here
I'll hit capture and my video is
recording I'll let this run for a couple
minutes and then I'll show you what it
looks like when it's done alright I
think that's enough video I'm going to
hit stop I'm going to pause my DVR and
right now the file is saving and I set
it to save in my video folder so let me
show you what that looks like
alright my videos let me open up for you
and there it is playing on my computer
and you'll see just how good this
quality is even at seven megabytes per
second and you saw how easy that was now
if I was recording an entire movie it
would be a much larger file size and it
would of course take longer because
you're recording in real time now that I
have this on my computer I'm going to
transfer it onto my phone I'll show you
what that looks like so pause the video
just plug my android phone it's the
computer and of course what's easy about
this is that it's just drag-and-drop if
you have an iPhone it might take some
converting again if you recorded a movie
it's going to take much longer to
transfer onto your mobile device but
that's the price you pay right so for
this example you notice that I'm using a
PC if you use the HD PVR with the Mac
you're going to purchase a $30 program
but what comes with the HD PVR that
software is free for PC
alright the video is transferred let's
see what it looks like
should show up in my video app there it
is this video that was on my TV is on my
phone and it worked just like that now
as you witnessed that was super easy and
once you have all the components set up
in your media cabinet
it'll take no time to record live TV
onto your computer now if you do make a
habit out of doing this you will want to
buy an external hard drive okay if you
have any questions along the way or want
to know more about the HD PVR tweet me
