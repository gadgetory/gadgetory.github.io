update is just chewy enough to give your
teeth a workout if you're using a nexus
device like the 6p 5x pixel c or nexus 9
then congratulations you'll be the first
to receive the update as usual other
android users will have to wait months
maybe even years for carriers and
manufacturers to roll out the update
let's hope you like kit kats and
lollipops if nougats new features were
candy bars here's how that rate double
tap the overview button and flick back
and forth between two recently used apps
it's simple and it works making you
wonder why stock Android never had this
before the nougat reading this one's a
Toblerone it's the perfect balance of
honey almond nougat and chocolate
something that you'll want to use or eat
every day hold the overview button down
and split the screen in half to run two
apps side-by-side watch a movie in one
pane write an email on the other but
it's a little buggy with some apps like
games plus using it on a smaller phone
screen can feel cramped the nougat
rating this one's a 3 Musketeers bar
overall functional but it's a little bit
bland plus if you are a samsung galaxy
owner this is old news no need to go
into an appt to reply just do it direct
from the notifications shade and
notifications now collapse or expand as
you need nougat rating this one is a
baby route there's a little bit of
something for everyone notifications are
grouped by app which is actually really
useful why would you want individual
notifications that's like having peanuts
without extra caramel and chocolate good
but you know there's always something
better nougat comes with 72 new emojis
talk to the hand sick guy I don't want
no salad with my bacon for now you'll
only be sending these messages to
yourself or other nougat users until
Unicode nine rolls out on other devices
everyone else will just see this reading
emojis are so popular this one is
definitely a Snickers bar now for what
you don't see dos keeps bad
usage low when you're not using the
phone and the screen is off but unlike
the version in marshmallow your phone
doesn't have to be stationary for doze
to take effect tweak it for individual
apps by going into settings battery
battery optimization and finding all
apps apps with the word optimizing
battery use are affected by doze but you
can switch it off on individual apps by
choosing the don't optimize option
nougat reading big hunk the one that
everyone always forgets about but it
comes back with a bang and that's nougat
in a nutshell for more new features and
analysis go to cnet com but if you'll
excuse me I think I need a trip to the
dentist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
