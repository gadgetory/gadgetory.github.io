we're going to be looking at the quirky
egg minder I come from a long line of
grocery store owners for whom expiration
dates tend to be more of a suggestion
rather than a hard and fast rule as such
I know that growing up I ate eggs that
were far past the recommended expiration
date so when we first got the quirky egg
minder and I was really excited because
it seems like a very elegant solution to
a common food waste problem I know that
if you're anything like me and my family
you forget that you have eggs in your
refrigerator and will run out and buy
more when you're at the store and then
you end up before you know it with three
cartons of eggs in your fridge they're
all about to expire and while it may
seem like an elegant solution to this
food waste problem it is also an
expensive one the egg minder retails for
69 dollars making it an expensive
kitchen gadget that you really don't
need I say it's not really worth it
because while I do think it's a really
great concept and I like the idea of a
kitchen gadget that does this function
for you it's not as smart as I would
like it to be it places a time stamp on
eggs that you put inside of it and marks
the day that it arrives which is
information that communicates back to
the cell phone app and this app is
available on tablets and smartphones but
even with that connectivity it doesn't
really give you enough information to go
off of granted you can customize how
long you trust your eggs to be good but
I don't really want that I want the egg
minder to tell me how long my eggs will
be good without me programming it to
believe that it's four or five weeks in
addition if you get out four eggs
because you think you need them but the
recipe only calls for three if you put
the egg back in the egg minder in my
test anyways it will recognize it as
being a new egg meaning that even if
it's a two week old egg the egg minder
won't recognize that and will perceive
it as a fresh new latest addition to the
egg collection this is kind of my
opinion of all of the quirky products
that we've seen so far and that they all
have these great concepts for things
that would really make your life a lot
easier if they were more fully realized
if however price points don't concern
you and you are really in the market
for a kitchen gadget that looks cool and
might make your life somewhat easier the
a grinder does work on a basic level as
it promises speaking for myself in terms
of kitchen gadgets if I were going to
spend that kind of money I'd probably
take that $69 and spend it elsewhere for
