that second annual live torture test
from CES 2014 i'm brian tong and here
with me is built a twylar managing
editor with CNET partner TechRepublic
bill thanks for hanging out with us
buddy hey thanks for having me I'm
really excited to be here at CES and I
can't wait to start Porsche testing some
of these devices now if you guys haven't
seen this before last year and this year
right this is the second annual torture
test we like to put these products that
we love so dearly put them through
different types of tests that may not be
realistic but also may be very fun so
right here you'll see a little bit of
boiling water you'll see a little bit of
something under this can you can anyone
figure out what is this I don't know it
looks like a big glass thing all right
also we have our 12 foot ladder we're
going to do a little drops but before
that standing by outside to do yet
another test as part of this is Sharon
Vaknin somewhere in this big span of
space the Las Vegas Convention Center
parking lot with a CNET bus alright hey
guys I am just outside of Las Vegas
Convention Center on the sea nut bus and
you know what we've got two more
products we're going to torture today
I've got the Chromebook by Acer and this
fancy Nikon Coolpix camera I'm also
joined by gear MA and yari to our bus
drivers if we're going to help me
torture the heck out of these products
so stay tuned for what's going to happen
you never know alright guys so later on
again if you love products we're not
here because we don't love our gadgets
we're not here to disrespect them but
you know it's CES we gotta have a little
fun all right and later on Jeff Bakalar
he's going to show you a torture test
with Las Vegas newest attraction this is
the high roller observation wheel where
we can see if an iPhone 5s can withstand
5,000 pounds of force that's right I
heard a whoa I don't know it's a whoa
but first we have to have we have a heat
test here to show you we're going to
take this hour if you guys are familiar
with the Samsung active this is a
waterproof phone claims to be waterproof
we have boiling water here you know a
little bit about this phone bill tell me
you know what can this bad boy handle
well the active is waterproof or samsung
says it is up to about a meter for 30
minutes but baten it didn't really say
anything about
wheeling water so the phone usually has
a high temperature range of about 113
degrees okay well if anybody remembers
from their high school science class the
the the the boiling water here is about
212 degrees so I'm not sure if this is
going to be able to take it and the
phone it's about $500 $500 guys who
wants us you know what we can just stop
the torture test and just give this
phone to someone in the audience right
now you want to do that
Wow you know thanks you're with a little
game we're going to play a little game
whatever we do things we have this thing
where we've said like CES or C Ino so do
you guys think this is going to survive
the boiling water torture test CS you
know I'm gonna you know I'm gonna go see
yes I have faith in sampling I believe
everything they say everything all right
well only time will tell
let's see all right I'm gonna put on my
special oven mitt this is what this just
look a little bit of protection never
hurts all right here we go we're gonna
drop this in we're gonna put the screen
up so you guys can see what happens this
is kind of tricky actually use these
palms I know my life oh there you go
Tong Tong okay here we go give it a go
right okay we're gonna get you in there
it goes whoo it's really public actually
bubbling a little more if you guys see
inside that the screen is still on
screen is on it's okay Jim it won't bite
it hasn't died yet it's still oh it goes
oh the screen just went off oh no now is
the screen off because it's like powered
off or did it actually go off because
the water well oh wait a minute the
screens come back on he's alive Arthur
he's alive and we have a message maybe
today or miss all right let's take this
out what happened to give this shot see
what we got here hope there comes okay
here we go if you guys can see this
message it says wait until it has cooled
down before using your device hey all
right
I think that's an amazing tip from
Samsung this is amazing but you know
guess what guys this is a seee yeah
CES CES alright guys we're gonna go to
another test here we've tested the
elements of heat what do you think about
this bad boy this is an ice block with
an iPad Mini why would you freeze and I
have any of you frozen your iPad Mini
before by accident yeah Rob did that
alright thanks the ice creations had
both this fic you robbed okay so what
we're going to do here is really just
test out if this ice-covered iPad Mini
will survive will work go on it's been
frozen for I don't know probably a
couple days it's thick ice is probably
around four to eight inches deep in that
ice that's what you got what do you guys
think are we gonna get a CES or a C II
no C no no so can you tell us about
freezing a product here like yeah what
are one of these things really able to
take bill well usually down to about 32
degrees Fahrenheit is what most
manufacturers say maybe a little bit
less than that anybody who's in the US
right now and are experiencing the
really cold temperatures that we're
having right now so if you leave your
phone in a car it gets down to about
zero that's not really good for the
phone so this is a little colder than
that
so we'll see what happens I mean it's
not really good sometimes with these
frozen devices they will come back on if
you allow them to warm up naturally
sometimes they won't liquid crystal
displays will actually freeze the CLF C
lights
depending on what type of device it is
that light up the displays they can
freeze they can come they can come back
to life if you allow them to warm up
just don't use a heat gun don't use a
hairdryer don't use anything like that
because then you'll just wind up burning
the device no yeah like you know when
even when products get wet they say
don't use on don't use a blow dryer just
put it in a bag of rice yep I have a lot
of rice in my home if you know you know
why right I like rice okay guys so there
we go this is the iPad Mini we're gonna
plug it in the the Samsung act is still
kind of worm it still says that you
should looks like a heat pad I'm gonna
put it in my pants it's cold here all
right here we go let's plug in this iPad
me you guys at home are going to be
see if it powers on by looking at the
screen okay
well see let's give this shot oh there
you go up there we come look at that ice
ice baby guys see yes or see you know
you know what it is my produce like it's
not quite on it turned on let's see
there we go it's the Apple logo this is
powering up it's good ready to boot on
iPad Mini it's not an iPad right it's a
little slow you know what I mean okay
let's see here that's their coach come
on up hello there we go hola
all right there you guys see it I even
guess the right next one was Ola I hang
a little advice too much okay we're
gonna we're gonna do a little bit more
with this later guys all right next up
chef Agnon we told you she's outside the
convention center with the bus Sharon
tell us what you're gonna do have a
little fun out there all right guys it's
time to do our first torture test with a
nikon coolpix camera and to help me out
is gear MA gear ma is usually a bus
driver but today he's a tourist in Vegas
actually gear about how long have you
lived in Las Vegas about ten years ten
years so what do you do around here like
the party Oh sometimes sometimes he's a
conservative partier okay what about a
camera what kind of camera do you have I
have a Sony okay you like to take photos
I like six point oh yeah scenery lots of
bright lights and big allies in Vegas
beautiful Vegas okay so Kira is an
experienced photographer let's say and
he's on vacation on his bus taking
photos outside of the window you know
what he's just gonna risk it he's going
to hang outside of the window while he's
taking photos because the scenery is
just so beautiful and you know what he's
living on the edge
you live on it oh my ha ha okay
okay well one thing's for sure um we
don't have a batteries in here anymore
and I don't know whoa oh my gosh you
guys look at this first I want you to
remark and see how there are really no
oh not much physical damage here the
camera is pretty much intact you know
what let's see what would happen if I
collected these poor lost batteries and
put them in here okay this is like a
little tricky right now where the heck
is okay oh my gosh I don't even know if
it would turn on I don't even know if I
put him in the right way
you know what I totally did it okay did
I
no wait for it wait for it I got to see
because you know we took photos on this
camera come on now oh is this broken I
think we could feel good okay we took
photos on this camera and let's see plus
guys help me out here - plus I think
it's been a long time since I put
batteries in a camera okay so that still
works well the camera is not turning on
you guys watch me put it in right oh man
okay this camera you know I bet was a
little bit of wee rewiring it might work
but for now we totally killed it it look
nice and a museum don't you things may
be on the shelf okay stay tuned because
when we come back we are crushing that
Chromebook with seven tons of bus and
then stay tuned for Jeff Bakalar
high roller torture test stay tuned need

the fastest the biggest and the
brightest gadget in town RV has quite
the high-tech dress on its big boxy it's
made of shipping containers nobody
outside Google really knows what it is
how do you be smart about blackbody you
plan ahead don't assume that what you
see in the circular is a good deal
welcome to see that's the fix the show
about DIY tech and how to my absolute
favorite bit in this car not even know
you
this is going to change your life that's
right
talking to you
okay so our camera isn't turning on but
you know what we still have lots more to
torture in fact we have a brand new Acer
Chromebook and the torture is only
getting more severe because you know
what guys you never know when you're
going to leave your brand new Chromebook
that by the way still has stickers on it
underneath a 7-ton bus oh did I put it
backwards and you know what did I
mention I'm not taking any prisoners
today okay so we're gonna put this guy
right behind it a nice little row of
gadgets that'll have a nice little time
underneath the pressure of seven tons of
seanut bus okay oh gosh I wish you guys
good luck it was nice knowing you
I love you do I smell something oh my
gosh okay there is a lot going on here
guys I don't know if we can even call a
lot of camera anymore
this Chromebook is just a pancake
there's a lot to pick up here so you
know what I think I'm gonna do I'm gonna
gather all of this
bring it in hand to the CNET stage so we
can take a really close look at the
damage
I'll meet you guys there this is nuts
that that hurt that's bad I don't think
that one's going back together yeah I
mean I leave my laptop under a car all
the time
all right now it's time for our big test
Jeff Bakalar visited the high roller
which is the largest or which will be
the largest observation wheel in the
world when it opens sometime in March
that's 110 feet taller than the London
Eye on we did a pretty amazing and crazy
test like I don't know the results of it
but let's check it out see what he did
hey everyone I'm Jeff Bakalar here at
the high roller observation wheel at the
link we're gonna see if this poor
innocent never did anything wrong to
know on iPhone 5s can withstand the
force of this monstrosity behind me the
biggest
observation wheel in the world
the high-roller observation wheel is
right behind us right here to explain a
little bit more about the high roller
mr. Eric ever heart is here he's the
general manager Eric this is quite the
impressive observation well tell us a
little bit about it well we're very
pleased and proud of it it's 550 feet
tall it's the largest observation wheel
in the world as you said we have 28
cabins each cabin has a capability of
having 40 guests on board at a single
time these little pods are pretty big
they weigh about 44,000 pounds and
actually have 8 tonnes of air condition
unit so how long does it take for the
entire wheel to go around one revolution
it's a 30-minute circle Wow
so it moves just under one foot per
second okay and we're really looking
forward to having all the guests join us
right on so this is opening in March
correct late March okay so tell us
exactly how we're going to torture test
this iphone5s we're going to tape this
iPhone to the drive rail and then drive
it under one of the traction motors that
actually propels the wheel around so so
that's the sort of gutter that the
wheels pass through the whole thing
these tires are held down with about
5,000 pounds of force
iPhone 5s it's pretty delicate yep my
money's on it'll be fine my money is on
my 5,000 pounds of pressure on the tire
here you know you'd be surprised with
Foxconn yeah okay I believe you all
right we're going to go check this out
and I kind of feel bad for this phone
already let's see what happens here's
the handoff Eric bye sorry
thank you
the time is now let's hit it boys okay
here it comes
got a good feeling
oh man let's just listen just listen I
think it's gonna be okay
I think it's alright alright thank you
sir
alright we're gonna bring this back to
the stage alright back to you guys on
the scene that stage alright so we have
the box this iPhone 5 do you guys think
this thing survived or what no no some
really nice well no let's see what
happens it enough this is the magic I
heard cracking it's down there I have
endings in here doo doo doo doo I see
tape and I shall I bad did look anything
a scream look at that that only thing
that you can see here guys is if you
turn the screen off and on here there's
a few there's a couple artifacts right
there you guys saw that that's about it
Wow
so I'm gonna hold on to this and Sharon
is back with our phone book and our
camera alright so Sharon you're outside
there right I mean we saw what happened
so let's just tell us what we got inside
this Boston hold it up ouch
