scoop I'm seen at Saqqara tsuboi joined
by Paul Sloane executive editor hi Paul
we are talking about Facebook earnings
be upwards numbers came out today yep
and they're pretty good yeah it was
fourth quarter they showed a lot of
growth they showed real strength in
mobile twenty-three percent of their ad
revenue is now coming from mobile which
is huge everything was really strong
though investors are ho-hum about it
because stocks been up quite a bit in
last few months and to get their
facebook has been spending a lot more
money so to get their ad revenue up 23%
for mobile what have they done
differently in the last couple months
well basically starting last spring they
introduced what's called sponsored
stories which are their mobile ads ads
that come right in your newsfeed and the
big surprise as they just said on the
conference call was that these worked
they're not angry and users people don't
mind them and they're very they kept
stressing how powerful they are because
they have your real identity day of
people who want to be there this was not
seen as intrusive and if they when they
get the balance right and they stressed
it really in the early days these ads
convert to use the add lingo very well
people are clicking through right
interesting no facebook also rolled out
a couple of other new products in the
last few months like gifts and the surge
has that had much of an impact on no
gifts they wouldn't say anything they
said it's tiny tiny they hinted that's
you know the revenue but they and they
hinted that there's still a lot of
tweaking going on with the product okay
they got pressed on this a bit and said
we're just going to have to figure out
the right mix but they're optimistic
that it will grow into something but
they didn't give any timeframe search of
course they just rolled out this quarter
Harry now and this is something this is
a big you know Mark Zuckerberg favorite
project right now he keeps talking about
the trillion things and shares and goes
across that go across Facebook and sees
this as a huge opportunity to create a
product that's unlike any kind of web
search which is social search which is
you know they call it graph search but
it's way too early to tell it's only
been rolled out to maybe tens of
thousands of people right we'll see that
in future course of course what would
you say the company really needs to do
moving forward to continue this upward
trajectory of the start price yeah I
think it's more the same I mean look
there's still at $31 there's still wave
far below their $38 IPO offering price
yeah the last few months have been very
optimist
and they're on the right trajectory but
they just have to keep going and showing
that their mobile ads work you know keep
making their products work better and
better and and just make that balance
work and hopefully some of this revenue
will start to improve from other other
products that just gives and finally you
know with all this talk of mobile I hear
that Zuckerberg finally squashed the
rumors of a facebook phone that's just
not going to happen well he's actually
squashed these rumors couple of times
but he wasn't even asked directly today
but he just came out and said we are not
going to make a phone look to him it
just doesn't make sense why make the
device I mean they want to be on all the
platforms they don't want it just
doesn't make sense they won't have a
deep relationship through Android
through iOS and through mobile web he
didn't talk about the other other
smaller platforms out there but that he
just once again dismissed that right
right why cross over to hardware when
you're doing well enough as it is it's
just not logical for them yeah thank you
so much Paul Sloane executive editor I'm
cars tsuboi thanks for watching the
