thin queue is another high-end phone
from LG available on US carriers AT&amp;amp;T
and Google project five for $900 it
competes against ultra premium phones
like the Samsung Galaxy S 9 plus and the
Google pixel to excel the V 35 thin
queue is a half step update of the
previous two v30 phones and features a
faster processor more RAM and better
cameras it looks nearly identical to the
g7 but with key differences it doesn't
have a black notch nor a physical Google
Assistant button its fingerprint reader
on the back doubles as a power button to
lastly it has an OLED screen while the
g7 has an LCD display that means blacks
look especially dark and inky on the v35
but it's also not as bright as a g7 and
whites don't look as brilliantly white
but other than that the phone retains
many of the same convenient design
features like a headphone jack and water
resistance you can dunk it in up to
three feet of water for 30 minutes and
it won't conk out
the v35 has 260 megapixel cameras on the
back one is a standard lens and the
other is a wide-angle which lets you
capture more content in each frame the
camera also has an AI feature that can
identify and categorize images like a
cityscape for example it'll then auto
adjust the camera settings accordingly
and suggests filters three to one
overall the v35 takes excellent shots
though the pixel to excel is better in
low light and portrait mode pictures
from the v35 were sharp and vibrant in
our lab preliminary testing for
continuous video playback on airplane
mode yielded more than 15 hours of usage
that doesn't edge out the galaxy s 9
plus is nearly 17 hour average but it
does exceed the pixel to excels 14 hour
time the V 35 is a great phone and it
matches the galaxy s 9 plus nearly spec
by spec however the s 9 plus is only 15
dollars more on AT&amp;amp;T and it has a
slightly bigger battery and screen and
software goodies like iris scanning and
Bixby
as for the pixel to excel it takes
better pictures than the V 35 even
though it came out last year but if you
need a new phone right now and can't
wait for the rumored pixel 3 in October
the $50 more you'll hand over to project
5 for the V 35 is worth it to
future-proof your phone with a newer and
much faster processor
