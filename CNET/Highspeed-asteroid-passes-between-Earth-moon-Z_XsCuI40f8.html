earth undetected this month and both
were closer to our planet than our Moon
are they gone they're gone okay asteroid
2017 bx came on to observatory radars On
January 20th 2017 and it passed us by at
about a hundred and sixty two thousand
miles or 261 thousand kilometres that's
about two-thirds of the weight of the
Moon slew dot-com astronomers caught a
faint image of 2017 BX and nicknamed it
rerun which I'm assuming is because they
responded the same way late actor Fred
Perry would have had he seen the
asteroid what's happening so why wasn't
this asteroid discovered long before it
got this close to our planet turns out
rerun is a small fast-moving rock let me
paint a picture for you imagine a killer
whale flying through outer space at
17,000 miles per hour you're welcome
actually if you don't track asteroids
for a living you might not be aware that
they pass by earth pretty much every
single day in fact another asteroid
passed by Earth the very same day that
rerun did only this one was a lot bigger
and a lot farther away like a mile in
diameter and six million miles away from
Earth difference so for now we don't
need to panic for more science and tech
