studios it's episode 207 of the 359
podcast my name is bvg and in the house
today we've got outfitting and joanie
souls Minh what is in our headlines so
much stuff and it's only monday as you
said a 4 out of 10 days it is a 4 out of
10 day April 10 so we've got three great
stories today we're leading with Jones
story about her interview with the
father of the Internet Vint Cerf who is
pretty disappointed with the lack of a
tech accessibility going on on the
computer which is you know everything
should be amazing but it isn't then
we've got another great story up coming
out of Louisville Kentucky basically
about a hack up a weekend hackathon that
all these coders go through they
volunteer their time to make the city
you know kind of like a smart city it's
led to really cool programs that people
that live in can Louisville can access
like you know create helping create like
the smart smoke detectors and like
vacant homes we've talked about this on
previous podcast but you know people
like don't get paid for this they like
volunteer on weekends just to do that
unless you need because if you had
that's why people that's why local
governments can't do it yeah hey smart
coders you get paid a lot yeah and then
um and then we'll be talking about a
Twitter's fumble football aah over the
NFL live streaming and you know if they
even still have a chance when it comes
to life during when they're going up
against all these like giant companies
that you know are pretty good at making
money yeah Google Facebook that all have
money that Twitter doesn't so yeah
snapchat no not snapshots not even like
I'm not I'm I've looked into snapchats
numbers I actually don't know like how
much more money they make them Twitter
they're just like right now I'm a very
high valuation but very very high
they're kind of like Twitter when you
know when they went public anything yeah
time will tell yep if they know how to
make money too um but yeah I don't do
you want to get started or yeah let's
hang out everybody we're gonna go ahead
and get our little bite-sized three
minutes and 59 second podcast recorder
that you can download later at your
leisure and then we'll be back in a
couple of minutes and we'll be joining
you in the chat and doing a little
QA as we do every single weekday here
from cnet now hold on a second we're
doing a hackathon so let me hack he's
tight and I'm in welcome to the 359
where we talk about the top tech news of
today and all the other crap we want to
throw in I'm Alfred Aang and I'm Joanie
Salzman don't you spoke with Vint Cerf
the father of the internet and his
thoughts on tech accessibility recently
he's hearing impaired and mentioned how
awful it is that computers haven't
really adapted well to the way you know
people need assistive technology now why
was he so frustrated by Tech Tech's lack
of a growth with it with accessibility
right his frustration I think stems from
the fact that for a long time
accessibility isn't something that's
baked into a design process it's
something that designers programmers
hardware makers kind of sprinkle on at
the end and he was encouraged that
things are starting to change that
there's more for thought into making
things accessible at the beginning
rather than at the end but it's to his
point it's been a long time for that
sort of attitude kind of start to take
hold now when he was helping create the
internet though how much of that was it
was the thought in his process yeah yeah
well he suffered people who don't know
Vint Cerf helped on the DARPA project
that's the underpinning for the internet
and he also was instrumental in the
beginnings of email emails one topic are
one technology that was helpful for him
as someone who's hearing impaired when
you're using email you don't have to
strain to hear somebody you can know
exactly with precision what they're
trying to say because they just wrote it
out for you so that was helpful for him
his wife asst was also profoundly blind
I'm sorry profoundly deaf before she had
cochlear implant surgery in the 90s um
and he thought it was gratifying that in
order for her to find that technology
she used email and the internet to
figure out that it existed and set it up
right so our colleague in Kentucky
Ashley Clark Thompson detailed how
volunteer coders in Louisville are
helping build a smart city so on
weekends they volunteer in hackathons
where they create projects where you
know everyday citizens can just go
through public data really easily they
can find out like kind of cool things
like what crimes
and in certain neighborhoods or what
days trash pickups are without having to
go through all this you know bureaucracy
stuff so these projects you know
actually led to some pretty cool
features Louisville like they have these
smart smoke detectors that are you know
if there's a fire in a vacant home it'll
be able to pick that up and there's
another voices system for your google
home or your echo that they created
which can tell you like the air quality
around your town now I mean I'm
wondering you know wouldn't it be cool
to have the features like these in like
every city where you know what would
your idea for like in New York if they
had something like this what would you
want oh my gosh an easy way to complain
about bad smells and restaurants can we
do that can we turn 311 into something
that's hackathon so it actually works I
mean what do we really cool you know how
like on the restaurants in New York they
always have like the the grades out
there a baby what your grade pending
insatiable matter what yeah yeah I mean
that I feel like that should be
something integrated in with like Google
Maps and then so last Tuesday amazon
announced that would be streaming the
nfl's thursday night football games
which twitter had last year they clearly
outbid Twitter for 50 million dollars
and you know for Twitter that's that's
pretty bad i mean they're they're big
focus is on live streaming and you know
right now without the NFL which is you
know America's most popular sport you
know they're pushing hard for MLB
America's pastime but as far as a live
streaming video platform does Twitter
kind of still have a leg to stand on
after losing like this big deal yeah i
mean this definitely speaks to the fact
that that amazon and google's people
that are not struggling like twitter as
they have the ability to kind of kick
the legs out from underneath and what
are what are kind of fighting on so many
fronts that even the thing that its
banking on to be the the thing that
distinguishes it it can't compete and
that makes it hard well what is it that
twitter has that you know that stick
makes it stand out right and a lot of
ways live streaming video and to make a
lot of sense because Twitter is such a
live based platform but it's also a
hobbled platform it doesn't it doesn't
make money it's having a hard time
making money it's having a hard time
keeping it so its users well thanks
again for listening and be sure to check
us out on cnet I'm Alfred dang I'm Joni
salzman
and we are back and hopping into the
chat room and we got a good question
well not a question more so a profound
statement uh the internet is now filled
with cats so what's disappointing about
that little dog lovers are very very
easy I thought that was just a profound
statement question response however to
the hacking app Pell Dean's an easy app
that can give instant info on bad things
about companies they talking about us I
mean I think that's Twitter actually
yeah right I mean well I mean to an
extent you've got Yelp yeah but more
maybe you're saying more rating systems
more or less about a dining experience
or personal experience as in the review
section of like an Amazon transaction
fleshed out maybe that might not be
merely it might also be talking about
like companies that do like awful things
well yeah like maybe if in order
countries especially since we're talking
about local government if there was a
way to know like which pediatricians in
your area have been sued the most you
know like probably don't want to that
might not show up on yeah that's like
things that usually are in you know like
I know reporters that have to do that a
lot where there was like a big feature
story last year basically about like
which child care centers had been like
so yeah exactly I more like which
contractors yes basically trying to find
data projects that you see in newspapers
like I feel like that'd be something
really interesting is like in real time
yeah pretty much yeah Danny Green our
old buddy how about beacons that
broadcast restaurant ratings and or
health code ratings for any business
requiring expansion that's actually
pretty good idea yes good idea I again
rounding out something we kind of
already have into a more robust thi
presentation yeah that's the cool thing
about their projects it's basically it's
taking something that like is all out
there that you can find on your own but
it's one of those things where it's like
you have to go through so many hoops to
be able to get it and then it usually
comes in like a PDF form that you can't
search where it would be so much better
if it were you know and that's whether
they're working to make like I don't
even think there's like a centralized
way to find all these like restaurants
and stuff yeah I know in New York they
have this really cool project but uh
where it's basically like you can add
we find every single tree in New York
City like it's like a tree's data
project they tell you like how long it's
been there for some a kind of tree it is
and like if you want a tree planted on
your block like like there's no tree on
it you can like request the city to come
and like plants a tree like that yeah I
always liked the idea of parking space
oh yeah yeah we're like oh thank you get
into a parking garage and you know like
I've seen some of them start to
implement actual like traffic lights
above spaces but that's pretty far and
few in between but the idea that you
could go in and like say it's it's a
it's a chain store and target you just a
target parking app kind of thing it
pings your location as soon as you log
in on your smartphone and it tells you
Lane c5 on the fifth level is available
as a room yeah the only the only thing
that New York has done so far as far as
parking and technology is that they've
made it easier for you to pay your meter
which is nice to you know you don't have
to leave a restaurant in the middle I
need to fill up my meter again but to
find a parking space is definitely I
think a lot more important than you know
being able to pay it but you know the
city's gonna make money somehow yeah
Doug be is requesting social media for
pets Doug I'm sorry I already exists
it's called Instagram unless they mean
like like your dog is allowed to Like
Tweet and stuff well it didn't they
experiment with that wasn't there some
interactive collar add-on thinking that
they could put on a dog Isis interpret
it I saw actions I saw something like
that but it wasn't um it wasn't like an
interactive collar that could interpret
it was more so like it was like this
kind of like raspberry pi kind of
project where every time like the dog
like went out for a walk or something
would like automatically like tweet out
like how far it's walking or something
like that they're like a Fitbit thing
but until we need a Fitbit for your dog
which I think that exists I'm sure it
does actually I mean I guess that's not
a terrible idea if somebody's trying to
get their pet healthier you got an
overweight dog or an overweight cat I
hit one of those myself we visualize
like the people that are in my facebook
feed which are like I read three miles
it's four seconds this morning yeah rate
your dog is an athletic I locked up my
stairs
um I would actually pay to see like a
reality show based around that when you
and it'll be like so niggas loser for
pets oh so many people would watch that
we got a few minutes left in the show
farming out more questions or requests
or wish lists for this hacking project
what else I'm sorry I'm brain farting
it's Monday what else we talked about
this way oh the accessibility yes and
Twitter the man who helped invent the
Internet let's flesh that out a little
bit since we're well I mean one thing
I'll say is talking about surf um you
can appreciate like just talking to him
you're like this person is so much
smarter than me like man um not by like
throwing out fat like he doesnt sit
there and throughout facts or like
impress you with things that you can't
understand you can just tell that his
mind is more thoughtful in a way that
most people aren't able to think I mean
I each I agreed with his argument about
how it's like why are people thinking
about accessibility like an afterthought
oh we made this whole thing oh oh crap
we forgot to make it one of the things
you mentioned is that it's such a youth
skewing design system um so many young
people work on it and one of the like
nature's of being young as you don't
think about the fact that you're
eventually going to be able to not be
able to see very well or I don't think
about that you're most likely than most
likely you're gonna be more able-bodied
like young people just haven't had the
chance maywood unless they were born or
um you know Warren had a disability her
to them through the very early part of
their life then they don't probably they
don't specifically like call out though
like you know computer developers for
that issue because i know that in like
the gaming world that's like that's a
part of their process like when they get
started right now people that are
advocating for video game accessibility
they they're trying to get people to get
started from that straight from the
beginning because it's way more cost
effective that right but i think so the
answer your question I think the reason
is that with gaming there's a reward
system built in if you have
accessibility in your game because it
means that you'll be able to sell your
game to a lot more people and make your
game more accessible even to know people
able-bodied people yeah don't I disabil
some of them like to use disability
features because it makes them be able
to perform back yeah um so there's
already a reward built-in what his
argument was that there haven't been
enough a war rewards built into other
types of computer and technological
design to get people to start thinking
about it earlier and that's part of the
problem is that there's not I don't know
if it needs to be artificial or not um
but there's not like a reward system
building this is he is it kind of more
advocating though for like a like a
requirement thing like it's like like a
law that like yeah be able to do this or
as Eve gifs more saying like guys like
this is what you should be doing I think
it's a mixture of both okay um yeah it's
not in the interview I had with him but
in some comments he made on the
sidelines of talked about South by and
so he had a panel there and he mentioned
that there needs to be a mixture of like
people accepting responsibility
especially like big corporations that
have the power to set rewards for their
employees um and all southern east that
they're a prong of it should be also
some sort of legislation I was just
going to bring that up i gotta be wonder
if that's gonna be something that will
be regulated sometime in relative future
cuz i mean you have to have wheelchair
ramps and public buildings and so on and
so forth i wonder if that will have to
become part of the lexicon for maybe
yeah cuz there's really no guidelines
like that like as part of the law for
you know just browsing around online
right which i agree there should be and
at this point a consumer is a consumer
as a consumer they want everybody that
they can to be able to get full on in
one hundred percent hmm that's a thought
sumukha says how could the Internet of
Things take away our jobs are we heading
towards jobless future due to Internet
of Things and AI depends what your job
is yeah I mean all right so think about
it let's go back a few decades it's not
centuries and there were steam engine
operators and eventually that technology
became obsolete they have repurposed
themselves like technology will
perpetually obsolescence yeah eyes you
need to actually find new ways to make
yourself relevant so if your specialty
becomes no longer desirable yes that
sucks and yes us here at this table will
probably feel that burn eventually in
our lives everybody will but that
doesn't mean that jobs are going away
just because a robot is going to start
working that manufacturing line is I
mean they don't need an engineer doesn't
need to make that way yeah but on on
that questions note though as but as far
as like related to like the Internet of
Things I mean unless your job is to you
know change a light bulb all the time or
like change colors like well I really
you know this is more so about like
making things you know more accessible
and you know easier for you at home yeah
unless you're talking about like other
cuz like technically like a smart cars
the Internet of Things and if anything
rude yeah that you know that would you
know completely drive out the entire car
service industry and you know the taxi
industry and all that so that's that's
one field where that would happen but
they still need mechanics and zoom okay
I'm you say I'm a mechanical engineering
student you're golden you're you're
saying we will always need you let's
take one quick side step into video
streaming before we call it a day jeffer
asks do you think YouTube will continue
to dominate the video format it's the
only format that's truly paying its
creators absolutely I think YouTube will
be dumb as remember how long it really
took for them to get legs though like
well I don't want them yeah yeah but I
had that's the thing that made the
difference is that they were able to
invest in the kind of infrastructure in
order to deliver this like mind-boggling
amount of video upload and delivery
maybe it happened like maybe because it
happened when I was like much younger
but like I don't remember like it taking
long to blow up I just remember one day
like everyone was just on youtube I mean
I I was there during the apex I'm a
little older than you little little me a
little but I remember when YouTube is
novelty mm-hm and as great as it is now
everyone just kind of like well this
will probably never really amount to
much this is a great brain dump content
no one thought it could be a viable
money-making machine that's the thing
like I think when it first came out like
none of us I was never really thinking
about it unlike the the business and
where I was like this is a cool website
Oh everyone's on it so that's awesome
that's Twitter yeah but YouTube did not
Twitter itself yes you figure out how to
capitalize mm-hmm you gotta wonder who
the next one because there's got to be
another one coming well the reason what
Twitter is able to capitalize because so
with Twitter I'm sorry youtube twitter
and youtube they're both ad based
platforms
and the crucial thing for advertising to
make money for a company is it needs
scale and that's what YouTube has in
spades it is crazy scale like three
billion people use youtube or something
like that it's insane Twitter doesn't
have that 12 billion or 12 million of
them are BOTS Twitter doesn't have that
kind of scale it's a fraction of it so
that's where the kind of power dynamic
the difference between the two so that's
why twitter is also trying to go into
this hey we're live with a live platform
where we're live stuff happens live
stream here but they don't have the
ability to kind of deliver on
competitively because everyone wants to
do live stream yeah I mean like I'm
surprised Twitter it like they're trying
to become more of like a media
organization now where I found out about
the Syrian air strike like through
Twitter and that was a push notification
I wasn't even on Twitter I was like at
dinner and I just saw it like oh that's
cool Twitter's doing news now I guess
but yeah I do just find like a moment
like a moment no no no no it was a push
notification I was like from Twitter oh
really yeah wasn't somebody that I fall
oh it was like from Twitter that's
interest yeah that is interesting I just
like I said seeing where YouTube came
from where YouTube went where YouTube
still going it's fascinating from the
perspective of how we have treated the
internet and how we've consumed the
internet because the Internet was the
birthright for podcasting taking the
traditional radio program that had since
been named obsolete the live talking
somebody telling you a story a human
being there the sense got pushed to the
side no one wants to hear you talk they
just want to hear the same four songs
over and over and over again and then
they brought back the podcast and an
on-demand format and now the internets
like no we want to re-energize live were
there in the moment everyone's together
it's a it's a water cooler everything's
a digital water cooler now I'm just
curious to see where we go with that in
YouTube and out of you too I just think
yeah I think YouTube is gonna be
dominating that for a really long time
unless like you know they make it easier
to search on amazon in facebook which
have not been that fun um even Twitter
like even Twitter it's like hard to find
like live streams there yeah oh it's
definitely the most threatening to ya
youtube
it's still unclear how Facebook is going
to what direction it's going to go yeah
how much it's gonna how much it's gonna
want to eat YouTube's lunch how much did
one wants to eat like televisions
luncheon there are more than a few
people in the chat to think that twitter
has kind of missed its opportunity wow I
hope not I hope that sweater doesn't
totally die I don't think it's gonna die
any time relatively soon but they need
to figure something out quick if they
don't think I by a thread also yothu
says you're a genius and that's a good
place to round it out everybody knows
everybody loves it Jones white hacked
rolling all right let's close it out for
the day alright thanks for watching
