MacBook Pro with Retina display you may
remember that we unboxed the 15-inch
model in the first episode of always on
back then we had to borrow the one that
the labs guys from New York cop but now
we have enough money to buy our own he
doesn't my name on it packing list
alright and I'm coming up in the world
because i still have my like box cutter
with my name on it let's check it out
pretty heavy box I'm not gonna live
feels pretty beefy they do packaging
well here's our little box power brick
little extra cable their instructions no
CDs in the box of course why would there
be oh this is heavy I mean it's not that
heavy but it feels heavy compared to an
air because it's a 13-inch laptop and it
was all kind of gotten used to that
really air size thing so much beefier
your laptop definitely has that pro feel
oh okay it's open it up and see if it
can come on so we can check out the
retina display while I get it all set up
let's do the specs the macbook pro with
retina display starts at sixteen hundred
and ninety nine dollars and it goes up
rapidly from there it has that 2560 by
1600 display which looks pretty darn
good the base model has a 2.5 gigahertz
dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with
eight gigs of on-board ram the base
model has a 128 gig solid-state flash
drive you're probably not going to want
that considering that you're likely a
photographer if you're the macbook pro
retinas target market you'll want to
upgrade to 256 gigs for an additional
three hundred dollars there's also a 512
gig option or
768 gigs that one will cost you an
additional thirteen hundred dollars the
macbook pro weighs 3.5 seven pounds it
has a 720p FaceTime HD camera that looks
very nice to Thunderbolt ports and USB 3
HDMI out and an SDXC card slot for those
photographers who might want to use it
it has a full-size backlit keyboard and
it ships with mountain lion I was
curious about the weight of this thing
so I brought down the 13-inch macbook
air to compare and I have to say that
they actually feel pretty similar in
weight and the macbook pro is a little
more compact than the air look at that
it's like a little bit wider because of
all that skinny bezel I guess obviously
the macbook pro with retina display is a
super nice laptop I'm curious about who
the target market is because frankly the
pro photographers I know we're hoping
for a 17 inch laptop and not a 13-inch
laptop and also that price I mean it's
one thing to pay a premium for Apple
products but 1699 is the base 1999 for
let's be honest the model that you're
going to want at minimum the macbook air
13-inch and the macbook pro 13-inch
without Retina Display start at 11 99
that's a crazy premium for a display
that frankly is beautiful but just not
that necessary I'm not saying I'm not
going to totally enjoy using this guy
for a couple of weeks and I'm excited to
take it home but i wouldn't pay for it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
