for a cheap laptop and I really don't
mean cheap in a bad way here it retails
for $200 however you can find it online
for about 170 for that price you get
this little machine that's capable of
simple activities it has an all white
plastic clamshell with a matte finish
that's cute and sophisticated for a
budget laptop it's also the perfect
compact size for traveling with
additionally it has an impressive
keyboard the keys feel sturdy and
they're comfortable to type on for long
periods of time it's a nice surprise to
find on a budget laptop lenovo is known
for giving its laptops solid keyboards
and it can proudly add this laptop to
that list what's the downside
well it's predominantly meant for basic
tasks kind of like a Chromebook but
since it's a Windows 10 machine you can
run programs like Microsoft Word and
Excel I was able to work in Google Docs
and have Spotify running at the same
time without any problems however if I
opened more tabs and started streaming
video performance significantly slowed
down and began to lag also its screen is
pretty underwhelming colors lack any
bold vibrancy and viewing angles are
abysmal thankfully it has a 180 degree
hinge that allows it to fold all the way
back this means you can probably find a
good viewing angle no matter what
position you're sitting in for under
$200
the Lenovo IdeaPad 110 s is a good value
but it will only appeal to those
interested in a portable laptop for
writing if you're a college student on a
shoestring budget or a writer with
simple needs this laptop could be up
your alley</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
