cars with a top five that took us a
whole year to make its CNET's
top five highest rated cars of calendar
year 2015 these are various model years
but we reviewed them in 2015 and they
are being ranked by their highest CNET
editor's review scores as well as each
one being a winner of CNET's vaunted
editor's choice let's go number 5 is the
2016 Ford Escape now they got great new
looks on this car a 2-liter EcoBoost
engine that we liked a lot available
with all-wheel drive it's got the new
sync 3 infotainment head unit a triumph
and a long time coming from Ford
self-parking technologies available now
roll that all together and you can be
paying $36,000 plus for an escape that
can be a little rich but to be honest
this is a compact crossover that does
nothing badly number 4 is the 2015 Audi
a3 Cabriolet great outtie looks and
handling of course on top of that you've
got 4G LTE tied in to really
sophisticated Google services and you've
got a top that is like a tank since when
is a convertible going to be so solid so
quiet and never make you worry about
leaks on the other hand this guy leaves
out any trace of voice command that's a
little frustrating and the trunk isn't
about big enough for lunch beyond that
though if you want an everyday compact
sedan with a truly useful top and some
of the best tech in the business this is
your 1 number 3 is the 2015 Mercedes S
Class hybrid now we gave its standard
gas engine brethren and eight point six
a higher score than this guy which gets
on 8.3 but only the hybrid version gets
our vaunted editors choice label as well
because he gets in the high 20s in
everyday driving and does all the other
great stuff that a basic gas engine s550
does if you've got to get around and
ostentation and you want to be efficient
this is your car
number two brings us a tie between two
cars that have almost nothing in common
the first of which is the 15 tesla model
s p85d this is the dual motor car even
faster at zero to 60 under three seconds
all-wheel drive in a sophisticated dual
motor fashion and this is the car where
Tesla really began to do over-the-air
updates that grant the vehicles
ever-increasing self-driving ability
it's no wonder you can't pull into any
artisanal coffee joint in Silicon Valley
and not be parked next to one of these
the other car tied for number two also
with an 8.8 score like the Tesla is the
2016 Audi TT Roadster completely revised
finally to my eye at least a great
looking Audi TT you've got an advanced
virtual cockpit like no other in the
world
all LCD and reconfigurable great
handling of course it's a premium car or
the convertible top like the a3 we just
saw that is a work of art and never
leaves you worrying if it's gonna be
leaky noisy or boat on the other hand
it's a diminutive little ride there's
barely room for one set of golf clubs
let alone two so when you go somewhere
on the weekend you got to figure out
what the other person is gonna be doing
our number one highest rated and most
loved car that crossed our garage
threshold in all of 2015 is the 2016
Mazda Miata the mx-5 completely redone
and still an absolute winner this is the
most fun you can have on the road
without being rich nothing about it is
terribly technically sophisticated but
they've hung on to their roots and
continued to refine great
straightforward unfiltered driving joy
there's more room inside for tall people
thank you
and while its no cabin tech
tour-de-force
it's no longer embarrassing in that
category either we want to have fun on
the road and it's our money paying for
it this is our huckleberry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
