that can cost you almost $100 you can
avoid that or at least delay it by
maximizing the one that came with your
robot to show you a few tips I'm using
the 700 series Roomba but these tips
apply to almost all models for starters
each time your Roomba cleans up things
like dust hair and fur get caught in its
brushes the poor guy has to work harder
and your battery drains like that so at
least once a week
remove the brushes and get them clean
for the Roombas nickel based batteries
it's best to keep the unit charging
whenever you're not using it but don't
leave it in there for days at a time
give your Roomba lots of playtime to
keep its battery healthy this tip goes
for your Roomba your phone and even your
computer always keep it in a cool dry
place out of direct sunlight and with
plenty of ventilation if you're going
away on vacation
put your Roomba and what I like to call
vacation mode that means charging the
battery completely then removing it to
do that just flip it over unscrew the
battery door and lift when you get back
recharge the room but to full and then
run it until it dies then go back to
your regular routine eventually you will
have to replace your Roombas battery but
with all of these tips you should be
able to put off that expense for a while
if you have any questions along the way
it hit me up on twitter and check out
