Panos Panay from microsoft's talking
about a couple of new tablets these are
the new surfaces coming in the market
now from the outside least you look very
similar to what we saw last year but
there have been some pretty significant
change is made internally and externally
as well start with the new pro which is
this guy here on my right yeah pro
service pros been an exciting product
for us been a great selling device and
we really looked at it as a team thought
man we got to make some changes but we
should be somewhat subtle in those
changes we knew bringing some exciting
things like more battery life was
important making it faster was important
larger memory and so forth so how much
more better love to heaven you know it's
anywhere from sixty percent to a hundred
percent more which is cool because
you're now in this place where you can
use this thing all day and that's that's
how I use it it's been pretty exciting
for us and this is stepping up to the
new generation Intel chips how much of
that is offering the battery life versus
other no I think about fifty percent of
the improvements from the Haswell update
and so it does have a Haswell processor
in it it's a really really cool
processor and brings a single life we
really did focus kind of every nuance
within the product itself to squeeze
every ounce of battery life out of it
here's the kind of marble of that though
with all the things we did to improve
the battery life we also increase the
performance of that thing by about ten
percent if you want even more battery
life you're now going to be offering a
battery keyboard yeah we don't have it
here but we have a power cover that you
would click in and it would essentially
be two and a half times more battery
life than you got on the original
surface pro now there's some other
tweaks as well I notice we've got a new
kickstand on the back here which allows
you yeah levels we saw that that's kind
of cool we wanted you to be able to use
on your lap comfortably so now when
you're able to get to that second
position it's about 44 degrees when you
get that thing on your lap with the new
covers which we'll talk about you get
such great balance and it really comes
to life another thing that it's great
for you can see how much taller you are
than me the angle for you is much better
now it turns out when you design a
product for like a dude that's 58 you
end up with 22 degrees so this is the
new Pro and then we've also got the new
surface this is the surface to cool
surface to is exciting this product is a
little bit different in philosophy while
they're both designed to be the best
productivity tablets you can buy we put
the best possible front facing camera in
this product so we can light up
and in low-light scenarios you can have
a great tool a call and Skype comes to
life which i think is an important kind
of piece we've doubled the bus speed on
the product so on both memory and Wi-Fi
and then basically that's like adding
more lanes to the freeway when you're on
the internet if we stepped up to USB 3.1
funny yeah we went from 20 to 30 both
products are running USB 3 0 which i
think is important because you're
basically 10 times faster in
transferring files and USB is one of
those subtle pieces of impact on this
product where you can just plug in and
print you can transfer files we get so
much feedback on how important that port
is for people that going to 30 is an
important improvement we've doubled the
pixels on this screen we have
forty-eight percent more accuracy maybe
a different way to say it is the screens
awesome we've taken the surface pro
screen we've improved that and then we
put it right here in to the surface to
product that's been exciting so now it's
about three to four times faster of a
device so this thing's lightning fast
when you're in office which comes with
outlook when you're using skype when
you're on the web all these improvements
but with all that you're right it's
thinner and it's lighter of course we've
got some improved accessories coming out
of this too so let's talk about the
keyboard covers or them here these
products are interesting we should start
with touch cover touch cover is
obviously the innovation that we put in
where you have the thinnest possible
solution for your product where you can
click in the cover and still be
productive I think clicking it in is
just as easy as it was but what you'll
see on the product itself I don't know
if you can get that angle but we've gone
from literally three and a half
millimeters to two and a half it got
thinner now that's paper thin that's
important because when you close it and
put in your bag you just kind of want it
to disappear and then this is the type
cover which is all with actual physical
tactile keys on it this is yes you
definitely different from last year's as
well it is so that is also a millimeter
thinner but that is a little bit
different of a reason this product is a
product people love it got a millimeter
thinner what that does is allow your key
switch to be a little bit shorter if
it's a little bit shorter we also dampen
the sound so it's super quiet so now
because it's shorter it's a quiet
keyboard but it's also allows you to
type faster so we're seeing improved
typing speeds if you're going to be the
most productive tablet on the planet
you've got to have the most productive
the keyboard and then on top of that
we've also backlit it and so now working
at night or in the dark
backlit it just looks gorgeous there's a
lot of fun so they both backlit now
they're both back and then that's right
the battery cover will be someone to
this but a bit thicker and presumably
little bit heavier too yeah the back
that comes with a 35 watt hour battery
because we really are putting packing
power to the surface pro 2 product and
yeah it's a little bit thicker but it
also works with surface too and it also
works with the original surface pro
great so you click this thing in a
surface 2 and you got untold amount of
battery life it's kind of hard all right
i should probably talk to me numbers now
when can we expect these and how much
are we going to be paying so we are
launching these on october twenty second
but they go on pre-order tomorrow so i
think that's exciting for people who
want to just get their hands on it
surface 2 will go out at 449 which is
exciting because we'll have surface 2 at
449 it will have surface RT for those
who wanted a 349 products so the RT
States yeah absolutely absolutely so
both will be there both with 81 both
without look surface pro 2 will start at
eight ninety-nine yeah sounds good and
there would be a new higher memory model
as well there is yeah so we go all the
way up to eight eight gigs of the memory
and 512 gigs of storage and more than my
desktop that's half a terabyte you
should also note that both these
products come with two hundred gigabytes
of SkyDrive for two years we've also
added unlimited international calling
with the skype service and unlimited hot
spots with skype sewing in all the
microsoft tricks every service that you
that you would really want really comes
with it I thought us thank you so much
for bringing this by know you're very
welcome and thank you so much and again
this is kim from cnet hope you enjoyed
