do-it-yourself tech and how-to i'm
donald bell and i'm eric franklin and
this week we take a look at photography
on your smartphone yeah we've got some
tips on how to take better photos and
we've got to do it yourself project
that'll take your smartphone photo game
up a notch but first eric franklin here
is gonna break down everything you want
to know about your smartphone's camera
when it comes to smartphone camera
quality the meta pixel spec seems to
dominate the conversation megapixels are
determined by multiplying the number of
horizontal pixels the cameras capable of
capturing by the vertical ones for
example the iPhone 5s takes 32 64 by 24
48 resolution images that's roughly 8
million pixels or 8 megapixels but just
because one camera has more megapixels
in another doesn't guarantee
higher-quality images the size of the
camera sensor also plays a huge part the
larger the sensor the bigger its pixels
can be bigger pixels means more light
can be captured which eventually leads
to more accurate and colorful images and
with a larger sensor you can also expect
better low-light performance less noise
and more dynamic range before light can
even reach the sensor to create an image
that has to pass through the lens and
the good lens can make all the
difference in the quality of the picture
and its aperture controls how much light
actually reaches the sensor list it as
an F number in Linde specs a larger
aperture can lead to better low-light
pictures and potentially less motion
blur but don't be confused with
apertures the lower the F number the
larger the actual opening and then you
have what happens after the image is
captured the actual processing of the
picture how well an image is processed
really comes down to the manufacturer of
the phone bottom line the camera is more
than just as megapixels with plenty of
other factors from the camera
firmware to how well it handles image
processing to the quality of his LED
flash that ultimately determine the
camera's image quality all right time
for a quick break but when we come back
we're gonna go on a photo shoot that's
right you and Sharon Vaknin are gonna
show us how to turn any photo into a
masterpiece maybe not a masterpiece but
close
you
welcome back most smartphones these days
have so many camera features crammed
into them that you don't even know what
they are or when to use them
yeah it's kind of like HDR mode on your
phone right we all have this mode on our
phone but we don't really know when to
use it well in this next segment we're
gonna show you some insider tips that
will help you figure it all out here we
are the Palace of Fine Arts in San
Francisco a beautiful setting to show
you some photography tips that'll help
you maximize the modes and features that
are already on your smart phone to show
you these tips I'm using the iPhone 5s
and I'm using the LG G flex for example
HDR mode almost every phone is gonna
have this maybe you know it is maybe you
don't it's called high dynamic range
it's a great way to take really
great-looking photos but there's ways to
use it in ways you should probably avoid
what HDR is doing is it's taking three
photos consecutively and then combining
the best aspects of those three photos
into one super image so it's gonna be
great for landscape photography it's
gonna really bring out the detail and
trees things like that we have a key
thing about HDR photography is that you
need to hold your camera very steady
taking three photos if you're moving
while you're taking those it's gonna
look weird
now you probably already know about that
feature that lets you tap your screen to
set the focus and exposure for your shot
well if you want to make sure those
settings don't change all you need to do
is tap and hold to lock those settings
that's great I mean I think that's
another great way to take close-up
photos - especially if autofocus is
having a hard time locking in what you
want to take the picture of being able
to really lock it down with your finger
is a good way to go another great tip is
to know that there's more ways to take
your picture than just hitting the
shutter button on your screen a lot of
times you can get a shaky shot because
you're pressing the screen so hard now
on the iPhone you might already know
that you can use your phone's volume up
button to snap the photo well you can
extend that feature with your headset
and when your husband is plugged in you
can use the inline Mike's volume up to
also snap a photo and use it as a sort
of remote shutter that's cool and then
you're totally erasing any kind of
vibration that might be transmitted to
the phone on the LG G flex you there's a
cool feature where you can actually
activate the shutter with voice commands
I could say cheese and just took a
picture I mean you can also say whiskey
whiskey random that's right
whiskey
another great thing about today's
smartphones and their super fast
processors is that you can enable a
burst mode that allows you to take our
rapid succession of like 20 shots all at
once and then you can just pick out the
best one later on it's really great for
taking pictures of kids or pets or
sporting events anything where there's a
fast-paced action shot you want to
capture you just take all the shots all
at once and then pick out the best one
later on hopefully you get some that
aren't blurry on the iPhone all you have
to do is tap and hold that shutter
button and you'll just see that number
of shots climbed super fast and when
you're done at least on the 5s the phone
will create a thumbnail that you can tap
and then choose your favorites that you
can keep as your primary photos yeah
on the LG G flex actually have to hit
the mode button go into burst mode it's
still pretty quick and then it'll do a
rapid fire boom 20 shots right there
so now that you know how to use more of
your phone's modes and features
hopefully you'll be taking more creative
and interesting photos to upload to
Instagram yeah I'm pretty excited to use
my camera again and have an excuse to
shut whiskey in public whiskey if I can
work oh it was really cool yeah I feel
like my food photos are gonna finally
look decent now that's right but if you
want to get even more advanced Sharon
Vaknin has a DIY project for how to make
your own tripod mount for your
smartphone if your smartphone is your
primary camera then there are lots of
good reasons to mount it to your tripod
in order to do that you'll need a
smartphone tripod mount which normally
cost thirty bucks but today we're doing
it ourselves for this project you'll
need a few simple materials you'll need
a smartphone case hardshell is best like
this one a quarter-inch nut and l-shaped
bracket some double-sided adhesive a
wrench and fine
some spray paint so the first thing we
need to do is prep the l-shaped bracket
first of all I want to give it a cleaner
look but also I want it to match my
iPhone case so I have some black spray
paint and it's really as simple as
putting on a coat of paint so let's do
it okay that was pretty simple now all
we need to do is let it dry for about 25
minutes
and when we come back putting together
the rest of the mount is really easy so
our bracket is dry and now it's time to
put that smartphone on our tripod so
what we want is our double-sided
adhesive I'll take one side off and
stick it to one side of the l-shaped
bracket this happens to be the perfect
size for my bracket but if you need to
just go ahead and trim it so that it's
that nice clean look okay we'll take off
the other side here and place it in the
center of your iPhone case
this looks about right just want to make
sure it's sturdy next we'll bring in our
phone slip it into the case so with our
l-shaped bracket in place secure to our
case the mount is pretty much done and
you're ready to put it on your tripod so
check out how simple it is I already
have my quick release mount on the
tripod so I'll take the l-shaped bracket
put it over that screw then we'll grab
our quarter inch nut and secure it to
the screw now you can hand tighten it
but if you want a little bit more
security just use a wrench
give it a little twist that's perfect
and our super cheap DIY tripod mount is
done why don't we take it out for a test
drive
so there you have it a super simple and
very useful mount for your tripod and by
the way all of these materials they only
cost me a few bucks at the local
hardware store us for the smartphone
case whatever you want to pay is up to
you but you can find them for really
affordable prices online that's it for
this week's show thanks for watching if
you have any ideas for us any feedback
you can reach us on twitter i'm at dawn
and i'm at mid opal and check out next
week's show which is all about home
security thanks for watching we'll see
you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
