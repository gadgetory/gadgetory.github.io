used to be the bee's knees but in the
transition to LCD it seems that the
company has progressively lost its way
while still making good televisions it's
just making a lot less of them
I am Ty Pendlebury from C net and it's
for televisions like the mid-range W 800
B that Sony has shown it can cut through
the fat and deliver a decent television
with everything you need and nothing you
don't this TV is attractively styled
with a black aluminum border and
wireframe stand it comes with a number
of features including screen mirroring
and Smart TV it also comes with 3d and
two sets of glasses but as this TV is
such a bad performer in this area worse
than most even I don't consider this
much of an value-add where the TV does
Excel is in 2d picture quality with
decent plaques and shadow detail for a
global dimming TV and very good color as
well
it can also display movies properly and
has one of the lowest lag times I've
seen which makes it a great choice for
gamers sure TVs like the Vizio e-series
are available for hundreds of dollars
less but they don't have this unit's
effortless sophistication or subtlety
with fine picture detail this is a
classic television which while not the
last word in value will outperform
Samsung and sharp TVs at the same price
this has been Ty Pendlebury for cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
