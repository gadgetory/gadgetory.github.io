from cnet here at CES 2013 I'm giving
you a first look of the yotaphone it's
not Yoda it's yoga with the T now this
is a really interesting device it's
crazy and I'm not really sure where to
start the concept is that you've got a
high-end Android phone on the front but
when you flip it around you've got an
e-ink display so you've got sort of a
secondary screen on the back that will
show all sorts of information it could
be an interactive app it could simply be
mirrored contents from the front of the
screen that shows up on the back why
would you want this the one main reason
you would want it is for battery savings
so one use case is that if the battery
is running really low on your phone and
you still want a basic map and you don't
need it to be crystal clear on full
living color then you can actually
transfer it from the front to the back
you take your fingers you pull down it
vibrates and then after a while it will
load up and you'll see your map on the
back the second way you can use this is
through these interactive apps now there
are a few right here that have been
pre-installed but wait yotaphone and the
company wants to do is actually provide
an SDK for developers to create their
own applications for the back so you've
got interactive or you've got mirror
those are the two different modes 4.3
inch LCD screen on the front and this is
HD quality and then on the back you also
have a 4.3 inch screen the camera
placement is really interesting is on
the bottom back over here this is a 12
megapixel camera and there's a 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera that does
capture 720p HD video and the camera on
the back of course does capture and
replay 1080p HD video now this is a
prototype device so this might not be
what it looks like at the very end it is
quite thick but one thing you might see
is that is also curved so what the
company has done is they've actually
contracted with horning the makers of
barilla class and they got Gorilla Glass
3 on
it's a curved glass so that is a first
the SIM card and the power button are
sort of combined into one so that's
supposed to reduce the number of holes
and buttons on the screen navigation is
also a little bit different here sort of
an a webos style you've got a swiping
gesture area at the bottom you don't
have capacitive touch buttons so you can
basically swipe halfway across the
screen to go back you can swipe all the
way to go home and you can present a
long press to pull up your recents same
thing with navigation on the back
there's a gesture area at the very
bottom or a couple different controls
you can do to navigate this ain't
display on the back you can say the
heart of the phone is the processor
there's a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
Snapdragon processor on this but that
could change because this is just one of
the first prototypes they're going to be
a few more iterations very high capacity
on here flash storage 32 or 64 gigabyte
versions will be available also two
gigabytes of RAM but there won't be any
external storage so that's why it comes
in two capacities phone also has NFC and
Yoda the parent company comes from a
background of LTE routers modems so the
phone will definitely come with LTE when
can you see this that's a good question
they are going to aim for the back half
of 2013 will be released in Russia first
and will come to other markets after
that this is definitely one of the most
interesting devices I've seen at CES it
isn't the first time at launch it was
actually launched in december but this
is the first time that we're getting our
hands on it and one of the first times
that it's really been publicly shown in
the US as well i'm jessica ball court
