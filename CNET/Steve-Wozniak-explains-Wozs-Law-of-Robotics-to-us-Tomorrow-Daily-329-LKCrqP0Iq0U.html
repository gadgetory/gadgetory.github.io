world drone pre we talk about software
that helps you create music with face
tracking and we also talk a little bit
about good years massive tire balls we
also sat down with someone who
legitimately changed the world Steve
Wozniak tells us about the Silicon
Valley comic-con and finally we bring
back back at our hackett with a
fantastic phone game that's gonna let
you play FPS laser tag out in the
streets sounds good to me do not turn
away so help me this is tomorrow daily
trading stairs into the internet welcome
welcome to tomorrow daily the besties
talk show the known universe on ashley's
gather i'm jeff cannata oh my goodness
what a what a huge episode was it
delight it was a true honor i think for
both of us to talk to Steve Wozniak that
was great it really was we both agree
bucket list item yeah uh it was great to
meet somebody in Jeff said earlier this
week and I agree with this great to meet
somebody who truly changed the world you
can you can actually talk to a person
who literally has proven to have
changeable and you know it's the first
time I ever got to be in the same room
with him he does not disappoint he is
exactly who you think he should be not
at all you want is to is to have him be
the exact person he is that's great even
exceeded my expectations but we got some
topics to deep dive about and then we'll
get to watch so lots of the headlines
alright so the world drum pre I just
love that that's a thing can we go to it
yes let's go to there can we have the
world drone pre happen every day of my
life for the rest of my life yeah first
person drone racing is really exciting
to me this is awesome okay so this is
happening in to buy if you weren't here
earlier this week Dubai is hosting the
world drone Prix where many and
difference look how they control it oh I
know it's amazing they have their first
person headsets on and then a gets it I
would get motion sickness maybe just I
know right it's the world's bar spree is
what it would be just a little bit right
and it's um it's really amazing look at
how nimble and fast these guys can fly
these things I think you know this is a
level of skill anybody that's actually
tried to fly a drone knows it's tricky
as a learning curve but what these guys
are doing and gals are doing with with
drones is really impressive I'm
wondering how it would be live to really
see it that's the thing i think a lot of
people are wondering about like Logan
had mentioned that too there's a motion
graphics oh it's tragedy so they go what
a terrible thing um I I really like the
nighttime track to which we'll get to in
a minute but one of our hey TD is a
couple people had said do you think
Nikki said do you think drone racing
will become the next big sport to watch
or get involved with especially in an
fpv VR experience that's how I want to
watch how you mean just put me in the
cockpit with these guys I do think it
would be a little bit nausea-inducing a
little bit yeah the speed and and
quickness with which they pilot these
things and zip around corners and right
i mean i'm sure if you're not the one
controlling it it might be a little
indus oriental disorient ence and then
Derek actually asked so we're while the
sponsor decals fit on the drones the
foot of us they put him on the guys the
the drivers I mean you always cut back
to the guys with the with the goggles on
actually I'm gonna one-up you on this no
one up units cuz I thought a lot about
this you guys a lot about this you
really i love the feedback for this I
really thought about this and I've got
it QR codes on the drums when you lift
up your phone to watch the race all the
logos are like explodes out of that out
of the drone that's pretty awesome
changes as it goes around the track like
you've maybe see a little like
Thank I that'd be kind of RAD AR is the
future of drone racing I just I'm very
curious if the experience of like going
there and sitting in stands because you
know I've seen a lot of drone stuff we
saw a bunch at CES right you know you
see you see a drone and then it flies
away and just a little speck and it
comes back I mean that's not much
different than a scar racing I guess
right every yeah I mean for me I think
it's I mean let's take a look at if we
have this footage they'll take a look at
the nighttime track because this is
amazing this is the right track it's f 0
which is pretty much a Sierra and all of
those lit up tines can actually any one
of them can be articulated into a hoop
so they fold up and around and they
create a hoop for the drones to fly
through so they can change the track you
can see a couple loops there on the
track um one of ours oh it's so amazing
one of our users product or one of our
viewers said the world drone for your
minds we have light cycle battles in the
movie Tron literally wondering whether
someday that's going to happen as well I
can only hope Wow but VRI chemically
working toward the tron future for sure
very true yeah and then Dustin wrote in
said you and Jeff need a live commentate
on the drone race on periscope come on I
know you want you should we should
totally it would be us just going oh oh
oh are we being like I don't know what's
happening but they're all flying around
and it's crazy like I have your big jobs
in the hand rhodri.jones ahead my link
electrician to yeah exactly oh man I
hope they named the drum God they should
be named like horses like Mama's little
drone Mama's little drone baby Oh Mama's
little baby yeah there's no place like
drone oh all just your own buns perfect
I think we are revolutionising the sport
as we speak we might be checking out
some drone racing here in Los Angeles I
would love that so we'll we'll keep you
posted on that but but yeah so drum
racing I think big I think big deal I
think if they can do something like a
virtual ticket I think that's where it's
at where you can put on let's say your
oculus rift you boot in and it says okay
will you pay twenty dollars for a
virtual ticket and you can choose any of
the racers in particular race to check
out their point of view and you can
switch back and forth to different
racers as they're racing I would I would
give that a shot like I said I think it
might be a little disoriented yeah but I
were I would I would give it a shot I
think that's really a cool it's a cool
new way to it
experience a sport I think that maybe
we'll be seeing that in other sports to
wear with virtuality watching of even
football basketball we've talked about
you know football you get you know
buying a virtual reality ticket to the
Super Bowl or to some other event that's
happening I think that that's not
realistic at all yeah I think that that
is a hundred percent going to happen at
some point if it helped it's already
happening in some way but yeah so that
is the drumroll pre if you want to check
that out the world drone pre calm
website as it has the livestream up so
you can watch all I'm gonna be checking
it out it's pretty cool and they have
recaps you want the video that we're
showing earlier so recap from day one
and then day two and then there was some
some of the races 11 there's like an 11
year old kid that really yeah I have
like age divisions or he's just that
good that's a good point I'm not sure
and I and honestly I couldn't guess
because an eleven-year-old might be
better at drone racing than anyone else
in the legit legitimately it I can't say
for sure um okay so let's talk about I
conductor so I conductor we discussed
earlier this week facial tracking
software that can enable either disabled
person or a regular person to create
music with just moving their face or
their eyes the best thing about this is
that it's very inexpensive this is all
just off-the-shelf components face
trackers like a hundred bucks standard
simple webcams cost less than two
hundred dollars to do this so you know
it really can enable anybody the goal is
to enable anybody to be able to express
themselves creatively which i think is
in a really lotta below and look how
cool this works like this person is
being right now like that's he's like oh
and then you can hear like a chorus
singing because he's chosen that as an
instrument and then he can create that
in a track which is pretty amazing stuff
so and it requires such little movement
and I think I'm a Jeanette you know more
and more familiar with the input like
for example someone that doesn't have
the use of their limbs can really get in
here work with it and get to a shorthand
where they can hear it something really
sophisticated sure yeah i think so and
and i think one of the things you had
mentioned was the fact that he didn't
have to move his face all that much it's
actually scalable to how limited
somebody's facial movements are so even
somebody with limited
she'll mobility would also be able to
use a software like this which is
incredible yeah and also I can see
something like this or this being picked
up and developed for computing use or
gaming or you know there's a million
other ways that they could incorporate
this and they took it to a few different
places and used it and people really
responded it just warms your heart to
see these videos it's amazing and they
were so excited to be able to create
music and and he said you know we really
connected with even the nonverbal
patients people who couldn't speak or to
you know when they created that music
they knew what was happening and they
were really excited it's an amazing
thing an amazing thing you know it's
important and I'm glad people are
working on communication ways to you
know get around be be functional if you
have severe disabilities but take it
taking it to that next step to just let
someone express themselves creatively
it's not just about function it's not
just about being essential you know yeah
you say functionality in the world it's
not just about you know being able to
take care of your side right it's that
next step of really being able to
contribute something and create
something and feel ownership over
something it's it's a beautiful thing
and it's really inspiring it is
absolutely inspiring and I like we just
love that story it's so so cool and
kudos to the designer and everybody kind
of working on this project is amazing um
okay so very last one which a lot of
people have a lot of things to say good
years concept for spherical tires why
hasn't this already been a thing you
know like this is this is bb-8 already
showed we can make it happen bb-8 bb-8
your car on a bb8 that's pretty much
what it is which is kind of cool um I so
Goodyear has this idea that they showed
off at the geneva motor show and they
were like what if wheels were spheres
what if it just was like putting your
car on for basketballs right super high
tag basketballs so they talked a little
bit in the video you can see there's
some there's some closed captioning
there to talk about what exactly they
can do with these tires a spherical
tired read that looks I know magnetic
levitation bat mo
it wouldn't be using axles so that would
enable using magnets would enable it to
move in any direction at any time so
literally you could instead of parallel
parking car you could actually
perpendicularly park a car by moving in
90 degrees right into a space would be
really really cool and then also this I
thought was really interesting the
design of these tires would change based
on the elements so if it was wet it
would get soft it would create deeper
grooves you'd be able to get more
traction on the roads yeah but if not
then you would have you know would be
ready for dry seems stiffens would dry
to deliver driving performance so I
really like this idea of these sort of
and I'm sure we have some technology
kind of like this and current tires but
I really love that they're kind of going
all the way with it yeah and the fact
that it really is a tire like this is
this is a an actual tire just redesigned
from the ground up I don't know if you
played the most recent batman game but
basically the Batmobile has tires kind
of like this and you can move in any
direction right and i think just having
played that game my money my mind races
and I go all the possibilities of being
able to corner you can corner in in ways
like look how look at this damn corner
it's not just about parking I mean
parking is the is the first thing your
brain goes to but every way you drive
the body of the car is always forward
yes and you can turn the wheels which is
pretty incredible that is such a cool
concept idea unfortunately not coming to
a car near you anytime soon although I
let's talk a little bit about magnetic
levitation to maglev tech because this
seems to be one of the emerging sort of
future well it's it exists now I mean is
bullet train train fast trains use it
right now and two great two great
success right and it seems like we're
really kind of taking maglev to the next
step by incorporating into things like
cars and incorporating it into things
that we wouldn't normally have thought
of before but now seemed very obvious
like well why aren't we doing this in
cars right seems like such an obvious
thing I mean it looks very expensive to
put in a car so I think that's a
prohibited prohibitive part of it but
I'm hopeful I think I'm you know I'm in
favor of
of this high-speed rail stuff the
Hyperloop uses some maglev stuff right
yeah it's uh the the tube actually is
not on any kind of tracks yeah using so
I believe it's like magnetic there's a
football there's a few different design
proposals that all kind of go around the
basic of it that Elon Musk had suggested
but yeah Hyperloop is an interesting
technology that I think is going to
incorporate some of some of the concepts
from Matt I mean transportation and you
know we've built us we built this world
with roads so kind of stuck using them
but stuff like this with these tires
where you can kind of reimagine what the
road how the road Randy yeah be you know
traversed it's it's it's going to be
it's the idea that we're gonna have to
do this because we can't keep putting
the same kind of cars on the road
forever now we can so I'm you know I'm
stoked about it no I dig it I'm into it
um okay we're gonna take a really really
briefly I just want to tell you guys a
couple of we had a fear us right to us
for hey TD and said this is great I
think we're just tired of regular tires
see what I did there oh I see what you
did there I figured you'd like that um
I'd love a good love a good pun guys we
good fun mag love a good pun and I'll
not know him we're gonna take a quick
break and we're going to come back with
the man the myth the legend of self
Steve Wozniak on to our daily so don't
click away
everybody we are here with the one and
only see what man yes and you are you
are talking about Silicon Valley
comic-con cuz I've always loved fun
things I've always loved entertainment
events I've even put on musical
festivals of my own in the past yeah and
so this is a big deal yes this is very
exciting and we heard that this this
came from a fusion of two of the people
that were most influential on my life
you and Stanley listen I met Stanley
about two years ago and he's a hero to
me and I'm a hero to him we hit it off
and they couldn't stop us from pakka to
each other we're so excited we said we
got to do something we got to come up
with something we didn't come up with it
right away but other people around
finally suggested let's put a comic con
together we know how it's done we know
how to do it and stand I said go let's
do it that's amazing it is really cool
and one of the things we really like
personally for tomorrow daily what we
like about Silicon Valley comic-con is
your kind of taking these really high
concept ideas in technology and science
you're kind of baking them into what is
now mainstream culture it's not you know
being a geek isn't a weird thing anymore
you're not a weirdo of your geek your
your everyone and so we really like this
idea that you're kind of bringing these
things together like what kind of what
kind of made you think like okay let's
bring in technology and let's have you
know babak from net from JPL come in and
talk about space or you know any of the
other guests that you guys have yes well
the genesis of the idea was largely
we're in Silicon Valley we have a lot of
technical people a lot of technol people
like the fantasy of the movies and the
science fiction and the comic heroes of
that imaginative and weird people that
turn imagination into products but let's
not make it a technology fair there's a
lot of technology shows let's only
handpick types of technology that go
along with the pop culture so it just
made sense and it was suggested at first
cuz we're in Silicon Valley and we like
doing things different I don't like
doing the same thing as everyone else
ever I like to be first of things yeah
and we're also going to do this
technology plus pop culture idea in
Silicon Valley Tokyo we're working on
that one too that's awesome cuz it makes
sense because there's Tokyo's known for
a lot of people at least in the past
that we're really up on months later
tomorrow it's where tomorrow happens
there's robots there that I still would
like to meet to this day I know as we we
talk a lot about future technology on
our show and we think it's really
exciting and cool that you're doing this
comic-con as a way to kind of merge all
of your favorite things like you said
but also a lot of other people's
favorite things in a way that is not
just kind of pandering to the masses
like hey we're going to talk about one
of the panels is you guys super babies
versus a high mountain well you know
what after reading the Martian and the
way geeks kept all the numbers on the
fly and do all the science yeah that
seen Andy weir speak to author of the
Martian that's gonna be good too but
real I think the one I want to go to the
most is a i vs super babies because all
the time we're focused on AI it were the
goods where the bads how does it come
out for humans yeah and I'm on the real
positive site right now you're the
positive side of a I'm very positive
feel all right tell us more about yeah
tell us about that because I I'd gone
through the negative side okay I've gone
through the negative side if machines
can think independently program
themselves better than we can program
advance faster and they get smarter than
us well economically they'll replace our
best thinkers even our best scientists
they'll be able to think better our
times faster than us or something for
example economic the big the big
financial traits of the world eighty
percent of them are computer to computer
in milliseconds because if you put a
slow human in the loop you lose money
well what if you set up a company across
the street from Apple building similar
products and you skip the slow humans
even a CEO and the company does better
economically could win so that's a fear
what if they're replacing higher and
higher levels of use of the real human
brain there is so much though to do two
robots being a quantity of them and
running everything in the world and
actually being able to to be on their
own know the only their existence is
going to really depend upon us for a
long long time no matter how smart they
are and we're going to we're gonna be
working together they're going to be at
they helping us have a better life we
don't have to work as hard I've worked
as much and maybe only one person has to
work four days a week to own a home in
Silicon Valley now my dream is that was
like that was my dream when I was a kid
when we took one person five days a week
I was hoping it would go to four but now
it takes two people full-time stressful
jobs
they do it with all the brain you can
own a home yeah same thing in San
Francisco so you would say did you see
the new updated atlas that in Boston
Dynamics post this video Atlas getting
the box knocked out of his hands with a
hockey stick the guy had a whole chicken
kept like pushing buckle your pants
poking and knocking them over and stuff
we just so you would be technically pro
robot in that scenario we'd be like hey
stop pushing that robot around I don't
know I'm but I the robots I think we're
going to help us get a lot more done as
human beings for a long time and they're
going to realize that that we that's
better to be friends to us now as a gasm
off had a law of robotics no robot can
harm a human being or by now it's
an action allows how much good to people
who the people who think good and don't
believe in harming people thats thumbs
good but isaac asimov had it all wrong a
robot doesn't obey our rule of Robotics
if it thinks for itself a thinking robot
right feeling consciousness it wouldn't
that rule is only one that was given to
it it's a slave to human rule so I have
losses law no human should harm a
feeling robot when a robot has a feeling
and knows you're killing it turning it
off you should not because then they'll
take a take us on as a type of enemy hmm
no boy like that was it la yeah I don't
hurt the don't hurt the machines once
they do what they say 13 shadows on of
course will hurt animals but these
machines might be a little more than an
animal yeah well I mean and I think they
know if they were you know sentient AI
that we talk about a lot in science
fiction and even now we're starting to
talk about it in you know computing and
everything they should see us as
partners and also I think that human
beings will look at the travails of the
world the hunger and poverty and Wars
and all that I think it comes from our
own lack of lack of being thoughtful so
we're kind of emotional and we react and
psychologists say it comes a lot from
our inner conflict of we're mortality
eyetality and we know that if I don't
win a contest on dying and he's losing
easily and he's living it yeah so that's
why I say they'll harm the robots we
don't want to give them a sense of their
mortality even well we have a hard
enough time treating humans and Pete
well it's going to be tough treating
machines
but I sure but i think the machines if
there's so much smarter than us they're
not going to make such a crummy world as
we've made i really want to believe in
my heart that they're going to figure
out ways to cooperate and find a lot
more to lock cooperation and much less
of the travails we have and that they'll
find a way to have a world without work
and they'll flee realize the importance
of nature and taking care of everything
including humans that are a part of
nature now we're talking about this you
brought up Isaac Asimov we're talking
about this in very much science fiction
terms were you always inspired by
science fiction and fantasy and genre
always always I'd rather read and watch
movies their science fiction than most
anything yeah well suspense is good too
but so it totally explains you know
Silicon Valley compound all these things
together um so aside from super babies
vs AI which i think is probably one of
the best panels I've seen in a con what
what is one of your other favorite panel
speakers happening at Silicon Valley con
con I have always been very poor
anything artistic in the normal sense of
art other than digital art and I'm
afraid to try it and show people
pictures or something like that so I
want to go to the cosplay events and
find out what they do that just is an
observer quiet well when you can cosplay
would you guys play as if I would be so
scared I'm so bad I would be too scared
of being busted I think I think I could
act the part well yeah sure I really
believe that but wearing costume I don't
know do you think that might be a good
way for you to kind of get around on the
show floor sort of like um mm does it at
san diego comic-con hill dressing a verb
amazing costume and be able to not get
mom I'm gonna be totally open going
around meeting everybody the whole time
I want to meet the attendees the
attendees are the important people to me
and I will but I will catch a few of the
panels that are important that's cool
that's really cool that you're gonna be
you want to also be a fan of the content
that's happening as opposed to just
saying it on this comic con I don't even
know who runs ever comes like and i'll
probably watching a lot of other plug
people doing the cosplay and all that
and i'll learn from that maybe i'll be
ready for it someday yeah hey listen
I've when you're ready to make your
cosplay just let us know when we could
debut it on a show he's just and we're
maybe we'll do a how-to you can tell
show people how
bilton because I think that yeah I think
that you seem to really dig the how I've
ever actually intellectually I'm ready
but emotionally I'm so scared do you do
stuff take her Avery do you still tinker
with stuff do you still work on things I
wish I wish I did but I have very busy
life so yeah I have some technology
companies going on and I've got a lot of
speaking tours I think I've no time I
think about it all the time though and
what could I do to bring that fun to
other kids and I'd love to see them
doing it yeah yes I think cosplay is an
expression of that too that that
hands-on craftsmanship that I you're
into something that's your passion it's
in your heart and I'm going to play it
out I'm going to be a big part of this
in my life and it doesn't even have to
be worth anything when we started with
personal computers it didn't have to be
worth anything just had to be something
we believed in and one to do yeah it'd
be worth money there's a big part of the
show as VR is that's a technology
excites you the vr-zone yes exactly run
for this because look at the imagine of
images of comic books and you know and
the visual effects of movies and how
powerful they are and we our computer
screens got better and better remember
8-bit 8-bit game but they look like
little cartoon characters verily like
like anything and it got more and more
real i started looking like a little bit
like characters in hand drawn cartoons
and then they start looking like real
football games and real people and real
movies that's where we've gone with
computers but this whole room someday
could possibly be a screen yeah and i'm
in a whole different world and i can
press buttons and walk through it and
everything well that's what virtual
reality does for us now yeah oculus rift
and I think I can speak for us all when
I say we're all kind of ready and
willing for the holodeck but that's like
the thing exactly off the whole again is
exactly what I'm describing yeah I love
wait yeah we can't wait thank you so
much for talking to us about silicon die
comment it's this weekend from next
weekend I'm sorry next weekend yes it's
next weekend eighteen nineteen twenty
eighteen nineteen twenty it Detention
Center and you can buy tickets so you
should definitely go your get a chance
to me was yeah you get a chance you get
a shock to me was if you're on a panel
you should definitely go super babies
vai pounce I have a feeling you see in
there yes and a lot more thanks a lot
appreciate it
welcome back welcome back well that was
awesome um yes that was amazing I just
love the idea of Steve Wozniak and
Stanley like just having a bj another
hangout just now being being awesome
going hey how did you change the world I
don't know how did you choose a row yeah
just having a chat change the world
meeting I incepted Jeff's brain no I
accepted Jess brain more and then George
Lucas walks in it goes no I did it all
it was me you're both cg uh thank you
again to see Wozniak and also to trip
owner a CEO of Silicon Valley calm calm
for letting us come in talk to Steve and
also we got to talk to Tripp a little
bit before the interview times all great
people involved in that whole thing so
thanks again and I will be following was
his first law of robotics yeah let's
hope we all do let's hope we all do you
all do if it's a feeling robot no don't
hurt it don't hurt don't hurt and on
that no let's talk about back at her
hackett
today I thought I would bring something
Oh not different but weird different
weird it's weird this is called father
died oh yeah and this is they they refer
to it as a first the first real life
massively multiplayer FPS now here's
what it consists have my doubts okay so
it's a nap you're gonna put on your
phone yeah and you get an efficient Oh
enemies nearby and you're like hall
where's Millia where's the enemies I got
to get out here first of all you're
gonna look like a lunatic running around
being like there are enemies around oh
yeah um but that being said you have a
device that gonna call Homeland Security
exactly you have a device that goes on
the top of your phone and you are then
put into sort of an augmented reality
situation where you can go attack other
people playing the game in real life
offline not on a computer again if you
were doing this in the middle of a city
square I think Homeland Security to come
pick you up yeah here's here's the thing
when I was a kid there's a commercial
very much like this for laser tag yeah
it was like you'll just play laser town
in the world all the time everybody will
have laser tags no no it's not gonna
work like that real you might be able to
get a couple of friends about to
download this app and go out in the
world but I doubt very much that it's
going to work as flawlessly as the
commercial the video and insists that it
will yeah it's um it kind of reminds me
a little bit of ingress I don't did you
ever sure yeah my friend actually got
really into that yeah yeah so kind of
rise a little bit of ingress with some
def PS at it yeah it doesn't meet the
ingress doesn't require the sort of
quick twitch stuff yeah I take it okay
so you have this thing called the in
scepter that's that's what they cause
the in sep turn you put that on your
phone and it looks like a looks like a
good like a gun / camera lens like it
looks like a camera lens a little bit um
I just find this very strange and I mean
it seems like it could be fun but seems
like the kind of thing that we want but
I i just i don't use like it seems like
a thing that i felt excited about when i
first watched it but then I started
thinking like one
actually use this and the answer is I
don't know when I would actually play
this so how does it know that your
friend is playing I have a feeling it
too uh it's like ingress where it's like
you're logged into the game so it just
basically has like points like oh this
this person is playing the game so I
point at a person and it checks the GPS
location of the person i'm pointing add
to make sure that that's a person is
playing I can't just like shoot anybody
any yeah dad you can't just shoot a
person but I would imagine like the GPS
would let them know if you were shooting
at someone who was playing so or it
would show you in the AR that they were
a player yeah or a nearby enemy has it
where um this is this this I love the
ambition of it but this smells to me
like one of those things that you see in
the bargain bin at kb toys when that
place existed you know it's like like a
knockoff laser tag kind of dealing I
will say this they are making a lot of
money oh yeah what are they up to right
now they wanted $50,000 and right now
they have two hundred and seventeen
thousand dollars well people are into
this idea they are super into it ah so
happy I don't think I'm backing it for
65 bucks you get to in scepters you get
the app access and then you get a
limited edition IndieGoGo camo weapon so
I mean when we when we all are wearing
are you know hololens and we all have
the the added augmented reality displays
on ourselves at all times then these
games will make sense running around my
phone you know I just don't think that
makes sense yet you know what it is for
me we're adults that's what it I think
for yourself Ashley how dare you it's
that if I was a kid I would love this
yeah but when you're a kid these are the
kinds of things when you're a kid that
let you down because the commercial
looks so awesome and so seamless and so
flawless and it just works and is
exactly what you want is a kid you're
like yeah I'm gonna get my little
brother is gonna be amazing and then you
get everybody invested it you asked for
for Christmas is the one thing you get
you and your little brother both get it
for Christmas and you have it and you
unwrap it you're like oh my gosh and you
download the app and you hold it up and
you go well this doesn't work that was
you preached that so much like that's
exactly your breach of the choir yeah I
get it I get it I know my friend was
talking about spiky
when I when I was like four to 12 14
wherever we want to spy gear like that
or do you remember rock boy from home
alone 2 and it was like everyone yes
this is awesome and then they got
anyways because it doesn't which ever
you heard of mindflex yeah yeah mindflex
were you it could you control a ball
with your mind no you don't Ron oh you
don't rock now listen maybe this is
brilliant it works but I have my doubts
and it's only because I've been burned a
thousand times and the little child
inside of me that asked for it for
christmas has been hurt so if this is
the thing that will deliver that child
into the Promised Land I'm excited but I
just don't think it is I way I'm gonna
go wait and see for now Hackett maybe
maybe we're happy maybe pick it up when
it's on sale at target I would love to
be wrong about this yeah me when this
thing hits it hits the shelves i hope
that i hope we get a father Aereo as i'm
calling ontario instead a father died oh
yeah fine valerio very oh uh I think we
need to discuss what we're into this
week because you are legitimately
bursting at the seams to talk about it
so it's time for it to it please you go
first okay I mean here's the thing
Cloverfield was it was a great movie
there is a pseudo sequel that's hitting
screens this weekend I got a chance to
see it early at a press screening it's
called 10 Cloverfield Lane and it's
awesome it's phenomenal now I should
write the top all disclosure I should
disclose that one of my best friends in
the world directed it and it's his first
movie and I'm I couldn't be more
thrilled for him that this thing is not
only out in theaters but it's awesome
I'm telling you guys go see this movie
avoid spoilers it delivers it's scary
it's thrilling its edge of your seat
tense it feels like a Hitchcock movie
with sort of like a Steven Spielberg
movie stuck on the end of it it is so
great and I'm so happy for my friend Dan
trachtenberg who directed this movie I
want everybody to rush out and support
it so this is this is me not being
impartial usually now I'm pretty
impartial on
show and I will you know tell you about
the things I'm into but this one I'm
into it for two reasons one its my
friends movie and two it's really really
really good I'll go see it for the
marshmallow fluff sandwiches Aloha I
mean alone in the trailer that's number
one marshmallow fluff sandwich I'm in
but secondly I actually I really did
enjoy cloverfield and what's very
different great notices but yeah it's
great mary elizabeth winstead who plays
the lead is fantastic and it's very much
her story and she is this awesome like
empowered powerful female lead and uh
it's thrilling there are very long
portions where I was like forgetting to
breathe cuz it's I'm like oh so good go
see it go see 10 closed a lane go see it
not only because we're telling you to go
see it but go see it because it's a good
movie yeah good movie uh I would like to
tell you what I'm into i miss you alfa
GO alfa GO alfa GO i don't know if
you've been keeping tabs on this you
guys but the game go is a really old
game i think it originated in China like
the thousands of years ago one of the
oldest um it's very easy game to learn
you can get get an app on your phone you
can learn it it's also extremely
difficult to master and is a game that
really relies more on human intuition as
opposed to sort of a linear strategy
like you would see in checkers or chess
so it's actually they say more
complicated a game than chess is yes
that's true that's true and so Google
got their eyes on go as a great way and
a challenge for their own AI well that's
only because we've conquered chess
that's true like me half they were there
were decades there where it was all like
well computers do this it's been decided
computers can do Jess I'm gonna tell you
right now I played chess master 5000 I
was a kid and it was beating me then so
I now all about imperial battle chess
what the animations um so alphago was
created to play against a legendary go
player this guy lee sedol is that is
literally the second winningest go
champion in in the world he's won 18
World Championships this guy is not a
joke and they said okay well why don't
we have a best of five
and you can play against alphago and he
said before the matches he's like okay
that sounds great I will totally beat
this robot they might go foreign one and
then Google can have some victim sort of
victory they can claim victory over all
right guys this robots up 20 to zip he's
just crushing Lisa dull how long do
these matches take they can last I
believe the lat the first one lasted the
video on YouTube is like five hours long
wow so this is a and encrypt but then
there are there are rules where they
will time limit turns so let's say you
only have so much time and they thought
that would actually help the human
player because the robot wouldn't have
because AI wouldn't have enough time to
really consider what moves it wanted to
make all of them so they thought it
would help but no not not so so I Lee
lost the first game and then came into
the second one I'm really thought okay
well a google deepmind alpha go about
halfway through the match was like I am
really confident that I'm gonna win this
and he everybody was like wait wait wait
the robot is like talking smack was just
like I like at this the test
statistically the Alpha go said I feel
I'm gonna win this match like it they
might as well go home hahaha not we're
not that far am not that Barney all
right well we can't make terrible puns
I'm sorry um but yeah so he has beaten
him twice it looks like potentially he
might sweep him Wow 30 which is pretty
intense but i've been i've been enjoying
this and following this story all week
so i highly recommend going and checking
out the matches it's super fascinating
stuff huge for AI because a lot of AI
scientists thought this would not be
possible for another 10 years Wow for
artificial intelligence so this is a
really big deal and you should
definitely be keeping tabs kind of feel
bad for Lee I don't he was he thought he
was talking he got a little cocky I
think he should have he should have
known that it was a very tough opponent
and now he knows he knows the tough
opponent but after the second game and
he after he lost he said you know I
don't know what say I'm speechless wow
it's a guy just I'm shocked I can't
believe that that happened and
apparently there the robot is making
moves that even the most kind of trained
go players are really stunned at they're
saying is playing really aggressively
their moves that
they would have never made or that their
trainers or coaches would have just
gotten all over them for making and he's
still winning so alpha go rewrite in the
rule book alphago are we doing it player
hit the game and the game is gals go
games go alright guys that's it for the
show today let's uh let's finish it up
