look at the Dell Latitude 10 that is an
Intel Atom
full Windows 8 touchscreen tablet from
Dell
it actually looks and feels a lot like
pretty much every other Windows 8
touchscreen tablet that we've seen some
of them have Intel Core i5 CPUs like the
Microsoft Surface pro other ones like
this one are atom powered the big
difference between those two even though
they kind of look the same at first
glance is that the animal ones are gonna
be lighter they're gonna be a little bit
thinner of course they're not gonna be
as powerful they do have really good
battery life however and of course the
core i5 versions are going to be more
expensive the surface pro starts at 899
you really want the $9.99 version of
that meanwhile the line of 210 and a lot
of the other atom tablets start around
$4.99 for really stripped-down version
this pretty mainstream configuration is
649 you can also add for $100 something
like a docking station this custom
docking station for this which adds a
video out and an Ethernet in Jack and
some additional USB ports because on the
body of the tablet itself you've only
got one USB 2.0 port in fact all of them
are USB 2 that's one of the downfalls of
using this Atom platform instead of the
more advanced Intel Core I through its
platform where USB 3.0 is required now
of course you've got a touchscreen that
despite the fact that this is an Atom
processor still feels very responsive
Windows 8 was really designed to take
advantage of the core I series and the
atom and give you a pretty decent
performance in the Microsoft optimized
apps in any case if you use some
third-party apps you may not have an
experience that's as good I took a look
at Internet Explorer 10 when you scroll
through a web page with that it's very
nice very smooth if you load up the same
web page in Chrome it's actually very
stuttery
a lot more like what you would think an
atom would feel like based on our
experience with netbooks now if you're
using this for everyday tasks and all
you're doing is sending some emails
surfing the web maybe doing one thing at
a time you could probably get away with
the atom and and take advantage of the
lower cost associated with one of these
tablets if you're a big multitask or
gonna use this as your all-day everyday
computer by let's say hooking it up to a
monitor and a keyboard and a mouse then
you may want to seriously consider
upgrading to something with a core i5
CPU that really won't be that much more
expensive when you consider that the
performance on the systems is just so so
so much faster I'm Dan Ackman and that
is the Dell Latitude 10</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
