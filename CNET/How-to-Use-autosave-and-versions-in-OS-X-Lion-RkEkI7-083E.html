inversions two new features that are
going to save you a lot of trouble when
it comes to editing documents with
autosave inversions you don't have to
worry about losing any unsaved work
let's open Tek set it to show you how it
works whenever you make a new document
you only have to save it once just do
the usual file save and give it a name
that's the last time you'll have to do
that because from now on text edit will
periodically save changes as you make
them once you make an edit you'll see
edited show up at the top bar of the
file click it and you'll see a little
menu lock lets you lock the file so that
no more changes can be made it's useful
if you want to create a template or just
prevent your dog from being changed if
it is a template you can use duplicate
in this menu to quickly create and open
a copy of that file now if you're
editing the document and realize you
want to get it back to the way it was
when you opened it click edit it and hit
revert to last saved version below that
option is browse all versions now the
autosave backs up all your changes you
can browse all versions of a document
click browse all versions to see how it
works on the left is the current version
and on the right is where you browse all
previous versions along the side is a
visual timeline of the different
versions with their time stamp just
click the version you want to revert to
and hit restore you can always go
forward or backwards in time by going
back to browse all versions right now
only a few apple-branded apps like text
edit and I work support autosave
inversions but hopefully other apps will
be updated to incorporate these features
if you have any more questions feel free
to ask me on my facebook page and visit

this for a cnet I'm Sharon Vaknin and
i'll see you on the interwebs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
