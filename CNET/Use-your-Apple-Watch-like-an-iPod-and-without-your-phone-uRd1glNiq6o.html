without a nearby phone but it can act as
a Bluetooth connected iPod to get
started you'll need to transfer your
music from your phone to your watch the
watch has a total of 8 gigabytes of
storage space but up to 2 can be used to
store music to do that head over to the
Apple watch app on your phone go to the
music app first decide how many songs
you want to sync with the playlist limit
option you can decide based on the
amount of storage you use for music or
by the number of songs then hit synced
playlists and choose your music in my
case I have a playlist I created just
for syncing with the watch your watch
will only import the music when it's
charging and this could take a while so
it's a good idea to do this overnight if
you can now it's time to pair your watch
with bluetooth headphones or a Bluetooth
speaker on the watch go to settings then
bluetooth put your device in pairing
mode and you should see the speaker or
headphones pop up on the list select it
and it's paired now you're ready to play
some music without the help of your
phone go to the music app on your watch
and force touch the screen to bring up a
menu of options choose source then Apple
watch and you should see all of the
music you synced now all that's left to
do is hit play
for more Apple watch tips and tricks'
