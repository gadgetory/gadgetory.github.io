the roost smart battery now this might
look like a regular old 9-volt but I did
not go trolling the aisles of CBS
looking for something to talk about this
thing actually takes the traditional
9-volt form and oh my god impacts and
smarts it's actually kind of a really
cool clever solution of retrofitting old
smoke detectors with Wi-Fi compatibility
complete with its own iOS and Android
app routes a clever alternative to
something like a nest you place it into
your smoke or carbon monoxide detector
then no matter where you are if that
detectors alarm sounds you're going to
get notified since this guy is only $35
if you have a big home with lots of
smoke detectors it'd be a lot easier to
make all of them smarts with this guy
than $100 nest and I'm happy to say it
works pretty well it's simple it's small
it only promises to do one thing but it
takes that one thing and really adds a
lot of Polish to it the apps really
well-designed it guides you through
setup carefully it's also easy to add
multiple users to your app so your
significant other your kids all of them
can monitor your smoke detectors with
their smart phones to an extent you're
gonna get what you paid for here which
isn't quite as much smarts as a fully
smart option like an S protect so this
promises to be able to silence your
smoke detector it's a cool feature
because if the smoke detector starts
buzzing and you're home and you know you
just burned the toast you want to be
able to shut the thing up without
grabbing the towel and starting to wave
it all around so to that end this nifty
looking smart gadget with a
well-designed app is worth your
consideration for retrofitting those old
smoke detectors foreseen it with the
roost smart battery
