telling the real tech news from the
jokes I'm Bridget Carey this is your
scene an update on April Fool's Day
technology companies think they're so
clever by putting out fake news
announcements to trick us all but the
tech world is so out of touch these days
even the real product announcements
sound like a joke so it's time to put
your full spotting to the test see if
you can tell the real news story from
the tech company prank with our annual
game fact or fool let's start with a
smart home iRobot partnered with zumba
fitness to create a new colorful Roomba
robot vacuum it can hook up to your
phone to play music for doing Zumba
workout dances while you clean so is it
real colorful music rumbas could be a
hot seller but this is a fool kitchen
gadgets are getting cooler now that
they're connecting to the internet and
gaming computer company razor made a
toaster that will let you start the
toaster from your computer and in your
game you'll get a pop-up that your toast
is done although it would save gamers
from burnt toast this is a fool those
keurig instant coffee machines are
pretty popular and there are also soda
making gadgets with flavor pods but if
you want something healthy check out the
juice row the seven hundred dollar Wi-Fi
connected juicer is not able to juice
any fruit or veggies that you buy at the
store instead you need to order these
special positive pre-chopped produce to
insert in the machine sadly this is a
factual product if you want to properly
document your life a selfie stick can be
a pain to carry around and you come up
as annoying so you may instead want the
row me a selfie drone it uses facial
recognition to follow you around and
take photos this is no fool it's a real
product there's lots of tech for pets to
the Wonder workshop created the dot and
dash robust to teach kids how to program
but with Wonder paw dogs can learn how
to program the robots to play fetch and
do other games it is a fool dogs have to
put up with all the weird TV we're
streaming these days so shooting dogs
get their own channel dog TV is the
first network just for dogs on directv
for five dollars a month your dog can
watch all sorts of scenes that can
either soon
them or stimulate them it may seem
foolish but dog TV is a fact Google is
always adding new features to gmail and
a new send button puts an animated gif
at the bottom of your message it's
called like drop and you see a minion
dropping a mic and it mutes the message
going forward it's a fool but it really
worked and when you use gmail for
serious business you don't have time for
jokes the prank backfired badly when
people accidentally hit the joke send
button on serious emails and missed
important replies now people are
threatening to leave gmail for another
service I don't think Google is laughing
now that's all for this round up but
remember like every day on the internet
don't trust anything you read from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
