2013 CES I'm Brian Cooley I'm Lindsay
Turrentine editor-in-chief of cnet
reviews you're watching us right now on
a device that uses either a keyboard a
mouse touchscreen or remote control but
imagine a world where all of those
become obsolete instead you might
interface with your electronics in The
Fairly near future by or media by
gesture by voice by eye movement even by
brain wave that's why we think the next
interface is actually you we have three
guests who are making that a reality
today James Park a CEO of Fitbit known
for wearable tech that monitors your
calorie is your activity and right next
to him in the middle of our panel is
Matt Rogers he's founder and vp of
engineering at nest we are both owners
of said products makers of a connected
smart thermostat that figures out your
behavior by monitoring over by figures
out your home's HVAC behavior by
monitoring yours and Michael Buckwald is
CEO and co-founder of leap motion which
has created technology for operating
electronics by just using your hands and
I also want to point out we've got
Bryant on over here on the little dais
right there and he's going to be showing
us some other fascinating technologies
from musics the muse brainwave sensing
from interacts on and also I tribes
retina tracking technology so we've got
a very interesting array of tech for the
next hour first off let's get things
started CNET's cara tsuboi we'll get our
mental juices flowing on this remarkable
trend
the way we interact with technology is
constantly changing and the next
interface is you Google's Project Glass
gave us a bird's-eye view of the future
of how humans will become one with
technology the glasses are outfitted
with a camera and voice navigation to
truly augment the wearer's reality and
when they become available to consumers
in 2014 we have to ask will we ever need
or want traditional computer screens
again that's just one of several
products transforming the human body
into an interface someday we won't need
all those extras like a mouse keyboard
and screen to operate technology our
bodies and gestures will do that for us
the video game industry pounced on this
trend several years ago sony playstation
Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Xbox all have
their own motion sensing devices that
allow gamers to play without a wired
controller and now you can play games
with no controllers and only your eyes
thanks to a company called I tried out
of the Netherlands a mobile devices
camera follows your retina instinctively
knowing when to turn the page of a book
or pop a balloon making touchscreen
technology look passe when leap Motion's
leap that can read your fingers motion
down to the tiniest wiggle its store
shelves later this year while the mouse
and keyboard become completely obsolete
it's about interacting with your
computer in the same intuitive way you
would interact with the real world and
what about gadgets that are so in tune
with our biorhythms devices like Fitbit
that can find out more about our bodies
in an hour we've discovered in a
lifetime or nests smart thermostat that
learns your routine and adjust
temperature based on your daily needs
what are the limits of using the body as
an interface with technology and who's
going to draw that line is wearable
technology merely a passing fad or can
these gadgets in their gamification help
change our habits and how do you protect
a wearer's privacy these gadgets and
more in the pipeline are all attempting
to change the way we interact with
technology and travel through the world
but as they become less like crops in a
science fiction movie and more of a
reality will be forced to answer these
important questions
so let's ask you guys just just kick
this off what are the benefits of
connecting your body in your life at the
hardware in your home to technology so
for health and fitness you know it's all
about removing friction in logging your
daily activities so the first step in
understanding and improving your health
is knowing where you are and where you
want to get to and when we started
Fitbit a lot of the problems with
existing devices that that is that it's
very tedious to track things where a
device you'd have to plug it into your
computer you'd have to remember to do a
lot of things with you know wearable
technology that truly disappears into
your lifestyle you know tracking is
something that you don't have to think
about it's just invisible to lure friend
that just assists you on your goals so
how about you match so with interface
design you want to basically boil it
down to its most basic components what's
the easiest way to do something so it
used to be you know the old technology
we had you touch the touchscreen was the
easiest way to interact with your phone
with you with your device uh but that's
necessarily a one-size-fits-all so we
did nest we thought well what's the best
way you want to interact with the
temperature in your home you just want
to turn it you want to turn up and turn
it down that's the most natural gesture
for that so he built an entire product
around that gesture Michael the
philosophy behind leap is very much
letting people reach into their
computers like we interact with things
in the real world and in the same way
that my reaching out and pick up this
bottle is a very complex but totally
thoughtless action that's totally
instant that's the same experience that
we want to bring to these unimaginably
powerful computers that are literally
everywhere we go Michael of all the of
all the technologies that we're seeing
here specifically out the stage with you
guys you're freaking people out the most
this is like as if it's my match I mean
all this stuff's really impressive but
you are describing to me that hand
gestures are not just very natural but
they're also their high bandwidth in a
sense what does that mean when you're
dealing with analog
human hands yes so it's it's all about
letting people bring the complexity
basically the fact that when I reach out
and pick up this object I am
transmitting thousands of data points to
my muscles in terms of how far forward I
should move how quickly I should move
forward when I should grab and if we can
let people bring that to a computer and
they can sit in front of something like
a 3d virtual piece of clay and they can
sculpt that piece of clay with their
hands and figures suddenly people who
have never created anything on a
computer ever can create a complex 3d
model that's just as good as what
someone would create who is a
professional 3d modeler and they can do
that with no training and in seconds and
that that same accessibility that
extends to all sorts of applications
it's interesting here is that all of
these panelists are taking us back to
being children aren't you doing the
simplest things and getting more out of
them in a sense simple works yeah yeah
we're the things that we thought about
is not just children but elderly want to
build a product that works for everybody
and basically boil it down to its most
basic components yeah I love it actually
yeah and if you watch a child like an
infant interact with a with a computer
or even a TV or anything actually their
first instinct is to reach out and grab
it so it very much is going back to that
most basic instinct I think one of the
one of things I think about a lot is
voice which is not something that is
necessarily integrated into the
technologies that you're working on but
I am have children and I watch them
laborious Lee learn how to write their
thoughts down how to learn how to type
do you think that there's a future in
which that type of spending years
learning the mechanics of communication
becomes less meaningful so I link
languages is part of who we you know
humans are and I language is never going
to go away but the question is computers
keep up so this is a question that
people have asked for tens of years I
mean speech recognition technology is
not new and it's still not great it's
it's getting better but still it doesn't
feel natural yet you still feel like
you're talking to a machine now if
language is one of these sort of main
touch points that we all know how to do
the other one is you know visual it's
such an important part of all human
senses you know it's called the super
sense in many case
it's the one that we really like
television we really kind of zero in and
relate to and get so much richness out
of brian Tong has got a visual
technology I want to go to him here he's
got this is vuzix smart glasses are the
m100 smart glasses that are there an
augmentation to a smartphone's interface
BTW tell us what these are we can kind
of see how you're wearing them there
yeah so this is a think of it this as a
heads-up display that's right right in
front of my probably a couple inches and
what it does is that it links to an app
on your smartphone and enables you to
interact with your smartphone through a
variety of apps this is again the views
expired glass m100 this is going to be
different than google goggles though
right you saw the demos of how was like
a transparent heads-up display well this
is transmitting the video information
from your phone or whether it be email
photos or movies and then showing that
in here and I'm going to just take this
off really quickly to see if you guys
can get a little peek of this to see if
you can even get a peek of the screen
hold on one second real quick there's a
tiny micro display in there that we're
looking at there it is right there very
hard to see but that's replicating the
smartphone display right exactly and we
have matt holliday here from musics and
we just want to ask mike sorry about
that least one actually really quickly
you know what do you see the future of
this specific technology moving forward
we ultimately see this as going to a
obviously a binocular technology
see-through and we see this as replacing
a cell phone one day you don't need to
have a cell phone you don't need that
screen that's in your pocket all the
time you have information access in
front of your eye it's going to be a
natural ability to have that that
information on the go and you can you
can have all that technology ready your
fingertips all right yeah that's uh it's
different than google glasses it looks
like it might be similar but it's
actually a more understandable leap
because we already know we're going to
see and it augmented reality is like
another another big jump that's almost
it's the next step in many ways so I
have a question about how the smartphone
and mobile technology has made it easier
for you guys to work on the innovations
that you're working on and you know is
it is that a bridge to devices that have
a future interface or is that how we're
going to do it for a long time so for us
it fit then when we think about digital
health we want our devices
to really disappear into people's
lifestyles and to do that we have to
make the devices not intrusive small etc
but you know that that runs counter to
having an interface directly on the
device so we think of the smartphone as
providing a really rich interface on top
of tiny sensors and I think that's
that's a very good combination yeah we
did a lot of the same thought so
Somerset's today have very cumbersome
interfaces and they lots of data and
lots of buttons but we have this great
interface in our hands with our phone so
let's put the simplest things things
that you need to use every day on
unnatural displayed cell phone
thermostat and have all the deeper have
analytic features how much energy using
at a program it on the phone it like
let's use the the right user interface
for the right job your technology skips
that all together it seems like it is it
does it render the smaller you know
tablet-style device not so meaningful
well I think I think there are there
probably two steps so immediately a
tablet that has leaf inside it could
still have the same screen it has but
suddenly the interaction area can be
bigger not just bigger but also
three-dimensional so it's not just about
this small 2d interaction surface that
is the same size as this small screen
I'm interacting with my phone or tablet
in this space between me and it which
opens up a lot of opportunity for new
types of interaction which is exciting
but we're also excited about enabling
new form factors that wouldn't have been
possible like perhaps head-mounted
displays where the users interacting
with augmented reality in their field of
view in their vision without strapping a
keyboard or a touchscreen to their arm
or something ask you guys about a little
bit toward your your longer range plans
leap motion as we've most seen it right
now is a module that works other devices
the nest thermostat see it right there
it's a product into itself Fitbit
products are also products into
themselves they're all discrete what's
the integration plan don't all of you
want to be out of the hardware business
at some point and be licensing your IP I
met you're shaking your head no never
actually so Thurman on my wall we
thought you said so I think so actually
so uh that there's a natural progression
of technology uh but there's still some
points in our lives where how we expect
things to work and those kind of shifts
take a long time a thurs has it been
people's walls for a hundred years yeah
and uh in we love being the harder
business and we get a lot of value that
way we can building this beautiful so
that's a work of art I love you know
that's what it's whenever one of our key
differentiators one of our uh whatever
you know key days is rebuilding it's
beautiful and easy to use that you want
to have on your wall as opposed
something that like usual hide are there
other uh nest products in the pipeline
uh we're always working on new stuff I
you know but this team there's there
there many things that we could do the
impression that you were moving toward
something much more of an integration
with other product strategy right yes
they're both are going to play a big
role in the future we really like
building hardware as well and we like
being able to create markets that didn't
exist before and obviously we can move
faster than Big OEMs so we're going to
continue to build products and create
new markets but we also don't think that
users should have to carry around a
peripheral to interact with every device
so the reality is if we want users to
use leave technology to control their
smartphone or tablet and we don't want
them to carry a peripheral around we
have to work with OEMs and we have to
work to embed the technology so both
both are in our future and I think we
can deliver great experiences let's see
me that the Fitbit almost almost wants
to be part of my mobile device isn't it
usually on me and couldn't you build
that into every phone or Madeira phone
and media player because people still
don't carry their phone to the gym all
the time well I think the notion of
interface is tightly linked with the
issue of usability wearability as well
so if you think about the smartphone
there's a lot of times throughout the
day that it's not actually on your body
you know it might be on your coffee
table when you go calling when your seat
being really weird you don't sleep with
your smartphone your Piana swim and
actually yeah your purse etc right
people you know women don't have pile
ones for so when you think deeply about
the problem you'll see that there's
actually a subtle but important
usability issue and I think you know
again the perfect combination is
actually combining the smartphone with
tiny sensors using a smartphone as its
richer interface yeah and using
dedicated sensors as you know the
collection mechanism so as sensors get
smaller and smaller and probably
overtime cheaper and cheaper is there a
future in which we could have sensors in
our clothes or you know in a in it in
any any little thing you might have on
your body while you're exercising or
walking around I think that's you know
that's ultimately where things will end
up I think you know when you think about
embedding things into clothes there's a
lot of additional engineering challenges
that you have to think about but you
know it'll be fashion challenges but i
think you know it'll be exciting for
everybody to try to figure all that out
if you took it seems to me there's a you
all deal to some degree with the the
issue of signal to noise in the
environment because you're all working
with an air gap to some degree if i can
kind of put it that way with leap motion
you know here you are making motions
that have to be intercepted across space
things can interfere the thermostat can
it's got a motion sensor on a few folks
haven't seen how this works it detects
people move by to get a gauge on motion
in the house and the Fitbit perhaps
could you know how it has to filter out
errant movements that aren't actually
physical calorie expenditure how do you
deal with signal to noise when you're
not hardwired in the traditional you
know motherboard fashion that everyone
else is so I mean a lot of it is just
you know smart algorithms analytics you
know with our motion sensor we collected
a lot of data and over time basically
learned how to build the best algorithm
on top of it so all the way is the
feature we use to basically turn down
your house when you're not home we
launched the feature and over the year
actually honed it in such that we
learned your most likely occupancy
patterns based on your motion so in the
morning when you leave chances are
you're gone either you went to school
you went to work went shopping you're
gone for a while and that mourning
period is actually the best time to turn
out the temperature because it's cold
so by basically collecting lots of data
and you know performing analytics we can
figure out kind of the best patterns
that sensor Michael how do you filter
out someone next to me picking up a can
of coke while I'm trying to do my thing
on my laptop well it goes back to the
core philosophy about interaction so if
leaf was about these binary gestures
where I make a sign with my hands and
then something that's predetermined
happens that's kind of what the gesture
control TVs are doing right pretty
simple right what would people think
about gestures that's what they think
about and we don't like that as much we
think that people don't really want to
learn sign language to control their
computers so when what we're pushing
with leap is the idea of interacting
with something that is where there's
context there's an object and you're
interacting with it in this physical way
so we can ignore any noise that isn't
related to some context so if someone is
sitting here and they're playing a harp
in the air with their fingers and you're
moving your hand behind me and it's not
anywhere near the harp we can ignore you
very easily so because the motions that
you're that you're reading and the way
that you're doing it is so rich it's
easier to reject things that don't
matter right I mean if I'm doing a
simple motion on a gesture TV to turn
the volume up and down or something and
a the cat jumps down from a bookshelf
that could be mistaken it's the same
thing right exactly a richer and easier
to distinguish absolutely absolutely a
gesture TV is looking for is there an up
or down movement yes or no we're looking
for how are you interacting with this
specific contextual situation and it's
actually counterintuitive but because we
have so much more data and more more
accuracy or actually a much more
resistant to noise interesting let's go
back to brian Tong I think you are going
to give us a look into your brain as
just terrifies me but let's do this
we'll see how much activity we have
there I think it's a lot wanna know all
right so i'm here with ariel she's from
use with the rain sensing headband and
tell us a little bit about this headband
so this headband has sensors on my
forehead and behind the ears and it
allows me to interact with content on my
smartphone or tablet so this is a nap
right here right that you have and when
there is brain
activity you'll start seeing the peaks
from the activity is that correct so
what you're seeing here is actually my
brainwaves this is what it looks like
inside my head I'll blink for you link
link link so you see that it's live and
it's me I tried that demone it didn't
work for apparent reasons so where do
you also see the future of this
technology moving for you so brain
sensing technology has lots of
advantages the first one is that you can
actually see what's going on in your own
head and then do exercises to improve
your cognitive functioning and reduce
stress so this is the first time we've
been able to you on a personal level see
inside our own mind and use that
information in some way to make our
lives better ultimately this is going to
be another control interface a way to
control your home electronic systems
your devices etc that's in the future
but right now it's about being able to
understand and improve the self and also
um you know it is a fashion statement
you guys were talking about wearable
tech right well that's how i roll like
that eyebrow action for all you tech
lovers out there not getting any brain
waves we're getting some great testimony
about fashion I cool it yeah yeah you're
making me um here's a you guys have got
a party I'm not trying to bite everyone
to interact saans party but explain to
us how the headband is going to be used
to operate the beer keg is a great story
we're at a CES VIP party tonight and
people are going to be able to pour beer
with their mind so they focus on the
beer tab it pours a beer when you're
done you just clench your teeth or so to
make a pedestrian like this stops
pouring walk away drink that's why
Bernie bar anyway so it works I love
that and I was kind of wondering if any
of you have ideas about really unique
uses you heard from your users you know
stories you've heard of wild things that
people have done using your products
yeah we had a user last summer I think
it's in Arizona who sent us an email
about this but there was a big forest
fire in his region and he didn't know if
his house is okay if it burnt down or
what was going on inside but he was able
to open up his app and see oh that my
house is fine it's not too hot inside my
house in lay on fire everything's okay
yeah he does seem like 134 degrees or
something
fire nearby yeah it would've been down
or something you know something would be
different yeah interesting James for us
you know we are device allows people to
track their sleep activity and you know
we had one family where the parents
actually use that gave it gave the
fitbit's to their kids and use the sleep
tracking as a mode of competition so the
kids would compete to see who would get
to sleep the quickness and who would
wake up the fewest number of times right
that is I can say as a parent that is
genius that's amazing what I was like I
gotta go that's really great Michael why
do people done with leap motion that
made you go never thought of that well I
don't want to I don't want to spoil any
of our developers activities but but
there's there's a there's a there's a
ton of things that people have expressed
interest in doing and it's it's been
really really amazing to see the
diversity and I think the thing that the
thing that's most exciting and
surprising to me is just how every
person is passionate about using this
for something else I think there is
something that people feel they've been
missing from their experiences with
computers and it's just it's just very
different from person to person so some
people are saying I'm really excited
that I will be able to you for the first
time edit video at an audio others are
saying I'm really excited that for the
first time I am going to be able to
interact with all of the complexity of
my social networking data in this really
intuitive powerful way and then of
course there are tons of great gaming
things in the work and I'd like you also
do explain a little bit early straight
for us a little bit about the the
resolution of of what you're capturing
because we're all used to touch screens
where resolution is not great trying to
type on a touchscreen frustrates
everyone if you're a little bit off it's
too stupid to figure it out and we're
talking about chorus versus fine
gestures how how highly resolved is your
ability to know if I can move my finger
just as tiniest bit you can hardly see
it can you pick that up we we definitely
can our accuracy is about a hundredth of
a milliliter and I know that that sounds
excessive but it's actually not the goal
with leap is for you to feel like your
arm is an extension of
happening on the computer and in order
to actually feel that way and to feel
like this is a fundamentally better way
of controlling and not just a cool
gadget it has to be extremely accurate
but also very responsive the the the
latency is almost as important as the
accuracy so yeah I've heard a lot about
with tablets a lot of the future
innovation will be about latency of the
touch response as opposed to even the
sensing of the touch response or the
pixels in the display I think it's very
early on with the iphone that we had to
get right it had to be super super fast
so it's one of the reasons why when you
swipe left to right it goes left right
immediately that latency is super
critical human brain is very good at
picking up that look in a different way
knowing that you're doing something
synthetic and going ok this is laggy
yeah and you see touch screen controller
vendors competing on scan rates
basically yes so that's one of the
things we're feeling when we're using a
touchscreen is a lot latency even more
than accuracy ok the feedback loop is
kind of off there let me ask you guys
about getting the word out to customers
I know your your various stages in your
customer facing life as companies what
works or how do you get people to think
differently about controlling things
when they are very in their minds good
at keyboard mouse and touchscreen
because they've not known anything else
is that what works great how do you give
them to sample to think differently
about that so for us I mean we're in
very broad retail today so you could
walk in your local lo store or best buy
or apple store and see the product and a
lot of time just try it and the best
sales of the product is actually using
it you know in using in person and uh as
we've grown and gotten more product out
in the field when people walk into
someone's house they see a nest in the
wall they ask what is that and that's
that's the best sales tools you know
seeing the product using an actual your
thermostat you got one here it's charged
up it has little battery I'm gonna get
Lindsey's thoughts on this too but the
reason in case you guys haven't seen
this one of the reasons I bought the
nest thermostat which is to 49 to 49 so
you know not a cheap datos thermostats
go but of all the things I loved about
it could being connected you can operate
the thing from your smartphone or cut
the device that's great and of course
all the intelligence and the great
interface they've got in this thing but
being able to turn to temperature just
like one of those ancient honey will you
know button thermostats that cost 19
bucks down at the hardware store that
was like that's what I want because I
had one of those push-button thermostats
for years when you want to go from 60 to
69 degrees it's seven pushes plus the
three it doesn't register going back to
interface design that's when we made it
round is that's the most natural thing
you want to do when you control your
temperature it's in our brains if you
what got you into the nest because those
are little mini focus group of what got
us into different interface well I
reviewed it for seen it so that got me
but i loved it i mean i became a convert
and people who review technology
products are very cynical right I mean
and I it was as easy to install as as I
mean I did it like on camera and and I
just well I like the way it looks I like
how easy it is but I also really like
the ability to change and other other um
thermos does have this functionality but
I like that's my house by the way um
that's my wall it's ruined that's my
hand um I like the ability to program it
from afar and I don't do it that often
but when I need to do it it's really
nice to be able to do it so you know
coming home from a ski trip and you're
freezing in its winter and you want to
turn on the thermostat or also being
able to turn it on from bed that's nice
we were talking about this earlier and
our question was right now nest you can
have one or two thermostats in your
house to work on different zones right
but it seems like there's there should
be a future in which there's a much more
nuanced to interaction than just when I
walk in the front door and you start to
see this with with a proximate industry
starting to be a bit more location-aware
you know it did your car just into the
driveway look at kind of the Ford booth
and some of the interesting things are
doing there is the connected car so
starting to think about you know had all
these things work together and it is
there a possibility of your thermostat
learns from your farm it's crazy right
you're headed in that direction you're
usually headed in that direction at that
time of day you're coming home from work
turn on the thermostat exactly let's i'm
going to ask james question here you
guys are Fitbit is arguably the nearest
thing to a household word i think in
this category of wearable fitness tech i
mean this has been such an explosion
here you said what the your area has
doubled since last CES you'd say yeah
this is this is a really big bump this
year for the wearable fitness space what
is the next thing that you've got to get
done to really make it not part of a
panel about the cutting edge but
mainstream how do you make that tip over
you know i think it's a lot about
consumer awareness and there's a lot of
different ways that we do that so one is
you know there's a lot of retailers that
actually you know carry products in this
category when we started the company in
2007 i don't think there was a major
consumer electronics retailer that
carried digital sports tracking devices
other than you know garments and polar's
for the very high end so in the past two
years you know retailers like best buy
apple target re ids mainstream retailers
have you know opened up this category
and i think that's really raised
awareness of how these devices can help
you so I think retailers help the media
you know consumer health is always top
of mind of everybody and especially with
these tools people can take control of
their own health which is are you
wearing right now I'm wearing the Fitbit
flex okay it's the only one I hold that
up and show the the lights that it does
to indicate what to you their camera can
zoom in and get the hold steady right
there we see the LEDs moving what do
they tell us so basically its progress
towards my goal so you can set a step
goal I set something pretty achievable
for CES so it was about 10,000 and I
think I smashed that by midday yes oh
yeah so the display on the device gives
you very quick feedback throughout the
day and if you want something more you
actually fire up your smartphone and the
device has been sinking in the
background so you launch the app the
data is already there you could see your
past history or graphs etc and on
Android phones
there's actually NFC tag embedded in the
device so all you have to do with
certain android phones is just tap the
phone to the band and the app will
automatically launch so we're all about
removing friction in the process so this
tracks your activity and what else so
steps calories distance your sleep
quality so how how long it took you to
fall asleep how many times you woke up
there's a haptic motor in there for
waking you up gently in the morning so
it also has a Bluetooth 4.0 so it's
always sinking constantly in the
background so it's all about you know
how do we create an ambient device that
collects meaningful metrics about your
daily lifestyle and on mobile apps and
on the web provide tools to actually
help you reach your goals welcome back
the second I want to ask you Michael
about what will be the breakthrough for
most people for your technology what do
you think is going to be the aha that
might be the buzz worthy hey have you
tried this thing after we come back
whether this next demo from bt here this
is the eye tribe technology we mentioned
this briefly at the open using I
scanning to operate the mouse or maybe
other parts of the interface on a piece
of technology tell us what you're doing
and not that you're ignoring us watching
a movie I'm not at all Brian so what
this is is this is the eye tribe tech
demo in what it has yours initially you
kind of calibrate their there's a camera
on the bottom with LEDs on the bottom
that detect where my eyes are we're
going to show you this just an image of
the screen right now in a second just
you can see what it looks like okay so
this is where we have you can see little
my two eyeballs in the right hand side
yeah okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna swipe into an app once it
calibrates that and knows where my eyes
are I'm gonna jump in a game like fruit
ninja because you know I'm a ninja but
this time I'm a ninja with my eyes so
we're gonna get to there and all I have
to do is I've stopped to look at the
fruit look at that Cooley you like that
seriously Wow Lindsay you got some of
that pineapple Kiwi mango lime pineapple
kiwi lemon mango so you're actually
using your eyes as the interface to move
right now right this is set to move the
cursor around as if it was your
watermelon and oh there you go ok it's
not voice technology no no no I'm just
saying oh because I'm getting in the
game baby i'm in
look at that look at that frou-frou oh
you're distracting me but that you know
it's an example of what we can see here
we're here with Martin tall which is a
very appropriate name here right Martin
yeah that's Republic 64 and Martin just
tell us about the technology and where
you guys see it going okay so what we
shown here today is an add-on devised
for your tablet we can actually control
the interface straight it's sort of
replacing a touch or a mouse or
something like that but we see it being
used all across the board so just making
the device a lot more aware of what your
brain is actually focusing on a lot of
the cortex is actually dedicated to the
visual system it gives away a lot of
your attention what your motives are
what your interest lies and I think this
technology is enabling much more
intelligent computers they're just not
sitting around and waiting for input
anymore they will know before you even
know and then where do you expect to see
this you know this technology integrate
you're hoping to put it in other
products in the future right right so
it's going to be a desktop laptop
tablets smartphones in cars to see if
you're falling asleep if you're paying
attention and all that sort of stuff so
it's going to come into range of
products and it's gonna happen soon to
write excellent all right back to you
guys I have a question when you were
doing that you were simply moving cursor
with your eyes and because the way fruit
ninja works you didn't need to have any
click command through your eyes right
there's no click enabled at this point
that's correct i mean if you were if you
look at it um well where my eyes were
pointing it was kind of said with this
game demo to kind of have a little
movement of a swipe already so was doing
little baby cuts so whenever my eyes
move to that point it was chopping up
all those fruit all right you're jealous
aren't you we're always jealous of you
Michael where we left off was what do
you think can you envision a time in The
Fairly near future where people are
going to find one thing they kind of
congeal around first and start to buzz
about around technology like what you're
doing and saying okay now I get it
because I've tried X through it so I
think I think there are two things and I
know that violates the spirit of the
question but uh what is that the moment
someone gets the leap and they connect
their computer they can use it to
control Windows 8 or Mac os10 like it
was a touch burn and even for legacy 2d
interfaces leap can be a better way of
controlling them than a touch screen
because you don't have to move one to
one like you do with the touch Karina if
I want to move from this corner to that
corner I don't have to drag and I don't
have to lean forward which is tiring so
I can sit back comfortably move my
finger a small distance to cover the
entire screen but it's still a directed
experience so we think that we'll have a
lot of mass-market appeal but it's also
it's about the developers so the
developer community is the single most
important thing for us we have over
40,000 developers from 150 countries
that have applied to be part of the leaf
developer program and it's it's that's
that the things they create which a lot
of which have a lot of mass-market
appeal those are things that are built
to work great with leap and those are
the first thing is where people are
going to use it and say wow this is
something that I never could have
imagined doing before your army of
editors how they spend so much time
hunched over reaching like michael says
for a device they've got to pull and
we're dealing with ergo all the time
like every company getting in the right
position so your next not stiff and all
that if we could just going to sit back
I'm not making a picture you go you know
install 2000 of these tomorrow
theoretically it join the developer
program that's it surprised you haven't
already it's a huge her go breakthrough
it would seem just for a way to get your
body in the right position and not worry
about am I also in the right position to
access the interface it's just cycle one
thing it it's a potentially great
replacement for something like a remote
control where you have to have a small
but kind of not interesting device that
sits around your living room your
instead of sitting you know across the
room and interacting with something on
the other side of the room yeah
definitely definitely we obviously you
can use a leap near a computer to
control that computer but you can also
use it to control something that's far
away so we we imagine use cases like a
conference room where everyone has a
leap in front of them that everyone is
interacting with the same screen
potential collaboration as well
absolutely now let's just talk about the
data that comes out of what all you
your companies are doing we've got so
much data from the way people interact
with digital media today it's an amazing
ground swell in the last let's say 15
years generously but if we look at any
frontiers that are still untilled and
user data that we have in the digital
media it's it's this stuff it's its body
and gesture we have no insight into that
all the data we have about users on the
web we don't know anything about where
their arm was or what their body
position was or what they're sort of
biorhythm state was when they saw
something this is a this is like
unlocking a new area of data isn't it I
look forward to the day where I don't
need to go to the doctor anymore but
instead i'm told by my by my iphone or
by my computer hey we know something
wrong you're walking differently than
before you might want to see somebody
and here's what you should tell them it
is and he hears me you give them with
all the data over the last three months
that gives them a history and say you're
putting an extra eight pounds of
pressure on your left hip what's wrong
afraid of being nagged I you know did
you guys hear about the haptic feedback
fork fitness on the fig it vibrates when
you're eating too quickly i think i
would just be like you know what I'm
putting you in the dishwasher technology
again it's supposed to Moltar how humans
already live so it should never be a you
know too obtrusive but and instead of
having diagnostic medicine is today
where they just do a bunch of tests when
you when you aren't feeling well to have
that diagnostic medicine happening
throughout your entire life I think the
key thing too is you know if you watch
the show house md in a house of his
favorite lines is you know people always
lie but if you are collecting this data
and you do present it to your doctor I
mean it's it's it's I think quite
informative for the doctor to see how
you have actually been living your life
between doctor visits I mean what is
what he's what he's doing today is
trying to make a quick judgment based on
observing you for maybe 10 15 minutes
but asking you questions but you know if
he was supplemented by this data and
possibly automated intelligence on top
of that data I think that'd be a huge
breakthrough and we all have such huge
bias anyway about what we think we've
done that led two outs or whatever we
don't really know how we are I mean a
question for you James about the
fitbit fits into a space I think tell me
if I'm if I'm crazy here that is we're
moving toward the 401k ification of
health care where we have to become
partners and be co responsible for our
health as we now are our retirement over
the last you know 30 40 years since that
kicked in is that a trendy things
happening I think so I mean you know we
sell a lot of devices to employers as
part of their corporate wellness
programs and I think there I hate to
call it a partnership but i think you
know it's good for both the employee
yeah it's good for both the employee and
the company for you to be healthy so I
would hate to see punitive measures ever
taken but I think right now it's all you
know everyone working together opt in
and you know let's get healthy all right
uh any final questions or anything that
we've left out what have we left out
what have you thought why didn't they
ask this why don't I ask that so we get
it we asked this a lot like why don't
you add this feature why is it have a
clock all those kind of things and uh
part of part of what makes building a
great device and Billy a great interface
tough is dealing with all the noise and
actually the discipline to keep it
simple and that's something to keep in
mind you know for all of us when when
looking at the session yes yeah I've
been looking at all this next-generation
technology keeping it really simple is
hard to do and that's something we need
to do in order to really to drive into
the mass market yeah Michael final
thoughts well I think it in our case it
goes back to the importance of the
developer community so we are very
actively seeking new applications from
developers of all of all kinds and we
will be continuing to send out thousands
of leaf devices between now and when we
actually start shipping the product
james last thoughts to leave us with for
us you know i think what we're going to
see in digital health is you know
smaller and smaller devices collecting
more and more meaningful data types and
i think it's it's a really exciting time
because you know it's really in the past
few years that technology has gotten to
the point where devices like the Fitbit
have been
possible so I'm really excited yeah okay
good stuff I want to thank everybody for
joining us for this panel this has been
you know I know we have to think as a
deterrent organization all of our
children are beautiful all of our
projects and panels and pieces this is
my favorite so far at this show so
thanks everyone for being here please
join me in thanking our guests if you
will James Park from Fitbit Matt Rogers
from nest and Michael Buckwald from lead
motion great future thinkers and of
course thanks to be T and the companies
that joins him there of musics interacts
on with the muse brainwave sensing
technology and I tribe the eye tracking
and scanning technology more good stuff
to have a hand for them great innovators
great innovators on behalf of myself and
editor-in-chief Lindsey Turrentine thank
you for being with us and our live
coverage at CES continues here at CES
