I'm taking a look at the LG LFC 2 2 7 7
0 s II this is a 30-inch wide French
door refrigerator and it has the honor
of being the first LG fridge we've
reviewed that's kind of disappointing
the performance was solid the main
compartment at both the default setting
and the lowest temperature setting
walked a nice line between 40 degrees
and 32 degrees Fahrenheit the doors ran
a little bit warm but that's usual
that's fine it even has a serviceable if
a little bit boring list of features
it's got an automatic icemaker it's got
humidity sliders it's got an extra deli
drawer in there
it even has spill proof shelves for me
that's a big win because I'm a messy
person I don't like spending time
cleaning things up and spill-proof
shelves tend to work really well so I
like that for the price it's just not as
exciting as GES comparable French door
fridge that one's only sixteen hundred
dollars it has a slate finish which I
think looks a little bit better than
this stainless the stainless here also
smudges really easily and that GE fridge
uses its interior a lot better than this
one it's a small fridge that feels
smaller than it has to because of really
poorly designed shelves moving them
around isn't tough but there's only so
many places you can put them so the
interior is tough to customize and tough
to fit taller bigger items with our
fridge we test we load it up with
groceries and this fridge struggled with
the normal stuff like milk jugs and
cheese and soda and condiments let alone
the bigger items we used to stress it
like party platters and cake trays it's
hard to imagine it costing that much
more for LG to put more hooks on the
back of the fridge to allow more
positions for the shelf yet that would
have made such a huge difference in
terms of allowing you to use the space
to its fullest so if you can fit a
33-inch with go with GES model it's a
slightly better performer but this one's
still fine and it's just easier to use
the space with this fridge LG just cut a
little too much to get the price down
but if you're tight on space it's still
a fine performer for more be sure to
