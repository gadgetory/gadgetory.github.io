making it hard for smartphone thieves
both gsm carriers have turned on a
database that allows them to block a
device from being used as soon as
someone reports it stolen in the past
carriers would shut off a SIM card to
block a stolen smartphone but it wasn't
foolproof since the crook could just put
in another GSM carrier sim card verizon
and friends will also launch a similar
database to block stolen phones on their
CDMA networks of course you still need
to be careful about sensitive data on
your smartphone a thief can grab data
off the device before carrier blocks it

storing and sharing photos and videos
it's called AT&amp;amp;T locker and the app
gives Apple and Android customers five
gigs of storage for free photos and
videos taken can be saved to the locker
and users have the option to share files
to social media and email customers can
also use the space to store music and
other files amazon has been busy making
its own games and it just released its
first one for mobile devices called air
Patriots the app is available on Kindle
Fire Android and Apple devices it's a
basic tower defense type game where
players direct the path of airplanes
