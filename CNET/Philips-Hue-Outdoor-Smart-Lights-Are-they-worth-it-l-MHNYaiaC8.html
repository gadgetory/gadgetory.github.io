lineup this summer with a bounty of new
bulbs and fixtures including several
that are designed for use outdoors up
first a new outdoor version of the
popular Philips II light strips with the
weather proof design Philips Hughes
outdoor light strips are meant for your
garden or for your patio but the thick
rubber surrounding the LEDs themselves
means that there are a lot bulkier than
the average indoor light strip I tried
to hide them under the railing here on
the deck at the scene at smart home and
as you can see aren't exactly
inconspicuous another problem of these
lights
you can't cut them if they're too long
for your needs like you can with the
indoor light strips you also can't
purchase extensions to make them longer
the strip's come in a two metre version
for $90 and a five metre version for 160
if you need them to be any shorter or
longer than either of those two lengths
you're out of luck also new outdoor
fixtures for your porch available in a
couple of designs and starting at just
50 bucks they're really just normal
wired light fixtures that come packaged
with a Philips II white bulb I'd like
them a lot better if they included a
built in Philips hue motion sensor but
they don't
at any rate those hue white bulbs cost
fifteen dollars each on their own and
are already dampness rated so feel free
just to swap one into your old fixture
instead Philips also has two new color
changing lights for your lawn these
Kalla pedestal lights and lilies
spotlights both options daisy chain
together to a weatherproof power supply
and work just like other color changing
hue lights and they're pretty easy to
install too between the two I like the
lily spots a lot better especially if
you like to go nuts with the decorations
at the holidays just be prepared to
spend though a three lily starter kit
costs two hundred and eighty dollars
with additional lights selling for
eighty bucks each meanwhile a one light
kala starter kit with the power supply
cost one hundred and thirty dollars with
additional lights selling for ninety
seven none of these are cheap worst yet
neither of them come with the Philips
hue bridge which is mandatory to control
them unless those prices come down a bit
color me a little bit unimpressed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
