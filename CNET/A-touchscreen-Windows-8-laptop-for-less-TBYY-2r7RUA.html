look at the Acer Aspire v5 this is a
very run-of-the-mill middle-of-the-road
laptop inoffensive looks perfectly fine
from a few feet away you get up close to
see it's a bit more of a budget laptop
very plasticy but what they managed to
do is work in a core i5 CPU Windows 8
and more importantly a touchscreen all
for a very reasonable price this
particular configuration is about $700
you can find it for a little bit more a
little less if you look around I was
actually more excited that going into
the Black Friday holiday shopping season
I saw a version of this that's
essentially the same just with a lower
end core i3 CPU for five hundred and
twenty nine dollars and that includes
with the windows 8 touchscreen and that
I think is a really great entry point to
get into Windows 8 while you're using a
touchscreen and it shows that you can
actually have a touch screen on all but
the least expensive of laptops once you
get touch screens in a reasonably decent
machine down to about $500 or so that
just means pretty much anybody can have
that besides that this is a pretty thin
laptop for a 15-inch they managed to
work in an optical drive as well
something you often see skipped in lower
end or really thin lower end laptops the
keyboard is a decent size from the
leather keys actually be a little bit
small although I do like that they have
the full button list click pad style
touch pad over here that's something
they usually only have in more expensive
laptops in Cheaper words usually get the
old-style left or right mouse buttons
the edge to edge glass over the 15 inch
display is also a nice kind of high-end
touch for a mid price laptop like this
but the native resolution at 1366 by 768
which is fine for an 11 or a 13 inch
laptop maybe even a 14 once you get up
to 15 inches it kind of looks a little
toy like and I think that in 15 or above
you're really are right to expect a
higher resolution these days other than
that this is a pretty decent mid sized
mid price entry point if you want to get
into Windows 8 and that touchscreen
experience because Windows 8 without it
really
not that good I'm Dan Ackerman and that
is the Acer Aspire v5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
