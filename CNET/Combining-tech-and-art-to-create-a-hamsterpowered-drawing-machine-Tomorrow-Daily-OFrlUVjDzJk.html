in Los Angeles California and we found
the man behind the hamster power and
hamster drawing machine hamster powered
hamster drying machines right here in
front of us is right here in front of us
we're looking right at it in real life
and Neil Mendoza is the artist and
designer behind that it was a lot of
work it kind of evolved into being what
it is today started off with kind of a
fascination with drawing machines and I
already had some experience making you
know doing programming electronic so
then i took that experience i guess i
started applying it to art making they
made a physics simulation of the drawing
arm part of the machine and then i use
that physics simulation to kind of trace
out where the wheels would need to be so
then i ended up with these two circular
drawings and then i used like a machine
called a cnc machine which is basically
like a big robot to kind of cut it out
wood for me I started becoming really
interested in that and then I built a
drawing machine which work but then I
was like what on earth is this thing in
a draw people's interest seemed to shift
between the two parts of it and then
take it in as a whole and be kind of
like wow that's really cute
I think with my work I want people so
you know engage with the moment rather
than escaping the moment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
