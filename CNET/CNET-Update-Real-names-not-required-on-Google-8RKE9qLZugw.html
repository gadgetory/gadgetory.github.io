I don't have to be Bridget Carey this is
your scene that update google is
reversing its stance on using real names
in Google+ accounts ever since Google+
launched 2011 it was a requirement to
use your real name on the service but in
a blog post google announced that it had
a change of heart and it now lets you
use a pseudonym for a handle instead of
your real name in order to compete with
facebook google wanted to create a
community of real people but real names
became problematic when google+ began
integrating with other services like
YouTube or some established accounts
don't use real names the policy became a
divisive issue on one hand real names
help cut down on nasty comments and
trolling but lately privacy is a growing
concern with Facebook collecting data on
us and reports of NSA tracking but
whatever your philosophy Google's doing
this to get more users Apple is also
having a change of philosophy it's now
working with IBM a company that was once
its biggest rival under Steve Jobs Apple
wants to work with IBM to help make more
business software on the iphone and ipad
of course many people already use their
iPhones and iPads for work but this
would bring Apple to the next level for
businesses by creating apps that are
just for specific industries like retail
health banking and travel now this
partnership is another blow to
blackberry but blackberry hasn't given
up yet it's announced that it will have
its own voice controlled assistant just
like Siri and Cortana but it won't have
a name it's just called blackberry
assistant and you'll be able to find it
on the blackberry 10.3 operating system
update which will also come loaded in
the new square-shaped blackberry
passport phone the passport has a
physical keyboard and it's coming out in
September BlackBerry's assistant can do
some typical tricks like setting
reminders about meetings or reading your
email messages aloud which could be
helpful when you're driving we'll have
to wait closer to launch to get a demo
with more examples of how it works and
looking ahead we may soon hear something
from Amazon about a new ebook
subscription service some test pages
leaked online
Wednesday were quickly removed after it
was noticed by some users on Kindle
message boards and soon after reported
by GigaOM on the test page amazon calls
it Kindle unlimited and for ten dollars
a month kindle owners get unlimited
access to more than 600,000 book titles
and thousands of audiobooks this would
compete with some existing services by
scribd and oyster which are also like a
Netflix for books that your tech news
update you can get more details on these
stories at cnet com and you can always
stay updated by following along on
Twitter from our studios in New York I'm
