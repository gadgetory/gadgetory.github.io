Windows 10 without lifting a finger
say hello to Cortana Microsoft's virtual
assistant lets you complete everyday PC
tasks using voice commands I'll show you
how to optimize the setup and I'll share
some of the most useful voice commands
to get started there are two ways to
launch Cortana you can either hit
Windows CE or you can use the command
hey Cortana but you'll have to set that
up so head over to the search bar click
it and then go to your notebook hit
settings and turn on this hey Cortana
option the only potential problem is
that Cortana will respond to anyone who
says hey Cortana so you might want to
teach her to only listen to your voice
ok let's get started now that you know
how to get Cortana to listen you can
start bossing her around if you already
use a virtual assistant on your iPhone
like Siri or Google now or even Cortana
on your Windows Phone you probably
already know a lot of the commands that
will work with Cortana on your PC so
here are a few examples hey Cortana
what's the weather right now it's 72 and
sunny photos of puppies
remind me to call the doctor tomorrow at
9 a.m. sure thing
remind you to call the doctor at 9 a.m.
tomorrow is that right
yes great if you ever want to manage or
manually enter reminders you can do so
by hitting the light bulb in Cortana's
interface you can also dig around the
system with commands like show me photos
I took in November 2014 and there they
are and you can launch apps and settings
by saying launch settings all right
which one do you want one settings or to
Lenovo settings one starting settings
you'll mostly use Cortana for voice
commands but there's also an
informational dashboard you can view by
clicking the search bar it works a lot
like Google now showing you the latest
news and weather but also information
about your upcoming flights or
deliveries if you want to get in there
and customize the dashboard you can do
that by going back to the notebook and
go through all of these categories and
adjust your settings for instance I can
go to eat and drink and I'll head down
and tell Cortana what kind of cuisines I
like let's hit Italian at it and from
now on Cortana will show me more
restaurant recommendations that are of
the Italian variety there's a lot more
Cortana can do but hopefully this gives
you a solid primer to get started you
can also check out more Windows 10 tips
