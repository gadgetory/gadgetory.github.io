with not here in Abu Dhabi taking a look
and Nakia additions to its range of
budget asha smartphones we've got the
500 the 502 and finally the 503 to all
three new Ash's have the updated design
you can see that it still has this
bright yellow plastic casing but it's
now looks like it's been encased in what
looks like ice or glass it's really
quite an unusual design but I think it's
really really nice so the Asha 500 is
the baby of the bunch it has a two point
eight inch screen with plenty of pixels
to keep things nice and sharp around the
back you'll see it has a 2 megapixel
camera with running nokia asha software
which looks a lot like a Symbian that
you may have seen on some of the earlier
asha phones you can see it's got these
rounded icons in a list and if you swipe
over this side you'll see what's called
Fastlane which pulls together content
that is coming up like calendar
reminders or messages and social network
updates that you have previously had
now the 502 is slightly bigger with a
3-inch screen and also around the back
it's camera has seen a boost to 5
megapixels and finally the 503 is the
daddy of the bunch this also has a 3
inch screen but it has a gorilla glass
coating over the top keeping it safe
from scratches and it also has the 5
megapixel camera on the back but
crucially this is the first asha to
offer 3g data support now a cool new
addition is whatsapp which is finally
made its way onto asha now that allows
you to send free messages and video
calls and even pictures only using your
internet connection
rather than using up your costly
allowance so there we have the three new
asha phone you've got the 500 starting
at $69 the 502 at 89 and the 503 at 99
make sure to keep it CNET for all the
latest nukkie knees</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
