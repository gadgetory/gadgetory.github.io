back CNET's live coverage of CES 2018
I'm Ashley ask Ewa
you may have heard of our next guest and
the hit online game HQ trivia we have
here with us quiz EEMA guire himself the
host with the most
Scott Rogowski hey hi so it's no good if
you're on c-span see so yeah yeah you
have so many fans uh I have noticed you
you have been sort of stopped every
about 10 feet here at the show it's been
a lot of fan and girling and Boeing and
it's nice to be appreciated and take
taking photos of like this lovely lady
here taking a photo that's good how
exactly does it feel to have killed the
productivity of most of America with HQ
trivia yeah I feel like I'm like the
anti Henry Ford he increased
productivity and he was an anti-semite
so I'm like I can be an anti Henry Ford
right back it's good so I talked to you
a little bit earlier this week and we
get this week we did I know that there
was alcohol involved but I believe you
said that you have been doing stand-up
comedy for 12 years 12 years yes January
2000 actually spent 13 years will be the
anniversary in a couple weeks
lucky for my first time on stage you're
like mega famous now you're like one of
those overnight successes that took over
a decade to happen
people think overnight successes are
overnight there in fact 1012 years in
the making sometimes longer so so how
did this even come about like you did
you just answer a Craigslist ad and not
get murdered it was a monsters monster
Inc what is that monster website just
monster jobs no no it wasn't that
submitting your resume on monster yeah
yeah
LinkedIn no no it was an audition it was
an audition okay and I got the call you
know my friend Nick Gallo who I met 10
years earlier when I was starting out I
started out interning for the onion you
can trust him because he has been your
friend since before you were successful
exactly and he well he's the reason why
I am successful because he I met him
interning at the onion when I wasn't out
of college 2008 and we kept in touch of
her Facebook Facebook I would say is the
biggest networking as you do
for me yeah and Nick said hey we're
doing this thing which I think you'd be
a good host would you want to come out
and audition for it I said all right
sure what did you think when you started
like when they say okay here's what it
is it's a game show
and it's literally just you like what
there's no like stage you're not gonna
you know live studio audience like what
was the what was the reactor well I I
didn't really know what it was gonna be
at the beginning I mean it and no one
really did we just they had the the
format for the live the technology
appointment viewing we're gonna go live
at the beginning was once a day five
days a week now it's twice a day during
the week twelve shows a week really
popular really popular we're doing UK
shows now we got Sheeran hosting UK
shows and it's when I first got the idea
I thought alright well this could be
something I mean I was gunning for taxi
TV I want to be the back of taxicabs
okay an elevator TV was also high in my
list a few ever why we do some of that
so you can come do some videos for CNN
and then we'll put you on the back of
the taxi during CES but now I'm I was
tell my friends I'm gonna be on an app
I'm an app you're an app now by and at
the time it would seem silly but now oh
now like I'm sure we're gonna see a lot
more of these happening I I think so I
think it's like really interesting that
this has kind of blossomed into a
completely different vertical for apps
this sort of like you said appointment
apps point app is point mint it's like a
pop-up shop but for you can win money
right instead of spending you can get
yeah if you guys maybe people here don't
know HQ we should explain what it is
yeah if anybody I'm sure a lot of people
are playing buddy please why are you
think that we all know so HQ is a live
daily trivia show on your phone 3:00
p.m. Eastern Time 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time
we go live with it download it if you
haven't just go to HQ it's in the I
store iTunes
you seem really into technology really
into technology yeah very tech-heavy
iTunes store and then also yeah it just
launched and just recently I think we're
still in beta but and you recently had
over a green you're free and it's free
and you read over a million people
currently playing a game like right
around new years all right
just this past Sunday night we cracked a
million player mark for the first time
that is pretty
writing 1.2 million concurrent users at
you know we asked 12 questions the way
works when you download it and you get a
push notification when we go live and
when we do go live you open the phone
and you yell quiz daddy and then you and
then it's you you say quiz daddy three
times and I appear it's like floating
married but even better and I ask twelve
questions ranging from easy to hard
trapped Trebek you have ten seconds to
answer the question and it goes fast too
fast ten seconds if you get it right you
tap through the three multiple-choice
answers that pop up on your screen yeah
tap the right one you move on in the
next round make it to the end answering
all 12 questions correctly
you win or split the cash prize we keep
out real money every day actual money
hundreds of thousands of dollars have
been given out already
can you explain why you screwed me on
The Canterbury Tales when you
accidentally round that question early
I'm very upset and I think our people
out there do you remember the Canterbury
Tales
I'm very nice very good quality about it
it is Canterbury Gate that was I mean
look we've done it over 200 shows now
things happen the humans run this thing
it's five it's not AI and that was a
glitch and we we restarted it but look
the good news is if you got the question
eight that day you already had the
answer so some people benefited but I
get tripped up at like four things start
getting tough yeah uh are you able to
say at all like how many like what is
the process of like put who researches
the questions like who's who's looking
this up was there a really big team now
like or do you have us we've got a
really big like oh my god I gotta look
up all these questions yeah it's it's a
team a team of writers I'm sort of the
last eyes on it okay be ready we got
fact-checkers there's the director
creative director and then ultimately
before it goes on-air I look at them all
and make sure you know I know what I'm
talking about
have you ever vetoed a question we're
like we can't we can't is it because
it's like offensive or is it because
it's just equal it's just wrong it's
just like like this like what
and I mean if I don't there was a queue
three maybe they ran I don't know if it
was about this and someone heard of the
book called the runaway children no the
runaway children you've heard of it he's
like now this was a q3 it was it was
scheduled for q3 and they this author
wrote the
even if Nesbitt wrote this popular book
they don't know I said I've never heard
of Edith Nesbit or the Rhine much so I
made it a winnie-the-pooh question is
dead that's thousands of people got it
wrong what percentage of the time would
you say you are not wearing pants when
the show goes live
I wear five pairs of pants every time
very cold they won't know if I wear
mascara I don't never have I don't
believe I don't need to you I have
naturally maybe I'm blinded maybe it's
Maybelline but no it's I'm born with it
it's not Maybelline it's not mikowski
yes I'll regale rillette spectacular
time do you get up in the morning to do
this do you get to sleep in question in
a time thinking about questions all
night I don't sleep anymore there's a
lot of bags into my eyes that Phyllis
was trying to help fill in back there
the makeup lady but no I pay her the big
bucks you know I'm a pipe to commute
from you know the burbs right now I'm
not living in the city and then but I'd
like to wake up and I do my research
that morning look at the questions that
morning yeah I'm up around 9:00 I would
say running a 39 that sounds pretty good
yeah it feels like you get to sleep in a
little bit but then I'm getting in late
and then you know a lot of commuting lot
of train just sit there for you are you
just sitting just in front of that
camera just waiting for it to go live
like a like a little robot some people
tried to plug you in know it's USB see
now so you can charge faster got to eat
my lunch got a goat get salads all right
so we have a we have a we have a gift
for you we have through this beautiful
CNET way to earn this gift you have to
earn it because I I have some quiz
questions for you I thought it would be
fun to turn the tables
so we'll have some they get easier as
they they get they get harder as they
they go along
okay um but very similar format that is
a similar format age I'm very familiar
format to you okay and you also only get
10 seconds I I might actually like three
two one oh my god that heard the queried
you guys okay first question
q1 what
city to CES take place in is it a New
York be in Los Angeles or C long Las
Vegas baby what's easy
yeah okay big face on it second I know
second question what is I bow a a robot
Butler be a robot dog or speed a robot
vacuum you already lost me robot dog you
got you go by instinct don't my instinct
I love it okay
question three this is a tough one we're
starting at this q3 now approximately
how many people attend to CES is it a
over 180,000 B over 240,000 or C over
460 thousand this is where I'm gonna
flag you as vague questioning because
I'm gonna take I'll take one
Hey because everything is over okay next
next question is how many total square
feet of exhibit space does CES take up
is it a around 1.7 million be around 2.6
million or see around 3.7 million can I
get a lifeline audience no one knows B I
can say 2.6 that is correct in the game
right now
the game I was gonna give you an extra
life oh yeah okay how good of friends
would you consider us a okay friends be
good friends or C best friends based on
our texting there's a correct answer
here best friends that is correct we are
best friends yes you want you get this
five times five times well that makes us
best friends in the world of technology
I feel so loved because obviously
everybody here is super excited to see
you um so I'd like I know you can't talk
about like oh if HQ is gonna launch a
third show or anything like that and
they didn't announce anything
specifically for CES but you want scoops
right
I would love a scooper and exclusive but
I will take there's one your show
president want a scoop sure when I get
back on HQ on Saturday I might have had
a haircut
ooh you're gonna want to tune in for
that everybody actually I probably won't
have time to get the haircut till Sunday
so Sunday night haircut
you're gonna keep pushing that off it's
gonna get played like everything else
here at CES that gets an out yeah or
sometimes HQ games yeah like I'm sorry
we have to delay this guy uh do you
think last I'll give you this last
question and then and then we'll wrap it
up okay do you think that we will see
more and more of this sort of pop up
style of appointment app or appointment
sort of technology because of the
success of HQ trivia and what you guys
are doing over there yeah I think
everyone who's in you know in this space
who's creating shows making apps they
want a capture live audience yes I think
we're already seeing some imitators
accept no imitations HQ is the OG and
there are I'm not gonna name the other
ones but they're out there but yeah I
think we're gonna see this year this
quarter maybe by Fat March even will
sees big players coming into the space
maybe they'll have you know Jamie Foxx
hosting a show I don't know well would
you rather watch TV Fox would you rather
watch the trap Trebek that's the
question you have to ask yourself I mean
I can't say no to quiz II McGuire quiz
acquire quiz requires my favorite Lizzie
McGuire could be hosting one that would
be amazing a question I think we'll see
a lot more but I think HQ is gonna be
ahead of the curve we know we're doing
and we're building and building and I'm
gonna pitch you on an idea yeah live
races where people use the steps in
their phone to race but so people just
randomly start running that's good like
pokemons go is it a walk around running
at 12 o'clock at noon or 12:30 after
your show's over like everyday people
just randomly just start sprinting for
no reason other than 15 people just
watching this or creating this app right
now you're already blue your idea so
welcome Internet thank you so much for
joining us friend thanks bestie bestie
you are you're actually our very last
interview on the scene at live stage at
CSD we're done we're good we're all done
thank you so much to everybody at sea
