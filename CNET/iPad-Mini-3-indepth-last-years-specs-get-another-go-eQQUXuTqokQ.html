was one of our favorite tablets of 2013
so we had high expectations from what
was to come this year well this is it
it's the new iPad Mini 3 and it's a good
thing we like last year's model so much
because it's basically unchanged in 2014
upfront lay the same 7.9 inch retina
display that's 2048 x 1536 resolution
it's bright and beautiful an IPS and it
works great at all viewing angles just
like before as you'd expect it's got the
same thin design and rounded edges that
we saw before which you can now see on
the iPhone 6 it's thin and light and
feels really good in the hand but
without air to now clocking in just 6.1
millimeters thick doesn't feel quite so
thin as it did last year performance
comes from the a7 chip just as it did
last year and just like last year most
of the benchmarks that we've run or
coming up with the same score as we saw
then that was great performance last
year this year though it's not quite so
great especially compared to the new a8x
chip that's found in the air to that's
definitely proving better performance
and while this thing will still run your
games perfectly well we're worried about
upgrades in a couple years down the road
battery life is just as good as before
an exceeding apples 10 hour estimate
should be no problem at all we were
easily able to get a full day of use
under the new mini 3 so it's all the
same what is new while touch ID is the
big thing this lets you unlock the iPad
and make apple pay purchases with adjust
your fingerprint it's also got the new
Apple sim if you choose to get this
cellular model which means you can
activate on any care you're like 11 sim
and if you really like you can also get
it in goal which is a new color for the
mini this year 16 gigabytes will set you
back 399 for the base model 64 gigabytes
is going to be four hundred and
ninety-nine dollars 128 gigabytes is 599
dollars if you like the cellular model
with LTE you're going to be spending one
hundred thirty dollars more reach
configuration that's the same as last
year the mini 2 however is now available
for 299 for the 16 gigabyte based model
or 349 for the 32 gigabyte model the
mini 3 is still a great tablet but with
last year's I've had mini now one
hundred dollars more affordable that's
definitely the smarter by unless you
really need it in gold
