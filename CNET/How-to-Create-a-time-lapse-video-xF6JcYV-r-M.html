time-lapse videos that compress almost
imperceptibly slow events in the short
videos seemingly speeding up time before
your very eyes but how are they made and
more importantly could you make one on
your own I'm antuan goodwin with
cnet.com and i'm here to show you how
you'll need a few things before you get
started a camera that can shoot still
photos at timed intervals we're using
the gopro HD hero photo editing software
with a batch edit function we're using a
front view on the PC which can be found
over on download.com and some sort of
video software to stitch your photos
together in this video we're going to
using quicktime pro is cross-platform
software step one you're going to want
to familiarize yourself with your
camera's interval photography mode and
for some of you this will be as simple
as selecting a mode on your camera for
others it may mean taking advantage of
custom hardware software or firmware the
exact process for this step will vary
depending on the make and model of your
camera for this video we're going to be
using the gopro HD hero now load up an
empty SD card select the time between
the shot here we have the choice between
25 10 and 30 second intervals mount your
camera depress the shutter and go find
something to do while the camera snaps
away now you could point your camera at
anything you'd like but I'm a car tech
editor so I am line out of the
windshield of the car on a trip from LA
to San Francisco step 2 once you've got
all your photos captured you'll need to
treat them however after hours of
shooting we have almost 5000 5 megapixel
shots now that's way too big of a
picture for even the nicest HDTV on the
market and way too many photos to be
individually resizing you'll need to
find a way to betch process these photos
now you could use software like Adobe
Photoshop but we'll be using the free
oron view software on the pc from the
file menu select batch conversion rename
then navigate to the folder that
contains your images and add them all to
the batch now you'll need to do two
things under the best conversion setting
headache
click the advanced button in the dialog
box that appears check resize and set a
value for the long side of each image
then click canvas size and apply a value
to be cropped now what you're aiming for
is an HD friendly dimension of either
1280 by 720 pixels or 1920 x 1080 pixels
the exact number that you're going to
use to get there will vary depending on
the image size captured by your camera
so you're going to need to do a little
math here we're going with a 1280 width
and a 240 pixel crop for our 720p video
now select the folder for your resized
images click start batch and go find
something else to do while your photos
process step 3 once you've got all your
images resized up fire quicktime pro and
from the file menu select open image
sequence now navigate to the folder that
contains all of your resized images
select the first one you'll have to
select a frame rate here we chose 24
frames per second click OK and then go
make yourself a cup of coffee while
QuickTime stitches the images together
into a video step 4 when QuickTime Pro
is done you'll have a working preview of
your time-lapse video but you'll still
have to export a final file for use in
other programs go to file then export to
bring up the export menu now under
option select size and make sure your
dimensions are set to your liking now in
addition to the HD sizes there are also
presets for mobile devices like the
iPhone so choose the one that works best
for you now give your file a name and
hit save you'll probably want to go grab
a movie or something at this point
because it's the longest part of the
process and can take anywhere from
several minutes to a few hours depending
on your computer's processing horsepower
once everything is done you'll have a
completed time-lapse video that you can
share with your friends on video sites
like YouTube or Vimeo time-lapse
photography is a great way to document
natural events like the blooming of a
flower or as we've done here capture an
entire road trip in just a few minutes
now these same steps can also be applied
to stop-motion photography for those of
you who want to get in touch with your
inner ray harryhausen so there you have
it time-lapse photography in just a few
easy stay
