view it's the first day dream ready vr
headset now if you're into VR I'll just
say that the specs are there has a nice
field of view and with the daydream
phone low latency and really accurate
head tracking we didn't just look at the
specs we obsessed over the details of
the design we wanted to make something
that's comfortable really easy to use we
also thought about how you could make it
your own so first let's talk about
comfort how it feels how it fits well
you'll notice immediately that it
doesn't quite look like other VR
headsets and that's because in designing
it we weren't inspired by gadgets we
looked at what do people actually we're
we're stuff that soft stuff that's
flexible and breathable and so we
crafted our headset out of that same
comfortable stuff fabrics soft
microfiber and other materials that
you'd find in clothing and athletic wear
in fact we worked with clothing
designers and makers to get the design
just right and the result is something
that's soft and cozy it feels great to
wear so the materials are really nice
it's also lightweight thirty percent
lighter than similar devices next let's
talk about making it easy to use you
open the latch you drop your phone in
you close the latch and you're ready to
go that's it the headset and phone say
hello wirelessly so there's nothing to
connect and the headset includes an auto
alignment system that gets everything
just right we wanted interacting with VR
to be easy to and that's where the
daydream controller comes in it's really
easy to use at the top is a clickable
touchpad or a couple of buttons but
there's more to it than meets the eye
hidden inside are a bunch of sensors
that respond to how you move okay now
what do you do with a controller after
you use it you lose it we didn't want
that to happen so the controller has a
home
inside the headset when you're done just
kind of snuggles in there like this
these little things that make the whole
experience easier and more seamless</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
