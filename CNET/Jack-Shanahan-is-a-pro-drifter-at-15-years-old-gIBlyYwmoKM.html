the gesture drift a white of Marlboros
bmw m3 contact with just under 300
horsepower
be honest actually love driving carries
with less poorly in or like doing the
glottic clutch kicks and you know having
definitely Troy used to care to its
limits to actually get around the track
I think it's definitely away any driver
should learn if you want to just have a
bit of fun like you know it's definitely
the way to go just a standard care and
just try absolutely
it's weird being in schools you know
because it's like my friends like no
one's really interested in Caravan you
know but it's not like playing a sport
you know it's not like being famous for
playing a sport you know you're doing
more sport like it's something that you
don't be accomplished for anywhere we'd
like you know like if you're famous for
being like being a soccer player you're
known all over the world for no matter
how good or bad you wear you know like
you're on team like it doesn't matter
you're trying your best to be known
everywhere and trying your best like
people to understand what rifting is
like
the last year on drift ourselves first
year hotel here I think you finished
fifth in the European Championship which
we couldn't believe lakeyanna
I was just over the moon Jack Shanahan
grew overnight like he before us
everything just went so quick like his
whole name just went through the roof
and even for us to adapt to that was you
know unbelievable
we did about 5,000 kilometers our own
trip drive put him moving back you got a
podium he was told over on in Sweden and
I was just so happy like it was just
bootleggers I quite understand much
humor me as in leg you know I was so
happy like you know nice to say that
he's a project friend my brother is a
challenge people think we're crazy
all I wanted it was live take the boys
racing and have some fun every weekend
it's tough when it's only me and dad you
know that people are like all but you
have this new of that and they don't
understand that reform once before of it
where stuff in the galleries nearly
every night you just working on the care
like Jeannie and I don't want just
arrived on to the track and just sit
here and enjoy Vaughn let me just hop
over and just walk away you know it's
never been that with me and I've done I
said I don't want to be that way because
if you don't know you're Carrie you
don't know nothing you know that's the
way I look at it like all the money that
I've earned since I was like eight or
nine it's all spin to drift cars you
know like I bought my first horrible
bought my first shot with his you know I
can't get a job I can't earn money in a
way that a normal person does like I
always worked for dad like I come off
the school bus at the shop and I stayed
or Monday to Friday like from like four
to six just so I can be helpful towards
him like you know and I come to the
garbageman I really want to be like you
know on a Saturday I work all day
Saturday just trying to earn my keep you
know just making sure that he sees that
I you have respect for him and that like
John not taking anything for granted
people think that he's a spoiled fifteen
year old child that gets out in front of
him there's a policy in the house with
his mother myself
Norwalk no racing
connor is my 11 year old brother who's
ever started drifting just the last 2 or
3 weeks so it was kind of always in the
nature for him to get into drifting and
all that but when I came to us you know
I didn't think he'd take to it as fast
he did
I always said like when Jack was small
that he had serious care control and I
always knew that driftin would be
definitely for him looking at Connor I
would have talked to Connor was a Nova
racer like he races in the the track and
was green and he's been really quick and
I always thought that that would be his
niche but looking at him now I think
he's probably he's gonna go drifting as
well she's the first time I see him
driving a couple of weeks ago I couldn't
believe that he actually put it together
so quick
he's his tour net he's no fear of
anybody or anything really I wouldn't be
a fearful wasn't a lot of us today I can
give boiler
the car was absolutely flying we had
great fun and then I was coming down
about a hundred mile an hour and flicked
in underneath the bridge when I kick the
clutch the gearbox not broke the whole
gearbox adidas fell down the floor so I
just spun around and then they
completely backward on the track
at the building
I think my dad has one of the best
drivers I ever seen when he was 16 he
like stole his dad's car and his dad to
race car and got his friends to tow him
to his first race there and he wanna
cook he didn't even know we were there I
went order with my first day racing and
I want to trough it I told him after
what I was doing he said I was crazy it
definitely brought them all after making
John you know when things go against you
when the chips are down he will he will
pull something out of somewhere to get
back going or Johnny f40 was in
twitter's he's just won the million
really as was I think he's definitely
the biggest influence on my driving
because without him I know nothing you
know even in the garage volcanic hairs
he always like he's always there we
build a counter get her we walk together
and I give him my two hands if I could
just get him out on the track at the end
of the day
we brought home and put it on the lift
suite off the gear without fixed aliens
amongst neighboring cut the engines
place and we just kind of tidied
everything up and put it all back
together we got the stay off like most
of the night fingers Kara going over to
bed at like four and Devon together like
two sticks about for something so it was
a really long night thing it scary going
but we got it going
we got a driveshaft made the next
morning and we were able to portobello
connections because with a practice
table
it would be great they could make a
living a proper leave and out is
something that you you know you loves
more than anything in the world I
suppose anything you do is about having
fun right you can have the competitive
side of it but if you're not enjoying
something it's not worth doing so but
that if they even to go on a competitive
level that you still enjoy what you're
doing
most important thing for myself a Jonin
jackson connor is that number one I
suppose that were happy and it's a real
family time forced to head away at the
weekend so obviously they're gonna get
big Bush you know I hope that we'd
always be able to do that for as long as
we can possibly do that
