buzz report this week pakistan's
internet road construction Yahoo's ahem
buzz and clogging the tubes returns but
first it's the gadget of the week the
gadget of the week is the chumby check
it out the chumby is like a little
internet beanbag it's all soft it's
durable costs $179 it's Wi-Fi enabled
and you can kind of just use it to do
whatever internet stuff it could be a
digital photo frame an internet radio
receiver could be an alarm clock a home
weather station in our assess reader you
could use it as an ipod speaker dock
this jack back here like a little widget
server Dealey you can even put charms
chumpy charms on it right here so cute
did stop looking at me like that you
don't you want chumby look at it go
freaking cute and now for the news
earlier this week the country of
Pakistan attempted to censor YouTube in
that country but the misguided efforts
went wrong and the entire world lost
access to youtube for almost two hours
over the weekend and then the entire
country of Pakistan was taken offline
while the problem was sorted out now
this incident points to a serious flaw
in the way Internet traffic routing
works basically what Pakistan did is
take the road to youtube and build a
giant detour that took all the traffic
to like a black hole in Pakistan so then
no one could get to youtube and Pakistan
was sucking in more traffic than it
could handle so then all the world's
ISPs had to close all the roads into
Pakistan so they could rebuild the road
to youtube and according to experts this
kind of rerouting is almost impossible
to prevent and it's not that hard to
pull off in fact here's how one security
expert put it to the AP to be honest
there's not a single thing preventing
this from happening to etrade or Bank of
America or the FBI or the White House or
the Clinton campaign so it would be like
you know if I knew somebody who had some
internal access and a major
international data carrier and I slipped
him a couple of hundos and I said you
know I think that and gadgets been
getting a little big for its britches
and you know I'm not saying it happened
I'm only saying it could in yahoo news
the company this week launched a dig
clone that it's calling yahoo buzz see
that's funny to me because a couple of
weeks ago yahoo launched this tech
tracker thing on yahoo finance and then
they said they were starting a new daily
tech news roundup called the buzz I'm
Sarah Lacy and this is the bus and I let
it go because like the very next day
they changed the name to the dirt and I
was like yeah boom you better change
that name but little did I know that
they were just saving the name for this
new yahoo buzz think okay and first of
all do you guys know any other words and
second why you got to take my name for
your dig ripoff why not just call it
like big with 1g or you know like
borough I think I'm gonna launch a
little social net aggregation play and
call it cnet borough you can check out
my sweet little meerkat mascot yeah
you're both going down okay that was a
lot of anger let's move on and find out
what's clogging the team now this video
was posted on YouTube on februari 22nd
and it has already gotten more than 2.2
million views it's a three-year-old
giving an adorably precocious summary of
Star Wars an OB Kenobi kind of cancer
he's keep saying Luke how do learn how
to do his little light up thorn he have
to try to block the whole pokeball it
blowed up princess Leia's planet but
don't talk back to darth vader he'll get
ya huh I mean if she talks really well
for a kid She Who am I kidding she's no
chummy people she's new chummy I'm
Mollywood and this has been the best
