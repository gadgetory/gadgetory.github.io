and Twitter music get all the attention
these days partly because they make it
so easy to share your favorite music on
social networks but your old reliable
extremely popular friend Pandora also
has a bunch of tools for sharing your
favorite music and I'm going to walk you
through them in today's how to the first
thing you should do is log into your
pandora account or create one if you
haven't already signed up next head over
to the drop down menu under your name
and select settings click privacy from
the sidebar and scroll down to manage
external services from here you can link
up your Facebook and Twitter accounts by
signing in then scroll back up to the
top of the page and you'll see an option
for making your listening activity
public or private if you're watching
this video I'm assuming that you're okay
with being public so let's leave that
box checked under that you'll see a
section called additional options here
you can allow a pen door to publish to
your facebook timeline and get specific
about the kinds of things that can
publish such as listens likes and other
people you follow on Pandora personally
I like to keep it to just songs I like
now for the last step hit the Save
Changes button down here so what about
Twitter well from the main playback page
you'll see a share option where you can
manually share songs and stations on
Facebook or Twitter there's even an
email option down here if there's
someone in particular that you want to
send to while we're here you also notice
a publish button over on the left where
you can toggle your Facebook auto
publish settings on and off this is
handy for those times where you a kid
request some Elmo song and you want to
keep that filthy garbage off of your
facebook page finally one of the least
appreciated features at pandora is that
you can discover what your facebook
friends are listening to by going up to
the music feed tab up here and then
finding your fellow pandora loving
friends using the fine people button on
the sidebar you can use the follow
button to add people to your stream or
click on their names to take a peek of
what they've been listening to now the
people you follow will appear in your
feed and you can discover some great new
stations this way so that's how to share
your favorite Pandora tracks and
stations on facebook and twitter for
more how to like this head over to how
