it today I'm taking a look at the
Electrolux CI 28 BS 80 KS for a it has
touch IQ controls it has a perfect temp
drawer that lets you set the temp
separately from the rest of the fridge
it even has drawers that are luxury
close drawers that when you push them
they go like this it certainly is trying
hard here to convince you that it's
classy but the interior actually plays
that classy part pretty well when
hosting a fancy dinner party you'll even
be able to pull out the shelves right
from the fridge and use them as party
platters I mean I know I'd be thoroughly
impressed if somebody served me escargot
on a wide glatz fridge shelf with a
plastic handle on one of the ends look
electrolux deserves credit for trying
here and there might be some people that
would find this useful if it was
seamless but you have to tilt the tray
to get it into or out of the fridge so
if you arrange some hors d'oeuvres on it
they're gonna end up sliding all over
the place when you're putting it in and
out the one advantage these trays have
is if you're using it normally and you
do spill the inward slope is going to
keep the mess contained and I really do
like the way the drawers close but so
many of the features just step on the
toes of usability and oh yeah it's not
great at keeping your food cold so you
know minor thing the doors would run 10
degrees or more over the set temperature
even the middle of the fridge when we
had it set at the standard 37 degrees
Fahrenheit would go over 40 degrees
that's not a good thing the FDA
recommends keeping food that spoils
easily under 40 degrees and the main
part of the compartment doesn't do that
so I have a bit of affection for this
fridge because of how hard it's trying
but the bells and whistles don't add up
to the thirty one hundred dollar premium
because the features stomp on usability
and it's not great at the basic function
of fridges cooling your food so I can't
recommend the Electrolux II I 28 be at
80 KS for a four more be sure to check
