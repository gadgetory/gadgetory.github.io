surface tablet because no one was really
making cool touchscreen devices for
Windows it's still the gold standard but
it turns out that not everyone is ready
to abandon the classic clamshell for
life of clip-on keyboards that appeal to
the familiar maybe why Microsoft's
newest addition to the surface family is
this a very traditional looking laptop
the surface laptop is thin for its size
and lighter than the 13-inch MacBook Pro
and sensitive surface it works with the
surface pan and surface dial but you got
to buy those separately the single
biggest thing that jumps out about the
surface laptop is that the inside is
covered with an artificial fabric
material called Alcantara it's actually
the same stuff used in the interiors of
boats and cars that means it's probably
pretty stain resistant but remember
Microsoft is aggressively pinching this
to college students I have a hard enough
time keeping a laptop clean as a
responsible adult I'm not sure how a
fabric-covered laptop is going to fare
in the world of dorm rooms and dining
halls
just remember it's kind of tough to
reupholster a laptop one big extra to
keep in mind with the surface laptop by
default it comes with Windows 10 S which
is the new safer version of Windows that
only let you install apps from the
official windows app store
you're probably going to do the same
exact thing we did and immediately take
advantage of the free offer to upgrade
to Windows 10 Pro it's an ad on a box no
brainer for just about everybody
