winter the vivid festival is back for
its seventh year bathing the Sydney
skyline and laneways in beautiful light
I'm Claire Riley the Senate let's go
check it out visit Sydney brings the
world's top lighting designers engineers
and artists to Australia's harbor city
for two weeks of dazzling light shows
there are talks concepts and events that
every night as the Sun sets locals and
tourists alike turn out onto the streets
for the main event as the lights
switch-on after lighting the Sydney
Harbour Bridge and it's ferries last
year lighting design company 3200
lighting is back and they're going to
paint the town red with a cool
interactive display 3200 has fitted
Sydney's Harborside line with hundreds
of high output lighting fixtures and LED
tubes all connected to a central brain
via a wireless network with a hundred
thousand control channels for the
lighting project director Ian Reed says
the scale of the installation is
phenomenal it's a massive undertaking
with a live in buildings of a square
kilometre of a Wi-Fi network that gives
you the power to change the city 3200
have set up a touchscreen on the
waterfront that lets the public paint
the town for themselves lighting the
skyline is as simple as swiping the
display and selecting the colors for
each building add a few effects and
you're ready to go my favorite part of
this whole artwork is watching kids hit
the Go button and the faces light up as
the city lights up with their creation
the best feeling ever paint the town
will be running as part of vivid sydney
until the 8th of june</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
