Pluto this week and it was really
exciting especially for me makers nasa's
new horizons Pluto probe was launched on
January 19th 2006
way back when Pluto was still considered
by astronomers to be a planet but
shortly after launch scientists decided
to downgrade Pluto and took away its
planet hood renaming it a dwarf planet
based on its size in a vote held by the
General Assembly of the International
Astronomical Society in 2006 Pluto fans
were obviously devastated well now it's
your turn to vote crave readers should
Pluto be reclassified as a planet please

planet
