here's what's happening this week on
cnet spray the react channel on YouTube
recently produced an episode of elders
playing grand theft auto 5 and the
results are alarming I like that look at
that body turns out our elders will obey
all traffic laws even in a video game
environment okay hey stop stop win for
the light to change the pedestrian video
reveals that a number of seniors are not
afraid of the police I'm invincible
worry I'll never give up you'll never
take me alive and we also learned that
they are bloodthirsty killers I got a
gun where's the person hmm I shot some
people there's another one get her I got
a knife the knife you're closer to the
victim it's more personal check out the
react channel on YouTube for the entire
elders playing grand theft auto 5 video
which is highly entertaining them it's a
weird set affected man we're zombie
killer and slingshot enthusiast york's
prov operator of the slingshot channel
on YouTube which is the source for
everything you need to know about
slingshots has created a terrifyingly
brutal weapon for crushing zombie skulls
in the upcoming zombie apocalypse the
skull tongs use two balls on swinging
arms with a piece of rubber between them
to grab the head of a zombie or possibly
a human and then splatter their brains
all over the backyard but releasing the
balls which bash his or her temples in
it work
the skull tongues are an upgrade from
York's 2011 device the slingshot zombie
hammer with skull ejector future
projected the problem with this earlier
weapon was that you needed to get close
up to your chosen zombie the skull
tongues solved that problem with longer
arms for grabbing zombie heads the print
smartphone case is like a Polaroid
camera for modern-day digital times you
simply put the print case on your phone
and use the print app to take a photo
and the image will print right from your
phone case it's like having an
old-school Polaroid camera there is an
augmented reality feature worth
mentioning every time you take a photo
using the print app and case the phone
will take a short video along with the
picture once your photograph has been
printed when you point your smartphone
at the printed photo the video will
automatically play bringing that image
and that moment back to life the phone
case holds 10 sheets of photo paper at a
time and refills a photo paper will cost
twenty-five dollars for 50 sheets the
print smartphone case blew by its
funding goal on Kickstarter and can be
yours for a $99 early bird pledge
