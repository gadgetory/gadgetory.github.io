interesting far-fetched and anticipated
gadgets are coming from these days look
no further than kickstarter com this is
launched in 2009 this crowdfunding site
has helped inventors filmmakers writers
musicians and game designers pursue
projects that were once unthinkable
while many Kickstarter projects don't
get funded and they disappear into a
puff of vapor where a handful of them
have been turned into million dollar
ideas I'm Donald Bell and in this top 5
I'll be counting down the
highest-grossing Kickstarter projects of
the past year that raked in over a
million dollars starting off at number
five Double Fine adventure the classic
point-and-click graphic adventure game
in the style of day of the tentacle or
the Secret of Monkey Island just the
kind of game that doesn't get made
anymore the folks at double fine
productions want to change that so they
asked for four hundred thousand dollars
to revive a genre with a new game you
gave them over 3.3 million dollars I
think they're onto something at number 4
Reaper miniature bones if you thought
that tabletop D&amp;amp;D style gaming sessions
where a thing of the past here's about
18,000 project backers who beg to
disagree what do they want they want
awesome super detailed miniatures of
orcs and dragons and elves and goblins
after waking in about 3.4 million
dollars our nationwide shortage of
miniature ogres will soon come to an end
but even more of you prefer to play your
role playing games on a computer so
coming in at number 3 project eternity
from obsidian entertainment this is a
pure fantasy RPG in the style of Icewind
Dale it'll be out on Windows and Mac and
Linux and with around four million
dollars at their disposal they should
have plenty of resources to pull it off
but that small change compared to number
two oh yeah this is an open gaming
console based on Android that is poised
to threaten the big guys like Xbox and
PlayStation the hardware and the
controller were designed by Yves Behar
famous for his work on the jawbone
jambox but the crazy thing is that the
system costs just ninety nine dollars
it's an awesome idea it's great for
indie game developers and you
I liked it enough to give it 8 point six
million dollars all right and finally at
number one the pebble watch who said the
watch is dead with this guy you can link
up to your android phone or your iPhone
and glanced at your text messages
control music playback track your
workout it even tells the time and with
over 10 million dollars in funding I
think it's fair to say that the watch is
back so there you go five multi-million
dollar ideas that you didn't think of
takeaway here for me is that you people
really love your games if you count the
miniatures that's four out of five I'm
in the wrong business but if you want to
kick start my career head over to top 5
out cnet com where you can watch more
videos like this hopefully a lot of them
Donald Bell thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
