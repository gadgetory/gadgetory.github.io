much different than an iphone launch I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your seen that
update when the Apple watch arrives on
April 24th you won't be able to just go
stand in line and pick one up like
people do for a new iphone you will have
to make a reservation when you order
online you can have it delivered to your
home or choose in store pick up
pre-orders on apple's website begin this
friday at midnight pacific time and
starting friday there will be some
models to look at at apple stores if you
want to try one on but you can't just
walk up to a table and slap it on your
wrist you need a schedule of fitting
with an employee and that may mean
waiting around the store for the next
open time slot on April 24th the watch
will officially arrived but even after
the 24th it seems apples going to
encourage people to keep ordering online
the entry-level sport version starts at
three hundred and fifty dollars
inventory may be limited for different
styles so if you simply must be among
the very first to have that watch on
your wrist you should plan ahead on what
model you want and what band you want
then jump online as soon as pre-orders
begin for the East Coast that means
three o'clock in the morning along with
Apple watch pre-orders there's something
else pretty big happening on friday for
the first time all star wars movies will
be sold as digital downloads major
retailers like Amazon Google Play and
iTunes as well as PlayStation and Xbox
will offer the Star Wars digital movie
collection you can get all six with
bonus features for $90 or buy each movie
separately for twenty dollars apiece and
speaking of new digital frontiers we now
have a u.s. presidential candidate
taking donations in Bitcoin Kentucky
Senator Rand Paul announced he is
running for president and his website is
accepting donations in Bitcoin there's
also the traditional payment methods of
credit card or PayPal but Paul is the
first one in the upcoming 2016 race to
fund his bid for the White House with
virtual currency Paul is quick to use
new technology and apps like meerkat and
snapchat to appeal to a younger audience
and snapchat is causing some drama with
a new update that labels your friends
with emoji faces it's not just as simple
as putting a smiley face next to the
people you chat with
rather it's putting specific types of
emojis next to people's names based on
how often you chat a heart means you're
each other's best friend and you get
sunglasses if your best friend is also
one of their best friends but a side I
if you're their best friend but they're
not your best friend and all this is the
worst thing to happen to emotionally
sensitive teenagers desperately seeking
approval and looking to a stupid face
for validation of a friendship that your
tech news update for more you can head
to cnet.com and you can follow along on
Twitter where there are no emoji
judgments from our studios in New York
