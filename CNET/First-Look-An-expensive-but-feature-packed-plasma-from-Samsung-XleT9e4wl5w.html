cnet I'm standing next to the samsung pn
68000 this is a 60-inch Plasma TV this
is Samsung's best television for 2012 it
has more features bells whistles doodads
and what have you then you could care to
mention of course i'm going to try in
the following video this video will
apply to the 51 and 64 inch members of
the series as well now the real standout
feature for this TV is smart interaction
it's unlike anything on any other TV
there's a built-in camera and microphone
that enables the TV to interpret your
gestures and voice commands I went into
this feature in depth you can check out
seeing it for the full details but the
short story is that doesn't really work
all that well microsoft kinect for
example is a lot better to interpreting
gestures and voice and we really don't
think that's all that useful unless
you're you know going to lose your
remote control on a constant basis
speaking remotes another big step up
feature is a touch remote Samsung
includes two clickers with this TV one a
standard multi button remote and one a
touch version that actually has a thumb
pad sort of like a laptop computer in
practice it wasn't as sensitive as a
laptop and is actually a little bit more
frustrating to use in a regular remote
but it's pretty useful if you're going
to be you know navigating the web
browser built into this TV of course if
you're going to be using the web browser
significantly I recommend you get the
$99 optional keyboard which has a
built-in touchpad it actually works with
samsung's android devices as well so
that's a lot cooler and worked a lot
better of course i mentioned the
built-in web browser it's the best found
on any smart TV sweet samsung smart TV
suite has more apps than any other TV
manufacturers in terms of major apps
they are missing amazon instant which is
kind of a big knock but they more than
make up for it by having exclusive
access to HBO Go which for HBO
subscribers is one of the best TV apps
you can get samsung also offers a few
custom apps like family story which
enables sharing among samsung devices
and a couple of other things including
built-in cloud storage so you can
actually upload things from the TV and
vice versa to the cloud so all those are
pretty unique and make for a very robust
smart TV sweet one of the features
samsung throws into this TV is its IR
blaster that actually uses bluetooth to
send commands to a cable box or a
blu-ray player that means you can use
your gestures or voice to control those
devices although can
is really rudimentary and not really
worth it the smart touch remote also
works with the IR blaster to allow
control with a sort of harmony remote
esque setup but it's really not nearly
as good as a harmony and in practice we
just recommend you go ahead and get a
standard third-party remote like those
harmonies other standout features on
this set include an excellent selection
of picture adjustments TenPoint gray
scale and the best color management
system in the business so if you're
going to get this TV calibrated it
should turn out very nice speaking of
picture quality Samsung's eateth ousand
is the best plasma the company has ever
made superb black levels extremely deep
it also has that very accurate color
that we like to see of course it has all
the plasma perks including excellent
uniformity and off angle performance on
the downside is shadow detail wasn't
quite as good as we've seen on some of
the best tvs the TV also has slightly
worse ability to reject ambient light
than some of the other TVs we've seen
that's compounded by the fact that the
60 inch or didn't get as bright as we've
seen on some other TVs of its size but
I'll told the samsung PNE 8000 has
excellent picture quality in 2d in 3d
it's picture is also very good actually
better than a competing panasonic plasma
be tested recently Samsung throws in two
pairs of 3d glasses they're not all that
comfortable but of course they are free
and that's more that can be said for a
lot of TV manufacturers on the back
Samsung actually has one fewer hdmi
inputs with only three that might be an
issue of a lot of stuff connected this
TV I like the design of this Samsung as
much as any plasma I've ever seen except
for the stand I find that spider stand a
little bit weird but of course to each
his own the minimal styling around the
edge however is really nice it's got a
nice dark bezel very thin and of course
when seen from the side it's also really
thin you might mistake it for an LCD TV
and that's a not so quick look at
Samsung's best plasma TV for 2012 the
PNE 8000 series I'm David Katz my
