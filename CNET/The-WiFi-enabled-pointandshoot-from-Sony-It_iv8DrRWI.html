CES 2013 we're taking a look at a new
tiny camera from Sony this is the
cyber-shot WX 80 so this is pretty
standard stuff as far as digital compact
cameras go there's a 16 point 2
megapixel sensor inside this little
device and an eight times optical zoom
there is a bit more zoom you can squeeze
out but it's digital so you will lose
picture quality it has 1080p video
recording but a really nice feature
about this camera is that it's got Wi-Fi
sharing now this is the first time
Sony's put its Wi-Fi sharing technology
in a camera this small and it's a
particularly good idea on their behalf
because if you're thinking of buying a
small camera like this you might be
wondering why don't I just use my
smartphone so the idea is that you take
a picture with this the camera creates
us a Wi-Fi hotspot you connect it to
your phone using an app which is
available for iOS and Android and then
you can transfer your pictures across it
sounds like a great idea in a good way
of easily transferring your photos
unfortunately there's no Windows Phone
app on the horizon so if you're using a
phone running Microsoft's operating
system you're out of luck for now it's
coming out very soon in January and it's
going to cost 199 dollars which isn't
too bad for a camera this tiny wait for
the full review though where we'll be
testing image quality and all the other
features on the west wave cnet CES 2013
and this is the sony cybershot WX 80</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
