announcement linux and androids not so
secret love affair goes public and the
galaxy s2 plus one equals galaxy s3 will
be checking out the latest remover
rumors surrounding what could be the
next big phone all that more on this
week's episode of that's right this is
Android at weekly episode number 94
Marsh 21st 2012 I'm antuan goodwin
alongside j marker baby holla holla and
jessica doll court wit stephen beach
among the controls howdy ones and twos
ones and twos so yeah it's kind of jump
right into the news because this first
one is really interesting to me and if
we're starting to see like images and
rumors appear surrounding the next big
galaxy s phone the Galaxy s3 what's
going on with that okay well um for the
longest time we've been anticipating the
next galaxy s phone because the galaxy
s2 has just sold gangbusters around the
globe like over 50 million units
globally that it makes it Samsung's most
sold phone ever so it's a really good
phone I've reviewed it everyone else has
reviewed it everyone loves it and so we
were sort of wondering with Samsung
going to release the next one at Mobile
World Congress so that would be like a
whole or announce the next one at Mobile
World Congress that would be an entire
year after they announced the galaxy s2
but Samsung has still been really mom so
that is sort of you know gotten the
rumor mill churning and the latest is a
second photo of the week actually that
appears to be pretty spot-on and
corroborate an earlier leaked photo at
least in the terms of in terms of the
design sort of with a bezel around it
and it shows a white face in this
picture there are differences between
this picture and the one that Scott
Webster wrote about that was posted on
reddit one of those is that today's
picture which comes from gsm help desk
originally this is a dutch website and
BGR picked that up along with others
one of the differences is that it looks
like it's got android 2.3 gingerbread on
it still and the other picture looked
more ice cream sandwich ified so we
still don't know exactly what it will
look like on TouchWiz it could look like
this it might look like something else
another difference is that the other
picture has sort of the european version
of the controls below the screen and
they've got sort of like that physical
square button that you can push and the
image that we see today has
touch-sensitive controls on the bottom
so that's still possibly accurate
because that's what we see consistently
now with the Samsung Galaxy series like
the Galaxy Note has that physical button
in Europe and in the u.s. it has the
four touch sensitive buttons below the
controls and I for one would like to see
the physical buttons and you has not
that I have anything against the touch
sensitive ones but I just think it looks
a lot cooler to have that central button
but um I don't know how do you feel
about the profile of it because in in
the pictures on Scott Webster's piece it
it looks very thin and the rumors have
had it being incredibly thin too yes
weird 7 millimeters the longer I look at
this one with the the three light touch
sensitive buttons it looks like that
central button has like an outline
around it it does i see that too so it
may be both it may be bet it would be
crazy that would be refrain so the specs
on this have sort of followed the phone
along 1.5 gigahertz quad-core processor
could be Samsung Exynos they haven't
announced the chip officially yet
android 4.0 ice cream sandwich of course
possibly a four point eight inch AMOLED
screen of course will have an HD
resolution support for LTE and some
markets maybe it's also expected to have
a 12 megapixel 12 megapixel rear facing
camera HD video capture and playback
with 1.3 megapixel front-facing camera
rumors have it that that will be HD
video ready with 720p video capture
Bluetooth 4.1 that that's the most
recent version
version of it and Brian Bennett goes
nuts over Bluetooth 4.0 and one touch
pairing and also NFC support so you know
internet chatter is suggesting that may
27th in London could be a samsung
unpacked press conference in the
meantime the rumors are just stacking up
know about what about wireless charging
because we've seen we've seen a few
pieces you know circling circling the
web about rumors that this is going to
have wireless charging up to two metres
away that would be awesome to media
sounds very sci-fi though two meters
it's like six feet right to like people
who use real units of measurement and
it's just like how long distance to sue
somebody is so American trick well no I
mean I'm a huge fan of the metric system
but I mean a lot of people i mean i
think in the imperial system but yeah
it's like a long distance to be sending
energy it doesn't seem like i know it
just seems very GI joe science-fictiony
well i mean bluetooth what's the
Bluetooth range the Bluetooth range is
rolling goofy bluetooth I don't know no
bluetooth is like 20 20 30 feet like oh
yeah if you have a line of sight yeah
and if you're not doing anything but
maintaining a connection run you can get
about 20-30 feet with Bluetooth this
just seems a little different or played
out because power that's being
transmitted I mean I feel like if you
walk within that 6-foot field of energy
transfer right there some kind of
mutation has to happen to your body
right well I think you're already
walking through that much radio energy
at any given time just being at fee net
so I mean it's that kind of energy is
coming out of like the dozens of
wireless routers and and laptops and
cell phones that are floating around if
you could measure the energy be a lot
but me about my health some days yeah
who wants to live forever just being in
this room we're surrounded by all this
frequency I'm secretly hoping to develop
superpowers at some point yeah not so
secretly I guess that just shouted that
out we've all made me feel worse
thank you can feel saving here I was
actually trying to scare you awesome
didn't work the jmar kabhi be fearless
but yeah it looks like an interesting
phone big screen thin profile it seems
to be what the people want I think it's
going to be a fantastic yeah it's pretty
much the phone that anyone would design
if they can't assign the galaxy f2 was
kind of a big let's get all this is the
excitement built around Android kind of
phone it was a it was a it was a like I
said I don't know what the word I'm
looking for is but one of those points
were just like oh yeah the galaxy s2
that's something I know that regular
people knew whether the galaxy s2 was
and it attracted a lot of attention to
Android the galaxy s3 could possibly be
something yeah and it would be really
easy for it to write on the success of
the galaxy s2 I mean it will definitely
be Samsung's flagship phone but it was
no mistake I mean Samsung through a lot
of marketing money behind it it made it
global there are four versions of this
phone in the US on three carriers so I
mean that's that's not a mistake they
brought to make it ubiquitous they are
gunning for the iphone like the the the
the i guess the marketing student in me
is like yeah the fact they're sticking
with galaxy as like a name whatever
galaxy nexusgalaxy s galaxy blahblahblah
that it that keeps things in people's
mind repetition is what helps people
remember and right it's a product family
an HTC is doing the same with its HTC
one family of phones which I just gave
you the perfect segue come on yeah good
segue so let's kind of jump into that
sprint HTC have I guess started sending
out invitations to an event they're
hosting on April fourth now is anyone we
know have one of these invitations yes
we know who do we know I know do you
know anyone know me uh yeah see I mean
seen it a bunch of us got invitations to
this Brian Bennett in New York will be
presiding at that event basically a
sprint sometimes does these secret
events in New York they did one with
kyocera and it turned out to be the
kyocera echo
it was this big production with David
Blaine and like a cube or something
suspended over New York um this might be
a little bit more toned down so we did
talk about the HTC one family of phones
that was announced at Mobile World
Congress this comprises three phones
there's the higher-end HTC One X that
sort of has all of the features the
juice step features that you would want
then there's the HTC One S which is also
a pretty good-looking phone and that's
going to be for t-mobile The One X is
already assigned to eighteen t which
doesn't mean that it couldn't come to
sprint and that's what probably everyone
would want but I also have this
alternate theory that it could be the
HTC One V which is the most entry level
and there was a rumor yesterday that
surfaced yesterday that that phone might
come to virgin mobile and guess who owns
virgin mobile super in sprint so sprint
has boost mobile and virgin mobile and
you know there is a possibility I mean
sprint runs them I don't know if they've
really like run a lot of their own
events but they could be so I mean I
feel like it could go either way
hopefully this is an HTC one phone it
would be great if it were the one x but
and the x is the big one right that's
sort of like dziena oh yeah just in
terms of features it's a larger phone so
the slightly toned-down 1s for t-mobile
is still going to be a really good phone
um let's see one of the overall feature
so these are all Ice Cream Sandwich
phones they all have well actually
that's not true um well they all have an
image processing chip that basically
promises zero shutter lag and I tested
it out in Barcelona and it was pretty
awesome so awesome you know you take the
picture and it's supposed to take in 0.7
seconds and if you leave your finger on
the screen it will actually repeat the
picture so you just have burst mode hmm
so that's not even part of it anymore
there's no setting for burst mode you
just keep you just press and hold for
like two seconds and you've just taken
like three
yeah that's pretty awesome yeah look
that the shutter lag is kind of a it's
an issue on smartphones will mean for me
getting even issue on any camera getting
to the camera app on a smartphone by the
time I get there it's like ah the
moments passed so yeah like I'm a fan of
the hardware huge fan of the hardware
button and any way that you can like
speed up that sort of like shutter lag
and I mean also speeding up focus is
there something that they're working on
like being able speed up autofocus um
well the picture takes really quickly oh
yeah yes though yes they have done that
um so I think you know unless there are
any leaks that come our way we're just
gonna have to sit and wonder for a
little while and hope well mean it's a
little while it's April fourth looking
forward to that two weeks yeah totally
but one thing Brian mentioned was that
if if it is the HTC One X that it might
only be dual core rather than the quad
core that the rest of the that the rest
of the globe got to see right that yeah
and there's a reason for that I took a
look at that at Mobile World Congress as
well the quad core version of the HTC
One X is using the NVIDIA Tegra 3
processor which does not support LTE at
this time and that's why they are
switching to a dual-core Qualcomm chip
for for the HTC One X for AT&amp;amp;T Sprint
doesn't have 4g LTE yet it could be the
first 4g LTE phone for sprint possibly
although one has already been announced
and that would be the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus however it is also possible that
this could be a wimax phone on 4G right
whatever it is it's gonna be good I
think it's gonna be good you think I
think it could be more David Blaine and
the really weird kyocera echo dual
screen how is that not good I just
realized I'm gonna be in New York that
week David Blaine and we needs to call
me so I can rush over there definitely
rush for the one thing that uh that I
would definitely rush over to it's not a
good segue at all that was
hahaha go on no I would tie this
together um let's see David Blaine I am
a fan of David Blaine's work you could
say I love David Blaine what what does
he use you know who else are secretly in
love this is the worst take away our
linux and android we've got news that
let's just let's let's kill that whole
segue thing and just say that linux and
android we just got some news this week
from a stephen Shankland that basically
an article that states that the newest
version of the linux kernel version 3.3
is actually pulling code from the open
source google android project to be I
guess reintegrated into the Linux core
and what's interesting is that Android
is it's no secret is offshoot of Linux
and so it you know basically peeled off
from the the core tree the no branch of
of Linux and it was honed and developed
for the the mobile space but now the I
guess the the trunk if you want to call
it that of this tree is actually pulling
back from that branch and this is kind
of like I guess what's interesting is
you see this happen a lot of as Linux is
developing there are a little smaller
smaller branches smaller relief clients
smaller version updates and beta that
are happening all over the place and
these things split off and some of them
don't go anywhere you know they're like
oh we're going to try to do this other
thing we're going to maybe try to you
know develop or optimized for this sort
of use case and maybe that doesn't go
anywhere but sometimes they do go places
and they become things like a boon to or
what if it was a damn small linux these
like different versions of Linux and
sometimes they come back to the the core
kernel with the things that you learn
developing these smaller versions of
Linux can be used to be reintegrated
back into the trunk and this is what
we're seeing happen right now with with
Android is a lot of the lessons that
have been learned developing for the
mobile
and optimizing for the mobile space or
being brought back into the mainline
kernel so I guess the net result is is
that it'll be a lot easier for
developers to develop across these
different platforms right right probably
mean features would be released a little
bit faster and updates would be released
faster and things like that right right
so there's there's a there's a chance
that you know any sort of I guess what
this is kind of a reminder of is that
developments that happen in the core of
Linux anything that you learn there is
technically a lesson that you also learn
for Android in a lot of cases and the
same thing with Android so there's you
know it's for me a reminder of like the
sort of crosstalk between the two
different ways of developing I guess the
two different chunks of that development
but there's also an interesting thing
that Steven talks about about a boot to
Android user space puts that in
quotation marks and basically saying
that potentially an Android developer
could develop in the core kernel and
then output you know a nap or something
to Android instead of you know using
customized tools specifically for
Android in that sort of situation you'd
be killing two birds with one stone no
it's there's some interesting things in
the authority yeah I mean that sounds
like it might even open the floodgates
just a little bit more for app
development I mean anything that you can
do to make app development easier
definitely sort of speeds up the process
another thing that I find interesting
about this is that it reminds me sort of
what we're seeing an apple space where a
lot of the development and features and
a nap set we're seeing developed for iOS
are starting to pop up in the next
version of OS 10 I can never remember
what kind of animal it is lion or
mountain lion mountain lion yes some
sort of some sort of a panther dance
wance just guessing boomba
a muscle or I could sex panther out of
my head now because I said that before
the show I keep wanting to say sex
panther by OS chinn sex panther
basically is like pulling a lot of the
you know that the Notes app and the the
cloud integration and things that we're
starting to see in iOS so this is not
something that sort of specific I think
too we also see the same thing in the
window space where you know basically
windows 8 starting to look a hell of a
lot like windows mobile mm-hmm windows
phone yeah there's weird start calling
it that but yeah we're starting to see
that so across the board we're seeing
like these three different through three
very different operating systems
starting to do very similar things as
far as the the convergence of the mobile
technology and the the more deaf copy
less mobile technology ecosystem yeah
there we go he'll eloquence isn't that
my strong point but yeah that's that's
what's interesting there we kind of
wanted to to touch on that speaking of
the ecosystems you can't go to eco
android apps are available in the
android ecosystem they are and a recent
study out of purdue university it it
basically taught us or showed us that
free android apps waste seventy-five
percent of its of their power on ads
which means they waste actually more
power than two paid versions of those
same apps and I think that is
interesting what do you guys think I can
understand make some that happens I mean
the ads require out of 75 percent more
power let's say it's interesting I mean
I can understand bandwidth because
they're like serving apps I mean the
absolute a coupling the ads don't take
up a ton of bandwidth usually they're
like text in a small image but then I
guess yeah rendering those things in
and calling them up and then sometimes
doing transitions between them
overlaying them on you know whatever app
you're actually doing or just those
interstitial ads that yeah pop up in
between each function every time you
finish a drawing oh you won that game
that there's new thing I'm just saying
I'm avoiding yeah crawl with me draw
with friends that was something Johnson
oh yeah I'm avoiding that on purpose oh
I just don't have the time in my life
and I'm like way too good of a know
you'll find the time trust it wait till
you try it but yeah so the apps are
basically wasting seventy-five percent
more power so essentially does it pay I
guess it pays to pay for your app yeah
if you if you're using a free version of
the app there's like another reason to
help your developer out a little bit i
mean you know you if there's a for me my
upon personal use if there's an app that
i like and it's two bucks and there's a
paid version somebody put time into
building that app and that's the reason
that i buy a lot of apps is because i'm
like Oh yes'm some dude in his basement
you know just built this app in a spare
time i'll give him a couple bucks for
coffee so what I want to know from a
developer standpoint I guess it depends
on how popular your app is do you make
more money selling it or do you make
more money from that you probably make
more money from the ads because it's
long tail it's like the longer somebody
plays your game for example so if you
want to help the developer out then you
might just sacrifice more of your
battery power and just play the game
often we're open the app often and serve
yourself more ads and I think that one
way to look at it and I think that's
even more more so evident on the Android
platform because I think actually on iOS
a lot more people are willing to pay for
the premium versions of apps just from
what I've read mm-hmm and yeah I don't
know if it's so so lesson with listen
we're taking away because I'm I'm taking
I think we're basically looking at two
different directions right now between
I my opinion in Jessica's offense my
everyone is not really my tongue stuck
into my cheek ah so the lesson is based
based on both of your opinions what
you're going to want to do is buy the
premium version of the app then delete
that download the free version of the
app and then leave that on so that it
continues to serve up ads to you or that
is the best part are better for the
environment because you're drawing less
power from the grid charging your phone
right I think we've got a winner yeah I
found a eco eco bend on that paid apps
are the toyota prius of the marketplace
with that on that bombshell well we're
going to take a quick break but before
we do i'm going to shamelessly plug
myself and the special podcast edition
of dialed in that's coming up at eleven
o'clock in just about 20 well whenever
these guys are done we're going to be
talking about early termination fees on
the carriers you can send us your
last-minute horror stories and tips at
dialed in and cnet com there will also
be an opportunity to call it in live but
you can also just call us and leave us a
voicemail too and we can play that and I
didn't memorize the number for our show
ok Stevie changes right yeah i'll then
call US 1 866 402 cnet or call us live
18 when 888 900 cnet so that's it ok
great guys great do you just please
thanks for being here Jessica we'll be
right back
my dad was
Oh creepy creepy voice underneath the
Android Atlas thing there oh alright so
uh yell it's gonna get back into it more
HTC news here what do you got what do
you got tell me what's up well this is
HTC has been making a lot of music II
musical I have noticed the dance they
get involved with beef right and now it
looks like they are HTC and beats audio
are in talks to acquire music streaming
service mog and so it looks like if the
rumor is that there's already actually
been a contract signed and they just
haven't made it public yet so for those
of you don't know magas and internet
radio sort of streaming service I guess
similar to pandora spotify ii i'm
thinking i think it's kind of like a
Spotify I think it's more so the the
that you can choose your artist right
right right the on-demand kind of play
rather than just the radio i'm not sure
if they also have I think they do
actually have like a radio functionality
social or some sort of thing where you
can just hit play and junk starts coming
out of it yeah I mean the thing about
mog is that their their catalog doesn't
seem to be as big as a lot of the other
options out there right uh yeah i think
the the thing for me is I guess I've
actually used mauled on a couple of
occasions they have like a partnership
with BMW or something and we we got a
chance to test their integration into
into the the BMW sort of cabin
technology suite and it wasn't that bad
but I think I've at by the time MalK
showed up on my radar I was already kind
of like I guess committed to paying
Spotify and then I really want to jump
services or whatnot but that's not to
say that anything is that anything
negative about log service is just so no
no I mean I think they have what is it
500
an active users 14 million tracks 14
million I mean it sounds like a lot but
compared to some of the other options
out there i'm not sure exactly what what
Spotify has but I knew I do know the
spot if I has somewhere around 10
million active users and right they've
got to be listening to something the
interesting thing here is that the
standard right now as things are now is
when you sign up for mog you can listen
to music all you want on your desktop
but if you want to listen to it on your
phone that's when you got to start
coming up you know all you have to
basically start paying them a ten dollar
a month subscription fee to stream or
download music to your mobile phone now
i'm wondering if HTC's plan to acquire
them means that we'll start seeing some
sort of a deal where oh yeah you have an
HTC phone maybe you don't have to pay
that premium service maybe your HTC
phone with beats audio comes with a
marcus and then they find some sort of
other way to monetize that maybe with
ADD that's an interesting huh yeah i
mean it's it's a way to get them to get
users to adopt that service right off
the bat right now right when they get
their phone boom they're in and they're
locked in forever yeah and I mean they
can I mean it's the potential to the
user ten dollar per month savings
whether you were going to use mod war
spot if I think they cost about the same
so I mean yeah this could be you know
again tied into the hole HTC trying to
make themselves a music phone company
maybe or even you know just you know
saying that you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
