buzz report and now for the gadget of
the week actually before we start with
the gadje of the week i want to
introduce a new buzz report feature i
call it fanboy points see many of you
email me and accuse me of being biased
against either Apple or Microsoft now I
try to be objectively snarky so I
decided to put a little ticker up here
and every time I make a joke about one
of them will award some fanboy points
okay here we go the gadje of the week is
the microsoft zune digital audio player
now people are calling this a possible
ipod killer it's 30 gigabytes it works
with Windows Media Player 11 and it's
got one cool feature built-in Wi-Fi so
if there's a song you like you can
actually share it with another zune user
so that they can listen to it a couple
times and decide if they want to buy it
now that is the cool feature except for
the part where everyone in the world has
to have a zune now if you could send
them to an ipod now you're onto
something bring them up boys there we go
start your count now and now for the
news the University of Westminster has
turned its London Student Union into the
most high-tech bar in history you can
order drinks remotely using RFID
equipped touch screens that actually
send your order over Ethernet to the bar
and then someone brings you a drink
university administrators say the
technology is the best way to cut down
on huge lines at the bar hmm yeah if
only there were some other cheaper
time-honored method for you to place an
order at your table and then have your
drink brought to you a judge says that
DirecTV can be sued over its lower
quality high definition TV broadcasts
Pieter Cohen originally filed a lawsuit
against the satellite provider in 2004
when the company allegedly turned down
the bitrate on their HD TV broadcasts
the result is a lower quality picture
often referred to as HD light so if
you're watching me now on directv let me
help you out a little bit this part is
my hair and this is where my ears are
this all looks probably normal but what
you can't see is this little blue
hanging on my nose right here see
upgrade your bitrate so the big news
here at cnet this week is the
ever-evolving HP scandal now you may
remember that the chairwoman of the
hewlett-packard board of directors hired
an outside investigator to look into
leaks that were going from the board to
cnet news com and other reporters and
then things start to get pretty Nixon
the investigators apparently spied on
the personal phone records of our news
com reporters may have physically
followed some of them send a fake email
tip to a news com reporter that contains
spying software and now it looks like HP
also considered placing spies in both
Cena and Wall Street Journal offices
possibly posing as fake cleaning crews
now I know this sounds totally crazy but
we here at the buzz report have obtained
secret security footage that shows that
this infiltration actually happened
let's take a look yeah yeah I'm talking
about HP mm-hmm okay Oh tell me more oh
that's very interesting information okay
now can we just go over this one more
time I want to make sure I have it all
right okay wow that's a really great
insider tip thank you so much ok I'll
try rebooting it right now and we'll see
if that fixes it Thanks crappy HP
computer and there you have it good plan
HP I'm Molly Wood and this has been the
buzz report thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
