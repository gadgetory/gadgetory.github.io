our favorite robots of the year from the
totally terrifying to super adorable
there's a robot for everyone on this
list first up at I megawatts and kuratas
who didn't want to giant robots to Duke
it out in a battle to the death even
though the fight was a little more
staged than we had hoped we still loved
watching both massive BOTS beat the hell
out of each other to claim Robo
supremacy in the end megabots
took the win but there's going to be a
giant robot combat league because of the
public interest in this inaugural fight
so I think the real winner here is
humanity for now every robot needs a
best friend which is probably the real
reason Boston Dynamics is working so
hard on spot many sure it's super weird
to think about enjoying the company of a
headless robot dog but then you see spot
minnie frolicking around in the grass
and suddenly you're compelled to whip
out your credit card and click down a
deposit or that's maybe just me I've
spot Minnie is a little too horrific for
you perhaps the resurrection of sony's
adorable little AIBO is the answer to
your Robo dog needs the company
announced it would bring back the
adorable little bot pooch this time with
AI sensors and cute blue OLED eyes on
board it won't come cheap though at
around $1700 plus a required
subscription okay look at Oh cuties
little robot dog speaking of cute
companions we also have to include
Spiros r2d2 on our list was pretty cool
when the sphero bb-8 rolled into our
hearts but old-school Star Wars fans
have been desperate for a functional r2
for decades this r2 retracts and extends
its third leg just like in the movies
and watches slash reacts to Star Wars
movies with you r2 might be from a long
time ago in a galaxy far far away but
he's never felt more futuristic now that
you've let your guard down over those
last two adorable robots boom the last
robot is a reminder that will all be
enslaved by the robot race Boston
Dynamics made the list Twice first with
Mini spot and now with Atlas endless has
technically been around for longer than
a year but this year he learned things
like agility jumping back flipping and
freaking raising his arms in victory
probably practicing for his inevitable
victory celebration after successfully
and
humanity okay okay a lot of these robots
deserve more credit than just they're
going to kill us all someday but it's
still fun to talk about our favorites
and dream of the day robots like Rosie
the robot Kay from Blade Runner 20 49
and c-3po are made real so what was your
favorite robot up the air drop your pick
