in the Camry lineup it's got 200
horsepower that's right between the four
cell division and the six-cylinder
version but it also does 40 miles per
gallon average that's better than most
cars on the road certainly better than
the other Camrys in the lineup now for
the 2015 model year Toyota Gaye of the
Camry a pretty big update but it carried
over all the drivetrain options into
this new generation this really has the
same gasoline-electric hybrid drivetrain
as the previous generation we do get new
looks for the car it's got a longer
upper cabin area with a really raked
back glass and I like the way they
integrated the headlights and the grille
and I'm really impressed with the amount
of light room in the rear seat area
because I've got the Entune premium
system with navigation as an option in
this car I've got a 7-inch touchscreen
and what I really like about it is it's
really responsive so soon as I touch
things things happen pretty quickly when
I go to the home screen you're pushing
this home button on the side I get a
split screen this is right now showing
audio on one side navigation in the
other I could actually choose what I
want in these screens if I hit this apps
button then I get to see all the
features of this system just arranged by
icons and I can reorder these twos this
is part of the Intune system that Toyota
offers I really like in tune it's one of
the better app integration systems
available so I have the Entune app
running on my iPhone then I get all
these apps here I've got open table I've
got Pandora being I Heart Radio movie
tickets calm Facebook places if I go to
navigation and I hit the destination
screen so I've got my usual destination
input sources I've got manual address
entry points of interest but else have
this web search button so I hit that and
here it shows me Bing and Yelp those are
two of my location-based apps with
Entune those are enabled by the system
on my phone I can actually add other
apps in the future I want to see them do
that but right now we just have big and
Yelp so I hit Yelp and I've got this
nice search screen here I can just enter
any search term I'm looking for pizza
why not I put that in it starts at
searching process it's gonna show me all
the nearby results on Yelp with pizza
that comes up pretty fast I really like
that so I hit golden boy Pizza on Green
Street here in San Francisco it's it's
fun
and it's got my rating reviews and I can
just check the map location with that
right away puts it into navigation then
I can say go to golden boy pizza and
I've got my directions right there very
good system another cool thing in the
Toyota Camry Hybrid this is an option in
this binnacle here I've got key wireless
charging there's a button here I can
push to activate it and this is actually
an inductive charging pad down here so
if I had a phone that had wireless
charging either through the case or
built into the phone I can just set it
down in here it would automatically
charge while I'm driving pretty cool
feature I don't have to cable to the car
or anything and within two and I get
everything Wireless under the hood of
the Toyota Camry Hybrid we've got a
gasoline engine as the 2.5 liter
4-cylinder does 156 horsepower 156
County of torque
pretty decent numbers but we also have a
hundred and five kilowatt electric motor
adding its power for a total of 200
horsepower that's a good amount of power
for this car feeding the electric motor
is a nickel metal hydride battery pack
and it actually reduces the trunk space
just a little bit 2.3 cubic feet gets
taken out but we still have over 13
cubic feet bath there that's it that's
enough for most Costco runs the power
from the electric motor and the gas
engine gets mixed through a planetary
gearset this is something Point has been
using forever on these hybrid cars does
a fantastic job of seamlessly mixing
that power to the front wheels my first
couple of trips out in this car I
stopped the fuel gauge is broken because
it's just pegged at full and actually
it's still pegged upon I'm driving let's
start quite a bit now well it does have
a 17 gallon fuel tank so that's part of
it but the other reason is it's getting
40 miles per gallon average even better
than that also when I first started
driving this car I thought there might
be something wrong with it does it it's
up a little rub it didn't ride as
comfortably as I expected a Camry to
ride well then I looked at the spec
sheet and I noticed this is the SE
model and it's got a sport-tuned
suspension and i don't understand that
at all there's no reason to do a
sport-tuned suspension in a Camry Hybrid
because there's nothing really sporty
about this car let's price out our 2015
Toyota Camry Hybrid SE base price is
$27,995 but to do it up CNET style
there's just one package the Intune
premium audio with navigation
poeta tells me that's optional on the SE
trim model but the online car
configurator forced me to add it and
that's $1,300 along with a $995 sunroof
and $75 for the key wireless charging
option with the $125 destination fee our
total comes to thirty one thousand one
hundred and ten dollars I don't
understand the logic of having a
sport-tuned suspension on a Camry Hybrid
so I definitely at the Le or the xle
model not this SE model that said the
Camry Hybrid is an all-around great car
it's got good cabin space good power and
in tune F integration is one of the best
I've seen and you can't really argue
with forty miles per gallon average</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
