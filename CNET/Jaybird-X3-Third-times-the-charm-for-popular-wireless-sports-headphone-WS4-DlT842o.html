iteration of the company's popular
water-resistant wireless sports
headphone what's new about it well for
starters it's earbuds are smaller than
the X 2's also its inline remote has
been redesigned and its battery has been
upgraded to deliver up to eight hours of
juice while playing music at moderate
volume levels j-bert also says it's
tweaked the six millimeter drivers
inside the earbud and I will say these
are among the best sounding wireless
sports headphones out there right now
and at 130 dollars they cost $50 less
and what the X 2's cost when they first
came out as far as other improvements go
the fins that help secure the buds in
your ears have also been redesigned for
the better and jaybird now includes a
clip to attach the headphone to the back
of your shirt if you want to the set of
cord shortening accessories are also in
the box along with plenty of ear tips
one of which will hopefully allow you to
get a tight comfortable seal to maximize
sound quality it's also worth mentioning
that jaybird has a little charging
accessory that connects to a microUSB
cable which you then clip on to the
inline remote I was a little worried
about losing the accessory but jaybird
said it went with this charging method
because sweat and grime from people's
hands sometimes ended up in the USB
charging port on the x2 and cause the
headphone to fail jibbers more expensive
freedom headphone has a similar charging
scheme but the freedom charging
accessory includes a built-in battery to
extend battery life this one doesn't
however like with the freedom you can go
into Jaybirds my sound app for your iOS
or Android devices and customize the
sound to your liking I thought the
default sound profile was pretty well
balanced and work just fine for me
overall I think the x3 is a significant
improvement over the x2 and may actually
better than the freedom well I think the
Bose sound sport Wireless is a slightly
more comfortable headphone to wear the
x3 did fit my ear a little better than
the x2 and it's more discreet than the
Bose and helmet friendly so you can wear
it while skiing or snowboarding without
a problem I'm David karna for cnet.com
that's the jaybird x3 thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
