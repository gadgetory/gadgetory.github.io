cnet.com and today we're taking a look
at this little stocking stuffer it to
the automatic smart driving assistant
and for one of our top picks for car
tech gift I give this year now this
little white dongle will actually help
you maximize your vehicle's fuel economy
now the automatic from art driving
system is actually a two-part system
this is the automatic link it's a small
obd2 dongle that plugs into your
vehicles diagnostics port now most
vehicles built after the mid nineties
should have one now what it's doing
while it's in there is communicating
with your bluetooth-enabled iphone over
bluetooth for data low energy and it's
sending information about what your
vehicle is doing back to the phone now
the reason for that is so that it can
give you an accurate idea of what your
vehicle's fuel economy is even if your
car doesn't have one of those dashboard
fuel economy monitors now the setup
process is actually pretty simple the
first thing you'll do is pick this guy
up and then download the app to your
phone and then after that there's a six
digit pin on the back of the automatic
that you'll need to punch into the app
so that the phone and the device can
actually start to communicate with each
other now once you've got the pin
punched into the app you'll just plug
this guy into your vehicle's diagnostic
port usually it's up underneath the
dashboard somewhere and then wait for
the phone and the device to start
handshaking and communicating with each
other then it's just a matter of turning
on your car and waiting for the app to
automatically download all the
information about your vehicle sensor
the VIN number and then comparing that
to an online database so they get the
most accurate information about your
fuel economy and the expected fuel
economy that's advertised by the EPA
finally you'll just drive your car
around like normal with this guy plugged
into your Diagnostics port as you're
doing that it's going to be collecting
all sorts of information about your
driving habits about how much fuel
you're using and then at the end of the
trip that will actually compare your
fuel economy with the epa fuel economy
and then taking current fuel prices show
you how much your trip cost you it'll
also using your phone sensors give you a
sort of a gps map of where your route
was and show you any places that you're
driving could have been
a little bit more efficient and at the
end of the week the app will actually
generate a driving score for you on a
scale of 1 to 100 with 0 or 1 being a
really low fuel efficiency with lots of
room for improvement and closer to 100
meeting that you met or exceeded the epa
fuel efficiency for your vehicle and
you're doing a really good job so if
you're looking for something to tuck
under the tree or in the stocking of the
car tech lover in your life take a look
at the automatic smart driving assistant
but make sure they're an iphone user
because for right now it's only
compatible with iOS devices Android
compatibility is coming to have a niche
one google with cnet com and this is the
automatic smart driving assistant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
