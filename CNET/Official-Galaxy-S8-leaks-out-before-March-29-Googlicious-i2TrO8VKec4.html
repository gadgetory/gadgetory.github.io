licious for everything google you can
think of there's lots of action around
mobile world congress and we'll get to
that but the big news came after samsung
announced its next unpacked event will
be on march 29th where we'll see their
official announcement for this wait
that's the galaxy s 8 yep sorry Samsung
it's already been leaked out by heaven
blast with this render but boy genius
report took it to the next level and
said hey if Samsung won't unveil it at
Mobile World Congress we will now this
is the actual samsung galaxy s 8 in the
wild with its 5.8 inch screen the larger
galaxy s 8 plus will feature a 6.2 inch
quad HD+ Super AMOLED display say that
three times fast now the battery will be
bigger in the s8 plus but other than
that the phones will be the same now
check this out the curved glass display
slopes down on both sides of the phone
for a nice feel but the phones are
actually narrower thanks to a nearly
edgeless bezel this time around and come
on are you drooling already that's just
sex 8 now in the US the essay will be
powered by a Snapdragon 835 with 40 gigs
of ram and 64 gigs of storage with
microSD XC support that's up to two
terabytes but 256 gigs is the largest
capacity available right now there will
be a 12 megapixel dual pixel camera and
a relocated fingerprint sensor on the
rear side but in the most interesting
move not only will the s8 keep the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack it's still
ip68 rated for water and dust resistance
that means the s8 with a headphone jack
will be more resistant to water than the
current iphone 7 and 7 plus that took
out the headphone jack because they said
it would help make it more water
resistant now the official announcement
again will be on March 29th in New York
City and the galaxy s 8 line is expected
to launch globally on April the 21st now
let's talk about mobile world congress
and the best device of the show has to
be the LG G 6 their modular design is
gone there's no more removable battery
but it's the best design the LG flagship
has ever had it's their first dust and
waterproof phone with an ip68 rating it
brings a dual rear camera setup that has
a standard and wide-angle lens the front
facing camera is why
as well plus the Google assistant is
here and it's the only phone other than
the Google pixel that has it at the
moment and you know what that's why I
like a g6 like a g6 yeah if LG doesn't
use this for their ad campaign they
dumped it will also be the first phone
with Dolby vision HDR support it's only
enabled when it's fed Dolby vision
content by Netflix and Amazon but I hope
it lives up to the hype otherwise it
might feel more like a gimmick now the
g6 will hit Korean markets first on
March the 10th for close to 800 u.s.
dollars it's not clear when it will be
available in other markets after that
and what was the highlight for Mobile
World Congress a phone that you love but
most likely won't buy check this out the
revamped 2017 edition of the Nokia 3310
or for my friends oversee the Nokia 3310
now the charm is still there after all
these years it's rounded now with a 2.4
inch qvga display and a glossy finish
there's this blazing fast 2g data and
texting with the t9 keyboard and if you
really want to go old-school it still
has the classic snake game this time
with colors it will be available in
select markets for 49 bucks so you can
either buy it for a nostalgia or because
you're a bad guy on 24 who needs a
burner phone now this might be the best
marketing job nokia has ever done except
no one's really going to buy this to use
it as their daily phone and finally you
tube TV is official that's the name of
their new live TV streaming service that
will cost thirty-five dollars a month
with a bundle of channels from broadcast
networks and some cable networks it's
basically the big for ABC NBC CBS and
Fox and cable channels related to those
broadcasters like ESPN Bravo and Fox
News independent pay for TV networks
like Viacom or Turner will not be part
of the package and YouTube TV will have
unlimited cloud DVR storage to add your
favorite shows or sport teams
recommendations with the help of its
machine learning hour and it will
eventually work with your Google home so
you can launch a specific show with
gesture voice it will be available in
just a few months as a nap first because
they expect most of their users to watch
TV on their phones youtube TV will also
work on laptops traditional TV and on
google chromecast devices so if you want
your YouTube TV it's coming real soon
alright that's going to do for this week
you can email me at google is just at
cnet com or tweet me at Brian Tom thank
so much for watching we'll catch y'all
next time for some more of that Google
