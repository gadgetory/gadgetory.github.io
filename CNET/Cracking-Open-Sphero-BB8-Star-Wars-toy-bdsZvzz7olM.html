theaters this December but you don't
have to wait until then to get up close
and personal with one of the movies new
characters thanks the robot makers spero
fans can by their very own albeit
slightly smaller version of bb-8 one of
the astromech droids featured in the
movie now I got my hands on one of the
new bb-8 robots and after taking it for
a test drive I wanted to find out what
makes it work and what makes it
different from spiros other rolling
robot now luckily I have my own show
where I get to do just that
I'm Bill Detweiler and this is cracking
open from the outside there are a few
noticeable differences between the bb-8
and the older Sphero
and the Sphero too this one's a spark
Edition with a clear shell the bb-8 has
a handy little droid head here has a new
droid inspired paint job and has a
different charging station now like the
Sphero and the Sphero 2 it measures 2.9
inches in diameter it stands for point
five inches tall and weighs about 7
ounces now the real magic with the new
bb-8 happens with the app designed just
for this version of the Sphero now using
the app you can drive the droid like you
would a regular Sphero you can also
issue voice commands you can have the
unit follow pre-programmed commands such
as patrol and you can even record and
play messages that the app makes look
like the holographic communications used
in the Star Wars movies now what makes
the bb-8 so different from the older
sphero's on the inside well to find out
we'll need to crack it open
unfortunately there's no way to get
inside the bb-8 without cutting through
the shell now I could use something like
this hacksaw but that's a little slow so
instead we're going to use a rotary
cutting tool and a diamond wheel but I
want to be safe so we're going to use
our safety glasses and our safety gloves
let's get cutting
now that we're inside the BB eggshell we
can lift out the internal hardware which
is comprised of a plastic frame to which
the circuit board motors drive gears
batteries and charging coil is attached
the internal design of the bb-8 is very
similar to that of the Sphero - with the
addition of the mast which extends up
from the center of the frame and
contains two magnets and these magnets
are what hold the bb-8 s-- head in place
and allow it to move to dissect the
internals I started by removing the mast
and magnets after removing a pair of
Phillips screws I also removed the main
system board on the board we find the
BBH brain and st micro stm32f4 - bit arm
cortex m4 core now there's also a csr
10:10 Bluetooth chip ST micro 512
kilobit serial EEPROM and a white high
battery charging chip along with a
gyroscope and accelerometer flipping the
unit over I removed another pair of
screws and a part of the internal
plastic body that covers the motors and
batteries flipping the unit again I
removed a thin plastic piece that covers
the batteries and then the pair of three
point seven volt 350 milliamps
lithium-ion batteries next I removed the
bb-8 to standard motor FP 130 - Katie
electric motors the drive wheels and
axle came out next and finally the
receiver coil for the inductive charger
now with our BBA in pieces the teardown
was complete so now that we know what's
inside the bb-8
how does it compare to its older cousin
the Sphero - well except for the mast
and magnets which move BB aides head
it's nearly identical there is one
surprising difference between the spark
addition of the Sphero tube and the bb-8
besides the clear shell the spark
Edition has an extra ST micro MCU on the
I'm bored now I suspect this extra chip
allows the spark which is designed to
teach kids about robotics and coding to
actually run the programs written by the
users all in all the bb-8 was a lot of
fun to crack open and even more fun to
use for more information on the bb-8
