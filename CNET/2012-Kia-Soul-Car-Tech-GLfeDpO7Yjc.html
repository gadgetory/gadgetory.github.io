fired the first volleys let the world
know that Kia was going to be the urban
cool cousin of Hyundai what's really
changed for 2012 is under this hood
where they used to have some pretty
anemic little four cylinders hooked up
to a four-speed automatic that would not
have been unfamiliar to the Jones when
they crossed from Oklahoma but before we
see these changes let's go inside now
inside things are cheap and cheerful as
you might imagine and the distinctive
look you've got this sort of what
pill-shaped
center console in this car because we
have a premium audio system you've got a
very pronounced center channel speaker
we've also got some tweeters up here and
the remaining I think four speakers
around the cabin it all tells you that
we've got the premium sound your base
sources on this car are going to be
am/fm CD satellite radio aux-in USB key
and Hyundai have been very aggressive
about putting that in at low trim levels
how you control those systems is through
the UVO interface UVO is basically your
voice I think where it stands for this
button here lets you do voice command of
hands-free calling that's pretty common
audio system and navigation none of
those are groundbreaking but in a car at
this price level it is command please
find a dress find out dress we do have
bluetooth streaming on this guy but
unfortunately no metatag information it
won't tell you what artist or song is
playing at least not with my droid razr
now as you can see on our navigation
system it's not a huge screen but that's
about as big as the console allows so
it's the best they could do you see we
have a serious traffic icon here you do
have traffic information live the
interface is common to Hyundai and Kia
products we've seen before but it's
simple its touch there's no controller
to speak up and it responds quickly I
like the way this guy moves around look
at that I can bounce around that map and
not lose it the premium audio by the way
is Infiniti stuff it's also got better
amplification the part of it that makes
me nuts and it's not going to get in
your way is the fact that we have these
color lights on the speakers
seen these you can set the color to be
off that's what I do or set it to music
where they pulse mostly to the bass in
the music or set it to mood where they
just do this mood thing independent of
the music you can change the color by
pushing and the intensity with the
rocker switch that's an awful lot of
engineering for something that's pretty
much useless and as part of the UVO
package strangely you also get the rear
view camera bundled in with that I don't
know what they have to do with each
other oh by the way this power steering
is electric to help the MGP okay not
much has changed in the look of the soul
the sheet metal is all the same but with
some small changes here in the front
bigger fog light pockets little
different shape on the alien mouth which
goes with the alien eyes on by the way
the paint's called alien 2 or alien barf
depending on your point of view and
you'll also spot one of these guys by
LED daytime running lights front and
tail lights
if it's a high trim car okay here's the
engine with somewhere in here way down
here sitting down low that's because
it's not a very big thing but it doesn't
need to be this is a new technology
motor now they used to have some pretty
anemic four cylinders in these cars
they're still 4s but now modern
technology your base engine the sole now
has direct injection which is kind of
the technology in gas engines these days
but it's only at 1.6 we have a high trim
car this is the highest trim Sol it's
got a 2 liter motor 164 horse 148
foot-pounds of torque gets this guy up
to 60 in about 7 seconds that's not a
huge feat doesn't only weighs 2,700
pounds I have relatives who weigh that
much
mpg is good though 26:34 if you get the
base car with a scrawny ER engine you
get 27 35 mpg a little slower zero to 60
I don't think it's worth it for that one
mpg gain just keep your tires pumped up
and you can do that much better
now I've mentioned before when I Drive
these cars right when they arrive at the
scene at garage first time I get in I
don't look at the badges at all I don't
want to know what the powertrain is I
want to guess cuz that tells me how well
it's doing its job so when I got in this
car I figured it was a 2-liter four
that's pretty obvious but I thought it
had a CVT a continuously variable
transmission in fact it's got a
six-speed with real gears that's not a
good thing because the CVT is a kind of
slippery thing in most cars kind of an
indecisive gearbox and this one feels
that way to me I've got this eco button
up here when I engage that and I see
that light the car is really going to
modulate acceleration to use the least
amount of gas there's no electrical
technology here no battery regen no auto
start/stop that's coming in a future Sol
but it makes the car very numb so I
disengage it and it's still got lots of
weird hunting so not a fan of the
gearbox programming it's not awful but
other Hyundai's and Kias I've driven
have really sharp decisive transmissions
and that's a big part of a car feeling
responsive beyond that it's a nice old
car to drive I mean it's taut it's firm
it's not much fun the tossing corners
its kind of shall we say rudimentary ly
sprung but the build quality is good all
around it seems to be bolted together
pretty well it does feel it's
lightweight the car definitely feels
very featherweight and it is okay a Kia
Soul can be had for about seventeen
thousan in this plus trim level which is
where I'd start because that's where you
get into the 2-liter motor
unfortunately all the CNET style tech is
still missing at that price point so add
in twenty five hundred bucks more to get
to the exclaimed trim level that's going
to roll in 18s six-speed automatic the
UVO system a hard drive for media if you
care and the Infiniti sound on the
output side then another twenty three
hundred bucks for the Premium Package
that will get you a hard drive
navigation the rear view camera
automatic temperature control and heated
leather seats
