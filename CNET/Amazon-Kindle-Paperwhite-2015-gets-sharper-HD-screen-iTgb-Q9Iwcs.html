this is the new third generation Kindle
paperwhite e-reader which looks
identical to the previous model and
starts at the same hundred $19 but now
sports a high-resolution ink display
that's found in the top-of-the-line
Kindle voyage
so same eReader but better screen like
the voyage the new paperwhite uses a six
inch Carta ink HD touchscreen display
with a pixel density of 300 pixels per
inch amazon says that's double the
number of pixels as the previous
generation Kindle paperwhite and like
all eing screens it's big selling points
are as a viewability in direct sunlight
and energy efficiency the added
resolution doesn't make a huge
difference but images and text do appear
a bit crisper particularly with smaller
font sizes it's a little hard to show in
this video the subtle difference in
sharpness but trust me it's there even
with the new screen the paperwhite isn't
quite the equal of the voyage first of
all it's about an ounce heavier and when
you compare the screens of the new
paperwhite and the void side-by-side
you'll notice that the contrast on the
voyage is slightly better with text
appearing slightly darker the light on
the voyage at its highest setting is
also brighter amazon says 39% brighter
and the screen appears whiter according
to Amazon battery life hasn't changed
the new model it offers up to six weeks
of operation on a single charge based on
a half an hour reading per day with
wireless off and the light setting at
ten you get the same one gigahertz
processor four gigabytes of built-in
memory and a bump up to 512 megabytes of
RAM from 256 megabytes
there's no expansion slot for additional
memory but that four gigabytes allows
you to store thousands of e-books that's
the new Kindle paperwhite in a nutshell
for the nitty-gritty details you can
read our text review but suffice to say
amazon has made an already excellent
eReader a little bit better while the
new HD screen isn't enough of an upgrade
to make you want to chuck your old
paperwhite it's a welcome addition that
incrementally improves the kindle
reading
I'm David Carr no way thanks for
