TVs new for 2017 this is not an oled
television which LG is known for they
are the best picture quality on the
market this is a less expensive
television that uses standard LCD
technology but LG's talking about some
new improvements they made this year
this is their best LCD TV for 2017 this
is the SJ 9500 series a little different
from it's less expensive counterparts
mainly because it's really thin if you
look at it from the side here you can
see almost OLED in thickness but of
course it bulges down at the bottom for
all the electronics and connectors you
need so in terms of picture quality LG
says it's improved the black levels on
this set to be less reflective and
improve the contrast when you're
watching a brighter room it also says
off angle video quality's improved a
little bit and it's got the color a
little bit better so in the past we've
not found LCD TVs from LG to perform
that well those improvements might
change that this year LG also says these
sets can work with for accounting for
HDR formats that's dolby vision and HDR
10 like last year but this year they've
added Technicolor and a new format
called h LG neither the last two have
any content out right now but the idea
is to add those extra improvements for
getting future compatibility when more
HDR format does come out Corsi sets a 4k
resolution and you can see styling wise
they have this pretty slick little stand
here it's very curved looking of course
the TVs themselves are completely flat
this is the most expensive there's also
a couple in the super UHD line that have
a little bit less in terms of features
and a little less styling but again they
have a lot of those picture quality
improvements that's quick look at LG's
super UHD line of LCD not OLED TVs at
CES 2017 I'm David Katz my prasena</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
