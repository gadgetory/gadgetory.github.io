spend a week and take a look at the new
iPad and show us what they can do with
it with all that amazing graphics
horsepower so we're going to bring up
three demos to show you some really
amazing stuff the first is from Namco
Namco is a great developer of a lot of
titles on the iphone and ipad titles of
everything from pac-man to sky gamblers
today we're thrilled to show you a first
glimpse of our new flights in game sky
gamblers air supremacy running on the
new iPad
great gaming experiences are about
immersion being able to really lose
yourself in the game and the new iPad
helps us achieve this in two key ways
first the extra graphics performance
lets us increase the level of detail of
everything in the game and second the
astonishing resolution of the new
display means absolutely none of this
detail goes to waste just look at the
heat haze coming off of the engines here
look at the scale of this city look at
the detail in its buildings and check
this out sky gamblers air supremacy
delivers console-quality single and
multiplayer experiences an experience
that not even this giant screen here
could actually show you the only place
to truly experience the intensity of
action that richness of detail is on the
new iPad itself sky gamblers air
supremacy launches exclusively on iOS
later this month thank you today I'm
excited to show you something new with
the help of Lawrence yang I want to
introduce sketchbook ink sketch book ink
is a new drawing app that focuses on
line art so it's totally complimentary
with sketchbook pro in fact Lawrence
actually started this piece in
sketchbook pro and is using the painting
created as a background you'll notice
right away that we take a lot of design
cues from sketchbook pro we have two
customizable panels on the sides one for
ink styles the other four color swatches
it's resolution independent so you can
see no matter how far you zoom all the
strokes stay crisp and smooth
professional and everyday artists are
going to love this device and it's going
to inspire them to create beautiful
pieces of artwork just like what
Lawrence has been creating for you live
today which by the way dude that's
pretty amazing for 90 seconds
autodesk sketchbook ink will be
available this April exclusively on iOS
thank you very much so just like Apple
has raised the bar today for mobile
computing epics iOS exclusive franchise
infinity blade has been raising the bar
for mobile gaming and we're really
excited to that with the new iPad so
today I'm going to introduce epics rod
fergusson and the latest chapter in the
Infinity Blade saga dungeons so in
dungeons you are the apprentice to the
master of the forge and you're on a
quest to craft the ultimate weapon the
Infinity Blade so you guys are in for a
visual feast of unprecedented detail
today I mean seriously these leaves here
are blocking the light from the Sun
right so let's dive in to this abandoned
mine and as soon as we go in you're
going to notice that your eyes pupils
are adjusting to the darkness cool greys
are getting give way to warm orange
tones from the lava that's a technique
called tone mapping that are
cinematographers use to dynamically
adjust brightness and color palettes for
better immersion of course just like all
our products this is running real-time
brought if you want to zoom in and show
them the incredible detail we're getting
here yeah well that's enough sightseeing
Mike if we're going to crap the Infinity
Blade I need the fire silk from the
Spider Queen Oh abandoned huh a few
quick swipes but now with the touch
interface I just hold and I can connect
my enemies for a chain attack
so infinity blade onions will bring a
robust crafting system dynamic dungeon
crawling all to the world of infinity
blade and it's only going to look like
this and play like this on the new iPad
Infinity Blade 2 is available right now
on the App Store and dungeons will be
coming soon thanks everybody for playing
thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
