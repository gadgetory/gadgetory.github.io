duck but not because it stands out from
the crowd of enthusiasts compacts with
one inch sensors it's odd because it
really doesn't which is unusual for
Panasonic the Alex 10 combines the 20
megapixel one inch sensor of the cs100
with a fast but short zoom lens and
manual aperture ring like the LX 100 but
those two standout the cs100 has the
longest zoom range in a compact camera
with the size sensor and the LX 100 has
a larger but lower resolution 12
megapixel 4 third side sensor and it
delivers better photo quality than the 1
inch models the only really notable
aspect of the LX 10 is that it's 24 to
72 millimeter equivalent lens starts at
f-14 that's wider than other cameras but
not by a really meaningful amount and
that's only at 24 millimetres it does
hit f28 at 33 millimeters and can stay
there through 72 millimeters which is a
bit wider across parts of the range than
many other cameras and it has pretty
good autofocus too by leaving out a
viewfinder and a hot shoe panasonic
manages to be cheaper $700 than the
current models in Sony's rx100 series
those are closer to $1,000 but they do
have view finders its photo and video
quality or excellent but I don't know
that a lot of people will find it more
noticeably excellent than a lot of the
competition and I miss a viewfinder
since the display only tilts up which
frequently makes it difficult to see in
direct sunlight and I don't think it's
tiny battery will make it through a full
day of vacation shooting you really need
to plug it in to charge whenever you can
Panasonic does offer some unique
capabilities in its cameras such as post
focus which snaps multiple shots at
multiple focus distances turns them into
a short video and you can extract the
shots you like from that and its 4k
burst modes work the same way for a
really fast continuous shooting at 8
