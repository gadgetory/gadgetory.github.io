here at last
in the nokia X but what is Nokia's take
on Android what are its features and
what is it missing let's take a look
let's start by talking about the
homescreen now this doesn't look
anything like regular Android in fact
Nokia has tweaked it to look much more
like it the Windows Phone operating
system as such you get these colorful
blocky tiles they can be moved around
and resized as well you can also change
the color of some of them if you swipe
down from the top you do get an Android
s notification pane seeing as this is a
dual SIM phone that lets you switch SIM
cards and you can also do things like
manage Bluetooth and Wi-Fi another major
part of this interface is what Nokia
calls Fastlane you access that by
sweeping to the right and this shows you
all of your recently used apps as well
as notifications interestingly unlike
Android there's no dedicated place to
find all of your apps they're just all
on the home screen so you will have to
scroll up and down until you find the
one you're looking for that could get a
little annoying now although it's
Android at its core there's not a Google
app in sight here instead the apps it
comes pre-loaded with are from Nokia and
Microsoft so you get things like Skype
Nokia's here Maps or Microsoft's
onedrive in fact apps are likely to be
the most contentious part of Nokia's
take on Android and that's because
unlike most Android devices these phones
don't have access to the Google Play app
store instead you have to find your apps
through Nokia's own app store or third
party alternatives if an Android
developer wants to bring their app
across Nokia has to approve it and they
also will have to change their code
slightly because of the way that Nokia
handles billing Nokia says you can
sideload apps if you want to but that's
probably a little too technical for most
people to bother with ultimately then
the question is does this tweaked
version of Android really have enough
apps to be tempting and as to that we're
just going to have to wait and find out
so this interface is designed to be used
on cheap Nokia phones however Android
phones are getting cheaper all the time
so it's not like there's no competition
another thing to bear in mind is that
this interface is still in his early
stages I think his success could come
down a lot to where the Nokia could
persuade Android developers to get its
apps onto this platform and quickly it's
an interesting strategy and an
interesting take on Android but what do
you think of Nokia made a smart move or
should they have stuck with something
much more recognizable let me know and
check out senior comm for much more from
Mobile World Congress
