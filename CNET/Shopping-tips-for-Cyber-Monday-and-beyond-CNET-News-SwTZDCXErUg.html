as you scramble to score sales on gifts
keep these basic rules in mind to avoid
getting suckered by a bad deal for
starters always do a little background
on the gadget is it brand new
or is it last year's model we've seen
some nice sales advertised on last
year's Roku which is still perfectly
good as well as last year's Beats Studio
wireless headphones and last year's
GoPro Hero 5 Smart speakers are going to
be a hot gift and we've seen many stores
selling a new Google home Mini at a
discounted price of $29 during Black
Friday and then stores were throwing in
bonus gift cards and coupons to sweeten
the sale it sounds perfect until you
remember that Google admitted there was
a problem with the speaker and it had to
disable the touch controls it's not a
big deal if you don't mind only
controlling it with your voice see
research matters if you're getting
wrapped up in Amazon deal hunting you
should use the site camel camel camel
it's a funny name but it will check the
price history of everything sold on
Amazon so you know if it's a really good
deal also do the math on bundles getting
a bundle doesn't always mean you're
getting a discount
we saw Nintendo had a Super Mario
Odyssey switch bundle that came with the
console game and carrying case and it
costs the same as if you bought all
three things separately when you're
swept up in the shopping rush of a sale
be wary of buying extra accessories at
full price and stay away from off-brand
or no brand tablets they just end up
being junk when it comes to cheap
tablets the best choice is Amazons fire
seven tablet it's only 30 bucks when
it's on sale I'm Bridget Carey and you
can keep up with the latest hot holiday
