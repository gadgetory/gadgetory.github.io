confession to make
I love the Nintendo 3ds I do I do I do
in fact it may be my favorite gaming
platform of all of last year that's what
the PlayStation 4 the Xbox one the ps3
the Xbox 360 the Vita the iPhone there I
said it
why is that true well first of all
personally I've gone back to being in
the Nintendo games for a long time and
that gets into what the appeal of the
Nintendo 3ds is for you which is it is
still a great gateway to a very
excellent supply of games made by
Nintendo it may seem obvious but we've
written off Nintendo for so long since
the Wii kind of tapered off and the Wii
U's been struggling in the 3ds when it
launched in 2011 seemed like it wasn't
going anywhere
that maybe haven't been paying attention
that there have been a lot of really
good games that have come out on this
handheld that are wonderful worth the
money and have tons of hours of gameplay
what it isn't however is a universal
game player now there really isn't a
Kindle of gaming everyone's sectored off
into different zones if you go into
mobile like iOS there are certainly
games you can't play that you can play
on your Sony system your Microsoft
System your Nintendo system and
generally even though there were
third-party games and needless to say
never the twain shall meet on a lot of
platform a lot of genres and a lot of
different franchises like Uncharted or
you have Halo or you have Mario and you
know and it goes on and on that's why
this can sort of do what it does which
is that you're basically paying an
admission ticket to play all of those
Nintendo games don't expect any
third-party games or sports games or
shooters or things that really would
match maybe what you're looking for
otherwise you got to come here for the
Nintendo games and you're gonna pay an
admission ticket of 129 169 or 199 for
the 2d s 3ds or 3ds XL my favorite is a
3ds XL because the screen is so much
bigger physically than the others and
that really matters not only for the
quality of the 3d perception effect on
the 3ds systems but also it
just makes it easier to use it the
controls feel really good the battery
life is better I prefer it the 2d s is a
great entry point at low gives up the 3d
effect all three of these systems at
least have the same features they have
the same cameras Wi-Fi motion tracking
abilities same controls same touchscreen
capabilities and they all play a
Nintendo 2ds plus 3ds games and they
both connect to the same a shop or all
three of them connect to the same you
shop which is a lot of content now
that's building up a lot of
back-catalogue cheap games that you can
pick up so it's obviously great for kids
and I think those games are better and
deeper than you would get on a mobile
phone but you had to think if you're
gonna hand an iPhone or iPad to a kid or
you may have a lot of games to entertain
yourself on an Android device or
something like that you may not need
this no those prices I just stated for
the three systems you'll find a lot of
variations you'll find sales at certain
stores there are some packing bundles
that even cost less and include free
games so you should shop around and see
you might be able to find one as low as
175 or $100 or find one with a Mario
game that you wanted and you know maybe
that means that the 3ds is a better Buy
at one store than the 3ds XL take that
into account when you go shopping right
now it's a great dedicated little gaming
platform and the best one that Nintendo
makes is that enough for you if you have
10 great games to get on it I think it
is I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at
the Nintendo 3ds as it stands early 2014</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
