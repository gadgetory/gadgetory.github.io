standing with the LG 55 e m 9600 this is
going to be LG's very first big screen
OLED TV and perhaps the first that ships
to the US market this TV uses o le D
technology which is a brand new display
technology it's actually found in some
cell phones the Samsung makes but is the
first time we're going to see it in a
really big screen this 55 inch TV is
thinner and lighter than pretty much any
other plasma or LCD TV out there one of
the advantage the Poulet is excellent
contrast so we expect this TV to have
very deep black levels perhaps flat as
black as it can possibly get that of
course improves the picture fidelity
especially when you're watching in dark
rooms and adds real pop to the picture
in addition being thin in life this TV
also has a really thin bezel around the
screen so it's incredibly compact for a
55 inch model LG says the bezel is one
millimeter although in person it does
look a little bit thicker than that this
might not be a shipping sample behind me
however I bet they're going to slim that
bezel right down when it ships in the
third quarter 2012 as you'd expect from
a really expensive TV this set has all
the features all the bells and whistles
LG includes into passive 3d which it
calls cinema 3d so you can put on these
inexpensive passive glasses to watch 3d
on it the set also has LG's smart
interactivity with the 4-way motion
remote so of course all those features
are kind of gravy compared to LED but
they are included despite the TV's
really thin size that pin sized also
makes it impossible to put connections
on the TV itself so there's going to be
an external media box that connects to
the TV that houses hdmi and perhaps some
processing power too so it's going to be
an umbilical between that box and the TV
itself to keep the TV really good in
life
LG tells us that this TV uses a 4 sub
pixel arrangement so in addition to the
standard red green and blue subpixels
there's a white sub-pixel that actually
increases the brightness so that
overcomes one of the traditional issues
with LED LG tells us this TV will ship
in the third quarter of 2012 price
undetermined that's the real catch we
expect his TV to retail for at least
eight thousand dollars u.s. that's a
quick look at the LG o LED TV the 55
