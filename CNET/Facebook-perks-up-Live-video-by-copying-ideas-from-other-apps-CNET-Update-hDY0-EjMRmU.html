Facebook live how about photo filters
I'm Bridget Carey this is your cnet
update it's a busy day for social media
news so let's start with changes at
Facebook Facebook's live streaming
videos are getting new features to live
in a broadcast so to speak now you can
tap on those reaction emojis while
watching a video and whenever someone
taps an icon it will float by on the
screen in real time for the broadcaster
see it's just like those hearts on
Twitter's periscope video app but
Facebook's icons bounce across and they
could be a combo of hearts thumbs ups
and faces and in an attempt to copy some
of that Instagram and snapchat magic you
could also add color filters to videos
such as a black and white filter in the
future if they also want to let you
write on the video now live videos from
your phone are a growing trend but you
know what else is hot right now
encryption and facebook-owned whatsapp
is getting lots of buzz for adding more
end-to-end encryption to messages which
prevents the company or any other agency
from seeing your chats whatsapp did have
high level encryption for a while now
for text messages but it just expanded
the protections to more areas like group
messages and photo messages even as
government agencies are putting pressure
on tech companies to loosen encryption
for data collection and investigations
you have whatsapp and others pushing
encryption as an important feature to
win over consumers security is a selling
point right now end-to-end email
encryption is messy for people to do on
their own so if you want to chat
securely you'll have to turn to a phone
app if you're interested in others you
want to check out the signal app that
also encrypts phone calls meanwhile at
Twitter there's a new button on the
mobile app that lets you easily share
someone's tweet in a direct message chat
this is part of Twitter's mission to
grow as a private messaging tool and for
you social crafters out there the
marketplace etsy is starting a new
service for sellers it's called pattern
by Etsy and those that make things like
jewelry or furniture can pay fifteen
dollars a month to have their own
websites to show off their work online
shopaholic should be pleased to learn
that
amazon prime free same-day delivery
service is expanding to 11 more cities
in the US the same day deliveries of
amazon prime now began last year in may
you have to shop on a prime now app to
get the option but bloomberg reports it
could come to the main amazon website
next month that's all for this tech news
roundup but you can find us on all the
socialist I'm actually Facebook liveing
right now whoo look at that if you want
to see a behind-the-scenes look at this
episode just find me on Facebook from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
