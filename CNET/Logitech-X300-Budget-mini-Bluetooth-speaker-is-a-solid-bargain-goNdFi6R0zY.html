portable wireless bluetooth speaker with
built-in speakerphone capabilities comes
in a few different colors and retails
for about $60 online hi I'm David
Connolly and I know what you're thinking
just what the world needs another
portable Bluetooth speaker but the good
news is that X 300 is a good value at
it's modest price point many ways it's
logitech's answer to the popular JBL
flip and flip two speakers which are
about the same size and shape but cost
around $100 like the flip the X 300 can
be laid down horizontally or propped up
vertically it has two drivers along with
a passive subwoofer and Logitech says
the way that drives are angled gives the
speaker a more expansive sound spectrum
the two speakers share a similar sound
profile offering a reasonable amount of
bass and decent clarity for a Bluetooth
speaker this size as with the flip to
the key to the X 300 is that it doesn't
distort even at higher volumes the
reason for that is Logitech's engineers
have done a good job with the digital
processing in this unit making sure the
speaker doesn't get overloaded sometimes
you can hear that processing kick in and
restrain the speaker which isn't good
but it's better than having the speaker
distort badly at least I think so
in all I like this speaker it doesn't
come with any sort of carrying case and
it's battery life is only so-so at five
hours but apart from that I didn't
really have anything to complain about
it's got a sturdy attractive design and
offers decent sound for its size I take
this over most of the generic $50
schambach coughs out there this was a
lot of the more established many
speakers which tend to retail for $99 or
more I'm David Carr joy thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
