orb shaped Alexis speaker with a
built-in touchscreen camera aside from
using Alexa exactly as you would at the
Amazon echo the echo spot also lets you
make video calls check it on your smart
home camera feeds or watch video on that
tiny two-and-a-half inch touchscreen at
130 dollars the spot splits the
difference between the pint-sized echo
dot and the touchscreen equipped echoes
show like the dot it's a small sized
speaker with an oxide jack that lets you
connect it with bigger speakers like the
show that touchscreen adds an extra
layer of Glantz ability to the Alexa
experience and it's not just the
clockface you'll also see extra info
during weather forecasts video clips
during your flash briefings lyrics and
album art when you stream songs from
Amazon and more as you use Alexa like
normal still I question how much that
touchscreen actually adds to the Alexa
experience this is still very much a
voice first user interface and the
display often feels like an afterthought
the other problem is that your video
options are extremely limited for
instance there are almost 4000 different
news sources you can add into your flash
briefings but only 27 of them feature
video to make matters worse you can
stream video from sources like Amazon
Prime video and twitch but you can't
stream from YouTube at least not right
now
that is a huge blow to this ecosystem
and it's not gonna get any better until
Amazon and Google stop squabbling with
one another I'm not holding my breath
waiting for that to happen as for the
camera amazon says that it only uploads
video during video calls and drop-ins
and you can disable it altogether in the
settings or by just pressing the mute
button
still I have preferred that Amazon put a
physical shutter on the spot you could
keep that camera covered until you
actually wanted to use it I mean after
all a lot of people are gonna use this
thing as an alarm clock and keep it
pointed straight at their bed
all-in-all the echo spot is a charming
looking gadget with a nifty nest-like
design and it makes sense if you think
you'd use it to make lots of video calls
or to check your smart home camera feeds
it has everything that you like about
Alexa and a brand new package and I also
like that it's a lot louder than the dot
but like the echo show the echo spots
visual interface is underwhelming
and the lack of YouTube support is a
major disappointment I like the spot but
I'm not ready to recommend it yet not
even for Alexa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
