believer in protecting the cinema
experience this is my edit room here in
my house in Miami I love cutting hair
because it's quiet this whole system
pipes to Santa Monica where I have five
editors yo oh yo bye
anyway those are my editors you can
connect with like different room they
can see what I do on my system here and
we can share screens it's a great way to
work a movie like transformers needs to
be seen using the very finest tools the
best sound technology best projection
technology and cameras I'm here to keep
three-d alive and the only way to make
it the best experience for you is to
shoot it natively that means two cameras
two eyes that see exactly what you're
seeing we're the first movie to ever
shoot IMAX 3d we place these two
gigantic cameras on top of each other to
give you amazing resolution just like
your eyes you see depth it is beautiful
and it's something you cannot fake we're
gonna spend the extra ten to fifteen
million dollars and we're gonna do it
right we're in fact the only movie this
summer that was shot in native 3d what
image like this to post convert is
virtually impossible see those billions
of little particles here they have to
capture each one of those and put them a
different space whereas when you shoot
it natively it's already doing that for
you the scale of a Transformers movie is
meant to be seen with big screen with
great Dolby Atmos sound and brightly lit
3d screens Michael's always fun the
cutting edge of technology for the
audience to have them have a more
visceral experience his filmmaking is a
very three-dimensional style
transformers has Benny
part of our brand it helped build IMAX
Michael is the very first filmmaker to
take two of these cameras and configure
them on a 3d rig and shoot in 3d in real
time and that's not trivial the
resolution the detail the clarity it
really is mind-boggling
it was a lot of shoot I keep
saying this is my last one and I'm going
out with a bang this is a big scale
