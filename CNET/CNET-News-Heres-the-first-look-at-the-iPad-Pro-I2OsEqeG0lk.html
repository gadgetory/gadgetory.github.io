shows and movies are more cinematic the
games we play are more immersive and
powerful and an ipad is always a
multi-touch device so now at the bigger
iPad pro you can have a full-size
software keyboard so you can type in
your documents for this great big
keyboard and keyboards can do many
things like be an amazing musical
instrument and the new multitasking
features in iOS 9 slide over split view
picture and picture were designed with
this iPad pro in mind they make it so
much more productive and capable so how
big is the screen on the iPad pro it's
12.9 inches on that diagonal why 12.9
inches ok let me tell you a little
secret about its size let's put next to
it our previous largest iPad that's ipad
air 2 if you look at the width of the
iPad pro it is the same as the height of
the ipad air and then we take that
height and we make a 4 by 3 ratio and
now you have an ipad big enough to run
your full ipad air apps with more room
side by side it is an incredible display
there's 27 32 x 2048 pixels do the math
it's 5.6 million pixels we thought this
display deserves a great sound system
and so for the first time ever an Apple
product we now have a four-speaker audio
system and it automatically balances the
left and the right depending on how
you're holding the iPad and it balances
the frequencies between the top and the
bottom dynamically to create a beautiful
stereo sound stage and it puts out three
times the audio volume of an ipad air 2
you really have to listen to it it's
amazing and that's packed into a device
that's incredibly thin in light
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
