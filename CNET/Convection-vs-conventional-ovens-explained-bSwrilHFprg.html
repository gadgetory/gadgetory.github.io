that hot air rises so the upper half of
the oven will always be warmer than the
lower half so if you put in two sheets
of cookies the top will cook faster than
the bottom rack in our tests the top of
the oven was a full 30 degrees hotter
than the bottom convection oven to the
rescue convection ovens use a fan to
circulate the air within the oven to
equalize the temperature so no matter
where you place your dish or how many
dishes you cook at the same time they
all cook evenly
but that's not the only benefit since
more hot air comes in contact with the
food your dishes cook faster so you'll
have to adjust your recipes accordingly
some ovens will auto adjust the
temperature for you otherwise you'll
have to do it yourself
usually that means reducing the
temperature by about twenty-five degrees
or reducing the overall cooking time by
about 20 percent
get to know your oven so that you know
exactly how to adjust your recipes once
you have the math figured out the
benefits of convection cooking are huge
for baked goods butter will release
steam quickly and this means the results
will be play here lighter and fluffier
and with roasts the fat will render
quickly sealing in those delicious
juices and leaving an evenly Brown and
crispy skin without the constant basting
there are a few catches first not all
foods agree with convection cooking
souffles and even light cakes are just
too delicate for hot air blowing out
their batter you'll need to adjust the
fan speed or disable the convection
feature completely and second there's
the cost more parts cost more money
usually hundreds of dollars it's not a
cheap upgrade but if spending less time
in the kitchen is worth your while a fan
in the oven might be exactly what you
need
