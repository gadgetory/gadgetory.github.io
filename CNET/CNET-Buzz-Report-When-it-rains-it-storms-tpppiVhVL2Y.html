online information source with a digital
age
hi I'm Molly wood and welcome to the
buzz report this week removable
batteries teenage drivers and the big
green army but first it's the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week is the
new blackberry storm duh
officially announced this week the 3g
storm will be a verizon phone in the
u.s. it features a big touchscreen with
click response typing a very nice 3.2
megapixel camera that takes video and
has a flash the BlackBerry OS and all
its business support plenty of
multimedia awesomeness and copy and
paste it appears to square off quite
nicely against the iPhone except for the
fact that we still don't know when it
will be released or how much it costs so
you know what rim release all the
details you want until I have it in my
hot little hands it's still in the same
league as the tooth fairy but thanks for
the press conference and now for the
news the European Union is considering a
new rule that requires all consumer
electronics devices to have removable
batteries many believe the rule would
affect Apple the most considering that
the iPhone every single iPod model and
the MacBook Air all have locked in
batteries the EU says removable
batteries are consumer friendly and make
the batteries easier to recycle but see
Apple already has a recycling plan for
iPods
it's called released a new one every six
months you don't have to throw away the
battery just recycle the whole thing
throw it away there you go this week
Ford said it would release programmable
car keys designed for parents to give
their teenage drivers the keys will
limit a car's top speed to 80 miles per
hour set the stereo volume at 44% of
maximum permanently enabled traction
control and introduce a nagging seatbelt
chime that's kind of awful but I'll
probably get one for my son when he's
old enough to drive oh hey can we also
get this key for the old people maybe we
could have a minimum speed setting too
late like 60 that's all I ask just go 60
the army is installing a massive solar
array in the Mojave Desert reportedly to
help bring down its three billion dollar
a year energy bill uh-huh now the army
can tell me that a solar array that's 35
times larger
the current largest solar thermal
installation is all about going green
but don't think I don't know that
they're actually working on an
infinitely hot directed giant laser beam
designed to vaporize hostile aliens upon
arrival I'm not saying I object I'm just
saying I know and finally let's have a
look at what's clogging the toons do I
even need to tell you guys what's
clogging the tubes the whole internet is
only watching one thing Tina Fey as
Sarah Palin governor Palin would you
extend same-sex rights to the entire
country you know I would be afraid of
where that would lead
I believe marriage is meant to be a
sacred institution between two unwilling
teenagers okay two things first
I would totally vote for Tina Fey and
second I have a very important election
prediction to make Sarah Palin will be
the number one Halloween costume that
every party this year
boom who's gonna bet me no one that's Oh
winner I'm Molly wood and this has been
the buzz report thanks for watching hey
Molly Molly what do you think the pink
jacket or the red one totally the red
it's pretty good right oh yeah you
betcha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
