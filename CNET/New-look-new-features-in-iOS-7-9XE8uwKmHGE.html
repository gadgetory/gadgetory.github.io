completely new look new features
reworked interfaces for the core apps
and plenty to show off I'm only going to
cover a few of the changes here but
there's plenty more to check out in my
full review when you first start up iOS
7 you'll notice immediately the new
passcode screen colorful icon designs
and flattened buttons this is the first
time there's been a major redesign since
the iphone was released in 2007 so it
can be a little jarring at first for
long time iOS users still I got used to
the new look pretty quickly and I like
what I see so far to get started let's
check out the new control center a
feature already available in the android
OS the control center gives you easy
access to adjust your most-used settings
and all it takes is a swipe up from the
bottom of the screen from here you can
get to common actions like turning on
airplane mode setting up Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth and you get a slider for
quickly adjusting brightness you also
have music controls and buttons across
the bottom for quick access to the
flashlight setting your alarm opening
the calculator and bringing up the
camera you can access the control center
from any screen so you don't have to dig
through the settings anymore next let's
look at safari Apple's mobile web
browser finally has a unified search and
address bar at the top so you can just
type in a search term or URL and you're
off and running you'll also notice the
flat design at the bottom with back and
forward buttons the share button
bookmarks and a button to see all your
open pages browsing through open web
sites is a much better experience than
before letting you swipe to browse tap
to open the page or swipe to the side to
close it now let's check out music the
redesign shows a lot more white space
and you'll notice there are still
buttons at the bottom for genius
features playlists and artists but over
on the left is a brand new edition with
iTunes radio here you'll be able to
create a station based on an artist or
song then hear a mix based on your
selection you also can simply pick a
genre and start listening I've been
using iTunes radio and so far it works
great next let's look at the camera app
along with a new look you can now swipe
to switch between video still
we're shaped and pan of shots you also
have a new colorful icon in the lower
right that lets you bring up quick
filters you can pick before you take a
picture when you want to browse your
shots the Photos app got some cool
changes as well sorting your photos by
year in a huge mosaic though you can
touch and drag to see specific images
you also can simply touch the year to
drill down to show photos by date and
location this is a huge improvement over
the wall of photos layout we used to
have in previous versions the last step
will check out as messages you'll notice
the flat chat bubbles no longer have
that 3d look but one new feature will
definitely come in handy a quick swipe
to the left shows the time each text was
sent where you only had a general sense
of the time in previous versions of the
OS well it may not seem like a big deal
texting is now a major form of
communication and I know I'm not the
only one who would like to know exactly
when text or sent recieved there's a lot
more to look at but in the interest of
time we couldn't possibly get to all the
new changes read my full review for a
complete breakdown of new features in
Iowa set thanks for watching everyone
this has been a first look at iOS 7 i'm
jason parker foreseen it see you next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
