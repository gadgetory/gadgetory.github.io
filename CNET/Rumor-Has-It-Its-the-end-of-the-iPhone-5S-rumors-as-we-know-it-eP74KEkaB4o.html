rumor has it the show that rounds up the
week's biggest tech rumors and you can
vote on what you think about the rumors
too in the interactive player if you're
watching on cnet this week we've got a
quickie about the PlayStation but more
importantly iphone iphone iphone let us
begin first as competition heats up
between microsoft and sony Sony is said
to be adding voice recognition to its
PlayStation 4 according to polygon the
feature will be included in the
PlayStation Eye which is a separate $60
accessory it's reportedly similar to
microsoft's xbox one kinect to
capabilities in that it has facial
recognition technology and it can follow
navigational voice commands so now all
of you Microsoft users won't be the only
ones waving your arms around and yelling
at the TV everybody can look like a
crazy person no matter what system you
use and finally this is it everyone
Apple send an invite for its September
10th event because of this we might not
have a rumor has it next week so here's
a roundup of what we suspect will happen
we think two phones will be announced
the iphone 5s which is an update of the
five and a lower-cost 5c with the 5s we
know it will have iOS 7 but that's about
it it could come in three or even four
colors it might have a bigger screen it
might have a fingerprint reader and it
most likely will have the new a7 chip
people want NFC including myself but so
far all signs point to maybe most of
what we think we know about the 5c is
that it'll come in pink yellow blue and
green and it could have a plastic case
some people have speculated that it
won't include Siri and it may be for
emerging markets again we don't even
know that the 5c will even be announced
but the event invite which looks like a
game of dots hints at something colorful
and all those leaked pictures we've been
seeing are totally convincing I think
that the 5c is definitely going to
happen what do you guys think to find
out for sure tune into Cena
calm next week for live coverage on
tuesday morning September 10th that's
our show everybody please share your
rumors that rumor has it at cnet com or
call set 1 800 750 cnet and tweet us and
see you in a couple of weeks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
