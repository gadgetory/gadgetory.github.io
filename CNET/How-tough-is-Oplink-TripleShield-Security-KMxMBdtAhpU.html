I've got the optelec security triple
shield package here to talk about we
looked at the package in comparison with
ice smart alarm another do-it-yourself
security kit that we reviewed this is
very similar it's got a lot of
components that do the same thing it's
got the same contact sensors that when
they separate will trigger the alarm
it's good for doors and windows it's got
the remote control tag here if you can
control it from your keychain it's got a
motion detector it comes with a panic
siren and if you pay 350 instead of
$1.99 you get two of these these
motion-detecting cameras that are
capable of switching into the night
vision mode all of its controlled by the
OP to the optic processing unit right
here it's just a router for all these
devices it kind of talks to them and
tells them what to do it organizes it
all so it's a pretty simple familiar
system and it works pretty well I tested
it out in my own home and I was very
impressed the app is very easy to use
the cameras in particular work very well
that's a problem we saw if I smart alarm
that uplink doesn't seem to have the
camera set up quickly and they do a good
job of switching from day vision to
night vision so when the LEDs go down
they will automatically adjust and start
capturing night-vision footage and
that's really cool another nice feature
is that if the alarm is triggered the
cameras will automatically start
recording for 30 seconds and save that
clip to your app so if something happens
if something breaks in you're gonna have
video of that break-in and you can send
that to the police to the insurance
company or you can just check in live
and see what's going on it's a really
nice feature it works well
another nice perk about this system that
we haven't seen the five smart alarm is
that you have the option of a cellular
backup you can purchase an additional
modem that for an extra ten dollars a
month we'll give you that cellular
backup in case your wireless network
goes down that's nice that's a good
option to have I think the thing that
might scare a lot of potential customers
away from op link is that unlike guys
smart alarm they charge a monthly fee if
you get the triple shield package with
the two cameras you're gonna be spending
$19.99 a month in fees in order to run
your system you have the option to add
extra sensors out of cart style but if
you add extra cameras it's gonna cost
you another five dollars per month on
top of the monthly fees you're already
paying still the monthly fees are a lot
less than you'd pay for a big security
firm
the system works pretty well the cameras
are really nice the app works great so I
liked it I'm not sure that I like it
more than I smart alarm to justify those
fees though but that's really up to you
if you're not convinced that you need
the cameras and you don't want to spend
twenty bucks a month take a look at the
OP link alarm shield package it's the
same thing as this without the cameras
and the monthly fee is a lot less the
bottom line is that this is a reasonable
security option for the do-it-yourself
minded consumer but the fees might be a
bit of a turn-off so you'll have to
decide for yourself and it's worth it
for seeing it I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
