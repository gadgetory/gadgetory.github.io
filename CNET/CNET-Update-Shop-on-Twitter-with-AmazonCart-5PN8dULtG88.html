Richard Carey and this is your CNET
update the future of online shopping
could be in social media amazon has
partnered with twitter to create a
special hashtag that lets you put items
in your shopping cart simply by sending
a tweet here's how it works first you
have to link up your Twitter account to
your Amazon account and once Amazon
knows your Twitter account anytime
someone tweets out a link to an Amazon
product you can reply with the hashtag
Amazon cart to put it in your shopping
cart you'll then get a reply tweet from
Amazon confirming that it worked it
doesn't mean you bought the item it just
means that it's waiting for you in your
shopping cart so you can make the final
purchase later it's so easy for anyone
to do this and it could potentially be a
new way for Twitter to make money we
don't know how Amazon and Twitter are
making money from this amazon says
twitter is not taking a cut of sales
from items added to the shopping carts
with the hashtag oh and for folks in the
UK they don't call it a shopping cart on
Amazon instead they use the hashtag
Amazon basket it's not just Amazon's
testing new ways to order online Google
just expanded its same-day delivery
service called Google Shopping Express
the program first launched in the San
Francisco Bay Area last year and now it
expanded to Manhattan and West Los
Angeles when you visit google.com slash
Express you'll notice Google partnered
with major retailers to sell all sorts
of products you can order basic
groceries a yoga mat even a 47 inch TV
customers then choose a delivery time
window for that day Google is promoting
this with free delivery for the first
six months and it comes a few days after
Amazon announced its same-day delivery
service is also expanding to more cities
with 12 in total on Amazon to get
same-day delivery it costs an extra six
dollars on top of the cost of a Prime
membership fee once that company that's
not out to disrupt shopping is Nokia yes
there still is a company called Nokia
Microsoft bought the mobile phone and
tablet hardware business of Nokia but
there are other piece
is to the Finnish company that still
remain like the group that works on
Nokia's here Maps the map app team is
seeking Android and iOS developers that
means Nokia wants to put its maps on
other devices besides windows and
Nokia's Venture Capital Group announced
it plans to invest 100 million dollars
into communication technology for cars
looks like Nokia is rerouting its brand
in a new type of mobile direction
that's your tech news update you can
