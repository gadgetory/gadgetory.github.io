and we're gonna take a quick first look
at the 3m streaming projector this is a
battery-powered projector that's small
enough to fit in your hand and it also
features an integrated Roku streaming
stick so you can wirelessly stream
Netflix Amazon Instant Hulu Plus
basically anything that's on roku from
the front it's a pretty standard looking
portable projector with a built-in
speaker and a mini jack output on the
side for headphones or an external
speaker on the back there's a slot for
the removable Roku streaming stick which
is included and that fits snuggly and a
custom compartment so it's not sticking
out the back of the projector the Roku
stick can next to the projectors mhm L
port so you can actually take out the
Roku and plug in any other MHL gadget or
an HDMI device since MHL is backwards
compatible with HDMI and conversely you
can take the Roku streaming stick and
plug it into a TV or an AV receiver that
supports MHL although there aren't that
many compatible devices on the market
the Roku streaming stick also has
built-in dual band Wi-Fi so you can
stream all the content sources available
on roku wirelessly which includes
Netflix Amazon Instant Hulu Plus MLB TV
Vudu HBO Go Pandora there are over 600
channels the streaming projector itself
has a built-in rechargeable battery
that's quoted to last up to two hours
and 45 minutes which is plenty of time
to get through most movies it has an 800
by 480 resolution which is basically DVD
quality it's not high def and a 60 lumen
light output which is reasonably bright
if you've got the lights turned off 3m
also says it can project up to a hundred
and twenty inches so pretty much
anywhere you've got a large flat surface
you're going to be able to watch movies
with this thing the 3m streaming
projector will be available exclusively
at Amazon for $300 and it starts
shipping on October 22nd I'm going to do
a lot more hands-on testing with the
streaming projector before the full
review but this is definitely a cool
device and I'm pretty impressed with it
out of the box I'm Matthew Muscovy AK
from C net and this is the 3m streaming
projector
