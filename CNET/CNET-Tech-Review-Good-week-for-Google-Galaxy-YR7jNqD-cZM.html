there's something for everybody at
Google's Developers Conference new
laptops new tablets a new music service
we've got the highlights from google i/o
plus an MMO you can take on the road and
a teeny tiny smartphone you should leave
it home it's all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer some unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's start with the good google
i/o was this week and Google pretty much
buried us in news everything from
laptops to like nine different operating
systems to well actually I could sit
here and recap the whole thing but i
actually just did that in the buzz
report this week so here you go I barely
know where to start with google i/o
their key notes are only an hour but man
do they pack in the news let's do this
as bullet points okay first an updated
version of honeycomb the tablet
operating system which thank goodness
gets resizable widgets I mean so that's
almost as awesome as that time iOS got
folders we also got a look at the new
version of Android Ice Cream Sandwich
because you can never have too many
operating systems that one will remain
open source and it'll become the OS that
runs everything from smartphones to
smart homes as an embedded system the
Chrome browser as usual gets faster you
can now rent in stream movies via
YouTube you can even stream them on your
Android phone which is pretty awesome
and here are some of the bigger
headlines first google music beta it's a
cloud-based music locker where you can
store and play back your music kind of
like Amazon's Cloud Player service it's
an invite-only beta for now unless you
have an android phone and then you can
just download the mobile app and like
Amazon Google went ahead and launched it
without the music labels on board
because they remain that irrelevant and
in the way of everything consumers what
and finally and this is really the
biggest news of all there's now a free
angry birds chrome app available now in
the Chrome App Store with exclusive
content for Chrome users I already have
RSI from using my mouse hand to launch
those little birds all day my boss is
not pleased
I am ashamed to confess that I played
five levels of angry birds chrome
edition in the middle of recording buzz
out loud on Wednesday they were the easy
levels though and what better way to
show off how all this new stuff is going
to work then to give away a free galaxy
tab to try things out on everyone in
attendance at i/o got the new 10.1 inch
version and eric franklin rushed back to
the office so he could give us this
first look you can never have too many
honeycomb tablets in the wild it seems
and today we have our fourth such tablet
i'm eric franklin and today we'll take a
first look at the samsung galaxy tab
10.1 obviously named for its 10.1 inch
screen the 10.1 is a google experience
tablet which means its UI is exactly the
same as a zoom running android 3.0 point
one it has a tigre to dual-core cpu and
a 1280 x 800 resolution design-wise
however the 10.1 has much more in common
with the ipad 2 then the zoom we don't
have a micrometer to confirm this but
just from feel and eyeballing them
side-by-side 10.1 is just as thin as the
ipad 2 in addition is actually slightly
lighter than the ipad 2 but is about
half an inch longer and a quarter inch
wider however the most intriguing detail
the 10.1 isn't what it has but what it
doesn't have the 10.1 sports a clean
design with no mini USB or mini or micro
HDMI ports what you do get is a
universal support that does allow you to
connect to a computer via USB speakers
on either side of the tablet a headphone
jack volume rocker power and front and
rear facing cameras so far the only
disappointing design decision is the
plastic back which makes the tablet feel
less solid than ipad 2 and kind of looks
like cheap kitchen wallpaper donna bell
did mention that he thought it was cute
though to each his own i guess this is
the Wi-Fi only version of the temp
one with no word and when we will see
cellular versions there's also no word
on price just yet but the 10.1 will be
available on june eighth once again this
is eric franklin and this has been a
first look at the samsung galaxy tab
10.1 the lesson here it pays to go to
Google i/o if every year they give you a
cool laptop or a tablet or both it's
kind of like going to see Oprah remember
a few weeks ago when the amazon cloud
player was all the rage well if you
haven't taken the time to upload all
your songs to amazon servers yet you
might want to wait especially if you're
on android google's new music service
might be a better answer hey I'm Sharon
Vaknin from cnet com here to walk you
through google music for android with
google music you can access all your
music across multiple devices and
computers without burdening your phone
or computer storage basically the music
is stored on google servers and played
back over Wi-Fi or your cell network to
your phone to get a google music account
go to music google com / music and
request an invite Google is slowly
rolling this beta software out so be
patient once you've been invited you'll
be able to access the Google music web
interface in the browser and download
the music manager for your desktop music
manager will copy all the music on your
computer to Google servers and make it
all available on your Android phone or
tablet when you're not at home but even
without an invite you can still download
the Android app and get to know the
interface go to the android market and
search for music it's the app with the
headphones icon once it's downloaded and
installed select which google account
you want to use with the app it's based
on what accounts are already connected
to your phone once you're all set up the
app will automatically load songs from
your online library and your phone's
internal storage if you have a huge
library because maybe you decided to
take advantage of the free storage of
20,000 songs it might take a while but
once the list is populated playing music
is pretty straightforward
just tap a song to begin playing it or
hit the arrow to the right of any song
and press play here you'll also see
other options make an instant mix is
Google's answer to Apple's genius
feature if you select it Google will
create a playlist of songs similar to
the one you selected it's nice for when
you're on the go want to dig up old
music or if you just want to let Google
work its magic you can also add a song
to a playlist in this menu you can
either add the song to an existing
playlist or create a new one all your
playlists are stored in the tab at the
top to create a new one hit the menu
button and select new playlist you can
rename it and begin adding songs albums
or artists through the other tabs each
tabs menu selection is different it
makes experience a little frustrating
but the main thing you should know is
that the playlist albums and artists
tabs have an option called make
available offline so now that all your
music is stored on google servers how do
you access it when you're not connected
to the internet this is where make
available offline comes in tap that
option and you'll see pushpins show up
next to the items on the list tap the
pushpins next to the items you want
available offline and hit done the music
is cached on to your phone so the amount
of music you can make available offline
depends on how much storage you have and
you can deselect them later to remove
them from your phone and free up space
you can check on the download progress
by going to menu settings then download
queue there are other useful settings
here to take a look around and contact
me on facebook if you have any questions
and look if you rotate the phone to
landscape you get a whole different
interface feel free to choose
accordingly send your questions comments
and how to ideas to how to at cnet com
and for more handy how-to videos head on
over to seen at tv.com foreseen it I'm
Sharon Vaknin and I'll see you on the
interweb
you may have noticed the fine print that
indicates that the music beta will be
free for a limited time and there's no
telling how long it's going to take
before those invites will start showing
up in your inboxes but you might as well
sign up now if you want to get in early
some of you may be wondering what phone
Sharon was using to demo google music
well it was none other than the second
member of the Samsung Galaxy family on
the show this week the galaxy s2 here's
Jessica dole court with a closer look hi
I'm Jessica dull court with Cena this is
a first look at the samsung galaxy s2
this is the next generation samsung
galaxy phone and it happens to be my
editor's choice now there's a lot going
on with this device first of all it is a
quad-band GSM world phone it's got dual
core 1 gigahertz processors 4G speeds
with hspa+ and it's running android 2.3
gingerbread that is the latest version
of the android OS the screen is really
beautiful it is a four point two seven
inch so almost 4.3 inch super amoled
plus screen that means it is brighter
bolder smoother and the colors pop more
than the regular samsung Super AMOLED
screen which was also very good so this
is just pretty amazing pretty brilliant
linking now this phone does feature
Samsung's custom TouchWiz four-point-oh
interface I'm not always a fan of this
custom ui's but I do like the easy
access to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth settings
and there are some visual flourishes on
here as well hopefully that won't impede
any of the OS updates in the future
there is an 8-megapixel rear-facing
camera on this phone also flash and it's
got a 2 megapixel front facing camera
for all of those video chats photo
quality on this phone was really
impressive it was sharp and clear and
the camcorder on the back captures and
plays back 1080p HD video as for the
design itself it's very thin this is
less than half an inch it's point 3
inches and it's also pretty light
sometimes light isn't very good because
it makes the phone feel cheap but in
this case I'm glad that it's not too
heavy won't weigh you down now Samsung
is
galaxy phones are usually really
plasticky but with this design they're
getting much better there's this
textured backing that makes it feel a
little bit more premium however it's
still not as premium looking as one
competitor that's the LG t-mobile g2x
now I did have a few complaints there is
no camera hardware button on the side
and the back cover is really stiff I
felt like I was going to break my nails
off trying to get it off there is a
micro SD card behind the back cover but
it's positioned in such a way that you
have to remove the battery to exchange
the card it holds up to 32 gigabytes of
external storage there are a couple
interesting things inside the phone
first of all there's a photo editor and
a video maker with which I find really
handy also an FM radio that I like
Samsung has added three new hubs it's
got music games and a reader hub that's
something that's unique to the TouchWiz
interface there are also some motion
controls that are pretty interesting for
example you can zoom pan silence and tap
for certain apps there are also some
business tools to try to make the phone
a little bit more Enterprise friendly
for example there's VPN encryption and
support for some of cisco services NFC
support is also enabled for some markets
so how can you get this wonderful it is
available in europe in korea right now
it costs about 500 euros 500 pounds in
europe unlocked and i was able to find
an online from between 700 and 800 u.s.
dollars however when Samsung does
announce us and canadian availability
the price should come down so what do I
think of this phone despite a few design
flaws the galaxy s2 has really top of
the line specs and it delivers so with
the screen and the speeds and the
excellent processors it adds up to one
of the best all-around smartphones on
the market this is jessica's all court
and you've been looking at the unlocked
samsung galaxy s2
eight hundred dollars unlocked yeah
that's why unlocked phones haven't been
that successful here in the US I'm
imagining most of us will wait and see
what a deal with the carrier looks like
before we dive in awesome phone though
oh and by the way nice bracelet ladies I
kind of want to borrow that too and
while I figure out where those girls do
their shopping let's take a break we'll
be right back for more tech review right
after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on and the good there's no
denying that world of warcraft is or at
least was a phenomenon but the major
downside to the game is how much time
some people spend locked up in their
houses playing it fortunately this
week's tappa bilal offers fans of the
genre and opportunity to go outside for
a change
welcome to tap that app i'm jason parker
and this is the show we cover the
hottest apps in the mobile space most
gamers know about blizzards world of
warcraft the most popular online
role-playing game of all time featuring
the perfect mix of beautiful graphics
engaging gameplay and the ability to
explore a huge online world it's no
surprise that world of warcraft is a big
hit among desktop gamers this week's app
is called order and chaos online for
mobile game company gameloft order and
chaos closely resembles world warcraft
in many ways from the graphical style
all the way down to the game mechanics
but with order and chaos you can play on
your iPhone like most popular massive
multiplayer online games order and chaos
starts you off easy you start by
selecting a race you can be human elf
orc or undead then you select a class
warrior mage monk or Ranger we're going
to select where to keep things easy next
we can make customizations to skin color
hair style hair color and facial
features finally choose a name for your
character and you're ready to play order
and chaos starts you off in a beginner
area and the game shows you the ropes of
how to move your character using the
on-screen joystick look around with a
swipe of your finger other basic
movement options and with notifications
that show up as exclamation points once
you learn the controls you'll be ready
to take on your first quest touch the
MPC or non-player character with the
scroll over his head to receive a quest
the first quest is to talk to the
warrior class trainer who is Right
nearby the warrior trainers shows you
the ropes of basic attacks on a combat
dummy and how to use special attacks
once you've completed the quest return
to the wire trainer to receive your
reward these early quests help you get
acclimated to the controls and options
for your chosen class but later you'll
need to run great distances and fight
monsters and strange lands all while
improving your character with new items
found and also focusing your character
to one of two talent trees each class
has two paths to choose from in the case
of the wire you can be a battle warrior
or a guardian as you level up from
completing quests and gaining experience
points you'll be able to unlock new
skills and abilities based on
level as you can see there are a lot of
choices to be made as you play order and
chaos but the class variations and
talent trees are part of what gives the
game so much replay value massive
multiplayer role-playing games like this
one are mostly made for desktop
computers because they often have a lot
of complex controls fortunately order
and cast does a great job of organizing
your menus requiring only a touch of
your finger to get to things like your
inventory character loadout your quest
log spells and skills and social and
team menus as you get further into the
game you'll need to team up with other
players online to conquer the more
difficult dungeons an order and chaos
offers a full range of social options to
team up and even join online guilds of
players order and chaos online is a
smooth overall experience with good
frame rates and beautiful 3d graphics
but you'll need to have a Wi-Fi
connection to play also you start out
with three months free after buying the
game for 699 but you'll need to pay a
subscription fee of 99 cents per month
to keep playing after that though it may
seem a little steep now we think that
once players realize how deep this game
is a buck a month won't seem too bad at
all so if you like fantasy based
role-playing games or a fan of online
multiplayer games like World of Warcraft
we definitely recommend you tap this app
that's it for today's show but you have
any suggestions send them to tap that
app at cnet com i'm jason parker thanks
for watching of course if you actually
take order and chaos out into the real
world I would suggest taking along a
charger as well you'll be burning
through your battery in no time all
right let's move along and see what's
going on in the bad
while the trend with most smartphones
seems to be bigger brighter screens HP
decided to go in a different direction
with a new vir 4g phone let's see how
that's working out shall we hey everyone
I'm Bonnie top senior editor at cnet com
and today I've got your first look at
the HPV r4 g418 T this teeny tiny device
is the latest web OS smartphone since
the pre two it's probably one of the
cutest phones I've ever seen it's got a
very attractive pebble like design and
the white model that I have here is
particularly eye-catching but will
probably grab your attention the most is
the size as you can see the vir is
really small and there are certainly
good things about the compact design but
I actually think that HP made the beer
too small because there are a number of
problems that come with it the first is
the screen I only measures two point six
inches diagonally so if you're trying to
do anything like view a web page or max
it's really difficult and you'll be
using the pinch to zoom feature a lot
even simple tasks like making call gets
frustrating because the on-screen dialer
is cramped and if you want to read an
email there's a lot of scrolling
involved luckily you don't have to enter
text using the touch screen since there
is a slide-out QWERTY keyboard to be
honest I didn't have high hopes for the
keyboard because the layout is pretty
cramped and the buttons are small but
with some practice you can actually get
around it without too many problems it's
not ideal but I wouldn't say it's
unusable either the last issue with the
design is the proprietary port because
the veer is so small HP couldn't fit in
a headphone jack or a micro USB port so
instead they put in this magnetic
connector on the side with it you can
connect this headset adapter and then
plug in your headphones so you can
listen to music I just think it's a bad
idea number one it's an eyesore and
because it sticks out of the side like
this I can see it easily getting ripped
off just putting it in your pocket or if
your headphone wire gets caught on
something also it's small so it's easy
to lose when you're not using it and
I've already misplaced it several times
while reviewing the phone the other
issue is with the magnetic connector you
have to use the charging cable that
comes with the phone so if you're
running out of
battery and you don't have it nearby
you're toast so overall I just think
it's a flawed idea it's really too bad
because the VR 4G offers a decent set of
features it's running webos 2.1 point2
so you're getting some of the latest
functions like stacks which groups
together similar tasks for better
multitasking and just type which expands
on universal search by letting you type
search terms and even status updates
from anywhere on your phone
unfortunately I think it's just hard to
take advantage of any of these features
with the phone's design set at a
reasonable price at hundred dollars on
contract but 18t has a number of other
devices for a hundred dollars or less
like the htc inspire 4G that will
provide a better experience i'm bonnie
chen this has been your first look at
the HP beer for d 4 80 sure it may only
be a hundred bucks but i'll bet it cost
a pretty penny to replace those magnetic
headphone adapter things see that's
where the real money is or would be if
anyone actually buys a beer in the first
place you know I'm right let's move
along and check out this week's bottom
line shall we Google on Wednesday
announced the new Chromebook platform
that brings the Chrome OS experience
onto a regular laptop and Donald Bell
was on hand to check out one of the new
Chromebooks the series 5 from Samsung
hey I'm gamma bell for cnet.com and
today I'm taking a first look at the
samsung series 5 this is a new laptop
from Samsung that runs Google's Chrome
OS do I'm June pricing starts at four
hundred twenty nine dollars for a Wi-Fi
only model you also have a four hundred
ninety nine dollar option for a model a
built-in 3g coverage through verizon
wireless you also get two different
colors here there's a white version and
a dark silver version both are going to
be available in the same prices and
configurations there's not a lot to the
laptop and that's really the point you
get 16 gigabytes of on-board storage and
when you boot it up you're booting up
right into the chrome browser the
support for Google's Chrome browser
application so that you can extend this
through different app store that's built
into the chrome system you can also have
support for all of googles great apps
like gmail calendar documents all that
functionalities here too so the upshot
of having such a lean system is that you
get really fast startup time from a cold
boot eight seconds will get you up into
the operating system if you're coming
out of standby mode that's going to
happen instantly you also get eight and
a half hours of battery life about five
hours of video playback battery life and
the other good thing about this is that
because nothing is really stored locally
everything gets backed up to the cloud
so that if you you know be shut it down
and this ain't gotta run over by a train
you could rest assured that all that
information that you've been working on
it's going to be backed up to the cloud
you get a new one open it up log in and
all your information is going to be
there taking a look at the hardware
design you've got a 12.1 inch screen
it's a really bright screen provided by
Samsung you get a full-size keyboard a
multi-touch trackpad you've got two USB
ports
an HD webcam up at the top and you also
have a headphone jack and an SD card or
a 401 card slot here for memory cards
right here on the front under the hood
you get a 1.66 dual-core intel atom
processor so it's got some muscle but
it's only got about two gigs a built-in
ram so it's not going to be a serious
horsepower machine it's also not the
lightest machine we've seen it's about a
little over three pounds so it's not
groundbreaking in terms of design but I
like the concept a lot it really after
seeing a lot of tablets this year this
kind of strikes that same appeal of
being a machine that is affordable is a
really utilitarian system for getting
onto the web getting there fast and
having a really simple operating system
without confusing people I think there's
going to be a segment of people who are
really going to gravitate towards this
because of its simplicity so yeah I'm
excited see this in June for cnet.com on
da mobile that was a first look at the
samsung series 5 chromebook the bottom
line this week now that's gonna be a
hard sell I mean it's nice of Donald to
say there will be a segment of people
who are excited about chromebooks I just
don't know if it'll be a big statement I
mean you can buy a full-fledged laptop
for four or five hundred bucks and then
have like programs then the Chrome
browser and the other browser you want
we'll see though I mean I was wrong
about people buying iPads to all right
folks that's our show will be back next
week with a brand new cnet tech review
until then there are tons of great
videos available every day at cnet TV
com I'll see you next time and thank you
for watching
