rumors the FaceTime saga continues and
the iPhone 10 is back from the dead
we're going to get to all of this and
more on this week's apple core first up
your rumor roundup it's only February
and we're already starting to get a
pretty good sense of what to expect in
the 2019 iPhones or I guess we'll call
them the iPhones eleven just for
continuity sake
so rumors point at a very similar design
to last year's lineup I shown on these
on leaked renders published in compare
Russia with a smaller notch on the front
a switch to a USB C port and that three
camera array on the back potentially
reserved for the price of your plus
model but until now we weren't exactly
sure what that third camera was going to
be used for and this week it seems we
got a few answers from Bloomberg their
report says that Apple is working on a
laser powered longer range 3d camera
system for augmented reality with
improved mapping capabilities of up to
15 feet so to put this in perspective
the current true depth array on the
front of the phone actually only goes up
to 50 centimeters according to the
report the catch it won't be ready until
2020 so the third lens on this year's
iPhone would be used to capture a wider
field of view wha-wha further proof that
this year's iPhones are kind of shaping
up to be a wash we'll see now the report
also mentions a new dark mode in the
works for the iPhone similar to what
Apple rolled out for its computers with
Mac OS these renders from phone arena
show us what that could look like on iOS
which could potentially look really good
on those solid black bullet screens of
the newer iPhone models this feature
would likely come with the update to iOS
13 in September though so we'll have to
wait a while with the announcement
coming at Apple's Developers Conference
in June also rumored to be coming in iOS
13 230 new emojis because apparently
we've all just given up on writing and
need an emoji for every single word in
the dictionary
some notable additions according to the
Unicode consortium which approves all of
these new emojis include better
representation of people with
disabilities with a wheelchair option a
probing cane also mixed race and mixed
gender couples and some pretty essential
members of the animal kingdom like the
sloth flamingos and a skunk
shoutout to emoji pedia for making all
these designs and make sure to check out
their video if you want to see the full
lineup once you're done here and wait
sadly we're not done with the emoji news
because if you have an iPhone 10 tennis
or 10 R you'll soon be getting four new
an emoji characters to play around with
the public beta of iOS 12.2 gave us a
preview of this adorable giraffe shark
owl and warthog in case you need another
excuse to make weird faces at your phone
but seriously enough with the emoji talk
the iPhone 10 is finally making its big
comeback on the Apple Store well sort of
Apple removed all traces of its 10th
anniversary iPhone last year presumably
to prevent from cannibalizing its own
sales but now it's back and Apple is
selling a very limited number of
refurbished iPhone tens on its site so
if you still want one you got to act
quick although honestly I'm not sure if
it's really worth it I'm gonna break
down the numbers so that you can decide
so try and bear with me over here an
unlocked iPhone 10 with 64 gigabytes of
storage retails for 769 dollars that's
$20 more than the 64 gigabyte iPhone 10
are and the 256 model in the exact same
price as the equivalent iPhone 10 are
even though this one is the newer model
now three possible reasons why you may
choose the older 10 over the newer 10
our would be that oled screen the dual
camera and that smaller size if that 10
R feels too big for you
next up an update on Apple's FaceTime
bug which apparently refuses to go away
since the news broke last week Apple has
issued a patch to the problem with the
recent release of iOS 12.1 point 4 and
has since issued an apology to its
customers who were affected and all who
are concerned about this security issue
and that the company is committed to
continuing to earn the trust Apple
customers place in them so this is great
but people are just not letting this one
go
last week New York City's Attorney
General announced she would be opening
up a formal investigation to find out
why Apple didn't give users a heads up
about the security flaw and what took
the company so long to address the issue
and then this week Apple's getting even
more heat from Congress congressional
lawmakers sent a letter to Tim Cook
requesting more information about the
flaw to understand the extent to which a
compromised users security now I want to
hear you guys chime in has this made you
lose trust in Apple or will you continue
to be using Apple products you know the
drill tweet me or comment below
you guys had really good opinions about
whether or not Apple should compensate
the teen who found the bug in the first
place so thanks so much for sending
those in the consensus among most of you
seems to be a resounding yes which might
actually happen according to a CNBC
interview with the Thompson family a
high-level Apple exec went out to meet
with them in Arizona to thank them and
mentioned he may be eligible for the bug
bounty program which offers cash rewards
of up to $200,000 needless to say the
kid would have more than enough money to
buy himself that iPhone 10 air pods and
macbook he'd been eyeing
