we're gonna take a look at the Cambridge
Audio minx err 100 this is a wireless
speaker that supports both bluetooth and
airplay and it's currently selling for
four hundred and fifty dollars the mix
err 100 is one of the nicest looking
wireless speakers to enter the scene
head offices a lot of these speakers go
for a real eye catching design but the
minx has an understated look with a
white plastic cabinet and gray speaker
grille that looks pretty good
almost anywhere you place it the top has
two sets of rubber mushy buttons and the
number of buttons on the Left offer the
neat ability to stream internet radio
directly to the minx without needing to
deal with a smartphone or a tablet
there's also a remote included but it's
one of these cheap thin remotes that are
common on speakers like this luckily
you're mostly controlling the speaker
with a mobile device so you don't use
the included remote that much now the
minx offers both bluetooth and airplay
which gives you some nice flexibility to
wirelessly stream audio from a wide
range of devices airplay does offer
theoretically better sound quality with
Apple devices but it also requires a
Wi-Fi network so luckily you can always
fall back to bluetooth if you're using
it outside your home network on the back
there are a few ports including Ethernet
a mini Jack input and an analog input
there's also a convenient handle but
that doesn't mean the Minx is portable
because there's no built-in battery so
you're always gonna need to have it
plugged in for listening tests I had the
Minx err 100 setup directly next to the
clips KMC 3 and the Peachtree audio deep
blue and it was quickly clear that the
minx was the lightweight of the bunch
the mixture sounded flat comparatively
no matter what kind of music I threw at
it and it didn't help that it was also
the least loud classic rock tunes
sounded noticeably less rich and the
minks always had a tinny quality that it
reminded you of its limitations
it also couldn't produce as much bass as
other speakers even with the bass
control turned all the way up and that
really was apparent when I was listening
to any kind of heavy music the mix of
shortcomings are less noticeable on
softer Tunes but even
then I preferred the richer sound from
competing speakers and that's pretty
much the story with the mink ser 100
it's not gonna win over anyone picky
about sound quality but it does have a
really nice look and a convenient
feature set that makes it worth
considering for less critical listeners
