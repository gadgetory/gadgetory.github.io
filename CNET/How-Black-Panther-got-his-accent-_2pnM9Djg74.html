to serendipitously like this other movie
message for the king and I'd already
started working on it when I was called
to do panther what's this about my
friend my sister Bianca and so I'd
already found a dialect coach I'd
already been to South Africa to Cape
Town to do research found Bianca had the
marker
touch it so it only took me continuing
my process with that because the
accident although it's pulled from South
African cosas it's what Condon and our
idea is that if Akane is what we say it
is we can pull from any place in Africa
that we want to if what Conda is
supposed to be the most technologically
advanced nation on the planet if it's
supposed to have never been conquered
which means that that advancement has
happened without colonialism taking it
then that would mean there's no way in
the world he would speak with the
European accident if I did that I would
be conveying a white supremacist idea of
what being educated is and if he's the
rule of a nation there's certain moments
when he has to speak to his people he
has to galvanize to his people and
there's no way I could speak to my
people who have never been conquered by
Europeans with the European voice
