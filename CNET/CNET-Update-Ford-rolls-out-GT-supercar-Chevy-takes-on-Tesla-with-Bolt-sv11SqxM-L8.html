can't guard its own Twitter accounts I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update we are back from CES and still a
little disoriented from the week-long
gadget extravaganza but the tech news
isn't slowing down going on now is the
Detroit Auto Show where we're getting
first looks at the 2016 Chevrolet Volt
it said to have an improved 50 mile pure
electric range the current model only
goes for about 12 miles on pure electric
power and don't confuse the Volt with
the Chevy concept the bolt which
promises to be an affordable pure
electric car with a 200 mile range Chevy
hopes to beat Tesla to the punch here
giving it a price tag of thirty thousand
dollars and you may be drooling over the
new Ford GT it's a 500 horsepower
twin-turbo carbon fiber Beast no
electric assist hybrid here for didn't
give a price but to put it in
perspective the last GT that came out 10
years ago how to start in price 140
thousand dollars and you can find our
full coverage of the detroit auto show
over at cnet meanwhile samsung revealed
a brand new smartphone but the korean
company waited until a week after CES to
announce it maybe it wanted to keep the
spotlight on other products like
televisions well the samsung galaxy a7
is a new eight core 4g smartphone it's
follow-up to the all-metal galaxy a5 and
galaxy a3 this a seven unfortunately
doesn't have the newest version of
Android lollipop instead it's loaded
with 4.4 kitkat it has a 5.5 inch screen
on the back there's a 13 megapixel
camera and on the front there's a 5
megapixel camera with auto selfie mode
at least you take a photo with a voice
command or a wave of your hand and
private mode gives your files and
documents an extra layer of security no
price and release date given yet aside
from shiny new cars and phones there's
going to be plenty of talk about privacy
and cybersecurity this week and next
week as President Barack Obama proposes
new ways to boost our online
security one such law being proposed is
that all companies have 30 days to
notify customers that they've had
personal info hacked right now there's
no one national law that governs what to
do about a data breach President Obama
is also proposing that companies cannot
sell student data for non education
purposes now while President Obama was
talking about cybersecurity to the
Federal Trade Commission the official
Twitter and YouTube accounts for US
Central Command were hacked by a group
claiming to be Isis talk about
embarrassing well that's your tech news
