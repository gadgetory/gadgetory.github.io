up from school but not by her parents
higher higher
her mom is busy at work so she's sent a
driver from shuttle a subscription car
service for kids parents need to
schedule a ride at least a day in
advance through the app while kids need
their own cell phone and must be eight
or older rides typically cost around
twelve dollars one time I had a child
asked oh can I be dropped off at this
location instead and we called the
parent confirmed that that was okay and
then dropped them off at the different
location for pickup the driver and child
confirm the predetermined password and
can see a photo of each other on their
phone
meanwhile the parents can monitor the
ride in real-time through the app every
single ride is watched live at shuttle
headquarters by full-time shuttle
employees with software in the car
called Zen Drive we can monitor driving
behavior in real time if putting your
child in a car with a stranger sounds
dangerous shuttle says all their drivers
have childcare experience and go through
extensive background checks we use
fingerprinting FBI database federal
state and local criminal background
check databases and social security
number verification currently operating
in the San Francisco Bay Area shuttle is
carving out a new market alongside
services like hop skip Drive in Los
Angeles shuttle is also launching a
carpool service busy parents like akemim
ease are also turning to meal delivery
apps like Monterey the service runs in
San Francisco New York Seattle and Los
Angeles with a rotating daily menu when
you place an order it goes straight to
the distribution center the food is
already ready to go it's closest to you
parents can order in advance through the
website or even on the way home from
school using the app complete meals are
delivered cold and cost between 8 and 14
dollars each they like it the salmon
because they can eat that they like the
fruits and they like the almond milk
from food delivery to kid delivery
there's an app for that in San Francisco
