conference we're getting our first
glimpse at the UI that's going to be on
Samsung's first foldable phone and also
on the future Galaxy S 10 Samsung is
calling it one UI so what we're looking
at is a galaxy s 9 plus that is using
Samsung's new one UI interface this is
the interface that is going to replace
the current interface it's also what
we're gonna see on Samsung is foldable
phone so the main purpose of this
interface is that you can do everything
one-handed it basically looks the same
this phone is running on Android Diane
Pi with the one UI on top of it you
notice the changes when you dive down so
when you're in multitasking here you
kind of have a new view things are a lot
luckier they're rounded corners that are
meant to echo the rounded corners of the
device you see that there's a darker
theme you can actually get to the dark
mode yourself through display click on
night theme and everything will get
darker you notice some of these changes
if you go into gallery this is radically
different in design everything is just
grouped into these big icons they sort
of remind me honestly of the icons on
the iPhone apple's interface so down
here at the bottom you'll see that the
navigation is moved from the top down to
the bottom where it's easier to get an
idea is that you can just operate this
phone one-handed without straining your
thumbs to get all the way up to the top
nowwhere shows this better than in
messages
we're at the top portion of the screen
is dedicated to viewing and the bottom
portion of the screen is dedicated to
action this is a theme that Samsung one
is to carry throughout the entire one UI
experience you see the same in the
dialer you'll see a space between the
letters so it's visually easier to see
it's also a lot more visual interest
Samsung is focusing on the use of color
in the previous UI you wouldn't see the
space between F and G it would just all
be run together without any break so the
idea is that if you're looking for your
J contacts your eye will zero in on the
four that you have here these navigation
tabs are here at the bottom but when you
dial in a number
they disappear because you don't need
them anymore you've taken control and
you're adding the number yourself clear
the number and they return you'll notice
these somatic changes throughout the
swipe left and the interface looks a lot
different
everything is grouped and you see the
same rounded rectangular bubble that is
permeating this OS and defining it it's
been a long time since samsung has so
radically redesigned the operating
system that runs on top of android it's
a fresh and welcome change when you're a
multitasking mode you'll see icons
suggestions at the bottom you could
either select from here or you can swipe
up to see all of your apps and easily
jump back into multitasking this button
in the bottom left like in previous
versions will help you hide or unhide
the navigation bar if you don't see what
you're looking for you can scroll down
to the bottom of the page to find more
settings in one UI Samsung seems to have
stopped a little bit short of making it
really easy to use the phone with one
hand you still have to reach up to the
top to pull down the navigation toggles
and your notification tray Samsung could
have made it easier by swiping up from
the bottom or swiping up from the corner
but that's where Samsung pay lives right
now since when UI is built on top of
Android that new Android 9 supports
gestures you can also ditch the
navigation bar entirely and just use
gesture support
switching needs me navigation buttons
and full screen gestures so you would
press hard in the center to go home you
would swipe up on the right to gets you
multitasking and you would swipe up on
the left to go back okay we're seeing a
bit of a new treatment when you press
the big speed button you get to be at
the top
instead of at the bottom so even the
design of the navigation buttons has
changed and so is the look we've got the
regular Galaxy S nine plus on the Left
Galaxy S nine plus with one UI on the
right and this is what this is what
multitasking looks like totally
different looks the icons are so much
bigger with one UI you can see the time
and the date very clearly with one UI
and you really can't see that with the
current operating system all right so
this is a look at the settings menu and
you can see you just have a lot more
space at the top to see where you are
some might call a wasted space but what
that's doing is it's really phonce and
training these groupings of apps the
fonts bigger the areas bigger it's just
an easier target to hit on the Galaxy S
9 plus here you see that when you eye is
echoing a lot of the same design
elements that we see in Android Pi what
we're not seeing is the way that this is
going to conform to of the unique
experiences that you can have on the
foldable phone that is something that
we're gonna see when we get our first
look at that device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
