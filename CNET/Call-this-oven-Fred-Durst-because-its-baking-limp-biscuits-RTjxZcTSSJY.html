Smeg c30 GG are you I was in love I mean
how often do you see a fire engine red
oven come through the Test Kitchen well
I can tell you not very often in a land
of stainless steel appliances this Meg
unit stood out unfortunately the
performance didn't come close to its
appearance now this gas oven is very
very basic and not in a good way all the
ovens functions are controlled with
knobs so it makes it a little tricky to
make sure you have an accurate
temperature especially for baking plus
the oven doesn't even let you know when
your preheat tom has been reached so it
can be a little tricky making sure the
oven is hot enough and even when I did
figure out a good preheat time the
baking results were visible my biscuits
were super pale and then when I baked
two wrecks of biscuits one was a whole
lot darker than the other now this Meg
isn't all bad news the stovetop can
actually blow water really really
quickly but for thirty two hundred
dollars is pretty little red oven just
isn't worth it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
