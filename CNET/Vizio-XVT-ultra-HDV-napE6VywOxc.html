2013 where we're taking a first look at
the vizio xvt series this is an ultra
HDTV or 4k TV that is going to be
offered in the second half of 2013 it's
going to come in three sizes you get a
55 inch a 65 inch or the one we're
seeing here which is a 70 inch 4k
resolution HD TV it's a new design for
vizio with a very thin bezel so it looks
probably like one of the best HD TVs
we've seen from Vizio so you're paying
for looks you're also paying for that
video performance they're not
downgrading or processing the 4k signal
before hits the TV apparently a lot of
the 4k TVs we're going to see this year
there's going to be some intervening
processing before that 4k signal
actually reaches the TV screen this one
is undiluted and bringing it right to
your eyeballs another cool thing is that
it has a 4k resolution input so if
you're if you're loading up you have a
4k compatible camcorder you can put that
content directly on the TV and see it as
full resolution uncompressed one of the
reasons why this is probably one of the
4k TVs to really pay attention to is
because it's coming from Vizio a brand
that is really known for their value and
really be aggressively pricing their TVs
so what we're looking at here might just
be the most affordable 4k TV ultra HDTV
that we're going to find in 2013 and
looking at it right now I can tell you
that the picture quality is beautiful
the content might not be there yet 4k
content this is not quite reaching the
mainstream yet what we were looking at
is a specially requested video clip from
a dreamworks picture that slowed down to
the half frame rate so you can really
see when you're looking up close here
when you're looking up close you can't
even pick out the pixels on the TV that
the video resolution is that fine so
there you go that is the Vizio XV
t-series ultra HDTV
