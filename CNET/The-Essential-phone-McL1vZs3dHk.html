phone essential well so the company that
would be it's clean simple build and the
two tiny divots on the back that connect
to magnetic accessory this is a lot like
Motorola's Moto Z phones except there
are only two contacts here instead of a
whole row so there's more freedom over
the shape and placement at the accessory
basically the connectors are just there
to hold the module in place and power
the device if the data itself transfers
wirelessly this is a new approach and
it's a pretty neat one too right now
there's only one accessory a 360-degree
camera but essential wants to make a
bunch of them so you can collect them
all here's a fun fact
essentials led by Andy Rubin who's
widely considered the father of Google's
Android operating system so although the
essential phone is strictly in start-up
mode for now it's kind of a big Z even
beyond the modules the essential phone
is reaching for premium status there's a
5.7 inch screen protected by Gorilla
Glass 5 and slim bezels the body is a
beautiful slab of titanium with a
ceramic backing it's really reflective
though and a huge fingerprint magnet so
you've been warned the whole design
really has a minimal look that reflects
theme of purity and asset there's no
headset jack here but you do get an
adapter in the box along with a
reinforced charger cable and both of
those are nice touches there's an 8
megapixel camera on the front which
might seem weird at first all they're
looking like a cyclops in the middle of
the screen and all but it's actually
really handy placement for selfies since
you don't have to look off to the side
like you do with some phones and that
notch you see does not actually cover up
notifications either on the back you
have a dual 13 megapixel camera one with
a color lens and one that enhances
images with black and white shots and of
course you can take black and white
pictures too
what's weird though is that the camera
app has very few controls for example
you can only add filters in editing mode
and you won't be able to manually adjust
things like white balance there's also
new portrait mode for now but essential
says it's coming there is however a fast
processor a lot of storage and a very
very clean version of Android nougat
7.1.1
which is something that purists will
love the essential phone is an
interesting device but it's also very
much a first generation product that
will have a lot to prove
as the ecosystem develops and grows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
