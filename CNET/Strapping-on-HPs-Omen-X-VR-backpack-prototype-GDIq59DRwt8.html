you have to get a powerful enough
computer you got to buy an expensive VR
headset you got a set of all the sensors
or base stations and even then there's a
serious chance you're going to end up
tripping over all the cords anyway
because you're tethered to a big desktop
computer
well HP is one of the companies working
on a solution to that through a VR
backpack it basically puts the entire
computer on your back so you can carry
it with you you're still tethered to the
headset but the tether just goes right
to the PC that you have on your back now
we've previously seen this version only
in photo mock-ups now we've had a chance
to try it out in real life this wasn't
actually plugged in and functioning but
we get the chance to put the entire
computer on our back and put on HTC vive
headset at the same time weight is about
10 pounds it's very compact so it feels
dense really the big shoulder straps and
the battery pack that you wear around
your waist felt bulkier than the
computer itself this is still a
prototype so we don't know if it's ever
going to turn up at the product you can
actually buy in stores but really fun to
actually get a chance to strap on a VR
backpack for the first time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
