google issues for all the Google
goodness that we can pack inside of a
show let's get to it in the flood of
Android wear apps has started you can
check them out on google play store with
some intriguing ones like the popular
duolingo for learning a new language
golf shot gps and all the cooks recipes
because seen a recipe on a tiny screen
on our wrist is what we all really want
to do now in addition to apps custom
watch faces for android wear have
appeared on the Play Store as well like
this one called premium watch face to
give you that added Flair but that's
just the simple stuff developers are
working on check out this project by
developer Doug Gregory who appears to be
associated with D CK automation by using
the ok Google command he shows off a
demo where he's able to turn on a living
room lamp and turn on and off a living
room fan all with his voice through
Android wear he also demos the concept
of opening and closing your garage door
an information card about the current
status of his home now this is just a
pretty slick early demo of what
developers have been able to put
together in such a short time so we know
there will be plenty more fun things
coming and sticking around the home a
report by recode says Google is
investing five hundred million dollars
to expand its google shopping express
service beyond san francisco los angeles
and new york city with plans for a
national rollout google acts as a
delivery service for products that are
actually supplied by local retailers
including Target Costco and toys r us in
case you want to get the latest
guardians of the galaxy Lego set with
Rocket Raccoon and Groot and set it up
next to your TV set in your bedroom the
service is still free to customers for
the first six months and google is
planning an amazon prime style option
that would be an annual fee somewhere
under one hundred dollars for unlimited
deliveries alright let's change things
up a bit with a really cool how to for
printing from any Android phone or
tablet first head to your computer and
launch Chrome you'll need the browser to
make this work open the menu and first
check to see that you're signed in with
your google account it should be the
same one you associate with your
android device once you're signed in go
to settings and scroll down to expand
the advanced settings here under google
cloud print click manage click Add
printers and check the boxes for the
printers you want to use in this case
it's my epson now head to your Android
and download Google's cloud print app
which is actually more of a plug-in that
enables you to print from applications
like chrome and the gallery once that's
installed you're ready to print so I'll
go to Chrome and pull up a webpage that
I want to print out tap the Menu button
hit print and there's my epson in this
window you actually have a few options
for things like paper size color and
orientation all that's left to do is hit
print and there it goes just keep in
mind that your computer does have to be
turned on for this to be able to work if
for whatever reason it's not the
documents will print once your computer
powers up again or if you have a cloud
print ready printer you can print to it
even if your computer is switched off
just go to Google support page for
instructions on setting up your specific
printer thank you for that Sharon now on
to the quick hits Google is putting a
significantly stronger focus on the
business and enterprise market according
to fortune google has made key hires to
grow that area of business and spent
more time on enterprise features like
drive for work and upgraded cloud
storage offerings for businesses android
worth and androids own business security
feature for mobile devices that people
use as work and personal phones at
Google i/o also still plenty of
rumblings and buzz around Samsung's
Galaxy F premium phone with this
gsmarena photo showing a familiar bezel
that we've seen on a phone from a
certain fruit company and no it's not
Chiquita n Royal Caribbean International
has partnered with the googs for the
first of its kind Street View tours on
its cruise ship now check this out you
can't or their ship to find plenty of
shirtless middle-aged or retired guys
cruise by the Aqua theater if you want
to see more guys this time in speedos
and I'm only messing around this is
actually really cool to get the layout
in the different areas of their cruise
ships because look
I just found the merry-go-round alright
guys that's going to do for this week's
show email us at Google issues at cnet
com or tweet me at brian Tong thanks so
much for watching and we'll see you next
time for some more of that Google Isha's
