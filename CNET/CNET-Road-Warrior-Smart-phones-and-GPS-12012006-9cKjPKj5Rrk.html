com and welcome to road warrior where we
take a look at the hottest gadgets for
life on the go coming up smart phones
gps sometimes both at once but first the
wireless action all right the archos 604
is back again but this time it's got
Wi-Fi so what does that get you sewing
the Wi-Fi in here really expands this
thing and it's pretty easy system to use
once you get to learn it especially
because of the touchscreen now we have C
netcom showing on the screen you can
zoom in magnify do all sorts of things
really I think the battery life is going
to be an issue 14 hours for audio four
hours for video another thing that will
drain the battery the archos 604 can
also act as a file server pretty cool
though next up yet another smartphone
the HP ipaq HW 6900 now it sets itself
apart by adding an integrated GPS
receiver so you can actually use this as
a GPS device and get driving directions
and pinpoint your location as you're
driving around it's also in addition to
gps it has bluetooth and Wi-Fi radios so
you can use it to surf the web and
connect two headsets and Bluetooth
printers and things like that Bonnie
wards it's a little awkward to use as a
phone but it's got great features for
the road warrior she also got to look at
the new treo 680 it's cheaper than other
trios but how does it look terms of
design it's a little more sleek here's
the 700p you can see they got rid of the
external antenna which is nice so it
won't catch on anything and it's just
slightly thinner it's also lighter and
feels good in the hands has this nice
touch screen here which is a advantage
it has over the motorola q on samsung
blackjack the keyboard is a little
cramped though so we prefer the cues
over that it's available for singular
but palm will also offer unlocked
versions as well but no Wi-Fi oh but
we're not done with you yet bunny job we
need a simple GPS mapping device for
beginners bring on the Navman f20 all
maps are pre-loaded on an SD card so you
don't have to deal with any transfers
from your PC to the device which is nice
I really like the interface it's simple
and easy to understand all the icons are
clear and it's clearly marked as well
Bonnie said it worked fine in a road
test two they're only complaint
the volume of the voice directions was a
little low that's it for this edition of
road warrior I'm Tom Merritt check back
next time for more gadgets to keep you
armed and dangerously productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
