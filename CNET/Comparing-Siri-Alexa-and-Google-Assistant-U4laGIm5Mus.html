have voice enabled speakers so we
thought it would be really fun to see
how each one compares so we're gonna ask
each speaker three questions and we'll
just cut to the answer to see how they
respond now there's not gonna be an
official winner at the end of this but
it will give you a better sense of how
they react to general everyday questions
first up we're gonna ask each assistant
to play calming music hey Siri play me
some calming music okay here's chill
music pick just for you here's a station
for calming music classical focus from
Amazon music okay here's a Spotify
playlist called calming Christian as you
can see all three assistants were able
to play calming music although Google
assistant specifically chose calming
Christian music which I didn't specify
but still they're all able to choose
different themes different styles of
music as well as specific songs and
musicians next up we're gonna ask each
one to set a reminder hey Siri
remind me to call the vet tomorrow okay
I had to call the vet - the reminders
for tomorrow at 9 a.m. what time
tomorrow should I remind you noon please
okay I'll remind you tomorrow at noon
okay I'll remind you tomorrow at 8 a.m.
I like that all three assistants let you
make reminders but Siri
and the Google assistant default to
specific times whereas Alexa actually
asks you when you'd like to be reminded
so you may have noticed that in the
previous shot the lights behind me were
turned on we've turned them off to see
how each assistant can respond and if
it's able to actually turn the lights on
hey Siri turn on the kitchen lights okay
okay sure turning
or lights on so as you can see all three
of these assistants are able to control
lights but not only lights also
thermostats
smart shades all kinds of connected
smart home products that was just a very
brief overview of how each of these
voice assistants responds to basic
everyday commands and it's something
that will continue to track over time as
they improve and change thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
