best at what it does but even the most
cynical Apple hater can agree that it
helps pave the way for the products we
use today making technology more
accessible to everyone I'm Vanessa Han
Ariana filling in for iies and today
I'll be counting down five of the most
iconic Apple products ever made
let's start in chronological order the
year 1977 the product the Apple 2 this
was not jobs in Wozniak's first computer
but it was the first one with mass
appeal and the one that put the duo on
the radar unlike the first Apple which
was more of a circuit board for experts
the Apple 2 was a more integrated
personal computer for everyone it sold
for almost two decades before finally
retiring in 1993 next we have the
Macintosh in 1984 when it launched Apple
had just introduced the Lisa less than a
year before and was now looking to make
its features mainstream like the Lisa
the Macintosh featured a graphic user
interface that Jobs borrowed from Xerox
with the windows and cursor we still use
today but unlike the Lisa which cost a
modest 10 K at launch the Macintosh was
more affordable and easier to set up and
Apple made sure it would be a hit
investing more than a million dollars in
a Superbowl ad that would have made
Orwell himself
drop the remote fast-forward almost a
decade and a half for our next one the
iMac the computer the brought Apple out
of the dark ages gave jobs a hell of a
comeback and was Johnny eyes first big
product design the computer itself was
by no means the most powerful but with
its built-in monitor bubble like plastic
in the back in all the colors of the
rainbow
it proved yet again that Apple had high
standards for design and usability and
that we're all suckers for pink let's
just say the iPod was Apple's way of
ringing in the new millennium
by 2001 there were already a slew of mp3
players out on the market but none like
the iPod was the device that finally
made us ditch our walkman 10 songs in a
cassette that you ripped off from your
local radio station versus a thousand
songs in the palm
your hand more importantly it's paved
the way for that little no music service
called iTunes which continues to be the
reason why some people remain loyal to
the Apple ecosystem we cap off our list
with the iPhone you know it was coming
hard to believe it was almost 10 years
ago now that Steve Jobs presented what
everyone thought were three different
products an iPod an internet
communicator and a phone we'll need to
shock them all by revealing that he was
actually talking about the same device
the iPhone was by no means the first
smartphone but it's credited for edging
out the physical keyboard and making
capacitive touchscreens a standard the
phone took six months to finally go on
sale and the absent come until a year
later but it sure din a new era of
connectivity so there you have them five
products that stand the test of time
cheers to the next 40 years of AI
devices Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
