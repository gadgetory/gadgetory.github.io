you've seen before but it's got one
feature that might just set it apart
it's called the mystic and it has lots
of familiar tricks like gesture control
and of course a follow-me mode from the
outside you'd be forgiven for confusing
it with the DJI maverick air the mystic
also folds up so it fits in the palm of
your hand but unlike the Maverick air it
only has a one axis Image Stabilizer
compared to the three axis on the DJI
one of the main features the mystic is
hoping we'll separate it from those DJI
comparisons is something called safari
mode from the app you can map out an
area you want the drone to explore and
then off it goes capturing photos it
uses artificial intelligence to
determine what looks interesting so
that's anything from landscapes to
people and even pets in our demo it
wasn't flying as far as they claimed 200
meter limit but it did snap a couple of
different perspectives mostly involving
people the mystic has 27 minutes of
flight time but the company says that
will be optimized to 30 minutes in the
near future so is it enough to set
itself apart from all the other drones
on the market machine learning and AI is
intriguing but the drones full potential
is still a ways down the track if you
want to get your hands on one it's
available - back on Kickstarter for $500
and should be available in November</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
