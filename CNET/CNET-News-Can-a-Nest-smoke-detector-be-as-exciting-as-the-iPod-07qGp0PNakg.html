detectors that's really the case why
hasn't there been any innovation since
the 70s and smoke detectors as far as I
can tell they look basically the same
they do basically the same thing and
they annoy you the same as they did in
the 70s when I was growing up you know
they beep at night they'll beep when
they and go off when you're cooking or
maybe when you're taking a shower when
you look at these things and a product
that's mandated by in every single state
in the Union and you have to have three
or four of these per home at least
minimally why hasn't there been more
innovation in this area why hasn't there
been something that doesn't wake you up
in the middle of the night when the
battery is low
it just seemed totally obvious to us can
you talk about your demographics or
where the customers are you have now
well it's one where we have now so our
customers today are in all 50 states
they're in Canada every province they're
actually in 90 countries where we don't
even sell they're less Nest Learning
Thermostat
so people either come to the US and take
them somewhere into their home country
or they actually go on eBay and find
some gray marketer does that so it
reminds me a lot of like the iPod days
and the iPhone days the early days when
they weren't available in those
countries people came and sought out the
technology and brought them to their
home country you brought up the
comparison to the iPod is it really I
mean it's just still a little bit
unimaginable to me to compare such a
device is it that is it that exciting to
you absolutely look we're talking about
revolutionising yet another category
that you interact with at some point in
your life or as part of your life and so
for me we are passionate we are
passionate about crazy enough to be said
thermostats and we're passionate about
smoke and CO detectors why that's what
it takes to reinvent categories you need
to have the passion this isn't just
about business this is about changing
our lives and changing your lives to
make it better or there other again
without divulging your roadmap when you
look around your house or are there
other things that frustrate you that you
think I mean what do you where do you
see this connected world going well I
don't think everything that could be
connected should be connected so you
know we have to look at key needs in
inside the home and where key touch
points are a lot of people are creating
new
like oh we're going to put a tablet on a
refrigerator to me that makes absolutely
no sense you have a great interface with
you at all times in your phone or your
tablet you take with you
why put another one on a refrigerator
that you have to maintain and software
update doesn't make much sense to me so
I think that you're going to see other
products get this connectivity for
energy data for convenience data but it
was not going to all have displays in
your face they're just like nest protect
there's not a display there
it's about ambient information and
bringing that information and combining
it into an app like the nest nest app I
think you're going to see many more
products inside the home get embedded
technologies not necessarily in your
face heads up there's smoke in the
dining room here's a weird one how did
you pick the voice we didn't just pick
one voice we picked five different
voices we picked American English
American Spanish we picked French
Canadian we picked Canadian English and
we picked British English
smoke alarm hushed what was really
important was to make sure we had a
mother tongue version of the language if
there is an emergency
studies have shown that kids are more
likely to wake up through a mother's
voice instead of a horn sound of a smoke
alarm so what we want to do is bring
that mother's voice on that local dial
in that local tonality to the product
emergency there's smoke are there things
from Apple that you've carried over to
nest or things like culturally or ways
you come up with ideas or things that
you could that you've taken from iPad
iPod times that you can show me well I
you know Apple was an amazing experience
and many of the people here are from
there and and and the biggest thing
lessons that we learned is about
experience right it's all about creating
experience not just a product experience
but a sales experience a how do you
learn about the brand experience about
how people communicate the experience
they have to their friends and family at
Apple how you sell it how you package it
how you unbox and all of those things
were all key to the experience and what
we believe we're doing here at nest we
want our customers not to just look at
our product singularly but we want them
if they buy multiple products multiple
categories of product so we want them to
work even better together and so in the
case of the the CEO detector and the
thermostat what happens is the number
one cause of CEO leaks in a home are due
to faulty furnaces something is broken
in the furnace and CEO is leaking into
the home so what nest protect does is if
it detects a co leak it tells a nest
thermostat in the same home to turn off
so hopefully we get the number one leak
source of the leak in the home shut off
right away so these are the kind of
things that we can do better when when
they're all engineered and designed
under one roof
