and today we're taking a first look at
the Samsung Galaxy Nexus which sprint is
now selling for 1 99 99 all you android
fans out there know that the Galaxy
Nexus isn't a new smartphone it came to
verizon last december and an unlocked
global model hit the world scene months
before that still this venerable device
was the first Android Ice Cream Sandwich
handset and still has a lot of things
going for it first it offers a clean
pure and tasty ice cream sandwich
experience the phone also has a nimble
1.2 gigahertz dual-core processor one
gigabyte of RAM and 32 gigabytes of ROM
it's got a nice HD super amoled screen
to that measures a large 4.65 inches
sprint has also promised to let the
Galaxy Nexus connect to its new 4G LTE
network which hopefully will launch this
summer and unlike its cousin on verizon
it features the Google Wallet app for
mobile payments in addition to enabling
Google Wallet the Galaxy Nexus is NFC
chip also supports the Android Beam
feature which lets you send content to
other similarly equipped handsets just
by bumping them together the first thing
you notice about the Galaxy Nexus is its
large gorgeous 4.6 5-inch screen using
AMOLED technology it displays colors
that are vivid and blacks which are very
dark above the screen is a 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera under the display
you notice that there are no physical
buttons instead there are three software
keys for back home and recent
applications on the left is a slender
volume bar while on the right is a tiny
power button on the bottom edge sits a
micro USB port and 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack some people may find the
placement for the headphone jack a
little awkward as opposed to being
located on the top of the phone around
back is the 5 megapixel resolution
camera which is low compared to the 8
megapixel and even 16 megapixel sensors
modern smartphones tent to sport I'm
