Congress 2013 we're taking a look at two
new 7-inch lenovo tablets so first up is
this chap this is the Lenovo a 1000 it
is a very basic tablet it's got this
7-inch screen the resolution is 600 x
1024 pixels so it's not looking
particularly sharp to be honest it does
have a micro SD card slot though so you
can bump up the storage which is a nice
touch it's got no camera on the back but
there is one on the front so you should
be able to make video calls something
that Lenovo thinks is quite cool about
this tablet are these twin speakers on
the front and these are Dolby branded
the idea is that when you're listening
to music you'll get it from two sources
so it should sound a little bit better
than the usual tinny speakers that you
get on tablets or smartphones it's
running Android version 4.1 which isn't
the latest version but it's quite it's
quite recent it's got a dual-core 1.2
gigahertz processor and Lenovo reckons
it is going to be cheaper than the nexus
7 first impressions are that this really
is quite a simplistic tablet build
quality doesn't seem to be too high you
see if I apply a little bit of pressure
to the back of the tablet you get this
screen distortion there which isn't
great but if it's cheap enough then you
never know it might be a good one for a
tablet that you're not really too fussed
about losing or maybe even want to give
your kids all right next up is this
slightly more luxurious 7-inch tablet
this is the a3000 so the resolution of
this display is the same but it's a
different screen technology this is an
IPS panel and that means that it looks a
lot better than the one on the a1000
colors are crisper everything just looks
a little bit more refined unlike the
more affordable option at this tablet
has the option of 3G so that's good if
you want data on the go it's got a
quad-core processor as well instead of
the dual-core one in the tablet we just
looked at it doesn't have the Dolby
speakers however for some reason this
one despite being a bit more luxurious
loses that feature it is going to be
more expensive we don't know how much
there's no pricing details exactly
yet but do expect to pay a little bit
more for the slightly more pricey
components this also got a rear facing
camera as well which is something that
the cheaper model doesn't have it's
running android version 4.2 which is at
the time of speaking a very recent
version of google's mobile operating
system so both these tablets are going
to be coming out later this year as I
mentioned there's no word on pricing it
unfortunately but when we do get word on
pricing will get a clear idea whether or
not they have the clout to take on
devices like the Nexus 7 or Samsung's
recently announced Galaxy Note 8.0 I'm
the west or agency nuts and these are
some lenovo 7-inch tablets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
