welcome to the Apple bite for everything
gonna bad inside the world of Apple and
let's jump into the latest you know what
iPhone 7 News now rumors first said the
new iPhone might be called the iPhone 6s
II but a report from a co 2 car's
reliable sources have confirmed that
this year's lineup will go with the
iPhone 7 and 7 plus to avoid having
back-to-back phones with an S in them
now the report also says the idea of a
third Pro model was never a thing early
mock-ups of large screen iPhones with a
single camera lens were produced as a
fallback in case the dual lens camera
didn't pan out the latest mock-ups have
repeatedly featured the new dual lens
design that should end up being the plus
model also digit x has jumped on other
reports and claims that the iPhone 7
will indeed have a 256 gig option the
expected capacities are 32 128 and 256
after reports that Apple will finally
get rid of a 16 gig entry-level model
thank you and you know what I'll give
them a good Apple but it's still not
clear if the 256 gig option will only be
available for the larger 5.5 inch iPhone
and a new leak from an ATM tease retail
schedule could potentially push out the
next iPhone launch as late as September
the 23rd now EV leaks claims the
sixteenth will be the official launch
Merchandising resets are a normal thing
in the retail world so this could be
nothing but I'm gonna lean with EV leaks
and the 16th on this one and it's pretty
much a guarantee Apple will be going
with a lightning connector in favor of a
headphone jack at Intel's developer
forum in San Francisco this week they
told C net that USB C and not lightning
is the future of digital audio with its
sound quality thinner size and power
management capabilities that will have a
negligible effect on battery life when
in use Intel also said the all digital
audio connection could allow for better
sounding headphones without licensing
agreements from Dolby or Bose and even
noise cancelling could be cheaper with
USB based audio now the USB type-c
digital audio specification is expected
to be released this quarter and what
else could be a part of the future for
the iPhone well how about faster data
speeds 8
is working with carriers to bring their
5g network to consumers earlier than
planned
once the 3gpp a collaboration between
groups of telecom associations releases
the official 5g specs so what like how
fast could 5g really be well according
to outdoor test by AT&amp;amp;T in New Jersey in
Austin
how about 10 to 100 times faster than 4G
LTE that's a good Apple
but Pompeo breaks the first phase of the
standards process is expected in 2018 18
T's 5g network rollout is expected in
2020 and then there's Apple who has to
get on board and we know that they
sometimes like to adopt new tech later
on like two years later on alright the
iPad could benefit from 5g in 2020 and
beyond but the iPad family could look a
whole lot different by then KGI
securities ming chi quo reports Apple
will have three new iPads in 2017 that's
right three starting with a low cost low
cost right nine point seven inch model
the current big screen twelve point nine
inch model and plans to introduce a ten
point five inch iPad pro he also claims
will only see big changes like a new
redesign and a radical change to a
flexible AMOLED display in 2018 at the
earliest
now quo mentions nothing about the 7.9
inch iPad Mini but I'm having a hard
time seeing what the value is bringing a
third iPad model into the mix between
the two current pros like neither of
them are even selling like gangbusters
all right Twitter just signed a deal
with the NFL to livestream 10 Thursday
night football games as part of their
huge live streaming content push
according to the New York Times Twitter
has also signed deals with the NBA MLB
NHL Wimbledon and the pac-12 network so
why is this interesting to you the Apple
fighters well the Twitter is in talks
with the Apple to bring their Twitter
app to the Apple TV and allow you to
livestream sporting events directly to
you without a cable subscription now I'm
really curious to see if they create a
custom stream of real-time tweets or
polls within the app to really start
bringing a sense of community during
these events and giving us a taste of a
real live interactive
experience and also you know me I told
you and you know how I hate people who
straight up use their iPads to take
pictures it's horrible like don't do
this and finally someone agrees check
this out
this dolphin straight up just grab this
lady's iPad in a pink case into the
water I love everything about this and
thanks to Apple biters annsofi Oh for
the clip now that lady and you all
learned an important lesson because I'm
pretty sure he did it on porpoise okay
that's gonna do it for this show you can
always email us at the Apple bite at
cnet.com or tweet me at Brian Tong
thanks so much for watching and we'll
catch y'all next time for another bite
of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
