point O and I've already got kales bags
facts and eSports is cracking down on
cheaters who are taking drugs you know
winners don't use drugs tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the besties
talk shows in our universe I'm Ashley
Skala that's kale anonymous I know I
like I just said I'm hurt broken by
these by these terrible revelations in
gaming it's easy with a new sport for
stuff to kind of subtly slip in and like
for us to start figuring out where like
it's it's a learning process growing
pains growing its growing pains and
there's a lot to talk about behind that
because it kind of people didn't even
think about yeah it was just kind of a
thing it suddenly blew up yeah and we'll
get to it but let's talk about a new
place to live yeah let's hit headlines
about a new place to live let's talk
about this Airbnb not here yeah I saw
this on our B&amp;amp;B you guys I was super
fascinated earth to point o is NASA's
account okay so we got to talk about
earth to point o this was this morning
now so now it's a pretty big deal and
we'll explain why they have discovered a
kind of cousin to Planet Earth in the
Kepler this is called kepler-452b not
eggs not see 452 big those other ones
are those other ones are total garbage
it is a near near the size of Earth it's
about sixty percent bigger in is
orbiting in the habitable zone of a star
that is similar to our own Sun which is
very which is pretty rare a lot of times
you have it's too close it's too far and
then even if it is in that sort of
Goldilocks zone it is not the son or the
star that it orbits is not good for
sustaining life so that means that this
planet kepler-452b is in an area where
liquid water is possible and its
location also means that it could be
rocky just like Earth it could be like
Earth you guys it could be it could be
you know they do expect it to have
active volcanoes though um and they also
and maybe a slightly thicker atmosphere
than our earth currently does however a
year there is only 385 days it's only 20
days more than earth earth year sweet
like an extra month yeah you get like an
extra month to do stuff it is
unfortunately for
200 light-years away in the Cygnus
constellation which you can actually see
pictures of they have NASA's got their
big photo gallery of all these amazing
photos taken by satellites and you can
see photos of the Cygnus constellation
but you can see this is like the whole
they have a bunch of pictures on
nasa.gov like I encourage you if you
love space like I do go over there look
over everything it's super fascinating
and also and I thought this was the most
interesting part that this system has a
1.5 built or a 1 billion year head start
in terms of evolution or development of
life if there is life there they would
have an extra billion years of evolution
on us it's a million years older than
Earth and there you have like so many
Marvel movies out have already some oh
my god guys there in like phase funny
right now oh it's like MCU phase 20 at
least um yeah I love this I think this
is so cool it marks the first time that
we've seen sort of what I have I think
of as look kind of the earth hat trick
which is right place right size and
similar star that it orbits so this is
the very first time we've seen all three
of those things be the case for a planet
to the layman how do they know as much
information and how what don't they know
about it like how did they find this
thing so we have a Kepler we actually
have a space as satellite that has been
taking pictures of the Kepler system
very specifically for a while since our
satellite it's been out there for a long
time and I think last year we actually
reported on this right before you came
in and started co-hosting two of the i
believe it's four or six mechanisms on
the satellite broke like they broke down
so they've only been able to get kind of
a really focused view of kepler as a
system and they still though have been
receiving data and they've been studying
it and kind of making these
determinations as they've gotten
information in so the Kepler satellite
still giving us like amazing information
and data on this start on this system on
the kepler system so super incredible
that we're even able to know and and one
of the reasons are one of the ways that
they're able to kind of see size and
different things like that is they will
look at as they're watching it they'll
see you know things cross in front of it
um that kind of helps determine how big
or small things are alright cool um but
yeah it's start booking your strategy
yeah you can't book your air B&amp;amp;B just
yet I you know I tweeted this morning
and I really mean this like we don't
really know what's over there right so
we just kind of know it's there and we
have some ideas as to what it could be
like and for me I can't help but think
that maybe a like a billion years ago
when they were when Kepler was in the
same position that Earth is in right now
evolutionary wise there were humans
there or some type of living sentient
beings there who discovered earth and
rely God's 1400 light light years away
and we're gonna name it like you know
Zach's Iran you know for 685 looks like
they were humans but they said Zach so
Jax Iran and so well of course that a
little bit different language than it
then then what we have here but yeah I
love this idea of like maybe we're
looking at planet that's looking right
back at us and neither of us really know
this is really base prime and stuff it's
really terrifying to think about it like
maybe because of space and time like
we're looking at them so far you know a
long time ago or you know actually what
if there was an earth to tomorrow Daily
Show where might be I there would be
what they called it tomorrow daily to
know like why are we calling it that but
I know so ya know it's probably out
there hey Dave space kale hey earth to
hey 2.0 Ashley come at me bro I will
fight you for supreme there can only be
one okay I'll and her alright that
brings us to our hashtag of the day
which is which is TD 45 to be so oh
great good luck with that 450 to be its
number the number four or five to you
don't have to type it all out and be
ridiculous t2 uh would you move there if
you knew nothing about it but you knew
humans could survive there like if you
knew humans could live on the surface
like you say they say we know humans
could live there like there's oxygen and
you can go there and you could live
there would you go live there first of
all it's not a good idea to send me
first I'm not I'm not a good thing first
I'm saying if they just said the
possibilities there we can get you there
in your lifetime we figured out you know
let's say we figured out wormhole travel
like they we know how to bend space and
time and we can get you there really
quickly like within five years if I can
decide in 10
years yeah okay he's in 10 years I will
have like experienced enough life on
this planet okay where I could be like
all right I'm literate I'm ready to make
an impact I'm ready to do a nupe new
phase of my life exam math and the earth
nearer to the ends you know that sort of
thing so but yes the answer is yes you
would go bring tons of books so many
movies I would learn everything and then
it would die on that plan you'd have to
bring here's the thing like what if like
let's say even if they were advanced
civilization people there were think
there were beings that live there they
all of their technology be totally
different than ours well bring a DVD
player what do you can't plug it in I'd
bring a generator Oh fair enough i would
get weatherby pedal or whatever or
sunbae sunbae be yeah come on Ashley
your power you're the host of tomorrow
daily we can figure things out they can
make a human heart out of nothing right
very true okay what am I getting uh I
feel like I feel like I would go it's
hard because i don't think i would go if
i knew nothing about it beyond just
humans could survive there cuz like what
sure you could breathe air but then like
if there's a bunch of volcanoes and
there's not any technology or i would be
really bummed out like in fact cuz i
love the idea of getting up in the
morning and not knowing if we're gonna
discover something like earth to point
out like that's really exciting for me
and if there was just none of that on
kepler-452b i think i would i think i
would be really sad i think i would die
sad lady here's here's the catch though
for you not to extend this any longer
than it needs to be but you report on
all this stuff all the time wouldn't you
want to be a part of at least one of the
stories if there's Wi-Fi on girl you
know i want there's a mcdonalds they'll
be a wife oh I want to be part of the
story where we upload our consciousness
into robots like I would like to end up
a Cylon before my death that's my goal
that's a gold life that's on my bucket
list number one right there you're
creepy he right now creepy lady I will
take it what about you and Logan no not
going not know music festivals now music
crash hold on kepler-452b Oh looking to
start his own all right tell me about
okay so so so so serious you're gonna
get through this real as real quick okay
um whether you like it or not e sports
or video game video game sports is
as big as real sports and because it's a
new thing maybe there's some problems
that we haven't discovered yet namely
Edo ping and or taking
performance-enhancing drugs yes there
are drugs you can take to make yourself
game better um caffeine is a lower level
laughing lower level right it's now
being discovered that adderall is being
taken by a lot of people playing the
game and because there's no there's no
rules against it just yet people are
taking it well they've decided to make a
stand with that the electronic sports
league has announced yesterday that
they're planning to start up a the drug
testing for drugs like adderall that
seems to be the one a new one that's
like very popular monks really elite and
by the way I just really want I want to
mention this really quickly the video
that you guys are watching over what
we're talking about none of these people
have like been convicted of doping they
haven't even been accused this is just a
really great compilation of eSports
gaming that I found online that was made
by a redditor and I loved it so much
that I want to put on the show so just
to be clear this is just a compilation
this has nothing to do specifically like
with any allegations of doping or
anything like that in eSports ok please
continue yeah I mean it gives you it
gives you an example of what it looks
like you're sitting there playing video
games there's a huge audience there's
millions of dollars at stake like this
is a real serious thing and people have
a reason to take these drugs a reason to
take these drugs I don't quote me on
that but so now they're trying to crack
down there's good they're gonna partner
with the Germany nada the national
anti-doping agency doping um panting so
yeah they're gonna try and make measures
to kind of prevent this yeah there was
an interview recently where some guy got
kicked off a team and basically felt the
need to tattle on everybody and say
everyone was taking adderall um so yeah
I mean it kind of blew the doors open
don't know how deep it's going we don't
know if there's other drugs that are
being taken or there I read some like I
read a bunch about this after i started
reading it and um there's there's no
word on whether because you can take a
caffeine pill that's really really
really high
caffeine and that's not good for you so
I mean we don't know if they're going to
start tackling that yeah there's no word
if they're just saying that now they're
gonna start cracking down there's going
to be some sort of rules in place which
is which is good that's a good thing I
mean I think it's good that they're
gonna policies and I know that you had
mentioned earlier before we started
feeling they're going to do like support
networks like to help sort of players
who are dealing with that this is an
immense amount of pressure these gamers
runner it's the same amount that you
would be under if you were playing in a
pro football game or if you then and
it's not a justification for doing that
but it is a very serious thing that
these players have so much anxiety and
so much stress about winning like at all
costs and so that's all they do day
night it's all they do tinnitus is play
the game that they play professionally
and train train train so for for the ESL
to say okay this is obviously a problem
and we're acknowledging that and we're
gonna make it better and we're going to
try to give these athletes a support
network which most other professional
sports leagues have yeah hello our
network look I know it's hilarious I
know tell relentless I know it's
hilarious to think that there's
performance-enhancing drugs to play
video games but there's millions of
dollars at stake and not everyone is
going to be taking these drugs here's
here's here's the real issue not
everyone is going to be taking these
drugs and it's not fair to the people
that aren't taking the drugs that other
people are they shouldn't have to
accommodate to that they're like well
they're taking them so I have to take
them to be as good so it needs to be
balanced it's only fair to the people
that are coming to see the shows and are
being like these guys are amazing gamers
so it's ridiculous it's just like
professional sports though yeah that's
not ridiculous at all i think that so
that is a logical sound argument it's
not fair to the people who don't and
it's not fair to the fans because it's
it's not genuine it's not a genuine win
you used something to help you win so I
I think it's a good thing I mean I also
adderall is not a legal drug unless you
have a prescription right so that's
already you're already breaking the
rules so it's like whether or not you're
playing starcraft real good it's like
you're not taking an illegal drug while
you're on a team to win millions of
dollars so not good shame shame shame
you're gonna getcha
go to break let's come back with into it
and our user feedback don't click away
it's tomorrow daily this week I'm
playing portal stories Mel which is a
community developed free mod that lays
on top of portal 2 all you need to do is
own the original game we played a lot of
planetside 2 it's a free-to-play now on
PlayStation 4 so I've been playing
telltale games Game of Thrones it's
based on the HBO series but it's not
about those characters it's about an
entirely different northern house and
sometimes some of the characters from
the show show up with Terry I've been
playing rocket League and is a blast it
is competitive as it gets I kamarag last
time I played a game where I'm standing
up screaming at other people this brand
new story new puzzles best part pletely
free it's been pretty mellow so far
wasn't really Game of Thrones he didn't
really capture that tension and that
anxiety but the most recent episode not
only was extremely nerve-racking but it
made me cry massive player battles in an
open world sci-fi setting can't really
beat that simple it's easy to play hard
to master it's awesome
telltale i think is doing a really good
job of making really feel like you're
playing the game of thrones and that
you're navigating these conversations
and these people's motives to further
your own in a way that's both dangerous
and entertaining so i would check it out
welcome back to the show we've returned
it's a thursday we like to talk about
stuff that we love on thursday so this
is into it i'd almost felt like you just
drop the bass on us alright can I go
first this week yeah you seem pretty
excited about it I am super excited so I
had heard a lot about how great the
Muppets TV show was going to be the
pilot the the stuff they showed a comic
con apparently was amazing and they
finally ABC released the footage from
what they showed at comic-con oh not the
first episode but the foot first like 10
minute presentation that was what was
sort of given to ABC to decide if they
want to go to series with it and it is
awesome it's so so good it's everything
you love about the Muppets it is smart
and and funny and just brilliantly done
the way that they're gonna do it is it's
gonna be kind of documentary style we're
almost like the office but it's about
the Muppets like imagine if you were
doing like the office but it's gonna be
backstage at like I guess a variety show
like they're verte the muppet show but
it's about their personal lives beyond
the show this is such a fantastic so
like I guess a cross between the office
and 30 rock but with Muppets like is
that that's probably the best way to
describe it and it is so good this 10
minutes is so funny and brilliant and
and again classic Muppets like there are
still some great Muppet jokes in there
but there are also some great jokes that
are like oh man like this is perfect
like these are perfect modern Muppet
jokes like I love so it's really great I
I can't I don't want to spoil it I'm
gonna tell you like oh this happens when
this happens but usually you should a
hundred percent watch it it's worth 10
minutes
your time and just jump on the internet
go over go over to youtube look up abc's
channel and just watch it because it is
so good and so funny and the conceit of
the show is great and i can't wait to
see it this fall I cannot wait it's
great yeah I haven't been this excited
about a muppets property in a really
long time really what about the Muppets
I didn't see muppets most wine oh that
was terrible I heard that wasn't very
good but I loved The Muppet movie with
Jason Segel yeah that was great puppets
but then before that there wasn't really
a whole lot for a long time so it's true
and I love like Muppets Take Manhattan
what's your favorite rub it oh my gosh
my favorite Muppet um I mean I really
love beaker beakers a awesome up it but
I have to say Sadler in waldorf like I
oh yeah okay fair enough I'd be like
yeah yeah yeah that's that's exactly
good that's good all right you win okay
tell me what you're into so I'm into it
I just got into two days ago thanks to
producer Logan who made the suggestion
he's like oh you're gonna let you
probably like this it's humans this is a
British television show it's airing in
BBC but also airing on AMC BBC is
obviously we're to their two episodes
ahead but it is about basically robots
are now servants like they've created
humanoid robots that are servants and
will like work in our house and it's
about the singularity it's about this
sort of there are helpers but they're
slowly getting smarter and some of them
happening your dark histories that we
that we don't know about gosh I can't go
any further than that but if you're kind
of into that sci-fi where sci-fi is
where like technology starts to help us
out but what are the ramifications of
I'm working how where does it I what is
it unravel and like the stories of like
how it affects the world and stuff like
that hello it's just fantastic they get
they approach it at the way i say is
it's the pacing is perfect british
television has pacing down to a tee
whereas sometimes american television
and this is this isn't universal but
sometimes american television can be
like we got to hit them hard at the
beginning and then it's kind of as that
slow along and then they do the ending
thing but this thing has like perfect
pacing
all the way through consistent yeah it's
really good humans if you end up
watching it let me know because I love
no other people that really like it I
love it you should check it out too I
definitely will know thanks for the
suggestions loser Logan you're welcome
awesome you're so well all right you
want to kick to this next thing ya hey
guys let's talk about you it's time for
user feedback yesterday we introduced
the flying car we did the flying car is
coming real soon unfortunately and so we
asked you we had hashtag TD fly car and
we asked you who would you give a flying
car too yeah you couldn't get you can
keep it yeah you had to give it away to
somebody freaking jerk okay so here are
some of here are some of the answers
first off we got Frank who says the
animal the animal troll well let's just
communicate on the animal patrol and
Africa should have this flying card to
hunt down these poachers brilliant yeah
he's referring to a poacher thing that
we're trying out coach I know who's that
love me wrapping it all together tying
it all together with a nice little smart
person Frank next up we have Leo who
says i'd give the flying car to Donald
Trump so he can fly away from Planet
Earth I have to say a lot of people
wrote that answer it wasn't just Leo
there's like I think five other people
who said just give the car to dumping
him fly away out of Earth people are
trying to get rid of Donald Trump you
don't want him around make sense next up
we got Mitchell Mitchell says I would
send one to a young mechanic for him to
build a service station and repairs for
future accidents no now you're literally
making somebody and on Trish
entrepreneur by doing that like that
Rachel entrepreneur that's kind of like
it's kind of an emotion that's good I
like that one that's you're helping out
somebody who maybe didn't didn't have
any a lot of prospects in life and now
he's gonna be a billionaire with a
flying car franchise good job Mitchell
flying car fixers that's what I'm gonna
call it lastly we have one from will Oh
will who says i'll give it to that
mexican drug lord el chapo so he can get
to trump faster LOL
who's gonna get the car first let me go
to fly over there is it gonna be i'll
chop 0 2 gets very edgy answer to give
it to a cartel drug attack in the car to
make art mean well I mean well uh
Mitchell's like I'm gonna help some
young mechanic feels like a drug lord
although to be fair I think he probably
has enough money to buy a car right now
so I'll chop yeah I probably just pay in
cash for a flying car give me those yeah
alright cool alright so that brings us
of course to our last piece of user
feedback which is your phone tag refer
of the day alright so Gregor Rodin Greg
took this picture with his one plus one
and I have to say this is incredible
reminds me of that movie fire in the sky
so aliens obviously on their way he says
check out this picture of the Sun
setting along the coastline in Alabama
the sky looked like it was on fire we've
been watching the skies ever since and
while there have been other nice sunsets
none have looked as good as this one it
was taken with the one plus one that is
an amazing picture Wow everything's
orange everything is orange in that
picture he didn't use a filter I'm
assuming not he just said take him with
one plus one can I tell you a story
about one plus one that I read the other
day that I thought was really
fascinating I'm really I'm kind of
getting an astrophotography like I want
to take pictures of the stars in less
light polluted area so it might go out
to the desert and like try on my Fuji my
x100 team but I saw it post online on
this website about astrophotography
where they used a one plus one and got
some amazing Star photos like of the
night sky with not a lot of light
pollution they were able to get pictures
of stars with a cell phone why it was
amazing why are they able to do that on
the one plus one and nothing else um
well because the sensor is really good
uh the aperture i think i think is the
lowest i want to say the iphone is like
2.3 and on the oneplus one its f-stop 2
point 0 is Louis so it's nuts in more
light so when you're in less light foot
area or I will actually pull the light
for the stars and stuff hmm seriously
you guys that one plus one camera my
it's one of the best out there like I
really mean I haven't tried it
personally but from what I have read in
seen from people's pictures it's a
really amazing camera and I'm really
impressed with that like I really I'm
always impressed by an excellent
smartphone camera and the one plus one
is definitely one of those so for what
it's worth I don't know it takes amazing
pictures that astrophotography stuff
i'll show it to you after the show it's
incredible anyway that's it if you want
to send us some photography you can
email us tomorrow at cnet com and you
know just tell us you took it and give
us permission because that seems
important and then also if you want to
find the show online you can always send
your user feedback sits at tomorrow
daily on Twitter but really you want to
hang out with us and you can do that on
twitter if you want to send me some arms
you can tweet at me I Matt Cail
anonymous or if you want to talk about
humans yeah at Cal mostly send me some
arms cuz i miss my art please send
killer arms but yeah and then you're
well you are I'm over at Ashley's
schedule on Twitter it's super easy to
find me as well but that's it for the
show guys will be back on Monday that's
