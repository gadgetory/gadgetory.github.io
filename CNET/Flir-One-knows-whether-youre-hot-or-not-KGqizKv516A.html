I'm Meghan Willerton for CNET appliances
here with the FLIR one thermal imaging
camera for iOS so while it's an
expensive mobile accessory at 250 bucks
it's really just a fraction of the price
of most thermal imaging cameras so if
you aren't familiar with thermal imaging
tech this expands your field of vision
so that you can see the heat signatures
in everything in any room that means
that everything from a cup of ice to a
space heater give off unique signatures
that help distinguish one from the other
Thermal Imaging's hexyz on a totally
different spectrum so it can see in
daylight or total darkness
that's a definite advantage but one
problem is that it doesn't have visible
light to work with it treats everything
like an opaque wall so if you wanted to
see what was happening outside from
inside your house and you use FLIR one
and pointed it at a window you would
actually see your own heat signature
reflected back so it isn't super useful
as an indoor to outdoor security device
but FLIR one does something a bit
different it relies on something called
MSX technology that's two cameras in one
basically a regular visible light camera
and a thermal imaging camera and it
mashes the two images together to create
a crisper image and that is the defining
quality that differentiates this camera
from its competition particularly the
sikh thermal camera that we reviewed
earlier this year I really like FLIR one
overall it isn't perfect but for a
handheld mobile device that you can
recharge and take with you on the go
it's really straightforward and so so
easy to use it also produces really cool
images things that you wouldn't usually
be able to see like heat and air
conditioning leakages on external
windows and doors or find any issues
with your electrical or HVAC system but
this is really a specialty product even
though it's only 250 bucks that's so
kind of a lot to spend
something that doesn't have a ton of
practical applications so definitely
think about specific use cases before
you buy this product for more check out
