gets a little bigger with two new galaxy
tab s slates and those looking for a
great movie watching tablet with plenty
of other virtues are going to find the
pair of worthy high-end investment I'm
xiomara Blanco for cnet and this is a
first look at the samsung galaxy tab s
the super thin and lightweight designs
have a light goldish brown trim and come
in white or dark grey both tablets are
currently the lightest and thinnest in
their category and the sparsely dimpled
plastic back is comfortable to hold in
landscape orientation the 8.4 inter
suffers from a button filled bottom
bezel with capacitive buttons that are
easy to accidentally trigger and in
order to avoid blocking the speakers
your thumb has to have hazard we hang
out by the back button the 10.4 inch
models slim side bezels don't provide a
lot of thumb space either and for these
reasons i found the cases to be an
essential accessory to fully enjoying
long movies the native video app is the
best way to watch video since it gives
you the full menu of options to optimize
your viewing experience like the AMOLED
cinema mode when turned on the saturated
colors sharpness and deep black levels
make HD content appear vibrant and
lifelike for some videos I really
enjoyed the extra punch but I wasn't
always a fan of how it changed the color
balance sometimes it makes
natural-looking scenes or skin tones
into oversaturated ones that often look
to green or red the AMOLED cinema
setting does a great job of enhancing
videos but it's up to personal
preference if you like the more
saturated and contrasted result speaker
quality isn't incredibly impressive or
loud but audio holds up at max volume
with little distortion and there are a
few useful audio optimization options
when using the native video app the
samsung galaxy tab s runs on Samsung's
own Exynos 5 octa cpu 3 gigabytes of ram
16 or 32 gigabytes of internal storage
and a microSD card slot that's
expandable up to 128 gigabytes other
Hardware on the tab s includes a
fingerprint scanner which is easy to set
up and works well consistently and an 8
megapixel rear and 2-megapixel
front-facing camera the cameras offer
the usual modes but you can also
download more if you'd like and though
there isn't a huge variety to choose
from it's a cool and rare perk to
download more camera modes for a tablet
the photo quality is pretty decent
images look fine at full resolution but
there's still visible grain and noise
the image stabilization makes a
difference when taking the light photos
but a steady hand goes a long way the
Galaxy Tab eps are to the best movie
watching tablets available and though
they're a high-end purchase with the
price to match they pack a robust user
interface and plenty of software
features to justify it I've only begun
to scratch the surface of what the
galaxy tab s has to offer so for a more
in-depth look check out my full review
on cnet again I'm xiomara Blanco and
this has been a first look at the
samsung galaxy tab s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
