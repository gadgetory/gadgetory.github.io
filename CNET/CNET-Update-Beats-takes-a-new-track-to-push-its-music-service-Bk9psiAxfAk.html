getting started I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update you probably
know beats electronics for their dr. dre
branded headphones well beats is
launching a subscription music service
in the coming months it'll be called
daisy and it wants to do so with some
marketing help from 18t Cena has learned
that executives that beats have been in
talks to work with AT&amp;amp;T so this Daisy
streaming music service can be bundled
with AT&amp;amp;T data plans for example maybe
you can listen for free for a while if
you're an eighteen t customer and that
will help gain audience quickly since
it's already a competitive space with
Spotify Rdio and Pandora and don't
forget about Google music all access and
itunes music but this Daisy music
service would be a hybrid of computer
algorithms and human curated playlists
from experts in the music industry for
example nine inch nails frontman Trent
Reznor will be the chief creative
officer for this service one of the
biggest competitors to Daisy will be
pandora and it just got an iOS upgrade
those with iPhones and iPads should
notice better buffering and a new auto
pause feature that stops radio playback
when the device is muted now more than
half a revenue pandora makes goes to
music royalties so that feature is to
make sure pandora isn't paying for music
that you're not listening to for those
of you getting the new playstation 4
when it comes out this year you won't be
able to turn off a light on the back of
the controller to save battery life this
was confirmed in a tweet by a Sony
executive the dualshock 4 controller has
a light bar that changes colors based on
what's happening in a game and it's
designed to work with the PlayStation
camera but if the camera isn't connected
the light bar is pretty much pointless
so if you don't connect a camera you
don't need the light but that like has
to stay on which might annoy people who
rather just turn it off to save battery
and speaking of video games a new Grand
Theft Auto 5 trailer is out that shows
actual gameplay this is a huge open
world where you get to jump between
three playable characters and you can do
tons of things like plan the details of
a jewel heist or go golfing yuvan is to
pursue
oceans to die animals display the game
will be available for the xbox 360 and
playstation 3 on September 17th keep
your eye on the App fancy it's kind of
like Pinterest but you can also buy
things that you fancy get it and
bloomberg reports that it just raised 53
million dollars from investors including
american express and actor Will Smith so
fresh prince of online shopping that's
your tech news update you could find
more details at cnet com / update or
