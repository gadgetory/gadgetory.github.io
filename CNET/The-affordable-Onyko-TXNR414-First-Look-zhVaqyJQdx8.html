we're gonna take a look at the onkyo TX
NR for 1/4 this is a budget 5.1 AV
receiver currently selling for two
hundred and eighty dollars like all
Ivanko zavery receivers it's not a very
stylish looking receiver it's got a boxy
look with a lot of sharp edges and
there's a ton of buttons on the front
that you'll probably never use the
included remote is decent although the
buttons are small and like the front
panel it's a little more clutter than it
needs to be now that bare-bones field
carries over to the user interface which
is just basic white text rather than a
prettier graphical user interface that's
found on a lot more expensive receivers
in fact the NR 414 is missing a lot of
features available on more expensive
receivers it's just a 5.1 receiver
rather than a 7.1 receiver and there's
no automatic speaker calibration analog
video up conversion or built-in airplay
but I don't really consider any of those
features to be that important and the
onkyo covers the essentials really well
around back it has six HDMI inputs which
is outstanding for this price and should
be enough for most home theaters the
Aniki also has built-in networking via
its Ethernet port plus akio sells a
$20.00 USB adapter to add Wi-Fi most
manufacturers charge closer to $100 for
their Wi-Fi accessories so that cheaper
dongle is a nice plus built-in
networking allows the receiver to stream
a bunch of audio from different online
sources including Pandora Spotify
Rhapsody and internet radio it also
allows you to control the receiver via
Onkyo smartphone app and that's a
particularly nice feature on this
receiver because it lets you browse
music services right on the app rather
than using the lousy on-screen user
interface we had seen its resident
Golden Ears Steve Guttenberg take a
listen to the onkyo sound quality
overall it performed pretty well
although it was a noticeable step down
from more expensive receivers like last
year's den on AVR 1912 action-movie
sounded a little less dynamic than with
the down although stereo CDs were more
comparable but altogether it's hard to
argue with the onkyo value for less than
$300 you get six HDMI inputs and
organ functionality which is a lot more
than its competitors are offering
however it is worth considering the
step-up akio TX NR 5 1 5 which has a lot
of those missing features I mentioned
before for just $65 more I'm Matthew
moscovia and this is the akio TX and our
401 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
