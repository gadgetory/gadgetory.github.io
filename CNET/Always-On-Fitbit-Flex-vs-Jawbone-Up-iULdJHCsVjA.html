than don't die hey the mud be with you
oh good one those are good words are
good
oh thank you nice so I have the first
aid kit in my bag no I love you guys
aware of this but it's there's no air
8,000 feet you know what hey there's mud
I missed the mud you got some right here
The Revenge go check out yellow right
here design-wise the Fitbit flex is
great it's super low profile it's really
actually pretty attractive you would
wear it in public and it's very
lightweight and easy to wear my biggest
complaint about it design wise is that
it's not a watch so it has this kind of
hieroglyphic dot thing for when you want
to see what's going on but that's all it
does and you wear it on your watch risks
which kind of bug me the clap on this
thing is ridiculous it's sort of this
weird piece of plastic and you have to
shove two pieces through two other
pieces it's really hard to get on you
will guarantee her your thumb trying to
get it on there it's just sort of a
weird design and frankly it feels a
little bit cheap I don't know why they
didn't spring for something better
so the Fitbit has always kind of been
the most full-featured fitness tracker
this one's no different i mean the fact
that it tracks your steps your calories
and your sleep and then gives you all of
that data and these kind of cool charts
so that you can really get a pattern
over time it's probably the most useful
of the fitness bands in that way and I
have to say I've got a little obsessed
with the sleep tracker especially and
that app is nicely designed I like the
way it lays out data I just wish it
synced with more android phones well I
have to say despite there being no clasp
and it's only on here very gingerly the
jawbone stayed on my wrist throughout
the entire mud run that's pretty
impressive now the bad news is it's hard
to be able to test to see if the fig
still lives I can put it into sleep mode
by holding down the only button that
this thing has so now that thinks I'm
going to sleep I have no idea any of the
data right now I have no idea how close
I am to my goal today four steps taken
or how I did with my sleep pattern the
only way to find that out is to plug
that into my phone and there's no way
I'm gonna be doing that while this thing
is still muddy
Oh
Wow
so we're all showered up yes I feel
something when us and we're synced we
synced our bands with our phones and the
apps evidently I moved 13,000 274 steps
today see I think that's kinda
interesting cuz i move 13,000 333 I mean
that's Wow pretty much a wash like yeah
and we were together most of the day so
it seems pretty accurate accurate so all
in all I mean I would say these are
performed pretty well for us but what
are your impressions of the jawbone up
and you will I don't like the look of it
I mean I think there are probably people
that would like the fact that it doesn't
look like a technology device for me it
looks like a silly bracelet that I'm
wearing that people keep commenting on
and asking you but with the bracelet
with a weird look in their eye and I can
so no no no it's a it's tracking my
activity today cuz it doesn't look like
tech all in all you know as much as this
did perform for me it's comfortable it's
attractive I feel like if the FuelBand
is still on the table it's only thirty
dollars more than these guys and you get
a watch you get kind of a cool sort of
retro readout I to me that's a more
full-featured more game ified half
that's actually ultimately more
motivating I have to agree so by or do
not buy for me it's a do not buy if
you're somebody that really doesn't want
to look like you're wearing technology
on your wrist and you like the look of
this you might want to consider it I
feel like if it came down to these two
the flex for me would be the x but like
I said fuel band is on the table I'm
going feel bad me too
