luckier than us get some pretty cool
Star Wars stuff and a crazy dog collar
that turns your dog into a giga pet and
also television may be coming to VR what
this is tomorrow daily
yeah you killed it yeah everybody yeah
welcome to tomorrow daily we got a bunch
of nerdy science tech and geek stuff for
you today but Ashley ask Anna is not
here today instead we have cyber Nova
you know there was a little mix-up she
got abducted on the spaceship I got
beamed down so now we're here let's roll
with it you're an alien apparently yes
okay that's cool let's hit the headlines
all right then so everybody loves dogs
right who doesn't come on they're way
better than people do you have a dog I
do okay with me but I have one there
they are better than people and some
people are obsessed with dogs you mean
fur babies some people are obsessed with
dogs and this brand new high-tech collar
is going to help those people become
even more obsessed a Kickstarter
launched buddy collar and now I'm in a
laundry I'm gonna launch right into the
features because there's none of them
okay so I besides having a super multi
coloured flashing collar which would be
really good at raves it has it has a
temperature sensor so you can see if
your dog is too hot wearable dog's head
something I'm worried about heart rate
stats and a 3 a three-axis accelerometer
without faster dogs running you can tell
how how fast is hard to meeting if he's
getting tired it has gps and the gps you
can create a virtual gate and if your
dog leaves that area it'll alert you it
will text you um it also has the
programmable colors the colors you can
make it different colors or like make it
flash or whatever so you can see your
dog at night the app also lets you check
your dog status from anywhere see
they're doing it right now look I have
any monitoring from your phone from your
SmartWatch anywhere it's crazy um also
you get social alerts this is this is
the social alerts why I'll tell you if a
fellow dog that has one of those colors
like you lose his friend he's like he's
at the park running around and you like
cool I'll bring Ginny to the park and
we'll go hang
with your big Rottweiler friends huh
social media for dogs now I knew this
was coming we already have the Instagram
accounts completely devoted to your pets
well guess what now you can stalk all of
their insides too you're not you're not
exciting me about a hater of social
accounts you can also scan therefore see
it's not even done yeah also scan their
clout their food to find out if you know
they need to they need to start losing
weight if they're eating too unhealthy
here we go there's programmable features
so it'll tell you when the dog needs a
walk when it needs to go to the vet when
it should be sit and when it should eat
so this is a Kickstarter thing so it's
not it's not fully funded yet okay so
let me ask you cyber novel how much
would you pay for this probably if I'm
guessing how much I would actually pay
for this now this comes in a small dog
sighs this changes the game if this
comes in five pound chihuahua sighs I
would drop a good like 75 bucks on
something like that 70 monitoring
temperatures think about it especially
where we live in LA where you'll see
people with Huskies in 100 degree
weather that would be such a great
technology to kind of monitor how your
pets doing but when you freak out like I
feel like I'd be worried all the time oh
my god was my dog too hot is it getting
enough food should I take it for a walk
is its heart beating really fast well I
mean I don't even use that type of
technology on myself so it might be a
stretch to worry about that for a pet
but I could imagine that you take a lot
of people take so much better care of
their pets than themselves this is just
the next extension yeah look at that I
could I could be tracking her stats
right now so so just for your
information on Kickstarter if you adopt
early it's a hundred and eighty dollars
hundreds either you got an 80 which is
it I don't think that's too bad
considering how much I pay that much for
the light up call yeah just for the
glowing aspect okay rave dogs so they
want 281 k to actually make this thing
and they've raised 100k so far so far so
what do we know about how long it's
taken yet uh I didn't I didn't see that
but I mean that's pretty good I think
they'll make it there though I want this
people like things that glow Logan you
don't have a dog do you want this Oh
perfect there's two souls what you get
Chihuahua sized one this I don't like
your little kid
any size out okay yeah look at that okay
so there's there's the stats 14 days to
go okay all right anyways left so they
have a hundred and one thousand dollars
raised so far that's pretty crazy what
do you think I think they're gonna make
the goal I think they are too Jenny
doesn't care she doesn't care he doesn't
care about being on TV okay let's move
to our next story because VR has been a
hot topic but it hasn't really made any
real headway like we're like all games
would be good on it I pray the gay guys
making fun of it has made a lot of good
titles oh that's a true way the whole VR
rolling down well let me tight here will
you hold my dog for me absolutely okay
well we got some new breakthroughs
because of variety is reporting that
cable labs is looking at vr now now
cablelabs is actually a non-profit wing
of the cable industry and the reason
they're looking at it as they saw that
there's a lot of response to these
360-degree music videos like Taylor
Swift release sports things concerts
they're saying that a lot of people are
having really great reactions to it and
VR and and cable is getting really
excited about it now the reason they're
get exciting about it is really really
stupid and being and I hit them because
they're getting excited because who
people will have to upgrade their
wireless I mean they're wired internet
connection because it's gonna be more
data because they're gonna need a 360
degree in high picture whoo ha ha ha but
yeah that's no good for us because we
may get some brand new content from
maybe some of our favorite shows maybe
we'll do a 360-degree episode of always
sunny in philadelphia there's some there
are some shows that i would not want to
get 360 with this action sequence right
here might not want to be behind a jet
but it would be really cool to just kind
of simulate flying and sort of things we
can't do in our day-to-day life that
definitely interests me yeah I mean oh
these a lot of these TV shows are
creating vivid worlds at like you think
of my the Minority Report show coming
out any of these ones like even breaking
bad if they're like they have a scene in
I mean it's too late but whatever so
actually that Dex so again they aren't
announcing anything there is going like
this
no something to consider will it make
sense if you think about it there they
are losing a lot of money everybody is
going digital these days a lot less
people are subscribing the cable plan so
obviously they have to jump on the
bandwagon find some way to take more of
our money that is exactly what the
article was talking about it's a very
good it's a very good theory because
they need to start creating ways to keep
by so who knows you may be in Westeros
watching a Denarius claim the game of
thrones I didn't even think about life I
could ride the dragons all right so but
all's complete but that actually leads
us to maybe you can add something to
this this is our hashtag today and we're
asking you guys this one is teeny TV vr
sorry I get to choose the hashtag it's
complicated a really good job with
Oakland thank you enough abbreviation um
but we want to know what television show
or series would you like to see some
sort of three 360-degree 3d element
right introduced in obviously you heard
some of ours I wouldn't mind an episode
of like Rick and Morty where it was 360
humans would be a good one new mens
would be a great one get up and close
and personal with some VR yeah the
ladies hello no BOTS so uh there's no
the world is your oyster let us know
what you think and which ones you want
to see I can't excited yeah I can't wait
to see these people are gonna be like
they're gonna be like the wire will be
like whoa whoa calm down hold on there
okay so so our next story we have it's
really adorable this is this is yours
you I am very excited about this so in
dads who were way cooler than mine news
apparently now this is really exciting
so there are actually a lot of things
that can go wrong with a human body but
there are some really creative dads who
have come up with a solution to make
their kids feel cooler about protecting
themselves so there are a couple of
really cool dads we have today now the
first dad his son is recovering from a
surgery from craniosynostosis so
basically it causes the bones in the
head as you know when kids are young
their skull it's still developing it as
to harden up so basically it just
hardens up a little bit incorrectly so
it causes some malformation so his son
needed to wear a helmet so instead of
you know dorky giant foamy helmets that
you see in the store he created Star
Wars inspired helmets look at this guy's
this all
oh this is the coolest dad ever so he
made r2d2 which is my fav what a my
personal favorite yes that is the best
amazing now Porkins I like because it
really looks like the portions character
a bit yes the chubby cheeks I love that
they use that picture for it and then
they also have bigs and Luke as you can
see they're pretty cool oh look at that
stay on target stay on target Lee's even
got a batman shirt in that one this is
this kid's gonna be so nerdy ya know
coolest dad ever now what's so cool
about these two is that he also made a
DIY video so if you guys you know you
know someone even if you just want a
cool bike helmet for no medical reason
whatsoever you can check out his DIY and
try to do it yourself yeah he was pretty
cool which one would you wear um which
are fame I'm actually kind of
disappointed there was no Darth Vader
one but i guess my son to stay like
totally legit or well hello lights i do
not get oh sorry the force is strong and
yeah so that's pretty cool now there is
another really cool dad now this is
something you might want to wear a
helmet for so it kind of ties into
product number one he created a rocker
for his child that looks like the
speeder in Star Wars so this is really
cool his name is Tess gelmiyor and he
also has a DIY up on YouTube I don't
know if you guys have seen it it's
really cool but look at this thing he
made it for a bank you'd be careful yes
I know be very careful but here's what I
like about it the most too is I'm just
kind of thinking of the full play
scenarios think about it you get pool
noodles pretend to be the trees that you
knock your babies off the speeder with
but not the baby off yes don't just say
you could simulate with pool noodles
swing by your baby DJ no teaching good
good things no this is great because you
know Star Wars doesn't have a lot of
good dads in it if you think of yeah you
know I'm looking at you Darth Vader not
a lot of good short is this is really
great oh yeah here's the DIA another DIY
video yes okay why video I did watch it
it is probably passed my skill set but
if you have the tools it definitely
seems like something you can make with
you know five or six tools if you have a
workshop like me the two of you that
have a workshop two of you watching your
credit
in real life you got this send us a
picture all right well that brings us
that brings us to our break right before
we come back with some really much
needed for yeah she's already Jenny's
knocked out r.i.p Ginny but we have a
break video for you and please be ready
because for this break video we're going
to need you to blow on your screen trust
me it'll be great and go
last one we're down one well this is the
worst episode tomorrow daily ever we
killed a duck anyway I promise the dog
is alive I just have this effect on
animals oh yeah winning uh so it is
Tuesday and you know what that means
whoo tacos got a huge had taco tuesday
no that means it is time for the new
releases of the week yeah
alright we got three of these suckers in
today some of you may be interested in
maybe some you won't be it's a real grab
bag I'm gonna I'm gonna read off some
information about each of them we're
gonna start off with American ultra
adhere to those yes I've heard of this
okay here's here's my synopsis jesse
eisenberg is a stoner / lacquer that
doesn't know he was trained by the CEA
to be CIA to be a lethal killing machine
when the agency targets him for
termination his former handler activates
his latent skills turning hit the
mild-mannered slacker into a deadly
weapon now the utterly surprised Mike
must use his newfound abilities to save
himself and his girlfriend is played by
Kristen Stewart so there's that well its
got the teen angst factor so I'm excited
I can't do nothing it's basically a
Bourne Identity meets a Seth Rogen movie
uh so big news is that it's got a
thirty-eight percent on rotten tomatoes
yeah crap well look you know what you're
getting into you go see this movie you
know exactly how you're going in to see
this right supposed to be intelligent
humours ladies and gentlemen appreciate
it for what it is but can I just say if
I am some sleeper cell feel free to wake
me up because that would be such a cool
way to discover your powers just saying
I would be scared of you I'm already
scared of you a little bit yeah yeah
yeah we don't we don't want me to get
powers chg woken up the animal kingdom
is united so we got the next one up is
hitman agent 47 and let me read this off
to you based on a somewhat kind of
popular video game franchise where you
mostly screw around killing people or
strangling them hitman agent 47 played
by Rupert Friend is the perfect
genetically engineered assassin who must
take down a corporation that plans to
unlock the secret of his engineering /
training to create an army of killers
more powerful than him and he teams up
and he teams up with a sexy young lady
also sake Zachary Quintos in it also he
must try to save this film franchise
series because the first one was
terrible alright well I mean they do
have some good names in there thankfully
they have some people who have already
done some pretty cool titles you know
heroes big shows like that so you know
maybe
finally got the cast down and this will
be the big break that this series needs
on film wow you are really are
supporting this one I mean you're like
you're playing on I really liked that
video game and since we don't have ER
and I can't immerse myself in it yet
right yet this is the next best thing
for all right a little bit of optimism I
like that Tiffany yeah alright because
the first one got a 14-percent around
you know what sorry maybe your brain its
River friends time he's got it gonna
leave believe in the hit man we believe
in Rupert Rupert team Rupert alright and
the last one that we have is sinister to
let me read the synopsis for you a woman
and her sons encounter the evil spirits
abigal and a house that's marked for
death that's all I've got but ghoul you
want to run that is but cool bug cool
all right well cool I don't know what
that every murder mystery that's it
always it's the scary girl person
monster thing in this series so it's in
city it's like its sinister to you know
what you're getting again this is comes
from a producer Jason Blum I don't know
if you know him yet the gift insidious a
purge paranormal activity so this is
what he does okay makes these movies
it'll these movies always make a trash
bag load full of money and this will be
no different so expect a lot of scares
yet a lot of twists I'm looking for
it'll be fun the twist is there's
nothing scary in it you just go and it's
hitman agent 47 team Rupert there we go
