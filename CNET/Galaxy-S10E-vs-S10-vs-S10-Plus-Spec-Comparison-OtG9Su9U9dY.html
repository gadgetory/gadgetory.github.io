Galaxy phones here's how to tell the s10
es10 and s10 Plus apart and decide which
ones right for you let's start with
price from least expensive to most
expensive the cheapest is the s10 each
starting at seven hundred and fifty
dollars in the u.s. in the middle is the
s10 at nine hundred dollars and the s10
plus starts at a thousand each of the
s10 phones shares a similar design the e
has a five point eight inch flat AMOLED
display compared to the edge-to-edge
amyloids on the other two phones the s10
is six point one inches while the
aptly-named plus has the largest screen
at six point four inches the bigger
phones also have a higher resolution
display than the s10 II all the phones
share their distinct hole-punch camera
at the front of the screen but the s10
plus adds a second front-facing camera
to capture depth information and all of
the phones come in the same colors pink
black blue or white in the US with a
green and yellow available elsewhere the
s10 plus adds an optional ceramic finish
in black or white
they all run Qualcomm's latest
snapdragon 855 chip our water-resistant
have wireless charging and can charge
any qi device like the galaxy buds from
the back of the phone for authentication
the s10 a sticks with a regular
fingerprint reader and facial
recognition but both the s10 and the S
tone plus have an ultrasonic fingerprint
reader embedded in the screen plus
facial recognition
the s10 II comes with 128 or 256
gigabytes of storage while the s10 and
Plus have either 128 or 512 gigabytes
there's also a one terabyte option on
the largest phone and if that's not
enough storage for you all of them have
a microSD slot as you might expect the
s10 II has the smallest capacity battery
at 3100 milliamp hour the s10 is in the
middle at 3400 and the s10 plus is the
biggest at 4100
let's talk cameras the s10 II has two
while the s10 NS 10-plus have three

the following two cameras number one is
an ultra wide-angle at 16 megapixels
with an aperture of f-22 number 2 is a
regular wide-angle at 12 megapixels with
optical image stabilization and a
variable aperture between F 1.5 and F
2.4 the third camera which is only on
the s10 and s 10 plus is a 2x zoom at 12
megapixels with an F 2.4 aperture and
optical image stabilization all have a
mode for capturing better low-light
photos called bright night plus
automatic scene detection and shot
suggestions to help you line up your
photos around the front they all share a
10 megapixel F 1.9 selfie camera the s
10 plus adds another 8 megapixel selfie
camera to capture depth information and
there's one more s10 phone to talk about
and that's the 5g model it will have a
six point seven inch screen a fourth
