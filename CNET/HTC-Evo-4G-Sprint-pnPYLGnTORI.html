editor at cnet.com and I've got your
first look at the much-anticipated HTC
EVO 4G for Sprint as many of you know
this is the first 4G smartphone
available in the US and that comes with
a lot of pressure does it deliver all
and all the hype well let's take a look
as far as the design the Evo is very
similar to the HTC hd2 it's actually a
bit bigger than the HD 2 but HTC still
manages to keep it relatively thin so
it's still pretty manageable plus you
might be willing to overlook the large
size when you get a glimpse of the
massive display measures 4.3 inches
diagonally and has a sharp WVGA
resolution so it's fantastic for viewing
webpages photos and reading text there's
even a handy kickstand on the back that
will let you prop the phone on a desk so
you can watch videos or slideshows
without having to hold the device in
your hand
the Evo is also relatively easy to use
and extremely customizable thanks to HTC
Sense senses HTC's custom skin for the
Android platform and it's always been
our favorite because it makes the OS
look less techy and actually enhances a
lot of the phone's core applications for
example in the phone app a tabbed menu
along the bottom lets you easily filter
through messages based on status
attachments group or meeting invite and
then also improves the standard Android
media player by bringing a nicer cover
flow like interface underneath sense the
Evo is running Android 2.1 which is
currently the most recent version of
android available so you're getting some
of the latest features like Google Maps
with navigation voice to text entry and
live wallpapers but if you're an Android
fan you know that Android 2.2 also known
as Froyo is coming soon
I asked sprint about whether they would
provide an update - Froyo when available
and they said they're not announcing
anything right now but what we should
focus on right now is the 4G
capabilities of the evo vivo is the
first phone to take advantage of
Sprint's WiMAX network which claims to
provide wireless speeds of up to 10
times faster than today's 3G average 3G
download speeds come in around 600
kilobits per second to 1.4 megabits per
second while 4G averages around 3
megabits per second to 6 megabits
per second Sprint's 4G isn't available
in New York's yet so I went down to
Philadelphia where they do have it to
put these claims to test and the Evo did
deliver I averaged around three point
four two megabits per second for
download speeds and upload speeds of 0.9
three megabits per second so it's on the
lower end of the spectrum but I also did
a 3G speed test to compare with 4G and I
was getting 0.77 megabits per second
down and zero point three point zero
point three five megabits per second up
so definitely a huge difference
the evil also comes with a number of
features that can take advantage of 4G
it's actually going to be the first to
ship with a YouTube high quality player
and also ships with a quick video chat
and a front-facing 1.3 megapixel camera
so you can make video calls
unfortunately our review unit didn't
come preloaded with the quick chat app
but we're hoping to check it out later
the Evo can also be used as mobile
hotspot and can connect up to eight
devices just be aware that this is going
to cost you an additional $30 per month
the civil silver lining there is that
there's no data cap there's a lot more
to this phone but the video would go on
forever if I try to cover it all overall
I'd say the Evo 4G is easily the best
smartphone that Sprint has to offer and
certainly one of the best Android phones
on the market it's packed with tons of
features and it's powerful and it does
deliver on the 4G promise I'm just
disappointed that they're launching it
with so few 4G markets currently
Sprint's WiMAX network is live in 32
cities and the carrier promises to bring
that up to that total up to 44 cities by
the end of the year including New York
San Francisco LA Cincinnati and Miami
I think the additional $10 for 4G is a
fair price but it's unfair to me to make
best add-on mandatory and they know a
lot of people have been unhappy about
this in the grand scheme of things for
in Stata plans are much less than its
competitors and there is no data cap
with a premium add-on but still if you
live in a 3d only market I can
understand why you'd be unhappy about
paying for something you're not actually
getting hopefully spring can really
start lighting up additional 4G markets
quickly so people can get their money's
worth and let the evo 4 do you really
live up to its full potential
the HTC EVO 4G will be available
starting June 4th for $1.99 99 with a
two-year contract I'm Bonnie tone this
has been your first look at the HTC EVO
4G</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
