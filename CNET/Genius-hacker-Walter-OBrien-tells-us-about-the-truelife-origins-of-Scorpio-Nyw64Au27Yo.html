expert who in his hacking days went by
the handle of scorpion but he's now
lending that handle and his past to the
creation of a new CBS primetime drama
Walter can you give me a little bit of
an idea of how the show got started sure
the company's been around 25 years and
we have a harvesting Department rather
than an HR department to harvest IQ from
the planet and they're getting a hot
it's getting harder and harder to find
more geniuses so we thought be a great
idea if we could tell our story maybe
have them find us and then CSI has been
on the air about ten years now and
they've influenced a lot of kids to
study chemistry and biology so if we can
do the same thing for kids studying
computer science or artificial
intelligence it'll be a huge benefit of
this country over the next eight years
O'Brien is one of the world's leading
experts when it comes to applying
computer science and artificial
intelligence to complex industry
challenges hacking to me is really just
a mentality it's one of your biohacking
a body or hacking a technology system
it's a way of thinking outside the box
of seeing what's not there of
questioning assumptions of going around
the obvious his first run-in with the
law happened at a young age just 13 when
he worked his way into NASA computers to
download Space Shuttle blueprints to
hang on his wall when I was 13 years old
there was a curious kid and I got on the
ARPANET before his called the Internet
and back then 1987 the coolest thing to
do was try and get any imagery any good
cool pictures on the computer he could
and I found an AutoCAD file on the
ARPANET that was very very large which
meant it was very complex so I managed
to piece together the file and it was
the blueprints to the spaceship Columbia
he was caught but after we helped them
to improve their security Homeland
Security looking for Walter O'Brien
scorpion the show follows the exploits
of a fictional Walter O'Brien as he goes
about creating what will become scorpion
computer services which in the real
world is a consulting firm with
thousands of employees technology runs
the world software runs technology and
sometimes software goes very very wrong
a minute which one is it and humans as
we call them have a 3% human error and a
lot of companies can't afford to be
wrong three percent at a time anymore so
we closed that 3% gap using some of the
technologies the AI we've developed that
doesn't make mistakes to compensate for
human error
you want to do something meaningful
here's your chance scorpion has
developed solutions for private firms
and government entities recently helping
to identify the suspects in the Boston
Marathon bombings
purely by analyzing security footage in
a rotate your cameras it's harder to
claim that you've stopped wars that
you've never heard of because you
stopped them so you're trying to prove a
negative but two things in the world in
general be a lot worse if there weren't
people are really really dedicated and
they don't sleep and they don't go home
till the problems fixed worries scorpion
premieres on September 22nd and while
episodes may take some liberties with
the truth Walter hopes the focus on tech
will be enough to inspire a new
generation of computer scientists my
name is Walter O'Brien and I'm a genius</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
