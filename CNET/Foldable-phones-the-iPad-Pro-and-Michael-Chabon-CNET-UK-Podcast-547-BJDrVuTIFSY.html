and hell maybe I'll even give up my
recipe for slow-cooked beef chili in
episode 5 for seven of the scene at UK
podcast hello and welcome to the show
joining me is of course rich hello how
are you just this one name like prints
oh that is actually my sin Satan yeah I
mean that's what I've always called you
but largely for other reasons good how
are you
yet very well thanks well looking
forward to talking about the the
foldable phone but but before we get
ahead of ourselves let's dive straight
into I know last week we talked a lot
about Apple and Samsung and I said next
week we won't talk about Apple and
Samsung so we are kicking off by talking
about Apple followed by Samsung I hope
that's okay I mean it's it's it's quite
rare that the Apple and Samsung both
sort of do something big it's just like
proper you know big tech giant's doing
interesting things and sometimes there's
a long wait for these things to happen I
mean if you like we could talk about the
new jet Xiaomi phones no that's not um
yeah I mean Apple had their iPhone
launch
yeah and shortly after had their iPad
and Mac launched both of those I had
quite interesting products so that is
why we are talking about them and the I
personally quite neglected I think the
effort has been neglected for quite a
while like they've had very kind of
incremental updates and but this time
around Apple are doing something quite
interesting so we have got the Refresh
of the iPad pro coming on to forms
twelve point nine inch and 11 inch but
both are identical other than the size
it's not like yeah you know like you're
not on some smartphones you know you buy
the smaller light version and what you
actually get is light Hardware you get a
pair down processor you get a crappy
camera one camera this is these are the
same cut the same hardware and that one
is this bigger which is interesting
yep but basically it's the iPad pro and
this is the first time we've really see
Apple I think moved towards
that what they think is the future of
computing these are if you excuse my
little burp these are proper competitors
to the MacBook Pro okay this isn't just
for casual computing anymore these are
high-end machines with the price to
match now come on to the price but
overall basically these are they're
bigger they're more powerful we've got
these narrow bezels with this refreshed
design which looks a bit more
we've got face ID on them now instead of
having the fingerprint scanner so that
screen stretches right to the edge
you've got face unlock but without the
notch so you get this fullscreen thing
that those 3d and you don't get no and
the phone has a notch yeah because
there's a little bit more room on the
tablet to kind of hide those scanners
basically around the edges
we've got USB see instead of lightning
which is interesting ditching its own
lightning standard the first they made
the first honestly to make about
lightning and again that's incredible
that's huge
it is huge but it brings it in line with
the MacBook Pro which I have here which
these also charge over USB see there's
no lightning on here well it brings them
very much in liners is if not
replacement products very much sit
synergists in synergism salinity lism um
cool they you know the downside is no
headphone jack ignore that got rid of
that obviously they have yeah so you can
use USB see headphones from any other
phone you can also Bluetooth and but
these are really these are powerful they
talked a lot about how powerful these
are for media for you can do 4k video
editing multi-channel 4k video anything
you can't you know you can't type but we
have the type cover of course like
another ones mmm but crucially now the
thing that really sticks out for me and
the reason I personally am so excited
about these is the fact that these are
the tablets on which we're going to see
full Adobe Photoshop for versions of
Adobe Photoshop right now we've got what
like Photoshop Express and we've got
Lightroom yeah both of which I do use on
the iPad and I love using Lightroom on
my tablet on location around they do
they say Andy Hoyle he loved
light room on the iPad it really does
but what I don't have is Photoshop if I
need to do any in-depth Photoshop work
on location I have to take my whole
MacBook with the charger and and it's
heavy and I take that as well as my iPad
this weighs quite a bit in a kit bag
when I'm also carrying tens of thousands
of pounds of photography equipment and
this however now I could use full-fat
Photoshop using touch controls using the
new Apple pencil because they've updated
the pencil in hand magnetizes to the
edge nice and charges inductively which
is so much better than the stupid way of
shoving it into the charging port where
it yea sticks out like a lollipop that's
crazy
which was bonkers so these are really
interesting and certainly as I say are
very much aimed towards MacBook Pro
users people who like professional
creatives like me I'm a professional
photographer that's what I do patina as
long as we've posting this podcast and
annoying you I I do a lot of photography
do something else I do that too does
seem to take up a quite a bit of your
time and that's what you kind of cool do
you think that you could work full time
on it on a tablet I don't know but I
know I know what you mean I can see that
you're excited about Photoshop but I
mean I I'm a huge comic book fan I like
to draw and procreate on the iPad pro
something that comic art has been
talking about for long time there was
when the first iPad pro came along and
there were a lot of comic artists going
well maybe I'll try it out you know I'm
looking to tempt me from my Wacom Cintiq
and then more and more of them were
going this is incredible and then people
are starting to say well I've just done
a whole page of proper proper
professional comics on great on the iPad
pro and that was before you know we've
got this even more improved even more
powerful version so it's because you
already navigate your Mac using it you
use a graphics tablet okay work which is
normally something that is as its name
suggests is for graphics
professionals yeah yeah I prefer that to
a mouse yeah I always have no I think I
just find it easier I just find like
using a graphics tablet is I think it's
because you kind of you can type and you
can sort of pick up yeah you know you've
got the the pen on the graphics tablet
and you're like touching on the tablet
and it just seems quicker and it seems
more mobile rather than just kind of
like
moving the little movements with your
hands and doing the little clicks with
the most I don't like using a mouse I've
never liked using your mouse and I'm off
using a graphics tablet tablet is it use
it's just like a Wacom Bamboo one a
little fun like the entry-level yeah the
really basic ones and sort of like a kid
one set so it's not a drawing on the
screen or anything now it's drawing on
the tablet but yeah so I've never I've
never really liked mouse mouse is but I
saw I can sort of see the iPad thing but
I don't know if it feels like a sort of
a psychological barrier more than
anything else to sort of think that
maybe could be I am so excited this for
me genuinely without any kind of
hyperbole this could be for me
absolutely revolutionary this this
because this would allow me I've done
before when the first iPad pro camera I
did a I did a story for seeing it where
I I spent a week working on it doing as
much of my actual salaried job on the
iPad as I can and I could do 95% of it
but it was when I got into kind of the
deeper levels of photo production that I
started to realize like AI actually
can't do there so at the time when it
first came out it wouldn't really work
with RAW files and certainly in terms of
using layers and Photoshop there was no
way of doing that and now and I was
constant when they talked about oh
they'll be full fat Photoshop on iPod I
thought okay that's fine but only
probably it still probably gonna work
for basic photo adjustments because the
demands of working with like very high
res images if you've got 50 layers on
the gutter and stuff is the iPad so
they're gonna cut it this well you think
about is like what I was going to was
because at the demo on stage they showed
what looked like an insanely high
resolution sort of looked like a merger
gene like 3d CGI and photography and it
was it looked like about a hundred
layers deep and the resolution was
massive they're going right in there
making real-time adjustments there's no
lag no delay everything on there is
optimized completely to work on the iPad
and with that software I use Lightroom
on my Mac and I like every other
Lightroom user I'm constantly frustrated
about how slow and laggy it is it's
bogged down switching between the
library module them to develop module is
like takes seconds and seconds and
things well
load into focus in quite the same way
Photoshop is better but the idea of
having that working so well on a
completely touchscreen interface that is
optimized to work with that is
incredible
now that's sound cool but you know one
note of caution can you trust the demo
because you know what they might have
done my Photoshop did no they might
Photoshop a demo shot the Photoshop demo
you know the other downside with this of
course is the price and that is where it
becomes very clear that they are
pitching this is a MacBook Pro
alternative okay I'm ready go and hit me
so it starts yeah the twelve point nine
starts at nine six nine just under a
thousand pounds but that is only with 64
gigabytes of storage if you're using
this all row work you're gonna be full
of exactly I I could not work with that
at all that one terabyte version of the
top model is one thousand seven hundred
and nineteen pounds Wi-Fi only now if
you ads then the Apple pencil which of
course is a expensive extra and the
keyboard case which you would also
probably need an azure G so that brings
that total price to two thousand one
hundred and eighty seven pounds we are
firmly in MacBook Pro territory here
very very much so I mean I'd say I'm not
defending that at all because that is an
absolutely eye watering amount of money
but let but it's good you've got to stay
light and the form factor of an iPad
with a terabyte of storage in it it's
and and running Photoshop it's I mean
that's an impressive piece of
engineering
it absolutely is that's whether it's
worth like you know that's four three
three months rent or no that's only
three months run for you man you've got
good rent I wish I was trying to I was
trying to like you know sort of like
connect with the plebs out in Oh outside
of London yeah
wow those guys rent there's no there's
certainly no question it like I'm not
saying this is so what I'm saying
basically this is no question a lot of
money that is 2100 man is a lot of money
but I'm not saying it's too much money
it actually for what you're getting it
seems like a that's okay you you would
pay you would invest that much money in
what would be a really good tool to work
with because well I going back to like
if you're if you are a professional
photographer working with a lot of
clients
one of the things that this would allow
you to do having full Photoshop if you
go to a client meeting and you're
showing the results of a photo shoot and
the post-production you've done in there
instead of them sort of giving you notes
on that yeah we like that maybe you
could have this and maybe we could sort
of change the color balance on this and
do this
you don't go away in and send them back
this stuff this is work that you can do
live in real time with them I mean yeah
you could take your MacBook but you can
show them on this amazing screen like
you don't want to be in a meeting with
with some client poking and prodding at
your photos that you can fortunately
that is a reality for a lot of a lot of
pros in there and I think that was
actually a genuinely a good use case of
what you could do absolutely having the
power to do that very quickly and easily
there and show people I think that just
makes the the iPad better than ever what
it fair enough I mean I think the key
thing about about the price really is
that you know like you say this is
MacBook Pro territory for the first time
they've made a device that you could
have instead of a MacBook Pro like up
until now the iPad has always been a
thing that you have as well as your
laptop and in that case two thousand
quid for a laptop and two thousand quid
for a nightmare it's just crazy but if
you're reaching the point where you
don't buy the laptop you just get the
iPad yeah then it's also been in your
media consumption device in an evening
it's your TV if you're in a hotel and
say oh it's great so actually if you
work it in those terms it's not that
expensive and of course you don't have
to have the one terabyte one there is a
512 gig one which makes it a little bit
more affordable but for me like it's
definitely really exciting but but so
much of my excitement really does boil
down to Photoshop it's down to Adobe's
app rather than the iPad itself the iPad
is just the vehicle for that as it is
for anything but really for me it's
about that Photoshop and I don't think
that's going to be on it will be
available on other iPads how well it
runs I don't know I'm not sure if it's
gonna be coming out on Android on
Android tablets because well that's it I
mean what about Android tablets like
they've always been the the poor
relation over they have and that is and
that is still very much the case there's
a lot less excitement around them
Samsung still does have some and
crucially Google launched at when it
launched the pixel 3 it launched the
Google pixel slate which is effectively
their answer to the iPad pro it is has
not androids actually Chrome OS okay
rather than Android is different it may
basically more of a office tool in many
ways it's kind of geared towards you
know using Chrome using Google Docs
that's the other thing and in which case
I they have versions going from like a
basic Intel Celeron processor which I
think starts at I'm not sure about I
think 500 pounds fish going through to a
very powerful Intel Core i7 processor
with a gig of ram or sadena thing and
that's like 1,500 pounds a lot more
expensive yeah and a lot of people said
like well what's the given its Chrome OS
and they those very intense apps like
Photoshop and not available on there
what's the point of having such high
powered hardware if it's basically a
consumption device for YouTube and
Google Docs then the basic tablet will
do that really well which is an argument
I see I have not used the pixel slight
crucially I'm getting one on Monday or
Tuesday next week I think and I'm really
looking forward to seeing how that we
should revisit this yeah I'm gonna be
revisiting this I'm gonna use it
hopefully I'm going to be using both for
at least a week at a time exclusively
and I'm gonna be able to kind of talk
about what actually is like to work cuz
I do a bit of everything from word
processing writing stories the photo
production a little bit of video here
and there although our extra talented
producer behind the camera over there as
a one who you'll really see doing a
video work so but I think we'll never
see him you'll never see him do anything
unless he wants to walk into frame now
which you're welcome to do JC Kyle I
give my wave but it's a good I think I
think I could give them a good workout
generally you know for things and I mean
you need to do some spreadsheets and
stuff just to you know pretend like
you're an accountant or I'm gonna work
on the Henderson account rich niggas on
my desk by the end of the day otherwise
you need yesterday of course it wasn't
just the iPad there Apple has been
talking about though yeah we also had
some long overdue updates the MacBook
Air and okay has really been the
Forgotten child of Apple for several
years now I think they've had at best a
couple of like basic processor upgrades
when Intel really good I mean that's the
thing about the MacBook Air it's just
pretty it's a lightweight laptop they're
just I mean there's this one right here
right now I've had this for a while this
is fantastic
you use really well and and it is but
the problem is that Apple has been kind
of like upgrading the models on either
side so since the MacBook Air launched
they also then launched the MacBook you
know that this standard very very thin
and light one which for people who just
do you know like office work word
processing web browsing that sort of
thing that the MacBook is brilliant for
that and then if you want to do more
people go for the MacBook Pro which is
why the air is kind of falling into this
middle ground the middle child forgotten
middle child that hasn't really had the
love and attention but Apple is of
coming now and it's it's beefed up the
processes of course and it's thrown in a
Retina display with with narrower bezels
which again the Retina displays been out
in max for so long and the MacBook Air
is only just getting it now and also
fingerprint and lock so it's I do like
that that's got that's pretty cool
III love using on my pro but it needs it
is it just seems a little bit like yeah
we're giving it the basic upgrades that
it needs it still kind of seems like the
MacBook Air isn't really a priority for
Apple it's just it's bringing it kicking
and screaming into today's market but I
don't really think it's much of a
priority it's very clear where their
emphasis is and that's in the iPad hmm
even the iPad even the MacBook Pro
doesn't really seem to be like a huge
deal for Apple its innovation is going
into the into the iPad so I'm so excited
to see what happens there I've also AM
the Mac Mini which is even more
forgotten about than the air Wow I'd
even forgotten that was the thing
actually I thought about getting one of
those recently and I looked and they're
still really expensive for something
that's so out of date yeah for something
that is it you know desktop you can't
take it with you you can't it stays at
your TV your monitor are there yeah yeah
they are quite expensive and they still
up they still are they even new on it
they start at 1099 pounds I mean that's
not very many is it no it's not very
many I and I and I kind of think that's
a mistake I think they would do really
well and having a really stripped back
version was about four hundred quid yeah
that's that's what I wanted I mean that
was well for something that gives you
kind of Mac OS you can use iCloud and do
the essentials and is a lot less than a
grand and spending that much and again
you probably you probably got
more demanding needs yeah that said
they've packed them with new processes
better faster RAM and I think was not
sure if his discrete graphics in there
but either way graphics capable enough
to handle some games and photo and video
productions so okay yeah maybe maybe
we'll get a Mac come in again give it to
our producer see what you make of it
he's not they're not looking happy about
it now as the killer design see how that
goes well so that's Apple that's some
interesting new stuff from Apple yes I
think you should move on to Samsung sure
what Samsung been up to well samsung has
yet again shown off a foldable phone hmm
right a phone that will display that can
fold up holding ham is it like an
intended yes it's almost like a Nintendo
DS or maybe like a Bible except that the
screener bigs are available books are
available
yeah the August catalog for the VDS has
two screens with joined with a hinge
whereas this is one screen that folds is
it though isn't it two screens or is
there a second skin on the outside
second screen on the outside right got
it so what happens is basically this the
idea is that this when it's closed use
the outside screen to see basic
information it works kind of like a
regular smartphone yeah exactly but when
you want it to be when you want when you
want to tablet you open it up and inside
is a bigger display pretty cool is a
really cool idea and we've seen concepts
from Samsung since I think 2013 2012
maybe when they first started showing
these things off in CES yeah and we've
seen concepts from LG and various other
companies where oh yeah we've got Visia
spikes a ball screen so like we know the
tech is there but it's never really come
to anything but Samsung has actually
said this is real and according to
Justin Dennison who is and reading his
notes Samsung's senior vice presidents
of mobile marketing said he will be
mass-produced in the coming months and
that's pretty interesting because these
have just been proof of concept and
nothing more
and the demo that they showed was also
like it kind of like someone standing in
the dark
with a case on the thing I mean did
people as you get their hands on the
nose so as far as I know no no one's
really kind of done anything it's very
much what we what we saw is the proof of
concept it's still not the finished
phone but we know a lot more about it we
knew do know that it's coming so DJ cozy
EO of Samsung's mo our business actually
told there's an interview last month
that you'll be able to use the device as
a tablet with multitasking capability
before being able to follow it up into a
more portable phone now we saw at the
Samsung's event this week we saw a demo
of Flipboard which is like the news sort
of magazine style yemm's app you see on
the outside of the phone the basic quick
access panels so you know for like quick
news and that sort of thing
and when you fold it out and you get the
full magazine style Flipboard experience
that's a really good idea I think that's
really interesting but I do you think
it's a gimmick I don't think it's a
gimmick I mean I one thing about that is
that is that whenever we go down these
kind of like alternative form factor
routes there's always going to be a time
when there are apps that just don't work
yeah because you know the app makers the
great thing about them you know for
example iOS or you know some versions of
Android is the great thing about that is
that app developers just make one
version of the app yeah it just works on
every device yeah and it's when you
start getting like different form
factors and stuff that they've got to
start making two versions yeah happen
like are they going to bother making a
version for an app if Samsung only sold
three and a half of these and that's
always in the case with Samsung and
Android at large they're all
fragmentation issues I've got a
optimized one app for screens that can
vary from four point five to eight
inches exactly yeah which is very
difficult I guess I don't think it's
given though I think generally it's a
great day it's obviously it I think it's
gonna happen and it's clearly I mean
like the the benefits are obvious of
being able to fold your phone up and i'm
een i'm gonna call it right now i said
you know digital tablecloth you know you
pull out you pull out your phone and you
like you look at your email and stuff
and then you go you know what i want to
watch a movie or something just like
throw it out and it goes straight over
the table and you've got the whole table
sized thing and you can you just you
watch your movie on the table that would
be good yeah the CEO said that this
excuse me will not be a gimmick product
and that would disappear after six to
nine months after it's delivered i mean
he says that though how'd it
what about the I mean the edge was there
kind of previous sort of attempt at
doing something very different and
everyone was excited about you know
phones with with curved edges and
they're still here it's still we should
have every fall of Samsung's current
phones have their most high-end Android
phones the huawei mate 20 probe there's
Garr they're all doing
they've all got maybe maybe the edges
aren't active like Samsung's you know
Samsung actually has software that takes
advantage of that edge sure but most of
them do you have that rounded as a
design trend at the very least those
rounded edges of the screen are still
there but something has been very big on
gimmicks in the past like we have had
they've done like curved banana phones
when you know and curved phones yeah I
think 3d phones it had the camera phones
like we've had the Samsung Galaxy camera
or the K zoom weather like how people
want a really good camera so why don't
we basically get one of our actual
compact digital cameras which is massive
and sort of give it basic Android
functionality and an idea that in theory
is kind of cool but in reality is you
don't want to carry around this gigantic
camera as your phone all the time and so
something has very much been known to
throw out the gimmicks and see what
lands see what works in a way that there
never has mud at the wall something's
gonna stick you know that's kind of why
Samsung has very often being sort of the
antithesis of Apple and will do the one
product and it will do it well something
is a little bit more scattergun it will
try these concepts it will put them out
it will look it's been very often known
to launch things only in certain markets
sometimes only ins in South Korea its
home market see what the market says and
then give it a go and that's kind of the
issue that it has with this because you
talked about like developers like well
I'll develop this is something that's
going to rely on developers getting on
board and making apps making software
it's going to take advantage of it but
are they going to be keen if this is
something that some some kind of ditches
after yeah right up for its first cycle
are we going to have a Samsung foldy
phone 2 and a 2 s and whatever I think
they're going to be careful about is is
if they're the first ones in I mean it's
all too playful because this is a brand
new marketing they're the first ones in
then they might clean up the market I
mean you could argue that's kind of
Apple did with the iPad
yeah the words I was before that but
they were the first kind of major one
that capture the market and I think it
sounds like we want to be doing the same
but they don't want to go in too early I
feel like 3d was kind of undercooked
when that started very much so 3d TVs 3d
phones all that kind of stuff and you
know a lot of people went in early and
went in hard and took a bit of a bath on
the whole thing and yeah yeah exactly
something's got to be careful I mean I
think when this does happen it's gonna
be really cool yeah it could be that
it's a few generations away yeah yeah
I'm not sure it's gonna necessarily be
there because we I mean we we call the
note a gimmick we're not first launch
off its massive phone it's a phone half
tablet how ridiculous and that's kind of
laughable looking back now as a son of a
success and of the note line and how all
phones are bigger even yo notice now so
that is what I know a gimmick of theirs
which it's duck that they threw them out
of the wall and that time I did stick
you know it may well be that this is the
case so as I say we what we saw isn't
the final version what we've heard about
it's gonna presumably have some
refinements hopefully tie the industrial
design as it looked a little bit blocky
looked almost like it was in a test case
basically it's quite possible then that
we will see something at CES in January
or possibly even at Mobile World
Congress in February I think it's
crossed now the thing is I think it can
be interesting about that timing though
is there MWC in February or around that
time is when Samsung launches its
flagship S series live es9 yeah
this year we do to have the s10 now that
should be a bit of a milestone phone for
Samson particularly when the preview of
the previous s9 and si have been kind of
they've done fine they've done okay they
have not been big sellers for Samsung
because people aren't really excited
about some of the stuff that something's
doing so I think it's been really
interesting to see whether they launched
an s10 which is a generally just very
good high-end phone and they launched a
foldable phone in the same rough time
period running the risk of overshadowing
the excitement of the s9 or the sari
more the s10 is the folding phone and
they go all in on the new tech and the
there and their new
mass-produced flagship phone is this new
foldable show thing because
that that would be its plane that is all
in in poker isn't it that is all your
chips playing them all at once
no powder is dry yeah everything in big
I went to call them and know when to
fold them absolutely better at words
than I am so I think it's gonna be
really interesting time period slink
Samson could end up if it if it goes the
to phone option then it could end up
stealing a lot of excitement from its
own flagship hmm which may not be
something it wants to do know we'll
check back in the new year yes
absolutely so I think I probably enough
of phones and tech for a little while
something we should move on to well see
beam up to you Pardo well I'm glad you
said it in such a lovely way because
last episode and I was if you remember
gearing up for Red Dead Redemption to
right yeah now I had planned this lovely
weekend and I'm gonna tell you a little
bit about it rich cuz shove it I'm gonna
set the scene so I had booked Friday and
Monday off work officially and so I had
a good four days of playing the Red Dead
I've sat at my house I bought in
American beers Goose Island IPAs because
they're the only ones I could find that
were actually made in the US in
Morrison's
I had slow-cooked a beef chili twelve
hours slow cook well oh my god it was so
good I also made cornbread which is
apparently quite traditional to have
with the chili sure
I was delicious and yeah I sat down and
I played the game and I've never played
Red Dead Redemption before I didn't play
the first one and I'd heard a lot about
it and I'd be told I'd really like it
because I like Kraft auto v which is the
same producers mm-hmm and I really liked
that game I loved the story the plot I
loved how the game kind of pans out so I
was really excited to go all-in on Red
Dead 2 is apparently like an insane
milestone in gaming of like the
technical achievements that they've done
and I found out myself of that is true
yes so this is a video game set in a
western world it's an open-world yeah
storyline wise it's a prequel to read
dead one it is it comes before John
Marston does all these stuff and it but
it is still is set in the same world it
is the Old West of America kind of as
the Old West is coming to an end
and you know modern America as we know
it is sort of starting to yet to take
hold so it is it if a storyline is
interesting I'm not going to give any
spoilers but it's an interesting
gripping storyline I've really enjoyed
playing for it I'm nowhere near finished
but it's all the aside stuff that just
makes this game immense and even if
you're not fancying doing the storyline
there are so many other side quest so
many other things you can do you can
just bugger off and go fishing you can
look after your horse and it's his the
world itself is absolutely enormous it
takes ages to get around because it's so
big I genuinely know you can just spend
half an hour trying to get to your next
mission that sounds absolutely terrible
that just why would you want it can you
fast forward can you make your horse
there is your horse can go reasonably
fast and there are sort of fast travel
options you can take trains and stuff
but for the most part like it's just
really so you have to commute this is a
video game where you you know you you
you relax you take a few days off work
to relax and enjoy some mindless
violence and what are you end up doing
you end up commuting and having to eat
and find food and skin animals and it's
just it's just work differently well
it's escapism because you're working in
was amazingly produced landscape I don't
beautiful it is already a stunning part
of the world's that whole area anyway
and is it's so well rendered and it's
pushing the graphics capabilities beyond
what we currently have and so really
does just look stunning
everything about it right again the
storyline the voice acting the just the
dynamics within the game everything you
do you know even down to things that
seemed a flight when if you're if you
accidentally kill your horse hmm it's
dead it's permanently dead it's not like
oh you've been working on building up
this horses stats and it's bond with you
and all this stuff so you know if it
accidentally falls off a cliff and dies
go to the stable and it'll be there
waiting for you know it's dead he's
fully dead and like that it really does
change things for you cuz when the first
time that happened I didn't realize that
would be the case and so when I then got
a new horse that again I had to buy
start from scratch to build up but it
really starts to mean something to you
really feel committed okay so what is
your doing and you're on you're more
careful like everything matters hmm it's
really it's it's really well done though
the reviews
possible it have been stellar like it
was his fives but I mean that's funny
you say it because the only thing I've
really seen from not being much a gamer
I just kind of picked up on Twitter a
lot of videos of horses running into
things
oh yeah there's a lot of a lot of that
yes just horses running into other
horses yeah well she's running into
rocks yeah she's running off cliffs but
might yeah mine run off a cliff with me
on it and I was unscathed my horse was
not yeah I know I think I think maybe I
landed on the horse really took the
brunt of that over that fall and now
that horse is dead
for good I hope you're happy with
yourself yep but I replace you with Mary
Poppins so I've got Mary Poppins is my
and also it's married couples be fair is
a better horse because I got this I got
my new horse later in the game or I had
access to better quality stables and so
it actually came at a time when I wanted
to upgrade anyway and and now when I
walk around loads people compliment my
horse in the street like what a fine
all-day thing it's kind of like in
granted or somewheres if you when you
get like a Lambo or some equivalent and
we drive it around someone will say like
cool car or something it's the Lambo of
horses it is the Lambo it is a supercar
of horses and I'm really glad to be on
it and you can drift the horse really
yeah you can't actually drift the holes
so there you go that's right that's kind
of late a little bit you know over an
overview it's not a full review because
we don't review games but it does and he
looks great so I think I said last time
like I I play I've got a cello
it's a 4k HDR OLED TV so like it which
is fully enabled to play that game
because it's 4k enabled to HDR enable
and it just looks stunning online TV it
just looks amazing so it's worth if you
have never played one before or if you
have done play it if you've got the
right TV and you know you can really
enjoy all those details then then do
because absolutely is superb and if you
are a fan of games then check out games
Broadcom our sister site I'm not a huge
gaming guy but I do love westerns so I
was kind of excited by this but then I
heard the business about you have to
ride your horse everywhere and it takes
your ideas to get places so I'm kind of
yeah it's like it's it's slow-paced in
that in that
there's a lot of time spent between
things and that has actually put a lot
of people off but mmm it does kind of
work because it again it feels like
you're really part of that world you
have you have a good way it's not just
constant you have the good and the bad
and the ugly
yeah with a fistful of dead horses yeah
it sounds good I mean like I said I'm a
big fan of Western so I'm quite excited
to see westerns being you know kind of
having having their moment in the
spotlight that's that's that's pretty
cool Deadwood it they're making a movie
of Deadwood alley yeah they are yeah
that's just started filming I don't
Balladur Buster Scruggs will be on
Netflix next week that's the new Coen
Brothers movie that's a Western
anthology yeah which is kind of fun very
lightweight very frothy but it's boots
fun so yes Boardwalk Empire at all
Western II or is it in that era
no no that's in the that's in the
twenties I was like Prohibition era
prohibition area okay I've never seen it
which is now plainly clear it's I mean
it's very good it's kind of from a
similar people who worked on Deadwood
he's very very good but it's not Western
would you recommend I watch it very much
so I love bored okay bye yeah I'm gonna
go yeah thanks look all right cool
well yeah look out for look out for
Ballad of Buster Scruggs next week as
well yeah while we're on topics of me
actually having watched things cuz
normally as regular Sanders will know I
haven't really watched any anything TV
or films many but I have been binge
watching Gotham cool which is great
that's all I'll say I know I'm really
late to it so you know it's not like I'm
oh I found this little thing that you
may not have heard of I know it's a big
deal and I'm very late but is good and
I'm enjoying it it's crazy and it's a
lot of fun Gotham yeah yeah yeah another
another show another TV show that that
is that I'm a big fan of his Star Trek
discovery now the first season was
earlier in the year and the second
season starts in January
okay but in between they are doing these
things called short tracks which are a
little kind of online mini episodes like
a little hike yeah a little hike through
the Star Trek universe little hike
through space a little little little
sojourn to the final frontier the that
unfortunately you can't see that in
Europe they're working on getting these
into other places if you're in the US or
Canada you can see it on CBS all access
which is CBS is streaming service
see this apparent company you can't no
you can see Star Trek Discovery on
Netflix everywhere in the world which is
lovely but you can't see the short
tricks what are we doing before I
criticize too much again my our parent
company I'm gonna have to say I'm gonna
have to be honest and say that is
bonkers it's it is frustrating for Star
Trek fans I mean the thing is so far
they're bit they're kind of like their
little the mini episodes they're kind of
little asides the most recent one though
is kind of inching the reason I brought
this up is it's it's set on the
discovery but the discovery it's been
abandoned mysteriously and we don't know
why the crew is missing and the
Discovery's computer is just holding the
ship there in space waiting and a new
character comes along and has a little
adventure on this government to people
they just wake up on this there's one
person who wakes up and then there's
also the ship's computer is that not mmm
now I haven't seen this film but is that
not um not interstellar maybe
interstellar the wrong with Chris Pratt
passengers passengers is that not is
that not past it well it's certainly to
have someone wake up alone on a ship is
kind of a a sci-fi trope certain
something you might see in red dwarf and
you might see in passengers and stuff at
that and this is kind of a track taken
it but the reason it's interesting the
reason we think is interesting way is
because it was written by the
best-selling author Michael Chabon who
is the guy who wrote The Adventures of
Kavalier and clay and Wonder Boys and
the yudish policeman's Union and lots of
other very heavy weight literary novels
and he's kind of nothing like I know
yeah he's he's he's a big champion of
genre fiction he's he's kind of into
sci-fi and horror and comics and that
kind of thing he he's kind of more and
more writing short stories and novels
that have kind of become more and more
sci-fi as he's as his career is kind of
progressed and so now he is in the
writers room of a new TV show being
developed in the Star Trek universe
which will feature the return of Captain
jean-luc Picard Oh to be played once
again by Patrick Stewart and they're not
doing like an earlier version likely to
do some of the Star Trek films where
they get like young hmm they're not know
I mean I think it would be quite cool
I'd love to see Tom Hardy come back and
play but Captain Picard again he played
like a clone of Captain Picard in one of
the movies pretty cool um he he might be
I don't know I think he might be a bit
maybe he's a bit kind of out of their
price range now I don't know but but
yeah Patrick Stewart's back and Michael
che when he's working on it and he also
wrote this short episode but it was
I had an instinct chat with him about
Star Trek and where Star Trek is
relevant nowadays and how much fun he
had nerding out so we're gonna listen to
a little clip of that him I think any
Star Trek writer any writing any Star
Trek show in the history of Star Trek
may be absolutely after the original
series had a responsibility and r32 arm
to consider Shannon - to be aware of
cannon to know you cannon on TV no sense
of responsibility to it you know all of
those things for me is probably cue for
a lot of miners and weird undercover
there's nobody even me like that's all
incredible pleasure for me so I got you
to sort of have like a litany excuse and
get please - move out completely the
Freak the breach of the treaty between
the Federation and the Romulans in 20 to
35 or whatever it is you know like the -
to have to like you know can have to
know to have to master the lore of Star
Trek in order to do your job is like
that's like if that's one of the reasons
I want to do it that's when the
pleasures I get out of doing but at the
same time and I think this has been true
in the history of Star Trek um from the
one from the moment the next generation
came on air you know it this is true oh
when you're dealing with any kind of
candor mrs. drew or any kind of fan
fiction as well it's not only the whole
you're always gaps or cracks or
contradictions there are things that got
left out their histories that we never
got to hear with the explanation of
people are looting in Cannon and they
don't give any further explanations I
mean maybe the greatest example in all
cannon ever is the giant rat of Sumatra
from Sherlock Holmes in other areas some
vision into this cases the giant that
Sumatra and it's the among the stories
and fans and one
ever since I'd like to try to come up
with more possible explanations for that
no you don't get I think it's important
not just if you can manage the barriers
as a wall as a perimeter brought beyond
that you can't go as a kind of grid that
you're sort of trapped on it's also you
try to find your way around it you try
to find the loopholes you find the empty
areas you find the good things but what
Canon doesn't seem to have anything to
say and you see and you say it if you're
really lucky in it to be working on
subjective and what you say becomes can
in itself I must be quite exciting for
them because Star Trek is one of those
genres one of the what not jhana is one
of those properties that hmm that
fluctuates massively sort of depending
on what it is that you're saying and I
mean was there this the space to joke
that every odd-numbered Star Trek movie
is bad yeah so I think it would be quite
excited to have someone who's of such
high esteem in the literary world
actually being part of that that writing
process I think definitely and there's
always been something kind of quite
high-minded about Star Trek I would say
I mean the you know my crochet buddy
made in this into you which is online
you can read it now if you just search
CNET for Star Trek discovery or Michael
Schaben and he made the excellent point
that Star Trek has always been about
tolerance and egalitarianism and I sort
of utopian view of the future and he
points out that dystopian sci-fi is a
little bit cliched at the moment partly
because we are living in a dystopian
sci-fi world so it's quite it so you
know there's the Star Trek will always
be important in because it does have
that really you know powerful message of
hope and tolerance and equality and
peace and thinking our way out of our
problems and and and so it's it's yeah
it is great to see that kind of
continued and that's kind of one of
these things exciting that Captain
Picard because he is kind of like the
exemplar of that so it's good to see
that character coming back and we didn't
tell us much about the details of show
because their kilts still kind of keep
it on the list of working it out as far
as we can tell okay and but yeah we're
looking forward to that so that's show
coming up soon but you will be able to
get discovery season 1 on blu-ray this
month in fact and season 2 will be back
in January so look out for that I'm a
big fan it's gosh I wasn't sure about it
first
but it kind of I realized what they were
trying to do and I thought it was really
good by the end well I've seen no Star
Trek's almost at all with the exception
I went to the premiere of is it into
darkness really well the one with the
worst one is it yeah the one that had
cucumber patch in it yeah yes the baddie
you you were there for the worst one
well done okay I'm going mad something
you said before yeah is is that really
the case that what is Michael Chabon
know here we're talking about the old
some honey yes yes Tom Hardy played
young he did he played so you may
remember the movie Star Trek nemesis the
other worst one of all the worst ones
out of the were Star Trek's it was the
it was like the most action-oriented
start of the next generation movie and
it wasn't great but he played a young
Romulan clone of Captain Picard it was
one of his first major roles and he was
very very good in it so they're
suggesting that Tom Hardy is going to
grow up into Patrick steal it maybe
that's who he becomes maybe maybe him
down a little bit I think he might have
had a nose I think him over a false nose
you know because Tom Hardy he usually
has to put on a voice but I thinking
this one he put on the nose was anything
else no that's it I'm out walking is on
Netflix tomorrow I think we talked about
that the other week it wants to be like
Braveheart it's not quite as good at
Braveheart some of it is Scottish it's
but it's incredibly Scottish it's Chris
Chris Pine
Captain Kirk from the the reboot of Star
Trek movies about being being Scottish
she's being Scotty and Scottish he's not
Scottish
he is from like I don't know Scottish
actor and is so lacking an act
apparently they had to bring in an
America well this I think it's a lot
like Braveheart in that it's the the
famous American guy what Mel Gibson was
a famous Australian guy but it's the
famous American guy playing the King and
then every other Scottish actor ever
like you will recognize every single
person in it from like you know all the
telly
prime suspect and my prime suspect that
target yeah tiger other yeah Bergerac
and other
relevant contemporary timely pop-culture
references how-do-you-do fellow kids as
I like how father Ted used every single
Irish comedian like if you were an Irish
comedian on the circuit and you haven't
appeared in my entire day you were
obviously like what had gone wrong yeah
exactly so there's a lot like all the
Scottish guys are in it it's it's kind
of fun it's it's just like the new
Braveheart it's yeah without so I needed
a Braveheart because yeah because
because we can't really enjoy Mel Gibson
anymore so yeah this is like the
Braveheart that it's you're allowed to
like maybe that's what Netflix did it
that's what it is really they wanted to
buy net Braveheart I like deal let's
just make our own that's just even
better I mean if you like if you if you
like gone do be found the Scottish
Highlands there's lots of there's lots
of locks yeah but I just had to go there
I don't need to sit at home watching it
I can just go because it's only two it's
only like a 12 hour drive from here easy
to do cool rich I think that probably
