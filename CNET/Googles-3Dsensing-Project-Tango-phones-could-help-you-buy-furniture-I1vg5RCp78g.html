recent applications for project tango
this effort started about three years
ago trying to push new hardware and new
software for mobile devices to explore
giving them the ability to understand
the physical space and physical movement
of a person Lowe's is one of the app
partners that are building enough with
this and what they do is they have a
fairly large 3d catalog of all the
appliances that they have in store so if
we wanted to buy extend our kitchen
counter with some appliances we can look
at we can use this landing pad on the
ground and say well let me let me see
what a stove looks like right here and
it loads up a physically accurately
sized model of a stove right in place
and if I want to I can look at the
different knobs and counters I can look
at the options on the back of the stove
and you can see it's about the right
height relative to the counter so the
nice thing about is that this allows you
to shop for products by physical size
Wayfair is another online retailer
furniture I think they're one of the
largest online retailers of furniture
and using the same basic concept we have
this small living room here with chairs
and this end table if we want to figure
out well we want to new a new item here
let's figure out like what options we
have we have a small catalog here let's
try this sparse stool and what it does
it loads a 3d model and then we can
place the bar stool on the ground it
allows a 3d model unfolds the box and
actually it puts it on the floor and
again you can see you know physically
correct dimensions of the barstool and
you can check the size check the size of
the seat and get up close to it if you
want to you can push the Buy button and
it'll take you to the main way for our
application and actually put it in your
shopping cart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
