it probably won't look quite right in
your living room fixing that can be as
simple as using a calibration setup disc
or as expensive as paying someone to do
it right now will do neither instead
I'll show you how to set up your TV by
eye so that you can quickly tune it up
at home without anyone's help
start with contrast for this one you'll
want to find footage with lots of bright
areas like this scene by the ocean
contrast controls the intensity of the
brightness for the lightest areas of a
picture that might sound confusing but
as I adjust it you'll see what I mean
turn it up until you start losing
details in the brighter areas like the
sky here or the sand then turn it down
until you start seeing that detail again
the correct studying is within a few
notches of that point
next up brightness for this step find a
dark scene like one from an action movie
contrary to what you might have heard
brightness adjusts the intensity of the
black levels so a TV that's too bright
will make blacks look washed out or even
grayish turn down the brightness until
everything appears way too dark then
turn it back up to the point where
things in the scene that are supposed to
be black are at the blackest level your
TV will allow this is the hardest
setting to adjust by eye so be patient
and adjust the brightness as you switch
between different types of programming
color not to be confused with color
temperature is usually a OK right out of
the box usually that means right in the
middle of the scale if you do want to
adjust the color find out well at scene
featuring a person's face to better
understand the color setting think of it
as saturation if you were to bring it
all the way down the image would start
to look grayish find the level where
their flesh looks natural without being
too orange there are two more important
settings to adjust here let's look at
sharpness for this one almost any image
will do so let's stick with ROS here
this sweet spot for sharpness is
somewhere near the body
of the scale it should be low but not so
low that things like wrinkles on faces
disappear you'll know it's set to high
if there's high lighting around the
edges of objects like her face find the
level just above the point where details
begin to disappear
finally color temperature again use the
scene where you can clearly see a face
like this the funny thing about color
temperature is that to a certain extent
no matter how it's set it'll look
correct to you so be careful with this
one on our TV we have color tone presets
instead of color temperature but it's
the same idea right now it's set to cool
but the color temperature is way too
blue which is causing this blue tint on
her face turn it up to high and her face
will be too warm pick one that feels
right to you if your TV has a setting
like white balance you can have much
more control over color temperature but
that's almost impossible to adjust by
eye once you've gone through these
settings you should find yourself
watching a much more accurate picture
and while an expert might not call it
perfect all that really matters is that
the picture looks good to you for the
