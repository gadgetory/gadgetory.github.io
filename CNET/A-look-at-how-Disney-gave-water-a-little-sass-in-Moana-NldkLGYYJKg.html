us of water as a character people don't
think of that but when it comes to
Disney movies everything is a character
so so when we would first kind of asked
to do this it was it was an acting
challenge so we decided to give a rig to
character animation so they could
actually animate kind of a bit of a sock
puppet like character and then it was
charged with for us to actually turn
that animation that performance into
something that looks like water so you
can see here is we gave character
animation and this is what this would
get approved by the directors in
character animation and this is actually
in this shot there's actually two
examples of that rig recreated there's
the one that puts the flower on her head
and there's the one who swoops her up
but these are actually two different
examples of that character so we took
another step of actually taking this
character and running water sim over so
you get secondary splashes and you get
water flying off of the character this
is what it looks like in the final film
so you can actually see there's the
secondary splashes there's bubbles
inside and then there's the seminal
the natural water in the background did
not see that coming ocean is a friend of
mine
another example of what you would get
coming out of character animation here
we got Moana given the water a high five
water comes in with a little sassy
attitude and this is what the kit is
what the directors would approve out of
character animation and again we would
take this performance running water
simulation over it put bubbles inside
and very often throughout the film when
the water finishes its performance
whatever it's doing with Moana we often
just let gravity take take over and let
have it become natural water again so
you can see here after the high five
performance
there's the water just becoming water
again and that helped quite a bit
waters pretty complicated character
throughout the film sometimes it's
sexually very wistful and whimsical
sometimes it's actually rather imposing
so it was very that was one big
challenge we had both this carrot but it
wasn't with character animation and with
the FEC's is how to make a giant water
like this potential tidal wave not look
like it's gonna you know take out Moana
and her grandmother so part of its it's
the simple performance of character
animation and part of it is what we are
doing in the effects Department by not
having this water simulate really really
big they're not having too much flying
off they also and you can see here how
he's sim the water against the shoreline
and water going up the main piece of the
of the ocean performance as well
hopefully given that all a very very
integrated
or at the shot
