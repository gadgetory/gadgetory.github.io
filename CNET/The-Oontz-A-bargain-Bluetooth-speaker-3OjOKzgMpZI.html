cnet.com and I'm here with the Cambridge
sound works oops
line of Bluetooth speaker that's right
oops that's a weird sounding name but
there are two of them
there's the oats angle that looks a
little bit like a pyramid and then
there's the standard booms which is
actually the higher-end model and that
does sound a little bit better it's a
little bit bigger speaker and offers a
little bit more bass the nice thing
about these speakers that they are well
priced the un's angle is $39.99 and the
regular oontz is $49.99 and they do
sound like more expensive models the
regular oontz was actually $69.99
originally but the prices since come
down so it is a better value compared
early speaking there are a lot of other
mini wireless bluetooth speakers very
similar to these speakers these do sound
a little bit better for the money you'll
find speakers that cost $79 or $89 that
are very similar list but these do offer
a little bit better clarity as I said
the step-up boots has a little bit
better bass one other bonus feature
you'll find in both speakers is
speakerphone capability so you can use
this as a speakerphone for your cell
phone your music will cut out when a
call comes in and there's a call answer
and button there are so control buttons
built into the unit itself you do get a
few more controls on the step-up oontz
there are transport controls on that as
well as volume controls there's also an
auxilary input if you have a non
bluetooth device what I will say about
both these speakers is they do have a
customized generic feel to them what I
mean is that there are some elements to
them that are a little bit inexpensive
for instance around back there's a mini
USB port instead of the more standard
micro USB port that's a little bit
disappointing the other small design
element that may some people is the blue
light on the front it's a little bit
bright it didn't bother me so much but
it did bother another editor here at C
net and unfortunately that blue light
can't be dimmed or turned off altogether
but all in all for the money both these
speakers sound relatively good they also
offer very good battery life both of
them are rated above 10 hours
you can actually do much better than
that if you play these at moderate
volumes and the designs are also
attractive they come in multiple color
options so the un's
funny name but all in all a good value
