come on I don't yeah really yeah we
don't need to just feel like it would
taste much better with bacon that's the
boring Oh what's not playing arm in the
bottom it says like what's playing hit
the X sometimes yeah i just happen to me
too with like jam up okay you'll get
clogged the place will get clogged it's
wednesday jun 13 2012 four-four time i'm
jeff beck alive and I'm Justin you this
is the show where it could use a little
more bacon it could on the side perhaps
like a lot more bacon I'll have a side
of bacon with a side of bacon man so you
were talking to us about that well it's
like an ice cream sandwich yeah bacon
out in LA they love their bacon and I do
too when pretty sure we're talking about
you know fake bacon or fakin bacon refer
to the common vernacular and turkey
bacon Richard brought up yes delicious
what do you like about targeting I like
the fact that it's like chewy right I'm
sure it's not yeah it's not does a lot
of fat on it write regularly yes and the
fact that you know we take a break from
our Pig friends and use the turkeys to
make a bacon which is fine that's just
the pepper pepper corn bacon oh my god
no good and the feel bad cuz we have my
yellow vegetarian in the morning I makes
like I want to know more about this
thing you call bake yeah um bacon yeah
we bring up bacon like we said last week
I was man you know I looked back I was
out in LA for four days and I had bacon
every single day mm-hmm that's weird man
every day every day but Ellenberger have
over breakfast right and then my
afternoon bacon sandwich hahaha hey
seven friend in college that would just
you'd be like let me get a bacon egg and
cheese yeah hold the Bagan it would be
like
the age hahahaha you just have a bacon
bagel yeah anyway we bring this up
because Burger King announced the world
yesterday that they will be bringing
something called the bacon sandwich it's
going to be hitting uh their stores
nationwide to go along with their summer
promotion man oh man there's limited
pork beef and sandwiches right right and
they're also introducing check this out
vanilla soft surge soft serve with fudge
caramel and bacon crumbles and then for
good measure they're just got back an
old strip of bacon on the side I don't
give you a spoon that supposed to be to
scoop up the ice cream with yeah I think
so that was the point I bagans not
strong enough to brittle it's too
brittle yeah so you know I think what
we're realizing now is that no one just
cares anymore yeah and we're just going
nuts with this the salty sweet dessert
is gonna cost you 510 calories 18 grams
of fat in a mind-blowing coma inducing
61 grams of sugar yeah you crazy bastard
what are you eating this I'm gonna I'll
split half of this let's get one yeah
well eat it on the air and we'll just
split it I'm down no wait what no no I
have to do that 30 grams of sugar a pop
yes I can't sick 61 grams of sugar I'd
what like I don't know if you've ever
had 61 grams of sugar in US and one so
much does a can of coke ave i'ma try 30
okay yeah or 20 something 28 mm-hmm
right so imagine you know putting back
two cans of coke which I'm sure you're
busy yeah I do that every day that's
what it would be like yeah so you know
when your heart is so fast that you can
feel it beating in your fingernails hmm
thats what its gonna feel like but most
people aren't just gonna eat this sunday
by itself now like right they were very
can you go for another reason right
they'll have a full like you know
whopper right they already had an
itinerary when they go in and they're
like oh bacon sundae let me add that to
the end of it yeah I would totally do
that there is something to be said about
the magical combination of sweetness and
saltiness yeah that is only achieved in
in very specific sort of combination
gave us that bacon chocolate Caroline
McCrory line McCarthy brought it was it
was most bacon covered in dark chocolate
and it changed my freaking life yeah so
good it did I went to this place called
hodad's in San Diego yeah and they do a
bacon burger and the actual patty is
made out of ground-up bacon bits just
died and they put bacon on top of that
infused with it no there's no actual
like beef patty outside all-bacon and
they put bacon strips on top of that
good I'm in net more think about that if
you're funny shoes maybe for you it's
not crazy ass give the metabolism of
like a 13 year old boy see me or the
justin i have i've have seen you order
the Justin um I I forgot how much of a
piece of garbage I was out in Los
Angeles I had triple fried chicken oh my
god okay okay and inside like the first
layer of fried was pieces of bacon too I
didn't eat it like a meal I just you
know took a bite of it right and then I
vomited but it was with you like cuz I
was so happy to be a part of it I was
like oh man this is ridiculous the
picture they're showing of this bacon
sundae hmm I'm not gonna lie it's
freaking appetizing man yeah do you know
there's no way it's gonna look like this
oh no it's gonna come with like a lid on
it thirty percent smaller yeah and I
have like a weird lid on it yeah uh I
don't know what it is about bacon and
sweet but I need to experience it maybe
we should just make this ourselves right
like you just get vanilla ice cream and
now my own that should be mass-produced
and certainly wanted to come from of
dollars and ninety-nine cents yeah
everyone's up costing yeah but I'm
excited about it we you know we really
appreciate weird kind of food here yeah
when I was in when I was I didn't tell
you guys this when I was in LA I had
bacon I had I had bacon wrapped matzo
balls what yep that's like always i'm
not kosher though right it was the most
blasphemous yeah just think about it
masa dough hairdo came up with that's
like I know some sort of like satanic
yeah it was amazing though and i had and
i shared it with another jew nine and we
just ate it and laughed on your way to
hell that in the face of kosher food
right it was ridiculous though a matzo
ball is just like a fried dough right
it's not fried dough at all it's like
cornmeal it's like I know about you yeah
you don't know dick about it it's uh I
don't how do i how do I describe it it's
just this like soft sort of melee it
tastes good it's the one Jewish food
I've really happened to enjoy besides
all the cold cuts and all it's really
good but these things were just wrapped
in this fried bacon it was so good
anything and it tasted like sin it was
magical it's really magical yeah yeah uh
did you be that story couple days ago
about this artist named Henry something
or other that's been like frying up
gadgets no I forgot about it until just
now but I wanted to bring it up this guy
Henry Hargreaves okay he's been cooking
up tech stuff uh and photographing them
as art and when you say cooking up you
literally mean I really really mean
dunking the iphones in dough and then
like breadcrumbs and then putting it
into like a deep fryer sure that makes
sense check this out here this is he did
he did it to a macbook he did it to a
gameboy and a couple other things so let
me see if I could pull this this guy's
got money to burn I guess earbuds is
like crappy Sony irrevocable that is so
weird very bizarre is he trying to make
a statement uh as much of a way as all
modern art makes a statement i guess
like meaning well no some modern art has
a has a very clear and obvious message
what do you think it would be here that
we've been consuming so much rapid
technology that's a go-to cliche
response but I think it also means that
like let's see you know we're so
addicted to this stuff we might just
like everything else it might as well
come deep-fried as well right is like
the message I think I don't know that I
bet was pulling it out of my butt I
don't I don't think I don't think he's
really worried about money yeah just
sort of frying up thousands of dollars
of gadgets here it's interesting that's
an interesting little uh expression
there it is
yeah let's move on to some stories of
the day yet you to do it what do you
want to talk mom so this is an
interesting thing because while we were
in college I know you and myself was
during the days of Napster oh yeah and
interesting piece from gizmodo saying
that record labels are paying students
to narc on other students who are
pirating music yeah yeah what kind of a
person would do something like this
apparently a lot this is kind of
disturbing but uh so a lot of record
companies use anti-piracy watchdog
groups right and yeah one of the big
ones that they all use is one called
promedia ok and that's nothing new a lot
of them use it but EMI Sony universal
and Warner are all putting a lot of
funding into this company promedia and
what they do and this was leaked by some
anonymous source within the company
they've actually hired 35 young watch
dogs under the age of like 25 i think uh
test my Hall Pass what exactly to go
round they should have to wear freakin
you know sling around their chest that's
a larks d-bag yeah i mean look don't get
me wrong stealing is bad but you don't
need to have some freaking narc behind
your back telling us yeah exactly what
is it what is the stitches thing oh well
I can't really yeah yeah oh it's true
man yeah stop snitching stoneleigh 12
yeah 2012 um yeah so they're like it is
watchdog group they basically crawl
through like four arms and like uh
piracy sites to go and hunt down these
so they're like hero at their like
actively seeking yeah they're like
professional lurkers like really creepy
stuff here um and then they'll also
track down file shares on like PDP
software programs like BitTorrent and
then slap them with like a fifteen
hundred dollar fine from their record
label season like writing course them to
settle out of court otherwise the
threaten being sued you know so everyone
will obviously threatened out of our
settle out of court at a fine of
apparently twelve hundred euros for
warner in Universal which amounts to
about fifteen hundred dollars and that's
how a lot of these music record labels
are getting getting their money back hey
man you gotta pay your way through
college somehow is all kinds of messed
up yeah that's weird but I was gonna go
you would you didn't order do it for
free narc ever
can't stand you arm this is an
interesting piece and I'm glad you found
it because we you know we always cover
like pranking headlines more
investigatory sort of journalism thread
the UM ever wonder how you'd like before
the days of Photoshop which were
plentiful right yeah most of our modern
world civilized world was a world
without photoshop how did they edit
Photoshop how did they Photoshop before
there was Photoshop Photoshop has become
like the verb for it it's become
synonymous with like what Xerox or or
Kleenex has become totally what's with
image editing but before that before the
late 80s right when Photoshop first
maiden appearance yep exactly what what
did they do image manipulation has
apparently been around for a really long
time since the Stone Age the Stone Age
they were etching out different images
hung to that stone but uh it wasn't
called Photoshop obviously before then
one could call it photo chopped huge
weight lifted off my back that is the
most embarrassing thing I've ever heard
you say that oh yeah anyway so there's
this photo forensics firm that operates
called four and six and I'll bring it up
on the screen here yeah please but they
have a whole like I have a whole archive
of you know physically manipulated
photos throughout history and the way
they do it is that they literally just
superimpose parts of images and cut them
out place them on others right like how
they used to do with you know frames of
film yeah you know they would literally
do a cut-and-paste job yeah exactly and
I didn't realize this but they do go
back really really far and this one is
from 1860 and they kind of describe some
of the more controversial images so this
one is of Lincoln I'm sure you've seen
this one before it's of course in a
standing upright post sure and that's
actually only his original head it's
actually spliced on to another
politicians body um so you could see the
one on the right here that they used and
then on the left is my model probable it
was put over the face of a prominent
South Carolina
politician jhansi Calhoun isn't that
amazing no reason why like I wanted to
see the original reality why what did it
was wrong with today first body very
weird this one I think you're gonna
really like Jeff in 1960 the u.s.
Olympic hockey team defeated the Soviet
Union I was nineteen eighty that's fine
nineteen sixty really they're not
talking about the miracle on ice that
was most certainly 1980 issue yeah they
weren't it was the first olympic gold
medal in hockey that could have been 19
8 i'll get maybe and maybe was 60 let me
see the photo i tell you okay that's
yeah that looks like it's uh this is
probably bit older yeah um anyway so
this was the first time uh Americans won
Olympic gold and several players were
actually missing when this photo was
taken so they chopped out their faces
from other photos and superimpose them
and you can kind of see which one it is
because obviously it's not as seamless
as the photoshop days now yeah I mean
look at this one in the middle there is
a clear indication of a very poor
editing job this one the left as well
and I believe this one on the far right
and this is most certainly not nineteen
eighty what's interesting uh if you
remember from CES this year uh-huh you
know a photon talk yeah explain that
could we find that somewhere and pull it
up no I might be sorry well I'm talking
about so for CES it was the last day of
the show and they wanted to do a huge
scene at group photo there's like a
hundred of us there I maybe more yeah
try to get in on this photo and I
remember two people off off the dome
that weren't there it was Sharon Sharon
Vaknin and it was Bonnie cha and they
were both not available for the photo
and they got put in every bag and it's
very obvious that it was worth it with
that it didn't look very good it didn't
look very good it was done on the fly
almost like somebody did it on their on
their iPad then in there but it was uh
it was a pretty it was a pretty funny
example maybe we'll get to them in the
shown yeah a final eight I do remember
marks head being like character like it
was like a caricature of his normal
Markel say yeah he wasn't in it either
no I think you know he was superimposed
to yeah I don't recall that but that's
funny that's a funny
example but yeah hey you know what
sometimes you gotta do it you know yeah
p will only remember the photos right
this is this I mean I they've been doing
it for a while now that there's also
like political like uh motivation to
photoshop people out as well like uh for
example there in the article they're
talking about how Stalin was sort of
infamous for airbrushing his enemies out
of photographs after they had fallen out
of favor so like a lot of people in his
camps if they eventually became
treacherous uh he would take them out
you know that they wouldn't exist
anymore impressive smart that's how
that's to me that's impressive because
it's uh you know they're not just
putting a face on somebody else's face
removing someone from a photo yeah and
and you know continuing the scene behind
that to me that what would you that's
impressive what would you even call that
I mean now you would say clone stamp
right yeah like but what was it back
then like how would you fill in the
water I don't know in the specific
example we're looking at looks really
good yeah link to all these in the show
notes but that's a that's a tough job to
do you know 80 years ago mm-hmm I don't
know I feel bad yeah yeah how do they do
that without the stamp tool the clones
to have I don't I do not know um I think
we'll take a break okay when we come
back more 404 we'll get to some
voicemails we'll get to I believe you
have a video voicemail perhaps that will
play was going to see if we have time
also emails will get to as well so stick
around a lot more 404 right after this
so is it any wonder people are afraid of
technology technology welcome back to
the 404 not bad it's really something ty
would do Ty Hyten play ty pendlebury I'm
at with huge census technology I know we
get complaints from people who only
listen to our audio show and they say
what the eff guys are you laughing about
you laughing about when you come back
from the break yeah that's not cool i
want to share that laughter well we
can't make you see anything over an
audio show but we really encourage you
can come back to the 40 Ford cnet com
after you've listened to the show or
perhaps as some sort of visual aid yeah
sometimes it's it's our companion app
yeah so and you can understand what
we're talking about we're not gonna
explain the back and I'm not gonna we're
not going to read it you know off the
offload you know screen there yeah not
gonna work like that um are you want to
do some uh some voicemails yeah let's
hit up some voicemails that's calls from
the public time time to show the love
866 404 cnet
all right calls from the public time
have you guys were you guys doing this
one yeah we were yeah a couple good ones
there's a hawk complimentary 20 they
were lying he's one cuz I don't ya cuz
the ones I listen to don't blink balls
of me yeah oh the one I was listening to
I guess or the couple episodes i was
listening to you guys didn't do it i was
like huh it all just went to crap we did
a lot of them though yeah yeah that's
really special and nice first one
talking about walking dead let's hear it
hey guys your champagne I had a quick
question for Jess in regards to comic
I've been reading The Walking Dead on
mytouch bed I guess I primarily use it
for comics and the thing with the
walking dead i was able to get them all
at one time and reissue wanna lay up
Dorothy what 98 now however I want to
get into more comics but it's the
hardest and most confusing thing on the
planet to try to figure out where to
start with all the different remakes and
revamp cuz curiously any suggestion for
a series or further I you know I guess /
a specific comic that you enjoyed the
cheek would be easy to catch up on or
you pick up on I love the huge ships a
book show okay ah that's that's a tall
order but I do have a few that I really
really highly recommend all right you
might as well yeah I'll try them it
afterward hands down and I know I've
said this a million times on the show
uh-huh but it's all about ex machina
that comic is my favorite series of all
time yep it's amazing it's about um
about a guy who becomes basically the
first superhero in the world and
eventually gets elected mayor of New
York because he stops one of the planes
from hitting the World Trade Center on
911 whoa yeah it's like an alternate
history sort of thing okay really
awesome well written uh highly
recommended it's done to is like issues
1 through 50 I read it in like a month
you'll be done quick and it's awesome
you have one that you want uh yeah I
really like a secret invasion it's
mostly years old now it came out like in
2008 but I got it that's fine while ago
but yeah it's still really good it's one
of those crossover ones where they make
like a giant super group so I think
xavier's in it from the x-men Iron Man
is also in this team mr. fantastic from
the Fantastic Four they all get together
to sort of like defeat this enemy called
the scrolls yeah and things go wrong and
some people get captured and I won't
give it away but it's really really good
okay huge too so might take a while to
read you're looking for something to
bite that's good another one I suggest
lock and key have you ever heard of that
yeah I've heard you talk about it before
it's basically about this family who has
to deal with a murder and ghosts are
haunting them in this house that they
live in in in New England it's really
really out there but it's very well done
and I think that's actually about to end
it's been going on for like eight years
and it's about to end but they do it in
volumes so volume 1 was like five issues
vol 2 was five issues and now the final
volume 6 I believe is just about to
finish it's called lock and key I loved
it yeah it's really good you know with
dark knight rises coming up I would also
recommend going back and reading the
stories like nightfall and nights and
sure Batman yes and those are the ones
that feature bane um for defeating
Batman and then what comes afterward
like uh you know I don't give too much
away but it's a world without Batman
right and they have to deal with that
somehow there's so many amazing Batman
graphic novels the long halloween yeah
these are all like the classic that's an
amazing one um Arkham Asylum is a
fantastic one and these were actually
also recommended to me by 44 listeners
yeah and then we had Blair Butler on the
show she got us really going on all this
stuff right um if you want more email us
the 404 it seemed calm and i can give
some more suggestions but it's really
tough i found out the hard way when you
first get into comics it's like oh oh
you want to read a comic okay so you
read walking dead right yeah that's like
enormous and nerdy almost that issue 100
and then it's like oh wait a minute
there are a billion comic that you
should be reading yeah it's tough to
stay with the day-to-day it really is
i'm reading the new Batman's like the
new 52 Batman's and I'm reading
detective comics and traditional Batman
right they're amazing you know what's a
really good one I'm a bird like being
super affected by this when I was a kid
is the death of Jason Todd it's call
a death in the family and Jason Todd was
like the second Robin yeah for Batman
and it was like the first graphic novel
ever read was like holy crap like
there's actual like crazy violence oh
it's in stories yeah um really really
good stuff a member we were talking
about Robin as a character um when DC
was gonna come out with their first gay
superhero and uh didn't end up being
Robin is Green Lantern right um yet this
was a really good story about Jason Todd
that second one's cool so again email us
we can give you more suggestions it is
uh it's intimidating but you'll get
through it yeah all right also wants to
give us suggestions all of that read all
of it for sure hundred percent um and
will be a comic con tu so I'm sure we'll
see like a billion more that we want to
read yeah for sure that's gonna be fun
um next up it's about our Apple in the
fall for this is idaho from us Jeff you
were talking about how you or SATA
appleton or at least something in
between the new Retina Display MacBook
in the air but they did they oh created
all of the original macbook pro lines
there are a lot faster and have better
graphics cards and all that fun stuff
and they're like right in the middle of
that like 1200 to seventeen hundred
dollar price range right in the middle
where you're complaining so guess what
you're wrong I'm right yeah sure but I
like that okay um yes you are correct
they did come out with a new macbook pro
on that's not the new lightweight design
in the retina display but they're still
heavy in there and they're like the one
I have here that's like super big I need
I want like a new in between version all
right the air do you know what I mean
yeah what would happen to you just now
that you look the way you do can you cut
sorry me so just throw up an image on my
screen because I know that only Richard
in our yoga as you can't we just talk
time I look at it I know I like it
do it was funny there's there's like a
new meme online that people
photoshopping images of the macbook pro
in like the glass case with all the
people foot right as it looked
ridiculous this one features the UH the
mr. being there right it was a bear
playing with himself that's that's all
that's what you want it's funny that
scenario it's funny it's crazy that's
good oh there it is hello guys what do
they call these where there's like it's
like a gift but then call yes they're
called but only one part of it is moving
what the hell yeah held I saw someone do
it with like a train yeah and it's like
this was like the hardest thing ever we
read read it too yeah there's a couple
and I think I think they're calling
interpolated what is it something like
this I don't know what it's called what
are they called arm anyway that was I
talking about it i'm gonna show me
masturbating bear you're talking about
the nick book the big book yes the
macbook pro so there isn't in between e
but it's not lightweight and it's not
like a cinemagraph is what a cinemagraph
and it's not like a it's not an
in-between you know anymore it's not
like I want him to come out the new
macbook road they're lighter but I still
wanted you know one that's more
affordable and they didn't do that they
dropped the price 100 bucks but they
didn't really do it um all right let's
go to a nonsense call this one's up next
hey you before four this is jeff from
idaho again um i'm trying to figure out
what ships to buy at the grocery store
do I get the frontier is tortilla chips
or the mission tortilla chips so here's
know okay so this is a big deal because
toward t like have you had the mission
tortilla oh yeah of course I've had the
strips and they think they're good yeah
you know what i really like I really uh
tostitos made these for a while they
were called like gold and they were like
super thick they're probably super
fattening as well right but they're
really thicken you can really get a nice
you miss all son you know what I mean
like to me that's a you're gonna have a
chip with stability yeah I agree if
you're piling on a sauce on there my
favorite tortilla chip is the have a
corn chips have you had those before
they sell them in California I've never
seen them in New York no cuz how could
they possibly sell them
this they infuse each chip in soy sauce
okay now I'm gonna be sick they are
delicious I'd rather have bacon flavored
tortilla chips but the sweetness of the
soy sauce kinda counteracts the
saltiness of the salt on the chip is
really good I'm not going on it like it
on Facebook right now good good for you
that's a big freakin accomplishment what
I based in Laguna Beach are they now
yeah they do look good i would eat the
crap out of that would i I'm embarrassed
to admit something what's that I like
lime tortilla chips oh me too are you

sweets worth right but i like how the
caller was why did he call us and leave
a voicemail from the computer he's slow
days later he's still there what is your
favorite chip I'm a big big fan of
kettle cooked chips okay yes any sort of
kettle cooked they're better than the
fried one but is there like a flavor not
brand but like because I'm a huge fan of
salt and vinegar yeah I love so many
that's a nice if chip because some
people really hate it oh yeah do really
like it there it's a tough chip to eat
if you're not used to it and you're not
if your palate is not prepared
appropriately jaw you are in for a bad
weekend yeah because that could really
mess you up you're like oh my god it's
it's getting in the you know the cut
songs if you have like it on your tongue
inside of your valve you're in front
room yeah um sucks I really like ketchup

number one Canadian export behind ice
hockey is ketchup chips you can get them

cherrim says sour cream and onion I'm
not exactly Mannion fan yeah it was

favorite not a big fan of barbecue chips

barbecue but not on you yeah I'm very
you're gonna Frank's redhot chips oh
yeah yeah those are good nuts ones yeah
oh that's too bad what's their nose in
the west coast did you know that I mean
everyone know that's before I came here
yeah I don't know I didn't know that
my head uh Doritos that were flavored
like cheeseburgers yeah oh yeah we had
that here yeah not like vomit awful like
literally awful I could just imagine the
assembly line where it's like up your
turn to puke in the bag okay like that
sometimes when people's breath smelt it
kind of smells like an old cheeseburger
it's like that it was like that yeah Oh
guys I'm talking about you it said like
you look at the back and it's like Oh
puke okay cool mix instead how there's
no bacon-flavored chips um that would
create a black hole in the world yeah
what is that we're not an obvious name
no i don't know i don't know why they
can't do that why can't they just team
up with like oscar meyer and make like a
bacon flavor chip i do that the world
may never know french onion sun chips
are the best whoa good it was real good
yeah oh okay I'm hungry um nette and
then finally we got a one last voicemail
about the Vita post III hey guys this
professor Jeff smell card hey I had a
quick question Jeff based on when she
saw at e3 do you think that the Vita
stands a chance at somebody that owns
one I'm really interested to see the
system's concede just curious on your
thoughts thanks alright so um yeah
everyone at e3 was talking about the
playstation vita it's their new portable
handheld gaming system that it's been
out for what excuse me like four months
yeah it feels like it's already been out
for seven years um I didn't really see a
lot of e3 that uh that sort of painted a
bright picture for the future of the vue
de it's kind of unfortunate but you know
uh they just don't really have a lot of
games that people are getting excited
about there's going to be an assassin's
creed there's going to be a call of duty
which i guess is a big deal but you know
you really want those those sort of
independent um you know uh ip's these
intellectual properties if you're
looking for a great video game right now
i definitely recommend gravity rush
because that's a unique game built just
for the vita I don't know man they just
had their resistance game that game is
not very good it's going to be tough I
think the the indie scene really needs
to jump on the Vita for it to sort of
develop some sort of following but I
don't know man
you just kind of bleak we have the photo
from cnet uh CS yeah there it is so if
you look almost left center there's a
very blurry Bonnie cha yeah so and then
