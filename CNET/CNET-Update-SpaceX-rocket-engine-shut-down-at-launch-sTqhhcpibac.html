espionage accusations I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your scene at update
although it looked like a
picture-perfect launch one of the
engines of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket
failed about a minute after takeoff the
other engines compensated to help the
launch succeed this is the second supply
ship SpaceX launch to the International
Space Station the first one back in May
was a test flight this is the first
operational flight under that 1.6
billion dollar contract it has with NASA
since the space shuttles were retired
this is how NASA will be transporting
supplies and experiments back and forth
between Earth and the space station
United States lawmakers are strongly
encouraged in American companies to not
do business with huawei and ZTE two
Chinese companies that make
telecommunications gear the House
Intelligence Committee released a
52-page report accusing the two
companies as posing a national security
threat because their equipment could be
used to help the Chinese government spy
on American companies or individuals
although there was no proof that these
companies did steal any data it was
discovered that some ZTE equipment
allowed for undetectable backdoor access
into a network ZTE said that was a bug
and there were also cited examples of
routers turning on in the middle of the
night and sending data packs to China
without any explanation the questions
surround large-scale network gear not
something consumers would buy but huawei
and ZTE have also just begun selling
smartphones in the u.s. certainly this
report might also damage its future as a
smartphone maker Apple hasn't even
announced the existence of the ipad mini
yet we already have reports from
analysts that the iPad Mini is going to
have a better design than the most
recent iPad also The Wall Street Journal
says that part makers in Asia have
orders to make more than 10 million
units of the ipad mini that's about
double the amount amazon ordered for the
kindle fire beware promises made by
motorola last year the company promised
to upgrade three of its phones to the
Android Ice Cream Sandwich operating
system the 18 th ryx 4g the Sprint
photon 4G and the Electrify on US
cellular now Motorola says it won't
upgrade them without explanation people
buy phones
typically if there's a promise to be
able to get an upgrade looks like you
can't even trust Motorola which is you
know owned by google in today's apt to
watch we're looking toward a galaxy not
so far away a new star wars-themed angry
birds game will arrive on november
eighth the birds take on the
personalities of the Star Wars heroes
the red bird is like Luke Skywalker and
as you can guess the pigs will play
characters like Darth Vader and the
stormtroopers that your tech news update
