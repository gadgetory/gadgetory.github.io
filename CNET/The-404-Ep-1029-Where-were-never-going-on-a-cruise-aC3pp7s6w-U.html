jeff beck allah and i'm justin you this
is the show we're never going on a
cruise letting the disney cruise not
even those words that could happen on a
cruise with the unlimited food and the
unlimited amazed man have you ever been
on a cruise i have yeah you gonna cruise
to mexico all the time all what does
that mean all the time uh maybe like
once a year like during the summertime
yeah our family would take cruise that's
nicer nothing crazy ever happened though
well we did would just eat a lot of food
wake up at eleven o'clock for the even
type of thing that's what it's all about
the food man you eat so much food oh the
bad me jitna magicians to the bad the
legends yeah what was his medians hit
mrs. yeah yeah i was at trilla question
one that's terrible there there there on
the on there pretty low on the totem
pole which say i'd say so it goes like
ditions can you neighbors can you name
one venture besides like Jeff Jeff
Dunham that's a he he owns the whole
market they give Jared and he was a 30
lost him yeah you know it's sort of like
with John Malkovich did or excuse me
what what's-his-face didn't being john
malkovich uh he's like I'm gonna be a
puppeteer now all right okay your
puppeteer now I'll make the necessary
call he's the most famous puppeteer of
all time yeah so the reason we're
talking about Cruz is we uh you know we
read read it a lot Justin to myself too
yeah are you falling to what my wife
calls a reddit black hole yeah yeah I'm
not that rabbit all the time spiraling
there's some good stuff on there though
there is some good stuff and one of
these good stuffs that we're talking
about is something i came across
yesterday holy God there are people who
didn't know that the Titanic disaster
actually happened I'm not joking there
are people who were tweeting early in
April about the fact that oh my god i
just learned that the titanic really
happen if now before we read some of
these off and you can agree or disagree
with
me you know how I feel about these
things if you've tweeted that you didn't
know the Titanic was a real disaster
yeah well you should be kicked off
Twitter you shouldn't be tweeting yeah
you should be clicked writing about your
ignorance on twitter is not good I have
a problem with that tube people it's
like almost trendy to be an idiot right
you know I'm so adorkable yeah you know
I I didn't know right Oh gravity's real
the worst is yeah they just okay so let
me read off this you will switch him off
looks real charlotte hall she says is it
bad that I didn't know the Titanic was
real always thought it was just a film
you a-hole she isn't a young person
either this she looks to be maybe at
least 18 years old no one that can drive
should not know that time some schmuck
named Brittany nobody told me Titanic
was real how am I just finding this out
yeah read one uh guys god I'm sorry let
me read it off in the voice you probably
roasted guys the Titanic was real
hashtag mind blown I can't deal with
this I like that I didn't like the same
kinds of people that didn't know uh
Billy Crystal uh who Billy Crystal was
we write in the Academy Awards which
maybe isn't as bad if you know that's
it's an act it's not as bad as the
Titanic but an Oracle landmark mr.
dragon slayer yeah clearly is educated
the Titanic was real holy s I'm never
going on a cruise yeah you moron it was
a hundred years ago yeah it really
happened a lot of people died so this is
because ten kate winslet was on it did
they just really thought that like oh my
god attend it was just a beautiful love
story that James Cameron cog is it and
you know I guess James Cameron neglected
to put based on a true story hahaha the
beginning of the grad is there holy God
I'm sorry not they shouldn't be kicked
off Twitter they should just be put in
jail let's just put him in jail before
they grow up to commit crimes because no
one that's stupid
we'll be able to get through life just
on honor did you know that a king kong
was also based on yeah yeah yeahs
surface so it's Twilight based on true
story I would the reason I think these
people should not be allowed to post on
Twitter is because to me twitter is
about progress right and it's about the
fertile it's not though as we can tell
that by every day's trending topics yeah
but to me it's like man this should be
the the world's knowledge being shared
people like this you're not a bringing
anything to the table so just get off
worthy characters Jack and Rose made up
for the movie the who cares that's what
I want to know if not point I know but
if we're diving into the its historical
fiction okay so they were probably
people in love on the boat I'm sure one
or two people were gonna like I need
jack is maybe one guy named Jack I mean
the thing was enormous there are a rose
there are a lot of people yeah I mean
even but do they bow to the character it
doesn't matter even if you like the I've
see how many times have you seen like
Titanic photos yeah real photos of the
real ship underground how many times
have you seen like an exhibit at a
museum museum but right like how do you
yeah government am I crazy I remember
learning about it in Elementary's
exactly like they teach all the whole
lesson about yes so about what happened
and about it and they show pictures and
everyone knows the iceberg story you
know and these people are like nope it's
real let me go tell the world yeah
uneducated and stupid i I'm not that mad
about it I mean young they probably
don't teach that to young people it
doesn't matter i didn't let anything
else crucial to knowing you know i mean
if someone had said what happened on
that one day I temperature 2001 but I
would be appalled but that was ten years
ago Titanic Titanic I'm sorry major deal
it's not a big deal in in our live yeah
it means nothing to us horrible tragedy
horrible tragedy but it was a hard to do
it I can't say it's a big deal now
because no one I mean I'm sure there may
be
there's a survive like one or two
survivors of that I don't know but it's
just crazy to me I know arrest them by
media I go see all their Haiti no I'm
not gonna see Titanic in 3d i still have
not watched the whole film back the
front back yeah wait really you never
seen the whole film before front to back
now just quit halfway through no I saw
its four and a half hours right second
the only part I wanted to watch was the
you know the news zinke sinky other than
the nude part of course there's a new
part yeah there's a pg-13 I'm gonna draw
you like one of my french girls i c'n
and get that reference what yeah this is
the part where he sketches her out when
she's like line is they're full there's
full frontal yeah well full frontal is
normally for dudes for sure we're
talking about Buddhist term full frontal
can go is unisex oh sure it is people
only talk about full frontal when it's
like a dong now I disagree like Mark
Wahlberg full frontal and boogie nights
all the time they're not on my Heather
Graham yeah but it means the same i
think i've always thought i was just for
men oh really yeah all right anyway so
the yeah it's like the one where he's
drawing her naked boobs asunder you have
to sit in that pose the rest of the show
I lovely hey just in any way so you want
to buy instagram no i don't have a
million dollars its salient a billion
dollars don't you think okay what are
you write great facebook bought it yeah
the I don't know you first you got draw
something we use though I mean everyone
surprised yeah it's not just me a
billion-dollar they bought uh they
bought draw something what what company
was that OMG pop Zynga boy oh boy OMG
pop right and with it came down for like
a hundred thirty million dollars i think
was 210 one was all said about that yeah
although we're evaluating that Instagram
was get sold to somebody for a quarter
million dollars like two weeks ago a
billion then a half a million dollars a
week ago turns out yesterday Facebook
bottom offer billion dollars now look
I'm not them i I'm I'm not the X I'm not
the official expert I think that's too
much money it's too much money it's too
much money I don't think instagrams
worth a billion dollars why not because
I just think they're it it's this bubble
thing all over again you know I mean no
I don't think it's just overvalued first
of everyone and their mother
about the zynga thing right there's no
one that would disagree with that a
billion dollars i mean yes they were
doing a better job at mobile photo
sharing they were then Facebook they
were 30 million registered users you
don't think that's worth a billion
dollars and then all the information to
share about themselves i don't know
we've talked about how facebook on cells
advertisements based on blocks of Ages
right right like you know if you want to
buy the 18-24 blanket you can advertise
specifically to that demographic I
understand imagine how much information
they can glean from people based on the
photos they post and then you can geotag
an Instagram 2 million dollars which is
all really valuable think about what a
billion dollars is I just think that
proves how much of a threat instagram
pose to face i think that's what it is
too and i think and who knows what the
back door you know meetings really uh uh
were made up of right you know who that
they might have gone back and forth
there's Facebook saying instagrams going
to be a separate entity they're really
not gonna touch it yeah you know they
just sort of want that under the
umbrella Facebook's also never been able
to really perfect the whole mobile
platform to that during I was I right
about that that's something I think they
bought into with instagram is no one
ever uses the facebook app it's an
iphone personally i'm on the instagram
app are far more when you go on facebook
on your phone what do you do to use a
nap or do you go to their mobile site I
never do it period I only only use their
app if I get a notification any to check
something their mobile sites getting
down a volunteer pick up I think their
mobile site is getting better yeah but i
think the core idea of facebook people
don't want to check on the go you know
you're not really worried about what
status updates people are poised right
there's too much information on facebook
right to be linked with instagram they
just want to see oh what's jeff looking
at right now it's one aspect of
someone's life is this where I get
instagram I think you should probably
stop being a biatch and do it right in
the tune yeah number two can't instagram
i'm pretty sure you still below with
instagram this it's funny cuz yesterday
I almost came out and said I didn't know
I know what it is of course I do you
know don't know the ins and outs of it
though all the kids on the Lower East
Side are all about you know I'm gonna be
a bit know there are hashtags Instagram
dude what there are I did you know yeah
okay yeah
and I know you can file people on it i
know the whole deal I'm just
understanding what tumblr is okay one
step at a time baby steps all right
gravy baby baby steps oh man so I think
there's only like a dozen employees at
Instagram still right don't know I think
so it doesn't matter Lee small startups
billion down billion dollars but that's
a lot of money they're doing cash and
stock too isn't that that's just so I
think the CEO isn't is getting 400
million something like that i read it's
really upset think about that they're
two years old the company yeah you know
who's next who Pinterest Pinterest you
think is next oh yeah pitchers only been
around for what four days yeah I mean
that's what feels like a better that
time it's yeah it's four years but in
reality if we just hatched your next uh
comic Jimmy after four days just make up
a company right yeah we were trying it's
funny vigil requires non existing
company for four million google acquires
his thought unnamed bars and harvard
congrads thought yeah eight billion
dollar yeah that's what it should be we
are we we started doing it before the
Instagram story broke it's gonna be
about the mac virus yeah but um but but
yeah which google acquires head scratch
from 15 billion bill liars napkin doodle
mmm we believe that you that's more of
an onion headline yeah then a comic the
comma gonna have a hard time visually
presenting that you could show okay do I
call it magic shoe thousand truths the
bubble all over again but it's so much
it's so much it's more than a mega mega
size rise in the.com bubble in like the
late 90s and early 2000s more of like
everyone just starting up doing a
start-up I feel like this is just a lot
of acquisitions right do you know what I
mean so it's a little different than
that i'm curious to hear what jill has
to say about this if she can really
speak to that right we're gonna have Ron
tomorrow helping out with your last
minute tax questions and whatnot so give
us a call 866 44 cnet or you can tweet
us tweet her and she'll answer some
questions you know who really got jacked
in this whole deal was that hipstamatic
I bet there
so pissed right now so explain that cuz
I'm not too familiar with its Matt I've
heard of it I didn't get hipstamatic
before either but as far as I know it
was just another exam has the better
name yeah it's Graham as a far better
name but it's just another digital
photography app and they introduced the
idea of filters yeah you know like
making it look like antique film camera
right I think they started that retro
trend in on in mobile photography yeah
but you know like there's a million of
about their Instagram camera bag is
another iphone right popular app if it
when you really must be pissed they must
be pissed off man piss my face buys
hipstamatic that's gonna be the next but
Leinster buys canada yeah when you
really think about and we do make fun
because i do think for better or worse
they have changed the way photography is
looked at ya RAB here crappy um so you
know who knows what of what that will
sort of result in in the long run but in
just two years they went from literally
nothing to a billion dollars that ain't
bad yeah and you gotta give him credit
it's Graham smart they sort of combined
facebook and twitter with twitpic on ya
own app it's so easy to use yeah that's
a problem that's what tumblr so big yeah
cuz it's so freakin easy to use one
thing does it really well man when
carpet used to hang out with carb you
like guys I'm looking for investors were
such idiots yeah he was like hey give me
five bucks I'll give you ten shows that
never happened but if it did would you
have been on though I'd it sir
hindsight's twenty-twenty huh yeah why
have we used to be like boys become yeah
I think we've been three times twice
yeah uh going back to our rundown
there's something going on in New York
City with our public pay phones believe
it or not New York City does have a few
public pay phones left in fact we have a
few outside our office here right ah
there never used their more of like
bathroom stalls right but there's a new
initiative in Manhattan to replace the
pay phones with smart screens yeah so
tell us about this so 250 phone booths
around the city will be replaced with
this pilot program they're gonna start
that i believe next month instead
they're gonna install these touch
screens which i've actually already
started seeing in the city where's one
uh um
I think in the east village they already
guys sorts of receptacles Dupree video
phone booth but yeah I think they're how
they'd like 20 9220 42 32 32 inches yeah
those are huge men yeah so uh these will
be turned into like Wi-Fi hotspots that
you could walk up to eventually be able
to check your email and maybe even
participate in a webcam chat through
apps like skype right directly on these
things of course there will also be
clogged down with advertisements yeah
and whatnot but i'll also give you
information like I guess if there's
subway delays or traffic information I
feel like they're bringing the text the
back of the taxi cab experience together
putting on every street corner right but
the what's the first thing everybody
does with a junkie exactly off shut up
and now they're just gonna put this and
you know as soon as you walk by it's
going to be like one of those you know
channel 7 updates yeah the revenues
coming in right like shadow I'll just
gonna turn all these off right we were
wondering how is is going to be sanitary
but apparently near the city of New York
claims these are more sanitary than ATM
machine yeah and that they're going to
be power hosing them they'll be jet
hosing them on the reg that word jet
hose yeah it'll be doing that I'll be
done every day every day means yeah they
said the screens will be dustproof and
waterproof and cleaned every day with a
jet hose huh all 250 locations that's
just really important because I try to
touch anything in New York City so I are
you like me and every time you leave
your office or even go outside to the
outside New York world yeah you come
back and you wash your hands yeah you
don't do that no you see you like your
fingers I go it and in Eli's got em yeah
finger-licking good yeah that's what you
did haha but if I ever go into a subway
or yeah I think then you should write
all you what's the grossest thing is
pushing those turnstiles the subway
turns down you don't see me I'll see
people just grab it with her there man
like that I do with my knee man I just
kick it yeah cool you can't there's not
a room boo you kick it open yeah and all
through the same let's go to say the
back must hit you in the head
it's ridiculous yeah look is right
people dragging their fingers across the
screens all day long not interested in
partaking yeah yeah uh I've ever you've
lost your cell phone a few times right
oh yeah all time Perry's r us why the US
wireless carriers are creating a
database Universal database to help
fight phone theft so basically it's a
database that will try and prohibit
people from reactivating stolen or lost
devices makes sense it's a universal
sort of thing it'll stretch across all
the major carriers in the United States
yeah uh it's a smart smart idea this is
really smart so they're gonna um I
believe AT&amp;amp;T verizon sprint and t-mobile
yeah all for the big carriers sure are
doing this um basically they're gonna
assign IDs cell phone IDs to each
account okay and you'll have to provide
this ID if you want to reactivate a
phone once it's been lost gotcha so
that'll prevent people from you know
finding something in the back of a cab
for example and then just starting to
use it you know like you can disable it
over the phone reactivate it over the
phone but you'll need that ID and I
think the biggest thing is the sim card
thing yeah where it's just like all I
could just pop my sim card in and it's
my phone right so that is this gonna
sort of interfere with that the ease of
doing that as well or now I think you're
gonna that so the sim card will be
attached to that IDs okay um if you
don't have it then you won't be able to
activate it afterward pretty sweet crazy
part there you go now you can all lose
your phones with no worries because
whenever I used to lose my phone it
would drive me crazy just don't store
the ID on the phone of course that's
kidding though I've never done that ya
i've never lost the phone if you wait
what I've never lost the cell phone what
are you talking you told us a story a
couple weeks ago I might have left it in
a freezer yeah that's right I didn't
lose it still in my freezer you've never
still imminently lost from never buy a
new never neither vine thank you Richard
us normal people here uh I've misplaced
my phone yeah I would you got it back
but I've gotten it back alright so that
does act that's us I've lost my wallet
though the first time that I went to
bummer first time I ever visited New
York City was when I was in Middle
never i had a wallet with me and i paid
the cab driver to get from the airport
to the hotel yeah and lost the wallet in
the cab that day is is right when i had
arrived i get a good wallet losing sorry
that's that's got to be scary though
here's your young yeah i was traveling
by myself i was back from college and i
just graduated um and I went to the
gamestop in there my house I bought a
game and I like a dingleberry must have
just left my wallet on the counter so I
get home and it was right around the
corner I get home and I'm like oh man
where's my wallet yeah so I call up the
gamestop I'm like hey I think I left my
wallet on the counter there they're like
yes some kid came in and took it huh and
I was like wait a minute you just let
some kid take a mistake like a wallet
without asking him if it matched the ID
yeah they're like yeah he said it was
his I was like all your well your yeah
you're no help didn't bother just open
that ten minutes later I get a knock at
my door it's the kids mom like hey my
little SH you know I kid she literally
said that my little crap kid stole your
wallet for gamestop here it is all the
money and everything that's awesome she
I guess she knew where my street was
rushing up in the ID card that isn't
that crazy yeah that is that's awesome
always counting little bastard yeah you
steal my wallet rap yeah hell man that's
not cool did you have a lot of money in
that or something like 80 bucks in there
okay you know yeah trying to tell me

because he's a little after a little
pilfering bastard anyway we got to take

so Maxim magazine were you guys into
Maxim hell yeah back in the day not
really bridges like no didn't read it I
you're the man returns like uh nope nope
definitely not could no that's
interesting look he's bright red I love
it was not a fan uh anyway I remember
when I first started working for mice
the startup that I was into in 1999
maxim was our Bible right maxim was like
the go-to it really was I'm trying to
think of an online sort of equal for it
porn not really porn uh because it was
it was playboy without nips yeah I mean
yeah uh but it was funny in there is
manswers yeah but in that was the man
show right persona into a magazine uh
and I used to love it I used to
subscribe ace thing is great obviously
the internet had its way with Maxim
there was always a Scott Steiner right
format right Scott signees right
remember I got it because I would always
sign up for these free magazine
subscription right yeah line I matters
Ben's bargain net yet would always be
offering free issues of maxim GQ uh
whatever publishing company this is a
con day I'll who is it I forget who
publishes them I don't know yeah I
remember I had so many Maxim's that when
I put them on my shelf remember the
binding of the magazine was always a
sliver of a picture usually look of like
a bikini-clad girl yeah and if you had
like the entire year yeah yeah like the
binding picture would make a giant
picture yeah I love that so I had so
many that I think it's alpha matte
bookshelf uh what is it it's alpha Media
Group puts out maxin did not know that I
know nothing about Maxim I haven't read
one in a while but uh one of our good
buddies sent in a link that is actually
kind of relevant to our show it's eight
ways to make a game or happy and I guess
it's aimed more towards the female end
of a male/female relationship or just
maybe the person who doesn't play games
it was the person who doesn't okay um so
there's eight tips on how you can make
the gamer in your life happy male female
does not matter number one get a clue
okay not saying you should fall in love
the call of duty but it'd be nice if you
had some idea of what the hell we're
talking about when we use gate when we
use words like gamertag matchmaking or
tea bagging which is a big online
practice you're just you're just sort of
oh you start making your way through the
maximal set here uh number to play play
a game from once in your life chances
chances are there's a video game you
already like so just take a look at your
iphone there's a huge audience for
casual console games I disagree with
this one playing call of duty and being
able to relate with your significant
other / call of duty just because you
play scramble with friends right doesn't
doesn't really work ok have some
perspective gaming keeps us in the house
and relatively subdued think of the
alternative we could be spending 12
hours every weekday out on the golf
course or in bars getting crap face with
our buddies rent resenting us for
spending sixty dollars in 40 hours with
mass effect 3 is understandable but also
it was understandable is that a word
but also temporary pretty interesting
this these kind of sucks really suck
yeah if I don't know they just seem very
stereotypical then they saying cosplay
put on an outfit yeah mix it up I think
this is making things worse for gamers
actually just I think this is proof why
no one yes isn't pretty but did you read
this before well I read the the sub
headlines he is a decent idea yeah this
just seems really gross not working
address again read this cosplay one this
really drives it in it says guys like it
when girls put on sexy outfits for them
and gamers like it when girls put on
sexy outfits from games they like a
cosplay equals costume play it's such a
big deal check his gaming stack then
google said title with the word cosplay
tacked on for some instant sexy time
inspiration I was just about to let
maxim back in my life yeah and now it's
like hey you just blew it tequilas it's
you know that was nice and organic yeah
we realized it on the fly this sounds
like the tucker max wrote for the
magazine yeah I'd no idea that bad
before we hit voicemails I want to talk
about best buy yeah their CEO Brian Dunn
has resigned they've closed a lot of
stores what's going on with best buy the
writing is on the wall the writing's on
the the comment section of this Maxim
article 2 i'm sorry last thing I'll say
about this story look at this first
comment really like I it says John
Benton whoever wrote this should be
dragged behind a barn and shot liked 62
times truth hurts man okay let's let's
move on now I'm talking about best buy
that's fine i'm talking about was less
time you're in the best buy uh tease a
bathroom maybe three weeks ago really
yeah we're in New York yeah the one on
fourteenth Street um you gotta imagine
they're really sort of shaking in their
boots a little bit like I said they've
closed multiple stores yeah although
there are they seem to be doing well in
certain categories in the tablet
category right but those things sell
themselves not so well in others um I
mean what do you think I mean circuit
city I mean they're they've been gone
for almost ten years now it was like
best buy they have too many stores
that's very clear they pop up like weeds
right what do you think I mean so we
talked about the story couple weeks ago
I guess they were closing down a Sun
setting if you will they were subsetting
50 of their stores right around the
country which is hughes and huge that's
true like you know best buy stores are
everywhere yeah there's too many them
there's there's even best buy vending
machines I'm not joking you go to an
airport you go there's a best buy
vending machine by like an iPad Africa's
energy yeah ridiculous yeah but I came
for the last time actually need to go to
a best buy for I mean aside from the
restroom right cracking codes but I'm
just really curious I'm een you got to
imagine that they're them sort of uh
having their CEO resign and he claims it
was a sort of amicable separation they
have to bring in somebody who will
literally change the face of the entire
franchise right someone to literally
right the ship and make it so that Best
Buy does not fold do you ever go to
bestbuy.com and obviously like their
biggest competitor right now online is
Amazon sure but I'm wondering if the
website even attempts to compete with
their retail model do you know what I
mean I me on right now they're comparing
the big box store at amazon.com the only
time I ever go to that Best Buy website
is to really just check stock yeah if I
need something that I know I can't get
any cheaper and it's just in because the
best buy is on the corner of where I
take the path train back to Hoboken I'm
obviously just gonna hop in there and
just grab what i gotta do even though it
is so painful going into these stores
it's funny you go on like Google Maps
and you see the ratings for these best
buy stores and they're like half a star
the employees cannot know they it's it's
really really sad and there was a time
and I think it also changes by where you
are um but I remember time where it was
knowledgeable people were really into it
maybe it was because it was commissioned
based I don't know right but things are
much worse now and something's gotta
change yeah some does have to change uh
let us know what you think about that
interesting to hear if we know anybody
who was the best about yags out
from Best Buy employee yeah there's
gotta be at least 40 of them I feel like
whenever I go into best buy now no one's
actually asking them for advice it's
more of a stock issue right is I do you
have any more the right I was just
walking around reason why I asking this
person yeah you know us five people on
the best buy the same question you'll
get five different answers you know I I
think the reason is because we get hired
at bestbuy it's not like because your
cell phone expert or because you know a
lot about scary ass yeah they probably
just get placed in whatever department
for that day you just play could be
refrigerators right could be stereo
equipment and I hate to really knock
against it but I'm sorry we're being
honest the best buy experience has
turned negative it just has and I don't
think you'd find many people who
disagree with that cuz they're a better
is there a better electronics retailer
that you'd rather go to like are you a
pc richard &amp;amp; sunday family owned ones i
mean son sucks ones that are ones that
are independent yeah you know like
tekserve toka tech service amazed right
right David's it's it's mostly mac and
but it's computer peripherals and
whatnot tekserve is fantastic compusa I
know still around a lil are they do
users already understand him in a while
yeah why would I go into a compusa the
world's biggest compact reseller that's
right i remember going in to compusa and
buying like the super super low like
value rack games right you know if you
need like a USB microphone right right
you got a copy i think i got a couple
mice there right yeah yeah i mean you
know it happens I'm not happy people
losing jobs over it but you can't stop
evolution all right before we go calls
from the public I'm to show the love 86
for scenic calls from the public time
apparently i ignited people's memories
with the ir 7000 here's Larissa hey guys
Marissa from houston i was listening to
today's show monday when you were just
talking about going home and finding all
your old stuff and i totally forgot that
i had that same exact they go no I know
what it was called the little PDA thing
I totally forgot that I had that until I
saw the picture of it and I was like
crap i had that same thing and i didn't
know anybody else who had it so like I
think you were supposed to be able to
like send information back and forth I
didn't know anybody with one so that
feature was pretty much pointless and I
mean I was like I don't know 10 or
something I didn't have a schedule but I
would like calendar the crap out of
things I had to go to school on Monday
through Saturday I will sweep in and
watch cartoons I can't everything in
that thing in my contact like we all had
the same phone number in the same house
but I would like mom's phone number dad
oh crap in that thing so yeah that was
cool and you should totally whip this
out and see if i can find mine and then
we can send data back and forth to each
other cuz i never got to use that aww
that is so adorable that it really is
cute I um yeah the thing is though is
that it was infrared that's the only way
you had communicated so Larissa will
literally have to come to New York yeah
and stand with intense for us to
communicate with our 7,000 i gotto next
time i go back to my parents place i
gotta i'll bring that back yeah it is
and i remember there was this like
battle mode it was like pokemon where
you it was like a turn-based battling
right you know yeah that's not that far
off the technology we use now like with
bump or whatever it's the same idea or
even with pda's I remember when Palm
Pilots gameplay like asteroids are your
babies too much Craig infrared they
basically did like a personal notebook
like personal journal and made it
transparent so it would look cool
because you could like see the insides a
little bit
this is basically like a language
transair with a there's a full keyboard
on it so you felt like that was worth
something I like a shoes putting in
everything from her five-year-old you
list or whatever exactly it's like why
you marketing this towards kids when
kids don't have business live right I
mean if you keep something like this to
a kid now oh it's slap you in the face
this is worse than a calculator you
might you might as well give them ball
in a cup yeah it's the same usefulness
another dollar scheme on this to it so
deliciously nineties it is awesome IRA
you don't understand how insane I got
over this thing I could not wait until I
guy I was getting for Hanukkah some I
can remember and I was just like I can't
wait design was really really popular in
the 90s especially for electronics
translucency yeah it sure is over I had
like a translucent Game Boy yeah love
looking inside of it and look at these
working parts cool my neighbor was
translucent you had a beep my organizer
was trans loose us so cool you had a
beeper even quicker clickers remember
those mechanical pencils those are
translucent you could see inside you see
the guts of the mechanical pen yeah
there you go it's the future well let's
go back give me a break we talked a
little bit about using an iPad or a
tablet or any sort of device yeah in
your place of worship let's let's hear
what our buddy has to say hey the 404
this is a sin Kiyoshi and you guys are
talking about the iPads and etc in
church and i'm a member of the Mormon
faith and actually the Mormon Church is
very tech forward very a lot of apps for
the hymns and the Scriptures talks
everything even a family history
genealogy there's so many apps at the
LDS Church is coming out with and it's
really cool I mean we just in our
building we just installed Wi-Fi let it
be know the password they know that came
and so people can use technology in the
excited school class etc so it's pretty
cool it is gone I don't know I i I'm not
a practicing Jew but we yeah so good
imagines tablets in service I don't know
I I don't know I feel like
because it varies by religion in church
I mean yeah Richard what do you have to
say about this yeah i'm i was raised
mormon well i still go occasionally not
as much as I used to but yeah you can
see like the church has an official app
you can reload and it has like all the
scriptures and manuals it's on the
school match door and all that yeah
that's awesome yeah and you can get like
the hymns and it really yeah huh so um
it's interesting because like in church
you see like everyone has their like in
sunday school class everyone just has
their phone or their tablet really
they're reading the scriptures and
falling along with moss and stuff yeah
that's pretty cool like that um I was
reading in that new york times article
we taught me yes sir there's a website
called uh we gather dot-com okay I guess
I'm lets you cater your churches uh sir
like you know your churches uh whatever
right to uh to this app but you also
make in-house donations using this app
as well so you can tether it to whatever
you're gonna get away that easily
exactly so you can you know tithe using
your tablet right instead of actually
passing around the tray yeah interesting
I I'd never thought I would see some
like that I never thought that you would
not be able to speak negatively about a
religion as we're talking about holding
it in you're about to puke right next oh
hey 404 is Arizona from Josh I just had
a question regarding venmo for Justin I
have recently downloaded and set it all
up but one thing I'm wondering is if
you're required to have funds in your
venmo account in order to make payments
and or to charge people and to if there
is a limit on how many payments you can
make from your linked bank account so i
was just wondering if you happen to know
about that anyways love the show thanks
yeah I've no I totally unfamiliar with
venmo yeah you or not no I am very
familiar yeah I use it all the time it's
perfect for like when you're out to
dinner with friends or something right
split the bill and I'll you owe me like
10 bucks you just do that through venmo
it's an app for android or iphone so uh
Souter's question yes um so you can
either have a credit
from whatever your friends send you you
know that'll go into your venmo balance
Ryan also add money to your balance like
you would like an arcade sure so you can
load up card you can load it up and that
goes from like your checking account I
believe if you want to do it from your
bank I think you're limited to thousand
dollars a week so that's the limit so
that's that's not a bad limit free
according to venimos faq ever you know I
I'm sorry to like get it down to this
level yeah but you gotta imagine there's
like drug dealers doing this sort of
stuff yeah and it I feel like that's a
pencil Jesus hints maybe then right out
there ladies do you think there's any
drug dealers that take square do you
know what I mean well they were giving
out free square hardware for awhile
anyone could get one I'm just saying I'm
not endorsing it or anything and I don't
know how easy it is to fly under the
radar yeah but and you can annotate to
according to what sale you're giving it
like lettuce pound of snow pound two
thousand dollars oh dear whatever the
going price I don't know I don't do
those things you know not to say that I
want someone to call up and explain that
to her than that out to grass shavings
you know dollars pen session oregano uh
we got to get out of here 866 404 cnet

stuff tomorrow Jill Schlesinger yeah
