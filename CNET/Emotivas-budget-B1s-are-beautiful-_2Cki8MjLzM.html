Eva's active speakers for some time they
offer excellent imaging for the desktop
at a reasonable price the new passive be
ones offer very similar designer
performance that saves you a hundred
bucks the emote IVA Airmotive be one
will probably divide people with its
angular looks but at least you can add
the magnetic grill if you want the B one
has a 5.25 inch woven glass woofer with
a folded ribbon tweeter and it's this
tweeter which gives the B one its airy
detailed sound this speaker is capable
of very solid imaging which I don't
think I've heard in a 300-dollar speaker
said before movie dialogue is also crisp
and clear sure there's not that much
bass there and popping them positive
walls is recommended but what is there
is pretty punchy if you listen to our
Kestrel folk or jazz the b1 is pretty
much your speaker if you want them to
rock a bit harder though consider adding
a subwoofer as it will also help with
home theater but these speakers aren't
the one I'd buy if I was looking to get
MOT Bo the larger team ones are a better
deal as they offer more bass and about
five times more physical speaker however
if you like the styling and want
something which can extract more detail
from your recordings than other budget
speakers the b1 is the one you should
get</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
