you just announced it in its production
trim here at the LA Auto Show and
there's nobody here you ever seen me do
a video in Auto Show with this few
people around certainly doesn't help at
the car they roll that as their sample
is done in the same color scheme as Kim
Jong Il's state ride but that said this
replaces the RL a much more staid to be
honest and more practical big premium
sedan the r LX will have either a 310
horsepower direct-injected v6 pretty
normal stuff or a little later an exotic
optional hybrid system based on that
engine but then adding three electric
motors one on the transmission the other
two are wheel mounted we'll have more on
that closer to its debut mid 2013 this
car will also have pause precision
all-wheel steering which means each rear
wheel can change its steering angle
independently for better handling and
ease of steering easy to spot one of
these cars from the front anyway jewel
eye LED headlights still a rare
extravagance in the car business and
here expressed as 16 bright eyeballs
looking at you inside there'll be a new
high-end audio system available from
Krell a boutique maker in Connecticut
that's never done an in-car system
before now down here you've got the
traditional sort of turn press and kick
knob you've seen in Acuras before but
look up here here is a touch screen that
is another interface area on top of the
control and obviously Pandora and aha
among your sources and then go up beyond
that and there's the screen you used to
be limited to in an Acura so look at
this two large screens and still the
knob controller and of course the car in
this class you can expect it'll have all
the driver assistance technologies from
lane departure to blind spot adaptive
cruise control also what they call
low-speed follow so even at very low
speeds and very low velocity traffic
this car will sit there and chase the
tail of what's in front of it kind of
nibble its way through stop and go
that's kind of slick
