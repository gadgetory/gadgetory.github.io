generation it's got a new design this
time which it didn't have before and
Apple is also pushing into fda-cleared
health tech now we've got the Apple
watch series four here in two different
sizes we just got it
we've unboxed it and now I'm gonna set
it up and I'm gonna show you what it
looks like in steel and in gold steel
and give you a guided tour on the watch
faces and how the whole interface looks
compared to the Apple watch Series three
now as far as ECG testing with heart
rate that feature is not coming until
later this year and we're gonna be doing
a lot more fitness tests on the watch
but let's dive right in and let me show
you what's new on the Apple watch series
for design the reviewing and I'm trying
out is a gold stainless steel also with
a gold Milanese band this is totally
over the top not a design would normally
wear so this is the 44 millimeter on my
wrist looks pretty similar to the other
Apple watch at first glance but I like
the larger display totally seems like my
sized watch definitely not too big
actually feels smaller than a lot of
other larger Android wear OS and even
Samsung watches so it's no pro feels
pretty compact and it feels thinner and
this is the 40 millimeter which feels
pretty small for me it doesn't it feels
a little small for my wrist but the
screens larger than the 38 so maybe more
people want to go for the 40 millimeter
if you want to see what it looks like on
a big hairy wrist like mine there you go
while there is no watch face store on
the Apple watch series 4 there are a
bunch of watch faces and some new ones
let's run them all down
so these are the 40 and the 44
millimeter Apple watch series for these
are both stainless steel which means
they're the step-up models from the
aluminum this is the regular stainless
steel is the gold stainless steel which
is a new color this kinda corresponds to
where the 38 and 42 millimeter watches
were last year but these both have
larger displays they are a little more
bezel as' a lot more bezel loose and
they fill a lot more of the screen they
also have curved edges and let's take a
look this is one of the new infographic
watch faces this is not available on
other Apple watches so it fits 8 into
here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and you can
customize it as well by adjusting color
now all the Apple watch watch faces of
some degree of customization
there are no extra watch faces beyond
the ones that Apple supplies so no watch
face store yet but there are new
complications which means bits of
information that have extra bits of info
here UV index which is a new one sunrise
sunset stopwatch stocks by the way you
can feel on this crown that it has new
haptic feedback so as I turn it I get a
little clicky feels so that's also new
heartrate calendar so you could do that
you could change these up you can change
all of them you can actually change the
ones in the middle you can add a new
calendar something herbs around on top
let's say do heart rate and if I tap
these I can adjust them all as well this
display definitely looks a lot bigger
and you can tell if you go back to the
Grado apps which is always on the Apple
watch here I don't use it that often the
icons here are a lot larger to touch
usually they're pretty tiny on previous
Apple watches now they're approaching
something my finger could reach so
that's what the two new Apple watch
series for watches look like
side-by-side but let's compare the Apple
watch series for 44 millimeter next to
the Apple watch series 342 millimeter
this is the largest Apple watch series 3
steel this is the largest Apple watch
series for also steal the gold steel so
let's lay these side-by-side and now you
can really see the different
this really seems small this seam is big
the cases are not that different so it
is bigger but I don't think it's crazy
big I like the size of this a lot the
big difference too is the watch faces
look a lot larger and that's because
these this display here goes edge to
edge a lot more now they both use
circular watch faces it looks like
pretty perfectly circular that one looks
a little more oval let's compare a few
other of the watch faces now liquid
metal is one of those new flashy motion
watch faces that's on the new Apple
watch but it's also in watch OS 5 but it
looks a lot different here they're
filling out the display here they put it
into like a little circle so it almost
feels like a liquid metal moon it's a
very big difference it's a shame they
didn't fill out the display here and
just show you it but if you want to look
at what the display on the old Apple
watch really looks like edge to edge the
photo watch face shows it off you can
see it's squared off and you can see the
bezels here compared to here where it's
a lot larger and curved so it's really
about extra screen size so the speaker
on the new watch is also louder so let's
test that out what's the weather that's
Apple watch Series three what's the
weather that's a lot better
also these watches with watch OS five
you can now just raise it right to your
face and and just say what you want and
not have to say hey Siri good news is
the new Apple watches work with all your
old bands and all your old chargers so
if you already have an Apple watch then
you probably know what it's bringing to
the table the new Apple watch does not
promise better battery life on a daily
basis and it doesn't have that radical a
design look and what do its Fitness
features feel like we're gonna be doing
a lot more testing with this so stay
tuned for a full Apple watch series for
review and a lot more fitness tests here
at CNN
hey thanks for watching we just got the
Apple watch series 4 so stay tuned for a
lot more testing and a full review
coming up soon on CNN</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
