escapades of the devious Frank Underwood
here are our picks of what to try when
you finished house of cards season three
four murders were survivors house of
cards was based on a British series that
first aired in 1990 itself based on a
novel some characters and themes are the
same but there are plenty of plot
differences to make the original feel
fresh plus some incredibly sinister
performances I keep the troops in line I
put a bit of stick about i'm lee kum
Chun if you create more political drama
at the West Wing is top of the pile it's
smart fun and features politicians that
are less evil than those in house of
cards the show's creator Aaron Sorkin
most recently turned his writing talents
to the upcoming Steve Jobs biopic I'm
surprised your guys managed to keep
fitterer in a chair with the clock
should be the first one fitted no here
we are The Good Wife which airs on cnet
owner CBS isn't as dark or edgy as house
of cards but is worth a look if you
enjoy political and legal drama but
found Frank Underwood's increasingly
depraved adventures maybe a little too
intense for your tastes fine arrest me
the girl with the dragon tattoo isn't a
political drama but has plenty in common
with house of cards there's an intrepid
journalist making trouble and the eerily
Placid direction of David Fincher who
directed the first two episodes of house
of cards establishing the show's coldly
impersonal visual style if you could use
a laugh after house of cards veep fits
the bill politicians depicted in Armando
Iannucci fly-on-the-wall comedy and no
less morally bankrupt but backstabbing
attempts to climb the political ladder
tend to result in foul mouthed fast
rather than brutal murder did the
president call no yep that should be
enough political intrigue to tide you
over until season 4 if you have any
other suggestions let us know and happy
viewing
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
