I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update Microsoft's office 2013 is now
available for download but this time
around there are several versions of
office and some go by the name of office
365 and require a yearly subscription
microsoft made this a bit confusing so
here's the breakdown if you just want a
copy of office for the home it comes
with Word Excel PowerPoint and OneNote
and that's a one-time fee of one hundred
and forty dollars but you only get that
from one computer in the house and you
don't get outlook publisher and access
Microsoft would rather you choose a
subscription model for a hundred dollars
a year that price has the complete set
of Office programs and users get updates
when available the subscription is
called office 365 and it can be
installed on five computers instead of
one subscribers also get 20 gigs of
storage space online and an hour of free
Skype calls every month microsoft
executives say that in 10 years they see
everyone subscribing and treating office
is more of a service the new office was
designed to play nice with touchscreens
streamlining many common tasks to
require only a couple of clicks be sure
to read our full review to see if the
new office is a good fit for your needs
the reports were true Apple said it
would offer a fourth-generation iPad
with 128 gigs of storage starting
februari 5th the Wi-Fi only version will
cost eight hundred dollars and a
cellular version will cost nine hundred
and thirty dollars it's just a minor
update giving the tablet double the
storage capacity that would be better
for business users who load up the
tablet with large files and it's coming
out right before the new microsoft
surface pro tablet hit stores facebook
updated its mobile iOS app adding
voicemail and video recording options as
well as updates to nearby listings
facebook added these options to the
android app last week this Sunday you
can watch the superbowl from your
computer cbssports com will be streaming
the game as well as the halftime show
and you can pull up the commercials NFL
com is also live streaming the game for
free and verizon subscribers can watch
the game from their app
or android mobile device using the free
NFL mobile app we're keeping our eye on
opentable a service for online
restaurant reservations because it just
bought foodspotting for 10 million
dollars foodspotting is a website and
app for people to share photos of their
meals and speaking of food you can dine
like a top chef with the iphone app
called find eat drink culinary
professionals rate their favorite places
to eat drink and grocery shop all over
the globe so you can find a gem in your
neighborhood or while you're traveling
