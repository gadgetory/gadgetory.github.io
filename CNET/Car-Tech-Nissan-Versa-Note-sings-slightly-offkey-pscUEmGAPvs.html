behind me I like to think that somebody
needs honest product planning looked at
the Honda Fit thought that's pretty good
let's build one of our own and a couple
of years later here's what you get the
2014 Nissan Versa note SL and you've got
to admit that it looks a lot like the
second generation Honda Fit and that's a
good thing if Nissan can get it right
let's hop behind the wheel of this 2014
Nissan Versa and L with the tech package
and see exactly how close they get now
in the cabin of the Nissan Versa the
first thing you're gonna notice is that
it feels really cheap and plasticky they
don't really hide the cars price tag
here in the dashboard the good thing
about this car though is that Nissan has
done a really good job with the
packaging there's a lot of space in here
for people and things I've got the seat
adjusted for myself I'm about five nine
and you can fit a six-foot-tall adult
behind me with a decent amount of
legroom so if you want to get people
around and not take up a lot of space on
the road this is a good car for that now
ours is an SL model it's equipped with
the SLE package and that's the trim
level you're gonna want to get if you
care anything about technology now this
has got the larger 5.8 inch touchscreen
and when I say larger I'll put that in
quotes because this whole interface is
gonna be dwarfed by your average iPad
Mini but it's a decently sized screen
you're gonna get navigation and that's
gonna also come with XM Nav traffic so
if you you'll be able to see traffic on
the road the rear view camera that
you'll get in the FL package with the
tech package gets updated to Nissan's
around the view camera and that's
actually going to use cameras in the
wing mirrors and a camera on the front
to augment the rear camera to give you a
view around the vehicle that's really
helpful when parallel parking so that
you can see how close you are to the
curb and what's going on behind the
vehicle you also get dynamic trajectory
lines that when you turn the wheel
you'll see where the vehicles gonna go
on the map that makes this already small
very Park able a lot more approachable
you'll be able to squeeze into those
tiny spots without worrying about
bumping your optional 16 inch wheels on
the curb or bumping into the vehicles
ahead
you the tech package also comes with an
interesting feature that allows it to
read incoming text messages now when
you're on the road and you're driving
you don't really get a pop-up but when
your parts you get a pop-up that allows
you to either read the message on-screen
or ignore it when you're on the road the
popup only gives you the option to read
the message aloud using a text-to-speech
engine so that you can see what the
message is without having to look at the
screen or look at your phone you can
also set the system up the sim can
respond to if the people while you're
driving so they don't continue to bother
you would follow up messages so there's
the message message from m21 Goodwin
hey dude let's get soft tacos later now
the interface is pretty simple you've
got a hardware button for most of your
functions but some things are kind of
hard to find on the interface and
they've managed to some kind of a way
meth up the volume knob this should be
like a simple thing you turn one way to
get your volume louder and you turn the
other way to get it lower but I found
that if you turn it a little too quickly
it tends to like jump around a little
bit so I'm only going forward and you'll
see that it kind of like pops up and
down like in the wrong direction every
now and then so sometimes you'll be
driving around and you'll want to crank
up the volume a little bit and it'll
just pop down to mute it's kind of weird
and I don't really understand why the
volume knob doesn't work like a volume
not supposed to be but it's a cheap car
and they probably cheaped out on the
controls behind that now where the Honda
Fit has its magic rear row of seats that
kind of flips in all kinds of ways to
get you more storage space and clearance
for your things
the Nissan Versa note has an interesting
feature of its own at the FL trim level
it's called the divide and hide floor
check this out flips up comes out and it
flips back right I know I'm not
impressed either but it is kind of cool
it gives you a couple of extra inches of
vertical space it gives you a little
extra storage area for hiding things
like a laptop case underneath there when
you're not using the car and when it's
in its upper position when you fold
those seats flat you get a perfectly
flat storage area for long items so you
don't have to worry about things getting
hooked over weird inches it's a
interesting feature but it's not nearly
as cool as the magic seat but it's there
now under the hood we've got a 1.6 liter
direct-injected four-cylinder engine
that's going to do
about 109 horsepower and 107 pound-feet
of torque and those numbers are so small
that Nissan doesn't even put them on the
sticker sheet that you'll get on your
new Versa note now what that's gonna get
you is 31 miles per gallon in the city
40 on the highway and 35 combined and I
found those numbers to be pretty bang on
I've been driving this thing all week in
a variety of conditions and that trip
computer hasn't budged from 35 miles per
gallon in the entire time now the way
that Nissan is gonna help you get that
good highway fuel economy is with that
continuously variable transmission that
is aggressively tuned for efficiency and
they've also got an active shutter in
the front grille so when you hit highway
speeds and the engine doesn't need much
air flowing through the radiator it'll
actually close the shutter down in the
grille so that it's a little bit more
aerodynamically slick now let's take a
minute and hop on the road and I'll show
you how it drives when it comes time to
accelerate things also get a little bit
wonky with the continuously variable
transmission for starters you've got to
have a pretty heavy foot if you want to
really kind of coax this thing out of
that 2 to 3,000 rpm range you kind of
got to get into it lay on the pedal you
want it to jump up the problem is that
much like when you're cruising around
town the RPMs tend to hang at that one
area of the power band so you don't get
the sort of going through the gear that
you get in a normal car you just kind of
get 5,000 rpm and it just holds there
and the result just doesn't sound good
it sounds a bit like an angry vacuum
cleaner you don't really want to spend a
lot of time with your foot on the pedal
because just sounds bad of course this
isn't a sports car and the point isn't
performance the point is being able to
get that 35 miles per gallon around town
and that 40 miles per gallon on the
roads from
you need it now the first-generation
Nissan Versa Hatchback claim to fame was
that it was cheap very cheap at one
point it was the cheapest new car you
could buy in America now this 2014 model
is a bit more expensive but it's still
inexpensive this SV model is pretty
close to being fully loaded at fifteen
nine nine five and you're gonna add
seventeen hundred dollars more to that
to jump up to the SL package that's
gonna get you some nice things like
bigger wheels fog lights heated seats
and keyless entry with push-button start
now in for a penny in for a pound just
go ahead and add the tech package at
that point it's the only eight hundred
dollars and it's gonna get you a lot of
- sport tech and nice features like
Bluetooth audio streaming and Pandora
support if you care about listening to
digital music in your car that's gonna
be the one to get in our models got a
couple of other options including floor
mats and a cargo cover and of course
destination charges to bring you to an
as-tested price of nineteen fifty four
or five now that's pretty close to
twenty thousand dollars for a car with
an interior that feels this cheap but
there's a lot of space in there and it
is a nice compact car with really good
fuel economy that said I'm still looking
twice as a competition from Honda and
Hyundai</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
