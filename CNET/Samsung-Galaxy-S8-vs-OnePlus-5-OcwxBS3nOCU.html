Android phone industry with its latest
galaxy sa it delivered another top-tier
phone with gorgeous looks and a
super-fast reliable performance but it's
not the only top choice available
oneplus has been clawing its way up the
industry - and its recent 1+5 not only
looks and works great but is hundreds of
dollars less than its high end
competition so how do they stack up
against one another we compare the two
and see with its barely there bezels and
slim silhouette the SI is smaller than
the oneplus but has a bigger display
it's edge to edge screen and glossy bag
adds to the sleek aesthetic but its
biggest advantage is that it's
water-resistant and you can submerge it
in up to 4 feet of water for 30 minutes
the oneplus can handle a few drops here
and there but don't dunk it for any
significant amount of time and expect it
to keep ticking as for its design the
oneplus does look similar to years past
but it has a solid build and its
fingerprint reader is not right next to
the camera lens like it is on the s8
which is a good thing
both our review units pack a Snapdragon
835 chipset from Qualcomm the phones are
speed demons and day to day tasks work
smoothly the benchmarks reran also
reflect this as the phones are in
similarly high marks but when it came to
battery life the 1+5 surpassed the
galaxy s 8 clocking in nearly 18 hours
of continuous video playback against the
s8 16 hours both phones take bright
vibrant photos and crisp close-up shots
but the oneplus takes better low-light
pictures and the dual camera telephoto
setup takes smoother and more dramatic
portrait shots with a blurry background
the s8 takes sharper pictures with more
details at full resolution and we prefer
the white balance on the SI 2 as the
oneplus turns some pictures a little too
warm for our tape
if you're a no mess no fuss type of
person you'll prefer the oneplus is cool
minimalism it features no bloatware and
a clean interface that comes pretty
close to pure Android but while the s8
has a higher learning curve it can do a
lot more stuff and TouchWiz is a lot
easier to navigate now than years past
you'll get expandable memory and
Samsung's digital assistant bixby it
still hasn't reached its full potential
yet but when it does you can bet your
essay will be capable of even more thing
the oneplus starts out at 479 dollars
while the s8 costs upwards from 700
dollars
this one's a no-brainer at over $200
cheaper the oneplus is a better friend
to your wallet so which one should you
get the answer to that depends on your
budget if you can afford to pay the $700
you'll be satisfied with the s8 sleek
looks durable water-resistant design and
feature pack software but if you want to
save a lot more dough the oneplus is the
way to go with features like a dual
camera along your battery life and
premium hardware you'll take a smaller
hit on your wallet without feeling like
you compromised</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
