mobile payments and virtual reality I'm
Bridget Carey this is your cnet update
every year Google throws on a big show
to reveal new software it's called
google i/o and it's going on now Google
took almost three hours to get through
its news but allow me to break down the
highlights you need to know in under
three minutes let's start with the
future cool stuff virtual reality last
year Google created a way to watch
virtual reality from your smartphone
screen by encasing it in a cheap
cardboard viewer google has improved the
cardboard design to fit more phones and
there will be an app to use this on
iPhones anyone can build one at home or
even take it into the classroom a class
can go on a virtual field trip by
loading up 3d content of places around
the world so how do you get that 3d
footage Google is taking the first steps
to create a library of 3d content on
YouTube all you need is this
do-it-yourself rig of 16 cameras and
GoPro is the first to make one Google is
able to correct little imperfections in
the footage so it's making a smooth 3d
experience next up google is taking on
Apple pay with Android pay it's
basically the same as Apple pay and most
of the stores that work with Apple pay
will also work with Android pay when you
have an Android phone with an end of C
chip inside you just tap your phone to a
register sensor to pay at a store the
next operating system for Android allows
phones with fingerprint scanners to let
you pay by pressing your finger to the
scanner otherwise you'll need to unlock
your phone than normal way android pay
also is going to handle payments made
inside other apps Google Wallet is still
around as a way for you to send money to
others but Android pay is the brand they
are pushing now google also has a new
app for photos it took the best parts of
photo storage and editing tools from
google plus and separated photos into
its own app with Google photos you can
back up and store unlimited photos and
videos for free on Google servers it's
smart enough to let you search through
photos without tagging them click on a
face to see all the photos of that
person type in snowstorm on the search
and it's smart enough to find the photo
the snowstorm probably the best part is
how you can share photos with others
select the photos you want and send
someone a link to view those photos the
person doesn't need to download any
special app it's just a hyperlink and
they can save a copy of the photos in
the next version of Android code name em
there are several updates including
something called now on tap the system
can predict what you may want to ask
about based on the content of what
you're looking at such as content from
an email or a song that's playing if
you're listening to a song by Skrillex
and you ask what's his real name it
knows his means the artist you're
listening to well that's all for this
tech news update but there's more
details on all of googles news at cnet
com from our studios in New York I'm
