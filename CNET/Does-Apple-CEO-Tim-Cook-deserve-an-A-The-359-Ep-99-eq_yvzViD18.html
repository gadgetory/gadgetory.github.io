August 22nd from the scene at studios in
New York City and we are joined once
again by Roger tang and Ben Fox Rubin
for another edition of the 359 podcast
good morning guys what are we talking
about today morning happy monday
everyone we're going to talk about Apple
um did we have it did we put a headline
on we didn't will eventually we'll all
right you were in such a hurry you gotta
go sorry put up the episode number all
right who wants some let's do it we're
gonna be talking about Apple it's all
apple today um it's about Tim Cook's at
Tim Cook its five-year anniversary
anniversary were gonna do a bit of a
follow-up how is Tim done over the past
five years yeah just sort of report card
hits misses what happens in the next
five years yeah so let's let's get it
rolling yeah alright happen and audio is
to speed take it away in three two
welcome to this 359 we talked about the
top tech news of the day I'll have the
crap we want to throw in I'm Roger Cheng
I'm Ben Fox Rubin so Tim Cook will
celebrate his fifth year anniversary as
CEO of Apple on Wednesday out so figure
it's a good chance to take stock in how
he's performed it's five years lob
changes he's definitely a different CEO
for then Steve Jobs yeah but would you
say he's better or worse oh god that's
such a tough question Roger we're gonna
start with that are what the easy one
yeah okay I mean you're basically
forcing me to say that Tim Cook is a
worse CEO because Steve Jobs is like one
of the greatest most epic CEOs in
American history right so but but Tim do
not take that personally okay well you
know it's not binary it's not like he's
a worse or he's the best it's clear at
this point though that he hasn't really
filled Steve Jobs shoes I mean like no
one can really follow steve jobs at this
point that legacy said he didn't it's
not like you railroaded the company or
anything like that it's still the most
valuable company by profitable company
and it's the most profitable company so
it's very hard to you know basically
knock apple and say well you haven't
done this or we haven't done that but
you know granted that's exactly what
we're gonna do on this road cat right
but um he you know he's still continuing
to move the ship forward and it's it's
he hasn't completely so right what comes
I gotta go
let's let's start with the nice stuff
yeah what has Tim Cook done to better
Apple so we've said this before on the
podcast the iphone 6 continues to be
like the blockbuster that was like a
high-water mark so far far for the
iphone and it just did really really
well i crush their numbers well adding
the iphone 6 plus as well absolutely
absolutely got got people interested
again in an apple you know it's from
solar perspective Tim Cook has
definitely helped Apple I think apples
more charitable it's definitely more
proactive about environmental causes
yeah LGBT issues be Tim Cook came out
obviously was a big boost to the LGBT
community yeah and I i would say because
Apple is Apple that is a huge platform
to be able to be talking about those
issues yeah and Apple is also hugely
influential so when they do talk about
environmental issues not only is the
company itself more environmental but a
lot of their suppliers also said is that
that is a huge benefit I would say so
and it is good to know it's important
note Steve Jobs not he wasn't really big
on charity he thought that paying paying
taxes was good enough no no me no harsh
but that's that Steve's is um you know
that was a mother-son thing was his
persona yeah yeah absolutely i'll moving
on the negatives yeah so I mean you
talked about the iphone look the biggest
innovation that Tim Cook introduced with
the iphone is he made it a little bit
bigger right and you know and then he
made he made a little smaller what they
a scene so these are mostly hardware
tweaks that he's done he hasn't really i
mean like the biggest thing that he's
really introduced as far as a new
product and the apple watch and the
story the jury is still out as to
whether that absolutely ideal do you
know anyone within a box yeah i do see
them out in the wild more often I see
them but not but they're not a huge
amount they're not it's not blockbuster
product but no it isn't and it's being
raided up against the iphone so i feel
bad for the Apple watch in that way well
there's also beats euros Apple maps
there are a couple yeah the user what
are they done his aides they could still
turn that around I would say yeah no but
there's a slew of missteps by Apple ya
can't cook for sure still the most
profitable company in the world yes we
have to keep on that
yeah I know last 20 seconds why what's
livelier next time here what Donald five
years I would sum up 20 20 seconds five
years I would love to see what they're
gonna do in the next five years with my
iPad and the iphone is it really gonna
look different or are they gonna keep
that iconic design ready I still want to
see it's probably not gonna happen but I
still want to see a self-driving car by
Apple ever you go there okay awesome
five years why not right yeah it's going
alright more about Apple check us out
and see that I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox
Rubin thanks for listening and that's a
cut on the recording Miriam is it
doesn't rush this I'll to rush podcast
we really do you feel it let's see there
there's so much urgency there's so much
more I thought of those variable on
board say there's a lot more to unpack
20 seconds of the next five years just
pretty excited we apologize for the
haste but Roger does have an important
meeting to get to first of all just say
hi to akash he's an India right now love
show awesome oh man alright much
appreciated man really appreciate you
check this out every time we bring up
Apple somebody wants to know more about
the camera uh Nick okay that's fine it
was the phone camera thank you yeah nick
says do you think the iphone 7s dual
camera system will be as good as the
samsung galaxy 7s there's s7 edge or
note 7 I mean we don't know son oranges
we don't know yeah Samsung has been
talking a lot about their cameras and it
did perform well it looks great well I
mean it does really well in LA LG camera
actually also did really well so that
uses a dual camera system as well stuff
like the Apple cameras is a slouch at
all you know I've taken a lot of like
what I thought would be pretty from me
thank you like the low light setting for
that it's not as good I mean it's decent
but it could be better right taking
cameras ready shots in a low light
setting is still kind of iffy you know
you sometimes it comes out grainy or a
little dark you know it's just you're
not sure what you're gonna get with
those I would probably argue that
they're gonna add a whole other camera
into this phone and this is probably
going to be one of the bigger features
that they're going to announce yes I go
out and buy this thing so my expectation
would be that it would be a significant
improvement is he going to get them all
the way up to where Samsung or LG our
man will have to do testing
to find out the apple has performed very
well with its past cameras because
they're able to control the software the
hardware side no one else can really do
that to the extent that Apple can and
that's why they were able to get away
with like an eight megapixel camera for
so long with even that camera could
still shoot superior photos just by
having a lower megapixel count so hmm
you know we'll see all right sidebar
yeah buddy know about the android and
release date no nougats now I don't know
no nougats nothing all right what are
your thoughts on the new rumored home
button on the iPhone or making a lack
thereof well it's a lack of bone i think
it's it's the lack of a physical bun
it'll turn into it's like that what's
the force touch screen on your Apple
watch or such yeah oh you're trying to
oh you thinking of the word haptic the
hamster it's a haptic yes they have to
feedback you know it's not it's not an
actual physical bun it's a you know I
think it seems like a flat yeah sir I
for one welcome it because i touch my
home button so often yeah I end up
messing it up after two years that's the
thing that's the best part I feel like
breaks the most easily yeah so the
limiting that moving part is she knows
it's pretty big deal but it kind of
reminds me of when black melon a big
deal well it's a big big deal from my
guesses supplier or a parts perspective
but it reminds me of when blackberry
removed the little bald pearl oh yeah
I'm there from their phones and they
switch to a little touch pad it's always
about blackberry with yeah I know so I
can't get over those guys wait a minute
so that was a big deal they made it far
like we're getting rid of this thing it
was a well they made it a big deal but
it was more of a big deal for me like a
customer satisfaction perspective like
it broke down a lot less that's the
thing what did they what did they
replace it with it was like as a small
touchpad oh okay yeah all right honey
lil touchpad cool yeah although it made
playing brickbreaker really hard so so
so we're like three weeks away we got a
new iphone 7 coming before the holiday
season how do you think it's going to
hold up in the Chrismukkah wanza
Hanukkah solstice gift see it'll do well
it doesn't matter was this a good
strategy what the
having out before the season silly
question yes it is they've been a very
good question yeah it worked out really
well for the last couple years it'll
sell really well obviously but I we will
be rating it up against you know
previous iphone sales and it'll be
interesting to see if it does as well as
the other ones yeah it'll be rated up
against the sex videos no mercy erotic
yes theoretically it should do better
than last year's model which is an S and
you know vast models always try to do a
little bit less than the the whole new
version this one is supposed to be like
another s so we'll see like toy breaks
the rhythm of what we're expecting here
we go will the iphone be compatible with
the pencil oh that's a good question
highly highly doubt it guys don't really
I'm soaked are they still making pencil
I don't know that that might for sale
they could theoretically for the plus
right no way no no it'll be it don't get
knocked for being too much like Samsung
and the node and they ok always wanted
to differentiate how do business of me
like it's an accessory that's sold with
it I don't see it happening okay all
right I'll take that bet maybe all right
fine one dollar all right all right
let's do let's so let's do a plug on
episode 100 we've been talking about for
the yeah we have been so this is episode
99 oh my god and then tomorrow we're
gonna be doing episode 100 and less
virus right now yes which wouldn't be so
