for this SUVs were big kind of dopey
they put the sport into them when they
called sport activity vehicles not sure
I buy all that mumbo jumbo but let's
jump in this 2012 x5 xdrive35i and check
the test
now we've seen everything in the cabin
of this x5 before I'm not going to
belabor every piece of tech I encourage
you to look at our other BMW videos for
2012 to get an in-depth on all the
different systems but three things I
want to call out for you here
first of all the iDrive controller is
kind of setting itself up as the best in
the business it's easy to use in a
moving vehicle without a bunch of slop
that makes it too sensitive this may be
the perfect blend of simple universal
control the knob and dedicated buttons
like back similarly the screen the main
interface on iDrive is really turning
out to mature nicely there are some
places where I gripe like when you get
to the navigation screen this cryptic
little menu of ribbon icons on the left
still doesn't make any sense to me and I
have reviewed probably a couple dozen
cars with that
that said though notice how it has crisp
throttle response it's not laggy if you
have the convenience package on this car
you get BMW online this is still one of
the best online systems in what is very
early days for this kind of thing
letting you do Google search to find
things that you then want to navigate to
that completes the circle of what
automotive navigation always should have
been and should be in the future and of
course you can option BMW apps on a car
like this for 250 bucks you get Facebook
Twitter streaming web radio and more
it's one of the better systems out there
now again because we have the
convenience package you've got not just
a rear facing camera but you can also
turn it into a panoramic camera that
goes all the way around the three sides
of the car I also want to point out this
sports activity trim level comes with a
ginormous panoramic roof the big glass
part here in the front moves the smaller
one behind doesn't but in every case
you're going to sunburn your head if you
wish I've got real mixed emotions about
this rear seat entertainment system
first of all it's 1700 bucks I guess
it's okay and that the display is bright
decent size it's not up here in the way
of the drivers rear view mirror that's
good on the other hand it's down here in
the way of the driver and the front
passenger zel bow that's bad your DVD
deck is down here it does have aux input
somewhere apparently this serves an aux
input setting on the screen more than
that though no one's sitting back here
is going to be without an iPhone or an
Android device they won't use this much
except perhaps as a little drink table
now these X 5s are all one configuration
they're all wheel drive hence the X but
we've also got an 8-speed automatic in
this car with this unusual paddle the
thing I have a gripe with on this guy is
not in the way the thing is interfaced
to your hand but the way it works on the
road
no wonder this amazingly light put what
does that mean it must be plastic you've
got a three litre inline-six what BMW
calls TwinPower Turbo technology it's
not twin turbos they did that for a
while now it's one turbo that has two
phases one for lower rpm then it kicks
over to another scroll pattern inside
for higher rpm that should mean almost
no turbo lag which we'll check out in a
minute the numbers 300 horsepower 300
foot pounds of torque 0 to 60 s around
six point four seconds pretty impressive
considering this guy weighs up porky
4,500 pounds the downside of that weight
is the mpg 16:23 rated hmm just this
side of embarrassing and that really
means like 18 real-world average
let's go for rides this big boy feels
kind of tippy and tall there's a fair
amount of annoying road input that comes
back it's a bit harsh the other thing of
bothers me here is unless you're really
in it there's not a lot of throttle
response this car is powerful but not
always responsive you can snap it into
sport mode that will do wonders for it
but it's undoubtedly going to lower your
mpg a bit at low speed the steering gets
really quite heavy a lot of reviewers
have noted that it's not just me oh one
other thing if you look out behind me
there I mean you see within the second
row but you can get a third row dropped
in for what it's worth let's price this
x5 xdrive35i it's the turbo six not the
non turbo not the v8 the one in the
middle the one you want $59,000 like
this because we have the sport activity
trim it's a nicely equipped vehicle but
you've got to go fifty two hundred
dollars more to get all the technology I
showed you on top of that two hundred
and fifty bucks for the BMW apps support
of course you're going to do that you're
watching this on CNET seventeen hundred
dollars for the rear seat entertainment
system of course you're not going to do
that thirty five hundred dollars for an
active suspension with active roll bars
I'd like to see some of that wallow
taken out ya parts and service are
really really high on these damn things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
