gadgets including the long-awaited g5
smartphone but will it be enough to put
the company on top we spoke to see net
editors who've seen and played with the
new tech to get their first impressions
so with the g5 LG's gone with this weird
customizable almost modular approach
with the design do you see that taking
off it's a really clever approach what
LG is trying to do right now is bring
back something excitement you had
customizing your phone apps doing with
hardware these these modular plugins
right right now they've just got to one
a high audio system in another camera
grip so it's really gonna depend a lot
on third-party manufacturers and whether
or not they'll actually supported with
other modules and you know given that
it's not apple or Samsung it's unclear
whether or not these manufacturers are
gonna support this phone I like the
change to aluminum body and I do like
the fact that they listen to their fans
in the sense that a lot of people like
that removable battery and the SD card
and they made it so that it still semi
unibody and pretty looking but maintains
those features that users liked so I
think the show we're gonna see a lot of
companies pushing VR is that something
that LG is doing as well and how
successful do you think it's it's been
so far if it is LG has actually been
pretty quiet in the proto rally front
until now they've put up this new
headset and I like all the other ones it
doesn't require you to plug in a phone
but the advantage there is it's much
much lighter so it's it's easier when
you're actually using it I just plug
into your phone via a USBC cable you
know the experience is pretty much on
par with some of the other expansions
like the gear VR but you know virtual
reality hasn't really taken off for
consumers so this is really just LG
putting its stake in the ground is there
any other stuff from LG this
particularly caught your eye anything
apart from the smartphone that you think
is a really good idea glad you asked I'm
not sure if it's a good idea
it's just caught my eye the ball and
they corrected me many times because I
was used everybody was using the term
ball it's not a ball it's a rolling bot
it's a ball
it's got different features it's
supposed to be able to you can monitor
your house with it it's got a built in
camera that you can access through your
phone you can use it as a remote control
as well and so you can move it around of
your house has an infrared sensor and
remote so you can turn on your TV when
you're not home not sure why you'd want
to do that but you can make me feel pet
maybe for your pet it does have a pet
mode which was kinda random the way this
is being advertised because it was
advertised as one of the key features
and it starts freaking out pointing
lasers and it's supposed to entertain
your pet I'm thinking it'll really
traumatize your pet I'd still love to
try it out on my puppy
so LG's a huge name in technology but
unlike Samsung or Apple it's never
really had its time in the Sun with
smartphones has never been on top of the
pile if you like have you seen anything
from its new range of products that
makes you think that's going to change
LG's biggest weakness is this marketing
presence it does it can't spend as much
as Samsung on marketing it doesn't have
the cash shared Apple and so have to try
a little bit harder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
