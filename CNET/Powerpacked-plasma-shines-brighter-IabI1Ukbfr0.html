sitting next to me is Samsung's best TV
ever this is the pmf 8500 series at
Samsung's top-of-the-line plasma for
2013 superb picture quality on this TV
as well as noodles of features but the
thing about is first and foremost is the
unique stand along the bottom here you
can see it's got a curved design also
extends the entire width the television
so we actually had to bring in a wider
table for it for this video all told
most people are probably going to take
off the stand who can afford this
television and hang it on the wall but
if you decide to keep it it's one of the
cooler looking stands we've ever seen of
course there's no swivel on the design
like this but that's the price for high
style in addition to stand I also
appreciate the TV's very narrow bezel
it's got a nice metallic grayish finish
here looked at from the side it appears
a little bit like an LED TV not a plasma
all told one of the nicer looking plasma
TVs we've ever seen I mentioned features
at the top one of the other external
things you'll notice here is it's got a
little pop-up camera can press this
camera it will just pop right off the
top of the screen of course that'll
allow you to use Skype which is built
into this television as well as
Samsung's gesture control features I
didn't test it on this TV yet but last
year the gesture control wasn't all that
useful unless you really lost the remote
and we're kind of an abide speaking of
remote control that's another extra
feature on this TV it's a touchpad
remote that's got very few buttons but I
really liked how it felt very quick
responsiveness and the touchpad of
course was great for navigating the
browser built into this television the
downside of course is that you don't get
that many buttons you have to actually
go into a separate menu to select
channels directly as well as access
additional features that are usually
dedicated to buttons on standard remotes
of course this set also comes with the
latest software that's Samsung's
recommendation engine and a new on TV
suite that allows it to control your
cable locks as well as suggest different
TV shows so it kind of aims to replace
your cable boxes interface you can press
the Menu key and it takes you right to
suggestions for upcoming TV shows and
things that thinks you might like on the
downside it really doesn't integrate
your DVR very well so if you're the kind
of person that watches a lot of stuff
from your DVR the system won't be all
that useful of course Samsung packs and
plenty of apps this is the only brand
that includes HBO GO
as well as pretty much every other
streaming video service known to man
there's also a bunch of games a bunch of
audio services including Spotify so all
told the app selection here is second to
none actually did like the design of the
smart TV interface as well it's a little
bit like a smartphone you can flip from
page to page here and access different
things like those apps the on TV section
including a cross-platform browse for
streaming services there's also of
course access to the cloud and local
media so again one of the more
comprehensive Smart TV features out
there on the back panel there's plenty
to be found for HDMI three USB as well
as a single analog and put the doubles
for composite and component video you'll
also notice a big AB for samsung's
evolution kit this TV can be upgraded
basically replacing the entire brains of
the television with a forthcoming kit
that should be available at the
beginning of next year that will allow
this TV to get any of those new features
of Samsung decides to build in samsung
rounds out the feature package with four
pairs of active 3d glasses in the box
I'm not a big fan of the glasses they
didn't fit all that well and they feel a
little flimsy but since this is a
universal active 3d TV you can buy
third-party glasses if you want in
addition to gesture control you also get
voice control on the set you press a
little button on the remote control and
talk to it to perform keyword searches
for TV shows and movies but more than
its cutting-edge features and design the
thing that impressed me most about this
high-end TV was its picture quality as I
mentioned this is the best picture that
I've ever seen from Samsung and it's
right up there with the very best
Panasonic and local dimming LED TVs out
there the f 8500 exhibits extremely deep
black levels in very accurate color but
the thing that sets it apart from those
other plasma TVs is its light output
this thing can get extremely bright
almost as bright as some LED TVs and of
course that really helps picture quality
in rooms where you can't control ambient
lighting of course is where our money
the most plasma TVs are plenty bright
for most rooms but do you have one of
those extremely bright rooms you were
avoiding plasmas for that reason you
might want to look into the set of
course that brings up one final down
side this flagship TV is extremely
expensive but again you really get
plenty of picture quality features and
design for the price that's a quick tour
of Samsung's pmf 8500 plasma TV I'm
David
