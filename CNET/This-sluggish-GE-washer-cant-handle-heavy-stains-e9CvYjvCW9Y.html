this $900 top-load GE washer but there
are a few issues with it that hold it
back from greatness first of all its
performance is just not that great it
does okay in terms of stain removal but
compared to some other models we've
reviewed it just really doesn't hold up
and then also in terms of gentleness
it was pretty gentle on the clothes but
there are other models that have
performed better I do like the look of
this washer overall the display is
generally easy to use but it has this
optional Wi-Fi integration so you
actually have to spend an extra 49 bucks
to get this connect plus accessory
that's sold by GE and on Amazon that
actually just hooks into the back and it
gives this dumb washer Wi-Fi smarts
so that seems pretty simple but it's a
lot more involved than it would be if
this washer just automatically came with
Wi-Fi smarts I do like that it isn't
something you're paying a premium for so
it's just 900 bucks you're not paying
that extra 200 bucks for something you
may not want but it's gonna take a lot
more work to configure it then it would
if you just had a smart washer to begin
with so while I do like the way this
washer looks and its display I wouldn't
recommend it strictly for its lower
performance and it's sort of wonky Wi-Fi
