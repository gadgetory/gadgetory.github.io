2015 Frankfurt Auto Show none is quite
as cohesive a technology statement as
the new 2016 7 Series now financially
not in reach of all of us to be sure but
it shows what could be trickling down in
the industry soon look at some of these
features
the key fob in this car is truly amazing
it's kind of the big crowd-pleaser
it ties into a self-parking technology
where you are not even in the car you
just press and hold on the LCD
touchscreen on the key fob and the car
parks itself in a space it identified no
one else quite has that in production
yet and you can also flip back and forth
to see status screens of what condition
your cars in pre-charge the climate see
if it's got a certain electric or fuel
capacity in it
this carbon core technology is
interesting that's not a pure
carbon-fiber passenger cell that
technology remains tedious and pricey
but here they're using carbon fiber
reinforced plastic along with aluminum
and high-strength lightweight steel to
create a lighter stronger passenger cell
it's a hybrid saves about 200 pounds off
on overall 7-series not earth-shaking
for a car this heavy but weight loss is
the holy grail this technology by the
way we first saw with the ice series
cars i3 and i8 a couple years ago from
BMW the new 7 is gonna offer laser
headlights as well now Audi got out
there early on this with a limited
production r8 but this is a real
production sort of an introduction know
that laser headlights aren't like some
weapon in Star Wars aiming out into
space and beaming at people the laser
doesn't actually escape the headlight
module it creates light within it and
then that's projected out but the
upsides on this are super low power
consumption incredible beam range like
double your current high beams and these
are tiny little laser modules so they'll
be able to give the stylist more freedom
and less bulky headlight they have to
accommodate we've seen a lot of gesture
controlling cars lately at CES and if
the auto shows but BMW is really putting
it on the street here with a variety of
gestures for altering the volume taking
or declining an incoming call even
turning the system on and off or going
to navigation there are three major
gestures in this car which isn't a huge
vocabulary but to see it actually roll
out in a mainstream production car and
on top of the previous knobs touch
screens and voice command shows that we
have an awful lot of choices for how to
drive our centre stack but gesture may
end up being a credible one of those the
HUD in the new 7 Series is said to be
the largest in the industry and that's
an important ever
because the HUD needs to be large to
really function well you want to get it
as close to your existing driving
field-of-view as possible and more size
more breathing room lets it do that plus
BMW already did the best HUD graphics in
the industry I think they really use the
space well more of something good is
even better the new seven goes on sale
October of 2015 base price of 83 expect
to pay more for all the tech toys of
course however what's interesting here
is not just the basket of technologies
that are standard or optional but the
fact that this is a bit of a tacit
admission that high tech cars like Tesla
are putting some pressure on the premium
German cars to maintain their mind share
of the tech forward affluent consumers
out there with a stronger technology
message and not just being the ultimate
driving machine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
