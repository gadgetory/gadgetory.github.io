really really good stuff to just in it
so how much me isn't there right now
that's my name is Michael Steinmetz and
I'm the CEO of flow Connell we are the
first farm-to-table business we
basically bring farm-fresh product from
master growers in the Emerald triangle
straight to your home in less than 20
minutes all right Michael won't you tell
us uh so this is the customer carotene
so nice to be customer corner from their
app and then they get the signage the
different drivers that are already on
the road I see her customers someone
that's trying to come out of the closet
and say like hey I am a good father hey
I'm a good parent
hey I am a good husband hey I am a good
worker and I also smoke cannabis
cannabis deserves to be in a little jar
with an explanation of where it does and
where it came from and who made it I
think going the extra mile and the
packaging does make a difference because
I think for so long you know we have had
cannabis crumbled up in little paper
baggies whatever the dealer had is what
you've got and then we went to
dispensaries where we went to a world
where you had choices and you had
offerings but you still had no idea who
grew it you want to know if the cannabis
that you're buying comes from a farmer
that's supporting a family or if it's
you know coming from a cartel in Mexico
the way it works is basically a mobile
web app if you're not sure what you like
you can take our quiz and get a
suggestion you know euphoric energetic
uplifted creative focus relaxed sleepy
or if you know exactly what you white
you can go straight to our curated menu
you click on the strain it'll give her a
bigger picture of it a description you
can also add it to your cart what's the
most popular strain you guys so I think
most popular says it would be maybe
Island sweets gun you say and we're
doing a special dessert section for
Thanksgiving so we have this cheesecake
what other ones are coming there's a
bunch of like creme brulee right now
that names come from the farmer you know
there's a saying in the hill it's you
know do you make it you have to name it
you know we put the farmer first front
and center we give you access to their
email to their Facebook to their Twitter
account we're serving thousands of
patients weekly we have 60 percent
growth month over month every month and
I think we haven't even been expanding
geographically so I think you know the
opportunities for us to continue to grow
are tremendous</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
