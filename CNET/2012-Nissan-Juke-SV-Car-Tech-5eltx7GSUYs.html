Murano cross cab the cube and this thing
let's drive the 2012 Nissan Juke SV get
used to being stared at and checked the
tech not hard to spot a Nissan Juke
never has any production car looked more
like a frog look at the face of this
thing that's little bulging jutting
lower jaw and big old bug eyes the
taillights do something similar and the
whole car just kind of bulges roundly in
odd ways all around but what they've got
here is a very distinctive kind of a
compact sporty crossover thing let's get
inside
now inside the Juke everything's kind of
high and upright it fits the look of the
car on the outside and it's kind of a
jaunty thing lots of rounded shapes that
match that weird-looking face it's got
let's get to the center stack here we
don't have navigation but we do have
this interesting screen here you get
this on the SV or SL the upper two trim
levels two buttons climate and D mode
look what happens when I hit climate or
drive mode it changes not just the
screen but the labels on the buttons in
the drive mode setting you've got normal
sport and eco self-explanatory but each
one brings up special driving gauges on
the screen to show either your eco level
how Greenlee you're driving here's my
boost I can also get a g-force gauge
further eco information above that is a
fairly standard Nissan audio system you
see this in a lot of their cars right
now I guess that's a doubled in space so
you do have a pretty good blank palette
here to work with if you want to go down
and buy an aftermarket head unit
otherwise you're going to have am/fm no
HD radio we got a CD slot right here
iPod connector in this case means a true
iPod cable dedicated over in the glove
box there are other trim levels that
have a USB port over here which will
support USB drives and an iPod so you
get a little more flexibility I would
recommend that now upgrading to the top
trim the SL or get the navigation
packages we don't have here obviously
and you'll also get an upgraded audio
system with a Rockford Fosgate sub
otherwise you've just got these six kind
of none particular speakers around the
cabin they sound okay but not great now
depending what Nissan material is you do
your research on you either get a
standard CVT or a standard six-speed
manual I think most of these are going
to ship with a CVT but it does add $500
to the cost so we'll call that the
optional transmission and Nissan does
these very well you go back to drive
typically over here for shift ability
Sport is not engaged here it's up here
in the D mode like I showed you remember
it's a CVT it doesn't really have gears
anyway so when you're shifting you're
going through these sort of synthetic
belt points it's a transmission that has
one long continuous range of variable
ratios but they make it seem like gears
based on programming now somewhere under
all this is the engine and I'm not
surprised we can't see it that's tiny
the 1.6 liter inline-4 with a turbo you
can see that back there and direct
injection those are the two darling
technologies of small displacement
engines these days and the results speak
for themselves
188 horsepower out of this little guy
177 foot-pounds of torque gets this 3000
pound crossover up to 60 in a round
seven seconds you've got a choice of
various power trains that will affect
the mpg but the best you can do is 2732
front-wheel drive with a CVT if you get
all-wheel-drive or a manual or a
combination thereof you're going to get
down to about 25 30 mpg
okay let's go drive our froggy friend
now the first thing you notice off the
bat is it has a remarkable amount of
power for a high mileage compact
inexpensive car under eighty eight horse
is the real deal and good torque as well
you don't get a huge amount of turbo lag
or turbo slop in this vehicle good
credit to Nissan for designing an engine
that has direct injection as well as a
turbo that adds precision and they've
done a really good job of programming
this CVT gearbox to this engine and
that's something you can do very well
with the CVT because it can select any
ratio it wants within its high to low
range there are no set gears now the
interesting question is do you get the
torque vectoring all-wheel-drive and
kind of take this thing in the direction
of a kind of an inexpensive pocket rally
monster I don't know we've got the
front-wheel drive car here and I find
that handles front-wheel drive nastiness
like torque steer pretty well to add a
couple grand or more for an all-wheel
drive system than its performance
oriented I don't know if I would do that
in a car in this price class the ride is
nothing unusual it's typically sprung
and lightweight the car weighs about
3,000 pounds it doesn't feel truck ish
it doesn't feel tinny and it feels kind
of tall all the time which i think is
suitable for the car I didn't find
myself missing paddle shifters on this
car because this is a really quick
shifting transmission I mean really
quick and the paddles would seem to
complement that reaching for the gear
shift isn't that big a deal but they
missed a small opportunity there as you
go from sport mode to normal mode you
can really feel a difference in the
throttle mapping is what I'm really
feeling there it may be transmission
oriented too but it's hard to tell with
a CVT
and the Eco mode as you can imagine
really takes some of the SAP out of this
thing but the best performance like that
was just slapping this thing in the
manual mode and just loving those manual
shifts on this CVT it's a it's a real
gym ok pricing a juke is pretty
straightforward
start with the bass on an S twenty
thousand seven fifty and then blow right
by that at about four grand and go all
the way to an SL don't fiddle around in
the middle of options or the sv trim
that we have here go to the top it's the
best value you get the navigation system
upgraded audio the rockford fosgate deal
the icon display the changes buttons
leather interior keyless whole bunch of
great stuff moonroof as well and then I
would go with the CVT in this car I
think it's the right transmission you
get the perfect combination of
efficiency and performance I would skip
the all-wheel drive it sounds really
cool but 2150 on a car like this is a
very steep extra</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
