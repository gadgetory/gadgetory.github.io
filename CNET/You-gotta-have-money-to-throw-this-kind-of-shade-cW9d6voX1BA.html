warm sunlight streaming in onto your
face as your smart blinds open up for
you some fee might have an answer while
the hardware for some fees motorized
blinds is pretty simple the app enables
you to be able to control your blinds
throughout the day with remotes your
phone or scheduled scenes the problem is
the costs of blinds like this really add
up one of these blinds plus the remote
will set you back about $350 you add in
the MyLink hub that allows you to
control them with your phone and set
schedules and that's another $200 if you
want any additional remotes that add
extra controls like slat angling control
or if you want a hub that allows the
proprietary radio signals to communicate
with other smart home technology that'll
also set you back another hundred bucks
per device now one of the cool things
about blinds like this is that you can
be really hands-off with them so I could
actually schedule these so that they are
opening and closing throughout the day
based on the angle of the sunlight
around the house but the problem is that
you really require multiple blinds
around the house for it to be able to
work in concert doing a rough count
around the CNET smart home outfitting
just the ground floor with smart blinds
like these would cost upwards of seven
thousand dollars so while the hardware
is pretty reliable in the app control is
actually really intuitive and simple the
smart home integration just isn't at the
level that warrants the price but if
you're wanting to outfit a whole house I
would recommend waiting until more
competitors enter the market and more
competitive prices are available too
they consume</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
