everything google that we can pack
inside of a show let's get to it and a
few weeks ago we were wondering if
android and was going to get rid of the
app drawer with all signs pointing that
way but a new LG video showing off their
latest user experience shows off three
different styles of home screen that
allows you to keep or remove the app
drawer so you can all now take a deep
breath knowing it will be there yes your
app drawer is still safe and sound now
the constant flow of android phones
keeps on rolling and hallways new p9
flagship phone has pretty much been
completely revealed on the wonderful
world wide web the phone is expected to
have a 1080p 5.2 inch screen but you'll
notice it has a dual camera set up a
dual LED flash a fingerprint sensor and
the USBC support no secret is safe
especially in China the official
announcement will take place on april
six in london Samsung is also gearing up
you know get it gear up for the new
Galaxy s7 active codename post site in
after the Greek god of the sea according
to have a blast the s7 active is being
tested at AT&amp;amp;T now if it follows what
we've seen in the past from the active
line we can expect a less elegant design
that's really replaced with a more
durable one with possibly even better
protection from water and dust no
release date has been targeted yet and
google has been sending out its
confirmations from its raffle for google
i/o in May but if you're rejected like
that girl who did you wrong on your
senior prom well google has announced
the android experiments io challenge it
started as a showcase last year to demo
the cool things that can be done with
android your project can be anything
that leverages the power of android it
could be a game a nap or even a robot
the top three projects will earn their
creator a trip to google i/o this year
and if we're talking about experiments
google is still trying to figure out how
to deliver project ara the modular
smartphone the right way now some new
questions on google's opinion rewards
are asking how much you would pay for
different features after a purchase six
months later that really sound very
project ara like we don't know what if
any project our developments will see at
Google i/o this year
or if the project will just fade away
hopefully not now Mountain View's
Planning Office has released the latest
renders of Google's tent light campus
expansion to its googolplex office
digital reporter on the lower profile
structure designed to blend in with the
environment or it could just be the
world's largest camping trip ever and
you know what they already have
marshmallows on campus now this is still
in the very preliminary stages with no
date set for anything related to the
expansion and we normally don't get to
see much behind the walls from google
but they decided to show off a 360 tour
of their data center that you can watch
on youtube or your own google cardboard
now the thing i noticed here the most
the creepy lurking security guard guy
but if you want to peek at something
cooler you can now tour the Batcave from
Batman vs Superman with Google Maps yes
you can check out above ground below
ground and all around the Batmobile
forget the fact that the movie wasn't
that great to me and hurt to watch at
times but this doles some of that paint
and it's really just a cool fun thing
we're checking out alright that's going
to do for this week you can email us at
Google issues at cnet com or tweet me at
Brian Tom I'll be gone next week on
vacation to this glorious place I call
Hawaii so we'll skip another week and
then be back for some more of that
google it
