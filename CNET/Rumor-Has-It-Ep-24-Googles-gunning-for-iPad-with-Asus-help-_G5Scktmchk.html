tablet oh and Android phones may finally
be getting Instagram praise be all that
plus our patented yays or neighs coming
up on rumor has it
it's Tuesday March 13 2012 and you are
watching a rumor has it I'm Emily
Dreyfuss and you're like my mic isn't on
and I'm Korean baby and you're tuned
into the Internet's hottest tech game
show gambling show bow bow back and
we're each week we round up the
Internet's and the world's hottest tech
rumors and then we bet on them and then
on the end at the end of the month the
person who loses has to be humiliated
and that is today in the immolation day
copyright trademark Alvin as well 2011
everything just in case of me wants to
steal that idea to cult Pope but bleep
bleep what's the official not be said
yeah her name's Colton cult classic era
parka yeah um gasps yeah we were trying
not to say it let's take a look at the
board yes it's I'm currently winning but
today that is humiliation Jerri will be
taken down a notch because I'm going to
have to pay for losing last month right
so at the end of this month if all goes
as emily plans it i'm gonna lose big
yeah and I am gonna seriously force you
to embarrass yourself in a way that you
have not even experienced because as you
guys are about to see right now in the
video that may or may not blow your
minds I actually really really embarrass
myself in public yeah like up until now
like humiliation day has been kind of
humiliated aim pretty tame exactly and
it's been humiliating but it's also been
do you like fine like we can handle it
were not like over-the-top blushing
crazy like you know I were the banana
costume you devil sticked which wasn't
even embarrassing yes i love devil
stickin so mostly were just doing it for
the humor but the other day was actually
embarrassing like Emily was actually
embarrassed we're just wanted to do
even-steven residenza I was embarrassed
like in the background like pretending
like we did like we weren't a partner
like we don't know her that we're not
with her yeah so this one is a good one
and should we watch it yeah let's do it
ready all right here's humiliation day
Oh
you
Oh
Oh
unbelievable mg oh my god so that was
actually right after the announcement
and what was so hilarious about it was
the people who gathered in that crowd
around the tent we're like oh my god
that's the first girl in line for the
ipad look at her that she's setting it
up and they're like narrating the entire
experience and saying this one guy goes
oh excuse me so it's happening tomorrow
you're here in time like you're gonna
spend the night and the woman with him
goes no it's not coming out to the 16th
she's gonna be here for a week what are
you gonna eat a banana tuna they were
seriously sad and scared for her even
the Apple employees were leg gathered
around the windows like looking and
they're like and we thought they were
gonna kick us out totally and then it
then we realized that this is just a
regular occurrence at the downtown San
Francisco apple store like everybody
ends up for Eli crushing so fast to make
to put that tent up by myself which was
difficult and embarrassing on his own
because I thought that the Apple
employees were gonna come out and be
like get off our lawn like you're on our
property but instead they're like oh no
it's happening early this year and like
through our product person is here right
and for a product that's like not even
knew it's just like enough decoration of
it so anyway for people who are
listening and not watching Emily set up
a tent in front of the apple store and
pretended to be first in line and
everybody took pictures of her and then
I had to sit in that tent while they had
left me and took video and then people
are asking me in the chat room did I
find the pictures they took of me and I
actually didn't that day though I
haven't really googled around that much
but I looked on Twitter and I looked on
google to see if anyone had put those
pictures up yeah like first dummy and
yeah why would be I was kind of confused
that they didn't put them up because
like why did they take them if they
weren't going to put them on social
media what is that for their own
personal I know which is what they're
probably taking pictures of your address
on the on the backpack I know I mean
what it's not her it's not my current
real address but that is my real
backpack so that was one time my address
sorry people who currently live there
gonna get me like not know anyway Bravo
Emily that was very so embarrassing so
well you were so gracious like there
were hundreds of people watching it felt
like even up in the building you see and
there's like a whole construction site
who stopped and we're washing yeah yeah
it was I mean everybody not like at all
think about the fact that we were gonna
draw a crowd I mean I I knew that it was
gonna be difficult to set up the tent
and do that with all those people
walking around but I didn't realize p
for could stop and point and talk to me
once I was like if you're still here in
a couple days I'll bring you food right
and late the minute we set up the tent
she's like okay peace we're out of here
my god someone saying did I promote the
show I really should have but I wanted
people to think it was real well I'd
when then I went into the apple store
cuz the guy was like what is she doing
and I'm like oh rumor has it blah blah
rumor has it and then he was like okay
whatever like is she leaving what is
happening so anyway good job thank you
goddess loser it was haul it was really
funny that was pretty good eating the
Apple was the funniest yeah that really
clinched it so deep inside you I'll put
that on my on my youtube page later um
we can have it forever and ever and I
can just watch it over and over again
but so now guys I really need your help
so that I can outdo this humiliation day
for Kareem this month if she loses if I
lose again go easy on me I know we'll
just have you double stick again like a
mystery because that was easy what were
you alright so she begins yes let's get
to our first rumor alright so this one
is interesting so back in episode 19
which was februari seventh we debuted
our very first copyrighted yay or nay
section and in that segment we asked now
it's a google tablet that will challenge
chap challenge that will challenge the
kindle fire so google is google going to
come out with its own tablet and for the
record Emily voted yes and I voted no
which is why I'm a big loser probably
because I don't know how to vote on
anything um which is why I've lost three
times bro so anyway just the other day
our good friend Carl who is one of our
viewers Hagar from our first episode
wrote to us and said one of my friends
knows a person very high up in the
Google Ashkelon they went to college
together and that source recommended
that my friend wait to get a google
tablet when it ships before June no
other details on specs or which version
of the operating system but presumably
ICS this person is high enough at Google
that they could have easily just given
my friend a tablet but I guess that's
just not the kind of relationship they
have hmmmm so very interesting right so
we've already reported on this rumor and
then our friend Carl kind of helped us
along with this you know this rumor is
still happening cuz I was over a month
ago when we talked about it according to
our other good friends didja time oh yes
our favorite friends IDing industry
sources which means there are not ranked
Google is getting together with ASUS
issues and will unveil a 7-inch
co-branded tablet pc as early as May hmm
with the model targeting amazon's kindle
fire and it'll be priced at between one
hundred ninety nine dollars and $249
according to the report google was
eyeing some other people to help them
out with this because they're not going
to build the hardware for it they were
HTC and acer the usual suspects in when
it comes to tablet and but finally
landed on a sous because apparently it
was the moat that company was the most
willing to cooperate with Google which
basically means that they were willing
to do things Google's way because
everybody else like had their own input
and Google was like no thanks like we
want literally 20 to build it in our fat
in your factory yeah exactly and we want
to be in charge of everything so this
rumor has been around as I said for
several months and people even
speculated that the new tablet would be
called the Google Play but because of
people because of URL filings like they
were violent for the domain name
although we saw last week that's
actually the rebranded name of the
android market so oh yeah play ended up
being something else but so this rumor
has been around um cnet even reported on
it last month and the Google branded
tablet will have a parent Lee a 1280 by
800 pixel resolution
7 7 inch display and according to
Richard shim an analyst at DisplaySearch
production is slated for April which
drives with may release so this is it's
just kind of an odd rumor because
they're already or Brazilian Android
tablets that are Google tablets so for
for a while we were confused about what
would make this different and then we're
thinking oh the way that it's different
is that Google will actually be
manufacturing it but then now it's
muddled with the fact that asus would be
right manufacturing and if like the the
google nexus like that phone i think HTC
made that phone though and so but they
were you know had tight control they
were yeah it was a google branded thing
rather than simply an HTC branded
something running running android
exactly so if google is in charge of
everything then google it has you know
the capability is or the rights to
change whatever they want on it and then
it's yeah their thing but they haven't
actually manufacturing wonder if this
rumor indicates that google kind of
blames the manufacturers for the failure
of their android tablets and they're
like if we were just doing it ourselves
it would be better i know everything
will be different no well maybe I mean
part of that I think the not I don't
want to say cuz Android is doing well
obviously it's a big competitor for ipad
whatever but there's so many of them and
so it kind of like you know makes its so
fragmented and it saturates the market
yeah like okay so what's the difference
between buying a motorola android device
or a HTC android device or like the
walgreens tower at the what yeah exactly
the one that you can buy at walgreens
it's like a boo I wish I could remember
the name of it I forget but yeah and and
so what's different so then you know if
Google is doing it themselves and
they'll have like a heavy hand oh yeah
and this will be the flagship Android
tablet which is what has been needed
yeah exactly that's exactly right yeah
so and you know other than that
everything they all kind of look the
same so it looks at the like the bet
that I place back in episode 19 will
help me continue my strategy of placing
the worst bets ever know your people
wait 200 years old because the last two
months you bet really smartly oh you
want too much you want to want to feel
like I didn't I feel like I didn't win
it's just that
los you ensure think of it the opposite
way I think that I just played like
clean beds lever I was like that go
against my Orleans when you were losing
I was like this wasn't me who won it's
just Kareem has has failed in this month
but I think that I failed these months
and you one will say I made some of the
dumbest bets in the history of tech
bedding I know I mean the next the next
couple that we'll get to in a few in a
few minutes is probably the worst one
that I ever I know there is a bet that
is going to come back and haunt me and
the second half of the show oh god okay
but before we get to that let's get to
the next rumor which is reported by The
Wall Street Journal and it's a rather
odd and strange rumor because it
involves Intel maybe building a
television subscription service whoa hey
whoa why would a chip maker want to do
that how do why would they think they
could so the Wall Street Journal is
reporting that the pc chip maker is
developing a new web-based TV service to
compete with cable satellite and telco
TV services and it would be delivered
via and Intel designed set-top box that
would offer a virtual cable service
people familiar with the effort drink
that ignorance anonymous set the service
would bundle TV channels together much
like cable does so my first thing that I
want to say is boo why would you do that
first of all Intel you're not anywhere
involved in in thank you now anywhere
involved in this type of content
delivery before so it's like a whole new
world for them that they're going to be
completely like fish out of water when
entering and the only way to really
compete with all of these other people
offering the same services is to do it
all a cart that's what the people want
that's why amazon and itunes have been
taking a little bit of the market share
away and coaxing people to give up their
cable and to become cable cutters like
me but it's not a perfect system and
what we need the cable colors of the
world we need a like
portable all a cart delivery for our
favorite content and Intel if you're not
gonna do it that way why do it at all
like you're literally late to the game
you don't know how you don't know if
I'll a 25 years yeah like no one has
explained it to you you like they're
already like established people trying
to do it the only way to make it work is
to change the rules if you're not going
to do that literally give up right now
take it from the three of us in this
podcast room you're destined for failure
if you bundle everything together
however i want to say we have all more
things about the rumor which is that
this is not entirely unprecedented for
intel to be interested in TV services
because back in 2008 they actually
displayed partnering with yahoo to do
web connected tvs at the time they were
just we thought demonstrating that to
show that their chips should go into
televisions as televisions get smarter
um but maybe it's just that TV is close
to their heart could be golly Bob Jesus
um and now just want water tellest yak
that is I really want to get involved in
the okay I was trying to do Elvis i
think i was working um but now so maybe
they just really want to be in the TV
industry the thing is it's everyone
wants in Apple wants in with apple TV
Google wants in with google TV because
it we pay a lot of money for it and as
much as people are on their computers
and on their smartphones people watch TV
and it is a big humongous industry with
advertisers in Hollywood and everything
behind it people want to piece the pie
and it's it's a changing market so
there's a lot of room to innovate one
unfortunate thing for Intel and with
this rumor that they point out that
Maggie Riordan pointed out when she did
some analysis of this rumor I said if
they're really going to do a set-top box
like Roku or like Apple TV so late in
the game where they don't have any
content deals with the distributors yet
some one major caveat might happen and
that is that broadband providers have
been talking about throttling high data
use customers so that their internet
speed goes down if they stream a ton of
video
I want to say that that is the most
infuriating thing I've ever heard and as
someone whose dreams ninety-eight
percent of my content except when I'm
watching The Voice on Mondays because
there's nothing else to watch and i
watch that with my bunny ears yo um I
would be the person who would be
throttled completely I download and
stream everything and just if that
happens get comcast are there are other
broadband providers but i'm not i'm
talking to you comcast in san francisco
if you do that i am going to use this
podcast I'm going to be evangelists to
get the other cable cutters of the world
into the street we are going to march to
your offices on potrero street and 16th
in san fran districts where you drop off
the box well they are going to be the
ones who will hear my yelling this is
don't take away our freedom we will will
we occupy the airwaves if I broadband
you do that okay we're just gonna all of
us are just gonna download everything
yes download blow up their system yeah
we'll do a DDoS attack on our gonna blow
up the tube why our own our own
computers I mean another side is that my
internet yesterday slowed down
considerably and I had to go to my
boyfriend's office and say pardon me my
darling have you downloaded so much
content that we may have reached our
limit for the month and he was like oh
potentially and he's like it's not that
big of a deal right because it's the end
of the month I was like it's the 11th
right like I need my internet so badly
so this would be upsetting but it would
be very strange until did this okay and
I have one more little just for the lulz
funny haha rumor if we have time before
the break we do um okay so just for the
haha's anthony amazon executive leaked
that he is the head of the secret future
original program
amazon by updating his linkedin profile
what did he literally wrote that he is
the vice president of original
television at amazon unfortunately at
the moment guys this is where the LOL it
comes in amazon doesn't have any
original content yeah yeah and as far as
we know that's what they do hello I
guess it is a vote on this I think we
did I think we were I think we did I
hope we didn't only vote that Disney was
something too sometimes we don't vote
stupidly but um yeah so the note I wrote
here was lol because sorry I know that
dumb not were supposed to say those
things out loud but I did it anyways
this guy is a former executive from 20th
Century Fox I would sure we could play
that music cuz that's my favorite music
um and so it makes sense that he would
be brought on to Amazon as the head of
original programming and after fortune
magazine noticed this on linkedin where
apparently they were just trolling and
asked him for comment he changed it but
i have to point something out he didn't
do the greatest job of changing it
because he changed it to vice president
of production at amazon studios which
doesn't exist the steam which also
sounds like vice president of original
programming on because amazon doesn't
have Amazon Studios yeah yeah so I
gather he was just so excited he had to
get ya I don't you it totally it's true
um but so i think that means we're gonna
be able to watch a show and we should
probably take that's next week on which
b-list actor is going to be starring in
it and i have a couple of suggestions
and what are they well probably any ex
member of The Sopranos because one of
those guys Van Sant is on the hulu one
or the netflix original i think it's the
netflix original show um but yeah let's
take bets who do you want to bring back
from the 1990s glory all right guys
let's take a quick break and you will
watch a very funny animal video or an ad
um and then we'll see you a second
you
you
welcome back you're watching rumor has
it on Tuesday what's the date March
thirteenth yes BAM and let's get back
into our rumors we have one last very
annoying and amazing and wonderful rumor
for you before we get to our this rumor
might be the tipping point of why i win
this money yeah it might literally be
the death of me on this podcast or my
rejoicing who knows um so I'll just get
to it Instagram is probably coming to
Android very very soon I'm excited for
all your android fans cuz i love
Instagram yeah wait you're excited on
our behalf you don't have an Android I
don't have I have an iphone that's so
true you do you have Instagram hell yeah
why aren't we following each other I
don't know it well I'm gonna see this is
like this is the thing there's this club
of people who are an Instagram and I'm
not part of it because of my little as
you know droid incredible with the
broken bits it doesn't have its not
capable of running Instagram and I made
a bet this is why I'm so ambivalent
about this rumor do why it's like one
side of my heart is pumping with joy and
the other is not pumping at all because
it's so angry um because I bet that this
was going that Instagram was going to
come to Windows Phone 7 before it came
to Android was fun thinking I don't we
had this whole show where we talked
about Windows Phone and I was like up
and dreamland like maybe I get a windows
phone I mean I've only played with it
one minute at Jessica dole courts desk
but it was like pretty and green I liked
and maybe i'll invest they'll get it for
my next phone and then like riding that
cloud ivan a bet that it was gonna
the windows own like this is hardly even
a rumor really because i feel like we
really talked about that and we're like
and I was like I'm gonna say no and you
were like what like we were so into that
room I think we got remarried
convinced ourselves that was coming
windows on and I mean there was one good
reason I think our logic was in some
ways sound because Android is so
fragmented and right and we relay go
along and we were like all the new nokia
phones that are running windows have
placed cameras and Instagram ones for
cameras like and now Lumia is delayed
and so we had like such good solid basis
for you voting yes and me but I was just
like I'm gonna do the counter vote that
we blow and I didn't know you're lucky
us it was a lot but so this rumor is
semi hardly a rumor it's basically a
semantic question of what the word soon
means because Kevin Systrom and mike
krieger cofounders of Instagram told the
crowd at South by Southwest this weekend
that the instagram app is coming to
android really soon and that's the fact
that the basil ovens from Instagram the
horse's mouth yes that an American idiom
that many people so it is that what you
Americans so the question really hinges
on what is their definition of soon soon
could be tomorrow soon as sometimes in
Raymond soon probably means before
Windows probably does mean next yeah
because their exact quote was I don't
think it took us that long we just had
priorities since term said had we tried
to be both on Android and iPhone at the
same time it would have been tough to
innovate in the way that we have now
what he didn't mention there at all
window so apparently that their priority
is certainly not focused on window I
know and it probably maybe never is
coming to windows and maybe they're
waiting for windows 8 to come to phone
Zoe vaise near so since i voted against
myself and I wanted on my phone I want
to be part of your club but i also want
to win if I win I lose and if you lose I
mean yeah I don't know it might be worth
it and with the win-lose and yeah it
might be worth it to lose the bedding
just so you have it on your phone
absolutely I would much rather win life
than the podcast I think the podcast is
life this life wow this is really having
a crisis of authenticity so I don't know
what I don't know
you mean so let us give on to yay or nay
yay or nay trademark copyrighted all
rights reserved 2012 would you like to
read them sure and I will be the
stenographer stenographer the scribe um
CNN to acquire Mashable I say may I say
yay because CNN is desperate and they
have been trying to like rule Twitter
since before Twitter was even a thing
that I cared about and like when you
watch their news instead of reporting
they just say so and so Jane 92 72 on
Twitter so they feel this way about the
fact that everyone says obama is a
muslim what Mashable does well exactly
and magic like literally does rule
Twitter like they write anything and
it's trending yeah and I just don't know
how they do it and I bet CNN is like we
will pay you whatever it was that we
were paying Wolf Blitzer and by you so
next by you not to be confused with on
the bayou we're gonna eat ourselves some
shellfish oh yeah I you roast not that's
not for thanks darlin first of all bio
by arrows can make clean no no that's in
Massachusetts they're gonna have clamp
they know they have you have a Croft
crawfish daddy but less costly okay um
okay um paypal to launch mobile payments
dongle yeah like a square thing yeah I
say yeah I say yay to absolutely the
inverse of square it's like you're the
one who would have it oh well maybe it's
not maybe it would be for sellers when I
was first hearing about I thought they
were saying that you and I would have
our own dongle attached to our pain but
that doesn't make it easy for sellers
yeah to have it and then you can pay
with your paypal yeah will the ipad come
to sprint yay yay it has to
whoo mark my words yeah is dan hesse
going to be booted from sprint as CEO I
say yay I also say yay oh no sorry nokia
to launch Windows 8 tablet later this
year I say yay I also say yay because
obviously that makes so much sense that
they would do that I mean it totally
makes sense i wrote a whole thing about
it we kind of we don't have to talk
about it for very long but it makes it
makes a lot of sense and the only words
of wisdom i have for nokia is to be
careful be careful how you release this
thing because everybody is like well the
kindle fire did it they're competing
they're competing with the ipad they're
doing all this stuff listen the kindle
fire was a very special case it was
about the price it was about the time of
year that it came out it was what it
included in it if Nokia releases this
Windows 8 tablet which I'm sure they
will they really need to make it
something special and they need to make
it different and that's the only way
it's going to compete in such a
saturated market that's all I'm going to
say about it I think you're right and I
think that they could they have the
potential to I mean did you see how Seth
Rosenblatt was so excited about the
prototype one that he had running
Windows 8 yeah I mean Windows 8 is like
optimized for touching and moving and
you know combining with your computer
combining with your phone like it makes
sense but Nokia really and it makes
sense for nokia to want to get into the
tablet market because that's the only
way they're gonna be able to compete in
the smartphone market you know like it
all it all comes together but it all
comes together together maybe but they
just really they need to be careful mmm
they need to tread light yes I think
that probably everyone is always telling
nokia that like be careful don't mess up
claw I'm honest I exactly yeah we want
you to succeed like you used I mean they
used to be at the top like everybody had
a nokia phone they used to be at the top
of the yeah you know smartphone or
regular phone or whatever although cell
phone that's back when they were just
called cell phone I know back before
yeah they weren't even called feature
phones yet so I'm rooting for you nokia
i really want you to succeed but i will
have you made rather some ecard oh no
that was for code a code on okay so that
was our
yay or nay section
and copyright in 2012 shall we now move
on to the betting round now fan out now
we should do a harmony now I can't get
out much tone-deaf all right do you want
to continue is Intel building a
subscription TV service um I say no I'm
gonna say yes because they're dumb oh no
but i don't know i actually think intel
is a great company and i love their
