it's elite because it comes with the
Xbox one elite wireless controller so
let's see what this looks like it also
has a specialized hard drive inside the
Xbox one we can't see that but I could
talk to you about it here's the bundle
it is five hundred dollars and you can
kind of see right off the bat front and
center is that Xbox one controller which
I really liked and you can read my full
review of the controller the Xbox with a
terabyte solid-state drive for five
hundred bucks okay on the left side of
the box here
just your standard power supply and and
guts like that you've seen that a
million times before let's put this to
the side because come on you've done
this before
alright I have an awful feeling the
console is just gonna look like every
other xbox one we've ever seen but who
knows maybe it's special in some way no
it's not
it's not really any different I hate to
disappoint everybody yeah but what it
does have on the inside is special it's
got a 1 terabyte solid-state hybrid
drive so that's interesting because that
could potentially mean the Xbox one
interface loads a little quicker maybe
games load a little bit quicker because
solid-state drive allows for caching and
quicker access to stuff so it's entirely
possible again I have not tested that
out that is just something I'm throwing
out there it's a possibility but that's
really all you're getting $500 you may
not hear that you're getting a lot of
stuff but again this is $150 by itself
and Xbox one with a one terabyte drive
usually goes for roughly 400 bucks so in
theory maybe you're saving around $50
with this package there you have it
the Xbox one elite bundle I'm Jeff
