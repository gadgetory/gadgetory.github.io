Veronica Belmont and this is the show
where we talk about all the wild
wackiest cool stuff we see on the crave
blog and today I have a very special
guest or two miss molly wood yes hello
hello thank you for coming on thanks for
having me so you're going to tell me a
little bit about some cool baby tech I
am I don't know if you can tell from
this angle but i am very expecting as of
not very long from now a couple weeks
and so as a first-time parent i'm all
about baby technology right especially
one that i read about today the why cry
baby oh my baby crying analyzer know it
cost 170 dollars which is a lot by new
parent apparently it's supposed to be a
little analyzer thing that tells you why
your baby's crying oh how is that
possible and how can they know if
they're right or not I guess it's
supposed to analyzed like the different
levels of stress and the tone and then
tell you if they're hungry or their PP
or just you know kind of grouchy you can
tell if they're poopy I think so too
that's the one you don't even hit that
all right what else you got I've also
got the there are a million strollers
out there that actually have like
speakers in the canopy kind of like a
mommy boombox yeah if you're walking
around with a Blee like pushing but I'm
super into this one called the I baby
it's only 45 bucks and it actually has a
doc for either the ipod of the ipod mini
so you can just rock your tune start
indoctrinated your baby with your muse a
disease that is very san francisco right
off the bat they're calling back to our
earlier bowel movement conversation
roto-rooter is having a contest where
you can win the most pimped out toilet I
have ever seen I mean okay haven't seen
that many pimped out toilets yeah this
one has a 20 inch LCD it has a DVD
player it has a refrigerator that comes
stocked with like beer and water and our
stuff comes with the star wars DVD xbox
360 X varies 60 like okay I know a lot
of people like to spend time quality
time on the John but this is ridiculous
you want to live in there
it's even got like a little carpet on
the top of the toilet seat because
obviously you're not meant to just be
using oh and don't forget the best part
if you spend too much time there's
always the emergency button in cakephp
help call roto-rooter and they can come
take care of all your problems or maybe
not all your problems if you spent that
kind of money on a toilet well that
one's freak say give it to you it's
supposed to be like a promotion if you
happen to have an extra sixty eight
hundred dollars lying around you can get
a shower sauna combination set up in
your very own bathroom I called the
Utopia steam shower I need that you
especially would love this stuff after
you have the baby is to relax and like a
key in there and get away get away hi
little devil exactly i mean the one
thing that's kind of bad about it though
is you can't go from the steam room to
the shower there's no like door in
between them oh really they're connected
but you have to get out and actually
like get freezing cold in your bathroom
next warm i guess you had a heat lamp
and a heated floor well if your original
before this you probably have that all
set up already it's beso yeah yeah so
what else you got for me other than baby
stuff um I have looked at the occasional
non baby item valentine's Day is coming
up so I've decided that I clearly need a
paint gadget who doesn't and you know I
thought that the LG chocolate phone
series was like a little bit silly and I
thought that chocolate name didn't make
that much sense until i realized the
genius of being able to come out with
all the different colors they have the
mint chocolate green of course they have
the chocolate wine which is like the
burgundy one and now they're doing
strawberry chocolate don't forget about
the white chocolate too we talked about
that I'm grave if one of the first
episode of course the wide shot so
strawberry chocolate the weird thing
about strawberry chocolate phone though
is that it's pink and strawberries
aren't exactly pink yeah but I guess
that's true I don't know that for some
reason I'm kind of feeling it anyway
it's really cute well I mean what else
could be pink like watermelon chocolate
yeah bubblegum chocolate oh no no that
wouldn't work so you know strawberry
chocolate it's really the perfect gift
for a girl for Valentine's Day I mean
it's got chocolate it's pink and
involves a two-year commitment to your
commitment no it's not what every woman
wants that's right for Valentine's Day
so my final thing is I know and you're
probably not gonna be able to get
out too much once you have the baby but
if you do making it sound like Jail I
mean it's not toilet so you can get the
itunes has a plug-in now that's out
called the I concert Cal and it works
with ical and also with itunes so what
it does is it scans your iTunes library
and then if there's going to be a band
that you like that's coming into town
and your zip code it puts it
automatically right on your calendar
that is cool hmm although does your
calendar have to be public because there
are certain fans that I really like that
I wouldn't necessarily want people to
think that I'm going to see you concert
or maybe I don't love them they just
happen to be in my library no reason so
like what's your what would a man can't
we're going to talk about that later
maybe I can show you some later all
right well then well thanks for coming
on the show thanks for having to go look
at her ical calendar her in concert
