from Glyph the atom SSD and the atom
rate SST now both dry are very similar
and very different at the same time now
both of them come with very sturdy
aluminum casing plus this removable
rough protective case and that means not
only they can survive a drop for my
height down they can also survive if you
happen to step on them no matter how
happy you are they both support the
latest USB 3.1 gen2 that has two cap
speed up 10 gigabit per second and have
this is PC port right here and that
means they couldn't work right away with
your 12 inch MacBook or the new MacBook
Pros without a dongle they also work
with all existing computer
thanks to this included compatible cable
right here us PC to us PA now the atom
SSD has just one source state drive on
the inside and in testing it has a top
speed of some 430 megabyte per second
the fastest ever seen for a non rate
purple dry on the other hand the atom
red SSD here has two subscript right on
the inside combine in one single read
volume of red 0 and that mean is
extremely fast with the top speed of
some 675 megabyte per second the fastest
ever seen for all external drives now
the atom SSD here is great as a general
dry you can use it to extend your laptop
storage space or as a backup drive the
atom read SSD here is mostly for hard
data later that you are working on like
a movie that you editing or a high-def
movie you are watching because red 0 is
optimized for speed and not data
protection you don't want to use this
one here to store import data or as a
backup Drive that's because if one of
the drives on the inside fail it will
lose data on both of them now you can
see the pricing and the capacity on the
screen but basically the red drive is
just about $10 more expensive than the
other one of same capacity obviously it
never hurts to get them both who's
exactly why I do obtain one table
- tada that's only because I'm don't go
and these are the Adam SST and Adam raid
SSD drive Bunkley</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
