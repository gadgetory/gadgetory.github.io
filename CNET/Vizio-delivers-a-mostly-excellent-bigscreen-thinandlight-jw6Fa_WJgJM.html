this is a look at the Vizio CT 15 tb1
still best known for its TVs Vizio
entered the PC market more than a year
ago with the goal of creating affordable
computers that still looked good and for
the most part that's what you get with
the b1 the anodized aluminum unibody
construction not only looks great but
gives it a very solid feel though it's
travel weight exceeds five pounds so
while it's very thin it's not all that
light it is very clean looking outside
though ports are minimal you won't even
find an SD card reader inside is nice
and clean to the 1080p IPS touch panel
is excellent for work and play with wide
viewing angles the keyboard isn't the
island style kind we've seen the most of
lately so if that's what you're used to
it might take some time to adjust the
touchpad is big and responsive or at
least more responsive than their last
generation but the software support is
lacking so again if you're used to
having a lot of multi-touch gestures
available or even just palm check to
prevent accidentally opening the windows
8 charm bar you might be disappointed
also considering it's more than a
thousand dollars the keyboard should be
backlit but it's not inside the case
you'll find a 3rd gen intel core i7
quad-core processor eight gigs of memory
256 gig SSD and integrated graphics the
combo performs very well for all but
graphics intensive things so playing
newer games at high settings isn't
something you want to do but it had no
problem with playback of high bitrate
full HD movies if battery life is
important to you the Vizio ran for seven
hours on our video drain test which is
great and you should be able to push
past that mark for less intensive tasks
all in all a very nice laptop it just
needs a little more polish I'm Josh
Coleman and that's the Vizio CT 15
