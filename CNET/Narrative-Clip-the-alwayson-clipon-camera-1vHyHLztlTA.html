can you see it yeah it's right here
it's the narrative clip it's not that
hard to spot but it's one of a growing
wave of wearable cameras that are
appearing now that wearable tech seems
to be vying for every part of your body
narrative clip is not alone there are
other products like the autography and
Sony's lifelogging camera concept that
are all attempting to kind of do the
same thing a lot of what Google glass is
also trying to do which is to capture
the moments in your life and remember
them for you all throughout the day
could be creepy could be inspirational
depending on who you are the idea is
based on life logging and this goes all
the way back to Gordon Bell in my life
bits and projects that attempted to take
all of your memories out of all the
Distilled bits of data in your life and
collect them and allow you to browse
through them and what that means
basically is that this is taking a
picture twice every minute that's simple
and it's an automatic process there's a
5 megapixel camera in here it's got an
accelerometer magnetometer and GPS and
it keeps track of the position of the
camera it keeps everything upright and
it collects all of those photos in a
photo quality that's kind of like an
iPhone for nothing
high-end or fancy and if you want to
take a manual photo all you do is you
double tap now if you thought Google
glass was potentially invasive well it's
harder to see this coming you could wear
it on your hat you could wear it on your
sweater you could wear it on your jacket
I wore it all around town and a lot of
times people didn't really even know
what it was but the question was could I
actually capture a picture that would
look like anything unlike Google glass
where you can aim with a viewfinder
you're kind of on your own here a little
tilt up and down could be all the
difference between looking at someone's
face or shooting a picture of the clouds
or your jacket and it's pretty hit or
miss but that's kind of the idea because
first of all you cannot pair the
narrative clip with your phone no
weirdly surprisingly it actually plugs
into your computer with micro USB you
upload the photos to the cloud service
that narrative clip offers or locally to
your hard drive and then there is an app
that your phone accesses that if you're
connected to that cloud service pulls
all the photos
back down for you to browse kind of
old-fashioned also creates a bit of like
a box of chocolates effect because you
don't know what you're going to get any
day that you walk around outside so if
you're looking for something that's
really an on-the-go camera kind of like
what looks see and others provide you're
not going to get that here it's not
going to be like a GoPro we're going to
be able to shoot photos on vacation and
know what you're looking at and that is
the idea behind this Kickstarter led
project is a Swedish company formerly
known as mimoto that created this to
really be low-key to not be something
you're paying attention to and not have
to micromanage all the time to its
credit I kept forgetting that I was
wearing it I'd walk around and people
would say what is that on you and I go
oh yeah I'm still wearing the camera and
that's the idea to blend in and be
invisible but this is 279 for the
privilege of being involved on the
narrative Clips early days which is a
lot of money for a camera that doesn't
really do anything that a lot of
point-and-shoots at the same price would
do or fancy or smartphone cameras so
that's also including a year of
narrative clip cloud service but once
that runs out it will cost $9 a month to
use that service so that's over a
hundred dollars a year to keep using the
service that makes narrative clip
potentially interesting you could just
download those photos directly to your
hard drive and upload them afterwards to
Instagram or Flickr or wherever else you
want to go Facebook but what's the point
because the narrative clip service
attempts to distill photos down to
moments and it claims that it does it by
looking at lighting conditions image
sharpness even facial recognition and
pulling out moments but the moments are
pretty random sometimes it could be a
picture of a street sometimes it could
be your friend eating a doughnut or it
could just be a picture of a ceiling now
you have to wear this all the time and
keep recording everything no in fact in
the narrative reviewers guide and then
on their website they recommend that you
stop taking photographs at times when it
doesn't seem appropriate
all you have to do to do that is put it
facedown where it automatically turns
off or you stick it in your pocket and
it won't take pictures anymore
but I kept forgetting to take it off so
odds are you might end up wearing this
anyhow wherever you might go and
that's the idea of wearable tech that
we're going to cameras on us all the
time watching everything we do a
panopticon hopefully not but narrative
clip is not going to be the last of its
type out there in the wearable camera
space
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
narrative clip available now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
