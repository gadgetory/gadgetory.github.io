in such a hurry to park your car that
you forgot where you put in the parking
lot or you're in the park and you've
lost your bearings or maybe you're in a
new town whatever it is a new feature in
Google now will help you find your
parking spot for you
I'm Jessica Dahl court for CNET and this
is how it works the new parking location
feature senses your velocity and when
you've stopped when you get out of the
car a Google now cards should pop up and
show you roughly where you put your car
you can tap this to expand the map and
for example turn on walking navigation
or you can tap previous locations to
track where you left your car before now
keeping tabs on your parking spot isn't
an exact science and it won't work for
everyone first you'll need to make sure
that you have version 3.4 of the Google
Search app to determine your current
version open the app press the vertical
ellipsis to open the options menu then
select help and feedback you'll see the
version number right up top next the
parking location card will only pop up
if you tell Google that you always get
around on four wheels to do this find
the button of a magic wand
this opens the customization menu press
everything else find the entry how do
you usually get around and make sure
you've selected driving you'll have the
best results if you've got Wi-Fi and
location services on remember that
location tagging is general and not very
precise you may also get some false
positives for example if you get out of
your friend's car or take the bus
somewhere also you won't be able to
recall previous parking jobs if the
location card isn't in your feet already
if you accidentally swipe it closed you
do have a few seconds to undo before
that option fades away but you can't
call it back hours after Google's new
parking location card does have some
good potential especially if the company
can learn to better pinpoint your
location as the technology develops I'm
