this is a hands-on with the new Spotify
iPad app Spotify is being in the US for
about six months now when one of the
most requested features was for a nap
dedicated to the iPad and today it's
here and we're going to have a bit of a
look at how it works essentially what
you get is a similar interface to what
you get on the desktop application
except it's down the side instead of
across the top so what you've got is
you've got a search bar you've got a
wats new catalog you've got an inbox
which is different from the one that's
on the iPhone it doesn't have a
dedicated inbox app you've got playlists
of course and people so to access
Spotify what you'll need is either a
free subscription which you can get
virus facebook login either 0 per month
there's a 499 unlimited account and
there's the premium account which is 999
which also gives you offline access to
all of your starred or saved tracks so
to start off what you do is you go up to
your search bar here and just look for
something we'll try Pennywise which is
being released today just click on the
artists brings up all the Pennywise
albums and go in here brings up a second
sort of slide out view there and just
interestingly you can actually slide
back and forward between these windows
as well once you actually bring up an
album just have a look here at some of
the playlists I've got an ozzy indie
reader so if you follow me on Spotify
you can find that playlist and you can
also bring up the cover up by just
pressing on this little button down here
brings up the cover up but as soon as
you go across like this it swaps albums
and swaps tracks it would be nice if it
had actually had a view we could see all
the albums in a playlist and not have to
switch automatically between tracks as
well okay lastly we put the settings you
can choose between offline mode you can
scroll to last.fm if you're a last.fm
member you can show on facebook if you
really want to
BAM all your Facebook followers and I
choose extreme which is the highest
bitrate as well okay and that's pretty
much it it has a bit more functionality
than the iphone app but the good thing
about it is the large cover art as far
as I'm concerned like most music
applications this is compatible with air
plays so if you want to play it to a
speaker or air express you just press
that little button got it hooked up to
an apple TV here glows green and will
play to your Apple TV so that's a little
bit on how it works if you're interested
in getting the Spotify app you can
download it now from the itunes app
store this has been ty pendlebury for
