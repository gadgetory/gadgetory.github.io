by opening up a computer open up any web
browser long as you have an internet
connection you can see your videos no
software to install you can record live
videos or take snapshots at any time and
when your camera senses motion in your
home it'll automatically send you an
email so that you can see exactly what
your camera saw and all of your
recordings are stored safely and
securely in the cloud so that you can
access them at any time you can even
download them at any time as well and
now view zone even lets you see in the
dark it's like putting on night-vision
goggles today we're announcing the new
views own night-vision camera that just
