with Cena TV and this is the Q tech news
delivered faster than a New York City
cab ride and definitely not as scary
let's get you started with your must see
moment to spider-man week here in New
York City where celebrity gamers turned
out for the launch of spider-man 3 the
video-game featuring the voices of
actors Tobey Maguire and Topher Grace
players will experience spider-man's
mysterious black suit persona would you
pay more for your TV service if it had
the content and features you wanted I
know my bill went up when I switch to
cable for HDTV but I don't feel that bad
it seems sixty percent of consumers
would do the same research by Microsoft
and Screen Digest seems to contradict
the popularly held thought that we just
want the cheapest price for our TV
service consumers are willing to pay for
lifestyle based packages rather than
just price and channels consumers also
want to maximize their TV enjoyment time
I'm with you convenience and ease of use
the two biggest priorities still I'm not
paying 600 bucks for an HD tivo period
moving through the Q Wi-Fi access at
hotels is still pretty mixed bag some
offer free every where others can drive
you insane with access charges
thankfully hotel chatter calm has their
list of 2007's best and worst hotels for
Wi-Fi the website says marriott is so
close to getting it right it's more
budget friendly hotels like residents in
courtyard and springhill suites all
offer fast free wireless and guest rooms
and lobbies but many of their legacy
properties don't holiday inn express
also getting high marks for their free
wireless now the bad news many of the
most expensive hotels don't offer free
wireless surprised chains like
intercontinental four seasons and
ritz-carlton all charge upwards of 10
bucks a day for the on ramp and many
times it's still wired time for the beta
when you have a few minutes to kill and
hot or not is way too 90s flickr combat
offers up photo battles for a quick
escape from the daily grind although
some of the images in the babes category
might be a bit risque for work the site
also offers cool cars cats Lansky
and more once you vote on a winner and
info box lets you know what percent of
people agree with you how reassuring
there's also a pic of the day and the
best 21 photos in each category finally
as summer sets in one of the better way
for a sun-kissed nation to relax than
getting all hyped up on energy drinks
major chains introducing slushy versions
of the caffeinated contingents 7-eleven
has a full throttle frozen fury Slurpee
while sonic has the not to be confused
full throttle cherry slush both are made
with Coca Cola's energy drink which
packs ginseng b-vitamin and taurine for
a frozen drink made from the category
leader TGI Fridays offers a redbull
berry blast slush combining wild berries
and that stuff that gives you wings just
think a 40-ounce ER with a hundred
milligrams of caffeine you'll never fall
asleep in the Sun got the jitters yet
you should cuz you are all cued up I'm
rich demuro with Cena TV in New York
