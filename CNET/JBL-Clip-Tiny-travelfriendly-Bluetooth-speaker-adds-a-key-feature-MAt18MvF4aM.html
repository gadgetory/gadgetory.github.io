bluetooth speaker that's the successor
to JBL's popular micro wireless speaker
it's very similar to that micro but has
a couple of small changes including a
carabiner style clip at the top instead
of a closed loop hi I'm David car noise
and welcome to another seen at first
look video like its predecessor the clip
delivers good sound for its small size
this is a mono speaker and is designed
to be laid flat or worn yes JB Oh calls
this a ready to wear speaker aside from
the clip the other big change here is
the addition of speakerphone
functionality there's a call answer end
button on the side of the speaker
along with volume controls and a
dedicated Bluetooth button for easy
pairing other extras include an audio
input as well as an integrated cord that
allows you to connect the speaker to a
non bluetooth enabled device or the
audio output on a laptop computer it's
pretty nifty how the cord stoves in the
bottom of the speaker as I said sound
quality is pretty good for what this
speaker is there's some bass just not a
lot of it and the speaker will distort
with certain tracks at higher volumes
its strongest in the mid-range and does
well with acoustical material and with
speech and it makes a good lightweight
companion for a tablet or smartphone for
watching movies television shows and
sporting events its rated as having 5
hours of battery life which isn't that
long but about average for this sized
speaker there are other speakers out
there like this one and it's not
ruggedized like divans boombox travel
which also cost 50 dollars since it
doesn't go with any sort of carrying
case it's also probably a good idea to
cover it with something especially if
you have sharp objects in your bag
because the paint on the grill can chip
off but all-in-all this retains the same
likeable qualities as the earlier micro
wireless while adding speakerphone
capabilities and it's recommended for
someone looking for a very compact
speaker that can produce decent enough
sound for its tiny size I'm David car
noise thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
