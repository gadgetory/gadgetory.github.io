use them more than just about anything
in our homes it's the first thing you do
when you wake up is turn it on and then
you turn it off before you go to bed but
at the same time you don't think about
them that much so when one burns out and
we have to replace it we can get
overwhelmed in the lighting aisle and
end up buying a bulb that doesn't make
our home feel right now there are LED
bulbs CFL bulbs incandescent bulbs
halogen bulbs and they're all different
in terms of the way they turn
electricity into light
old-school incandescent just heat up a
tungsten filament and they glow halogen
bulbs do the same thing but with a
little bit of extra gas that makes it a
bit more efficient CFL bulbs or
fluorescents they use fluorescent gases
that admit light when electricity comes
into play and then LEDs are little tiny
diodes that give off light in a very
efficient way you put them inside of a
bulb and you can really cut down on your
power usage so while you're shopping for
bulbs you just want to think about how
you want your home to feel and look do
you want bright light that's gonna help
you read do you want light that's gonna
ease you to sleep at night and be kind
of gentle do you want bright daylight
white tones to help you focus during the
day those are all different things you
can get them if you know how to look for
them you can really customize the way
your home feels so the key to brightness
is to remember to look for lumens lumens
are a unit of measure when it comes to
light that tells you how bright a bulb
is so if it has more lumens it's a
brighter bulb and what you're gonna want
to remember is that the terms are really
changing we don't really talk about
these bulbs in terms of wattages anymore
instead we talk about lumens with
brightness so if a bulb says it's a 60
watt replacement that doesn't mean it's
necessarily bright enough it just means
it's intended to replace an old-school
60 watt incandescent so the most
important number to keep in mind as
you're shopping is 800 that's the amount
of lumens that you're gonna want if you
just want a standard common light bulb
60 watt incandescent back in the day
would put out about 800 or 850 lumens of
light so if you get a bulb that's got at
least that number you're gonna be pretty
happy with the light that you get the
other numbers to keep in mind if you
want a brighter level of light like a 75
watt or 100 watt would be 1100 lumens
and 1600 lumens respectively if you want
something like an accent light like a 40
watt bulb for a side table lamp 450
lumens is a good number to look for the
other really important thing to remember
is that light bulb packaging now has
lighting facts on it just like the
nutrition facts on
food that you buy those are so important
to look at they'll tell you the amount
of lumens they'll tell you the color
temperature they'll tell you how long
the bulb will last
they'll tell you how much energy it'll
use all of that information should be
right there on the packaging make sure
you check it out
color temperature gives you a sense of
the tint of the light you know light
bulbs don't just look pure white they
often look a little yellow here if
they're hotter they look more like
bluish light it's really just the white
light spectrum represented by the Kelvin
scale the common yellowy light bulb
you're probably thinking of is 2700 K if
you go higher it's gonna get whiter and
then more bluish you can save a lot of
money by upgrading all the bulbs in your
home to LED if you're still using
incandescent an incandescent is gonna
add on average about 7 bucks a year to
your energy bill if you use it for 3
hours a day by comparison an LED that
puts out the same amount of light
well maybe add less than a dollar in
some cases so you're saving about five
or six dollars per bulb on average if
you're just talking about standard bulbs
like that
the problem with dimming is that you
have so many different kinds of light
bulbs and so many different kinds of
dimmer switches and dimming hardware and
other X factors like voltage
irregularities that it's tough to
guarantee that a given bulb is going to
dim really well on your dimmer switch if
you're really concerned that dimming my
recommendation is to upgrade to smart
bulbs because with smart bulbs you've
got dubbing mechanisms that are
standardized inside each of those bulbs
you don't have a lot of the problems
that you get with common dimmer switches
and modern bulbs with electro magnetic
interference you know what to think
about any of that if you don't want to
take that step though you're gonna want
to make sure you look for bulbs at a say
they're dimmable and be promised long
warranties and give you some reassurance
that if it doesn't work out if the bulb
flickers and it doesn't work with your
dimmer switch you can take it back and
try something else
aside from that dimming advantage smart
bulbs offer a lot of convenient features
and kind of nifty ways to control them
using voice or using your phone and they
can offer just an upgrade in the way you
interact with your light and considering
like I said that you use your light bulb
so much I think that makes a lot of
sense and prices have come down on some
of the best top-of-the-line smart bulbs
that it's not that unreasonable to make
that switch at the end of the day these
new light bulbs last for years and years
and years so it's worth ensuring that
you get the right ones know the numbers
and that won't be as hard as you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
