buy the new iPhone 10s or the 10s max if
you're looking for a reason to pick up
Apple's latest phones skip to this
timecode now these lists are based on
Apple's event things can change after a
full review you ready to do this thing
let's do it
at number five is your standard anti
phone argument the 10s and Macs have no
headphone jack you can't expand the
storage easily and you cannot change
your default apps also if you like that
home button or touch ID those are gone
too and number four they're not all that
different from the iPhone 10 the iPhone
10's and Mac's don't really have that
many new or unique tricks oh okay a
fancy bokeh effect we've seen it emojis
you've seen it not seen it face ID seen
it dual rear cameras in a vertical
orientation we've seen it if you've got
an iPhone 10 you've got very little
reason to upgrade number three is the
price the 10s starts at nine hundred and
ninety nine dollars and goes all the way
up to one thousand three hundred and
forty nine dollars the 10s max starts at
ten ninety nine and maxes out at
fourteen hundred forty nine dollars do
you really want to spend that much money
on an S model coming in number two no 5g
2018 is a terrible year for upgrading
your phone 5g networks are coming very
soon yes the 10s and Macs henceforth
known collectively as smacks have
gigabit LTE but that's a stopgap when 5g
wireless networks go online the smacks
won't be able to take advantage of them
before we get to number one let's talk
about five reasons to buy the iPhone 10
S or s max and number five we've got new
finishes on the new iPhones yes this is
very superficial but it's still a reason
there's silver space grey and gold
options and they're shiny so shiny
coming in at number four is the dual SIM
capability if you've got a work line and
a personal one you can put them both in
one phone yes lots of other phones have
had this ability in the past but the 10s
and 10's Mac's are the first iPhones to
support the feature dual Sims can also
be really handy if you travel a great
deal at number three new camera tricks
Apple showed off the ability to change
the depth of field after a picture was
taken using the newest iPhones it's kind
of like that Lytro camera that
a few years ago number two are the
storage options the iPhone 10s and 10's
Mac's can be outfitted with 512
gigabytes of storage I believe that's a
first for an iPhone as well and the
number one reason to pick up an iPhone
10s or the Mac's
is the power apple claims its newest
iPhones can launch apps up to 30% faster
at the keynote we also saw some very
impressive augmented reality apps like
an app that can analyze how you shoot a
basketball gaming looked good to the
developers will quick to note that what
we saw was only possible thanks to the
new iPhone okay back to the negative
side and a number one reason not to buy
Smacks is the iPhone 10 R it starts at
around 750 dollars and it's a lot like
this max the 10r has the same processor
and face ID as the Smacks on top of that
it generally has the same Smacks
experience no home button and gesture
based iOS while the 10r has just one
rear camera it does have a similar
portrait mode and at depth control like
this max also the 10r
has an interesting size it has a 6.1
inch screen it's a little bit bigger
than the ass and a bit smaller than the
max the 10r is kind of a wild card in
the iPhone lineup that does it for us
we'll have full reviews of the s and the
s max at CNET Amaya's actor and i'll
argue anything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
