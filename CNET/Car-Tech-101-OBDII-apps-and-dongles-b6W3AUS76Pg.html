generation to port is located under your
dash on any car sold in the US since
1996 or in Europe since 2001 look for it
within a couple feet of the steering
column usually right about where the
dash trim panel stops and the ugly parts
begin now that obd2 port is collecting
data from sensors all over your car in
the engine bay in the suspension parts
of the ABS system that detect movement
and g-forces generally speaking the
newer your car the more data feeds are
coming in there
things like throttle position fuel flow
steering wheel angle and tons more data
all right there now you get the data out
of that obd2 port into your phone or
tablet most likely through an app that
talks to one of these wireless dongles
these cost anywhere from 10 bucks to
$100 or more but that's basically your
range so they take the data harvest it
and send it out via bluetooth now the
difference in price can be quite
dramatic because some of them are a
little more limited than others I would
spend a few more bucks and make sure the
app you're using is compatible with the
dongle you're about to buy most app
support notes will tell you which ones
work the best with it pair it once and
now the fun part for the car geek there
are apps like torque that give you
amazing amounts of data from the car in
multiple configurable dashboards many of
these apps also merge in GPS and time
stamping from your phone you can even
add a video recording app to record a
view of your driving with some virtual
data readouts of your choice overlaid on
the video and GPS trajectory and speed
replayable later over a track or road
map for the everyday driver who wants to
save fuel
automatic gets a lot of buzz it's both a
proprietary dongle and an app it's focus
is not the firehose of data we just saw
but rather conclusions based on it that
coach you to drive more efficiently it
can also do automatic crash notification
if your car doesn't have that function
and beep to warn you if you're braking
too hard accelerating too hard or
exceeding the speed limit for the driver
who wants to save on their insurance
there's a breed of paid or pay as you
drive obd dongles
monitor your actual driving usage and
can then often qualify you for a
discount on your premium these also tend
to roll in things like vehicle location
monitoring and the ubiquitous crash
notification service see if your
insurance company offers one of these so
these combos of dongles and apps also
allow you to view and clear diagnostic
trouble codes like those check engine
lights look for that function if it's
important to you by the way for the
tuner you have to step up to something a
little different we've been talking
about readers that mostly go one way
reporting vehicle data but tuning your
car too hot it up require something
different like the cobb accessport which
does connect to obd ii but with a custom
controller and cable and only for a
limited number of performance cars if
you're at all interested get out there
and know your car better the data is
free and the faucet is right under your
dash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
