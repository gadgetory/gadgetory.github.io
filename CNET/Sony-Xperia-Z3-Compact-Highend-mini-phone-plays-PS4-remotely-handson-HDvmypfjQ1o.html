a look at the Sony Xperia z3 compact
it's an Android phone that packs the
same high-end tech found inside the
brand-new flagship Xperia z3 but packs
it into a much more compact 4.6 in size
now it's very easy to see the family
resemblance between the z3 compact and
it's bigger brother they both have glass
upfront and backs and they're both
completely waterproof now there are a
few differences to note though most
notably on the edge now amber z3 compact
it has a polycarbonate edging rather
than the more premium feeling metal on
the full-size model the screen is 4.6
inches across which makes a lot more
easier than using one hand in the 5.2
inch said three a four point six inches
that is actually quite a bit bigger than
the four point three inches of the said
one compact although the phone's body
itself hasn't got any bigger so it's
still very easy to use the resolution of
the z3 compact screen is only 720p which
is a step down from the Full HD of the
regular Zed 3 but in a smaller body is
actually not a lot of difference to tell
in clarity many of the key specs are the
same though they both have 2.5 gigahertz
quad-core Qualcomm processors and around
the back you'll find 20.7 megapixel
camera as only reckons that this camera
has been optimized to work particularly
well with low-light now a neat new
feature on the z3 compact and indeed the
other zimizib 3 range is the ability to
hook your phone up to your PlayStation 4
on the same Wi-Fi network and actually
play PlayStation 4 games essentially
using your phone as a second screen
experience said three compact isn't a
massive overhaul from the experience
dead 1 compact but it's bigger screen in
the same size body will be very very
welcome as will Sony's claimed two day
battery life the so free compacted do to
go on sale globally towards the end of
the year although sony has yet to say
how much it will cost so make sure to
keep your eyes on Sina
I'm Andrew ho CNET's and this is a Sony
Xperia</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
