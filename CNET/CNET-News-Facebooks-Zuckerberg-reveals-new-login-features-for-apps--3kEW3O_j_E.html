control and power back in people's hands
so now whenever you sign into a new app
with Facebook you're going to see this
dialog and if you want you're gonna be
able to easily change line by line what
you share with this app so in this case
I'm so in this case I want to sign in
but you know I might not be comfortable
yet sharing my email address or you know
revealing exactly how much I love Lana
Del Rey or you know maybe I just don't
want to listen to summer summertime
sadness on a repeat right now you know
whatever the reason is you know I don't
want to talk about it right now it's
fine I can I can just uncheck these
boxes and I'm done with the new login I
can sign in on my own terms and if I
don't want to edit anything here that I
can sign in with exactly the same number
of taps that took before there's no
extra friction it was a developer this
is going to help more people be
comfortable signing into your apps and
engaging with them there's there's one
more login product that I want to talk
to you guys about today how many times
have you installed an app and wanted to
try it out but you haven't wanted to
create a brand new account or you're not
yet ready to sign in with your real
identity today we're going to solve this
with a new service that we're
introducing called anonymous login
and the idea here is that you know even
if you don't want an app to know who you
are yet you still want a streamlined
experience for signing in that removes
the hassle of filling out all these
different fields so I mean here's how it
works you can got to see this is what
you're going to see the first time that
you tap on the anonymous login button
and and of course you know after
subsequent times it's just a one tap
experience to get in so you want
hassle-free way to log in and try apps
you probably also want an experience
that can be synced across devices which
is possible because will provide an
anonymous identifier even if we're not
telling the app who you are so you're
gonna be able to have a spear ian stats
synced without the app actually been
knowing who you are for the first time
so this is going to let you try apps
without fear and then if you want you
can always sign in with your real
identity to personalize the app a bit
later on once you're more comfortable
using that app so that's anonymous login</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
