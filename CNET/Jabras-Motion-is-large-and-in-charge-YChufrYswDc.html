and right now we're taking a first look
at the new Jabra motion Bluetooth
headset targeted right at mobile phone
users who tend to spend a lot of time
gabbing the motion is an accessory
designed for big time talkers at a
hundred and twenty nine dollars the
motion is certainly priced as a high-end
hands-free device - it goes head-to-head
against other premium Bluetooth products
such as the Plantronics Voyager legend
and jawbone era sporting a huge over ear
design and big flip-down boom mic the
Jabra motion is a serious piece of
wireless hardware as a trade-off where
it's garthe though you do get a lot of
bells and whistles connecting to phones
and tablets via wireless bluetooth
version 4.0 the motion also features an
NFC chip for fast pairing just tap the
headset against compatible phones to
link as its name implies the jabber
motion is equipped with an accelerometer
or motion sensor with it the device does
nifty tricks like automatically
answering incoming calls when you pick
the headset up or kicking in extra noise
cancellation when it detects continuous
movements such as walking in fact Jabra
claims that the motion thanks to its
dual microphones and motion sensor can
adapt intelligently to din filled
environments internal voice commands are
built-in as well which allows you to
answer in screen calls without touching
your handset the device features touch
sensitive volume controls as well other
buttons on the motion include a big call
answer end key that's hard to miss plus
a small voice and mute toggle on the
boom you can charge the motion through a
micro USB port and Jabra claims a single
charge provides seven hours of talktime
one thing I really like about the Jabra
motion bluetooth headset is its smart
phone companion app which is available
for iOS and Android devices basically
you can use the app to control many of
the headsets features right from your
phone I'm Brian Bennet for cnet.com and
this has been a first look at the Jabra
motion Bluetooth headset
