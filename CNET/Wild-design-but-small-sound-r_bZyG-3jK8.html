and right now we're taking a first look
at the BlackBerry mini stereo speaker
this tiny bluetooth smartphone accessory
cost $99.99 basically $100 and is made
to operate as both a wireless speaker
and a hands-free speakerphone the gadget
also has a pretty unconventional design
unlike typical Bluetooth speakers which
tend to be boring rectangular boxes or
cylinders the BlackBerry mini stereo
speaker is shaped like a clip the idea
is to use the speaker's u-shaped body to
slide it onto back straps shirts or
other items of clothing once attached
you can listen to music and other audio
and stereo while on the move or conduct
hands-free calls since the device also
doubles as a speakerphone hello hey you
charge of speakers rechargeable battery
via a micro USB port and the gadget has
a line in 3.5 millimeter audio jack to
connect non bluetooth devices a power
switch volume buttons and play/pause
call key are the only physical controls
now I do have some doubts about the
appeal of the BlackBerry mini stereo
speaker first I'm not sure who would
want to blast tunes or make calls from
their back strap or even where and when
they would do this for example trying
something like this on the New York City
subways and buses will land you in hot
water pretty quickly also the speaker is
on the pricey side especially
considering its small drivers which
don't get very loud and while it should
work with any handset that supports
stereo Bluetooth BlackBerry markets the
device as an accessory for its new z10
smartphone unfortunately however the
speaker doesn't take advantage of the Z
tens NFC chip for fast pairing if you
want to find out more be sure to check
back soon for a full review on Brian
Bennett for cnet.com and this has been a
first look at the BlackBerry mini stereo
speaker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
