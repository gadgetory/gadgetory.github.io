my first
CNET unboxing not only is it my first
scene that unboxing it's my first
unboxing on camera of unbox plenty off
camera but this is my first unboxing on
camera and this knife looks a little bit
this is a little scarier than normal as
I use here okay let's see how to do this
I'm a scene person I cut the seams I
just don't go
you know jagged edges see all right this
does not look like an original box it
looks like this is another box or
something else I'm gonna be able to see
this is the saddest part watching a
grown man just try to open a box but if
this is the whole three minutes just me
just struggling struggling to like cut
through tape alright now I've seen what
you've done alright this is perfect
getting better at it and we're out of
time so sorry everybody alright what do
we got here oh it's a blue box oh my
goodness this is insane can I open this
alright Teddy Ruxpin let's talk about it
so this is the new version alright this
is like the like 2018 version of Teddy
Ruxpin when I was growing up Teddy
Ruxpin came out and this thing was
insane because it was a doll that spoke
to you I realized that I've gotten older
that my childlike mind is sad that I was
very excited to have a doll that would
speak to me but I really wanted this
doll because you put a tape in his back
on audio cassette tape and then you
would read a book and he would act out
the parts he had a little friend grubby
and and my dad and I went all over the
city trying to find a Teddy Ruxpin it
was harder to find them like a Cabbage
Patch Kid if you don't know either of
these references I'm all and so the
whole idea was that you would go to Toy
Stores and wait there was no Amazon or
anything like that and my dad and I went
into the city and he had to tell me like
look Santa is so overwhelmed this year
that he said that I could help him so
that's what we're going to destroy this
special toy sir so like we were on a
from Santa little did I know said that
doesn't exist that's an unboxing of your
soul and and so we went to this Twitter
and we couldn't find it and I wanted it
so bad and we never we didn't get it
until maybe like three months after
Christmas and this teddy ruxpin was the
thing I would play with all the time and
what was great was you could play so
many things back in the day there was no
there was no come on guy get up there he
was all right I'm sure Cephas right so
what you could do is you put a tape in
his back and you can put any tape in
there so I can put like ac/dc in the
back of my Teddy Ruxpin and he would be
like you know and that was that was the
best part of the Teddy Ruxpin is that
you could manipulate him and make him
curse if you tape like that the F word
on TV
Teddy Ruxpin was like but he wouldn't
say it like he wouldn't say it like in
the Teddy Ruxpin voice he would just say
it and like the voices that you recorded
it in I'm looking for the tape deck
there's no tape deck oh it turned on now
does he turn on let's see if he turns on
should I have talked about the boxing no
honey dead eyes so talk to me
No all right hold on looks like it has
to show me something what is this
yikes Teddy Ruxpin into some weird
maite everything did not come with a
blindfold handcuffs back here oh geez
what is that right so wait how does it
turn on let's see the eternal son of a
bitch oh wait yeah I think okay oh we
n-no what come this is one of these toys
you have to let me look at the box now I
gotta look the box
alright back to the instructions then
all right we got it how to wash him oh
there's an app it's batteries before you
start remove the clear film covering
from his eyes
Oh God I don't think there is wait is
there who there is yeah yeah this is
this is like Kubrick Ian I'm hold on all
right there we go we got to hear him
talk all right
I got the fourth triple A's this guy's
can't even give me a sample
ooh look at that there's ghostly clear
eyeballs
I would love to see what it happened Lee
turns on that's why in my house I carry
a box full batteries stocked full of
different batteries a different kind
this is amazing at which you could see
what was so cool about him but I mean
yeah I don't let's see I'll take this
home and I'll play with it and I'll make
my own videos you can follow me on
instagram as I do videos with Teddy
rocks and that will be about three to
four days before I'm arrested so I am
Paul Scheer thank you so much for
letting me unbox a Teddy Ruxpin my
childhood toy the elusive childhood toy
which was way better than a Cabbage
Patch sucka Cabbage Patch
Teddy Ruxpin for up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
