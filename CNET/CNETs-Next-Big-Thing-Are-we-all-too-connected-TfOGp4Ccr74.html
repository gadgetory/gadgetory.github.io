next big thing presentation our marquee
super session on Molly woods and I'm
Brian Cooley and we're glad to have you
joining us here on what is actually our
10th anniversary of the next big thing
so how about a hand for all have you
been with us for so many of those years
staying smart here at CES very cool very
cool glad to have you here for all that
we are here of course to explore a topic
once again that is going to be we think
very much the future of technology
that's what the next big thing is all
about it's about going forward and
something it's not totally futurist
right but also not obvious although we
have a futurist it so it's good to have
a future shows a little bit yes yes so
be going in that direction as well and
it's kind of a digital reunion of sorts
as part of what we're talking about this
idea of a post mobile future that's
right mobile devices obviously have been
hot at CES and beyond and they their
usage has changed this industry
dramatically but we are looking ahead as
Brian said into the post mobile future
what happens when we start when we get
to stop finally talking about tablets
and smartphones and talk about a
connected world I know a lot of you
depart just gasping okay we're still
getting our heads wrapped around tablets
and phones to some degree especially
with our consumers and customers but the
idea here is to stop having these silos
of phones our phones and tablets and
then computers and then maybe connected
TV or just televisions another bucket
trying to get to a wall-to-wall series
of basically screens that let us get to
whatever experience we want whenever and
however and have a little more
interconnexion between those services
that's a little more difficult challenge
actually and it's not too much of a
surprise as you might imagine the CES so
far has been all about this idea of the
connected future yeah we would also like
to invite you to take part in this of
course through our social media we're
doing that with Twitter right yeah
absolutely I think you should be able to
see our hashtag shortly post on the
screen we've seen it and BTW right there
please tweet us during the session and
if you tweet mean things about our
moderation we'll never know so go crazy
um I also want to let you know if you're
standing in the back there is overflow
seating in the room
directly next to this one that one tends
to fill up to so if your feet are
hurting oh that's bowl I just heard full
okay okay well if you're a bad bad I'm
really sorry they're gonna keep on
hurting me about it next time better
shoes all right let's dive in with that
then and explore the post mobile future
last year we officially moved into the
post-pc world but are we getting close
to a post mobile world to the next big
thing in tech is always on always
connected and completely programmable so
what does that mean for consumer
electronics and the services that power
them well that's what we're here to find
out today I'm actually use the
smartthings app let's actually turn on
the Christmas lights from here as you
can see this is so much more than just
like a remote control ball this is a
robotic gaming system sleep I must have
been tired do you want to listen to a
story yes please basically it's a
thermostat but redesigned totally to be
connected to the Internet according to
Cisco 1,000,000,000,000 devices will be
connected to the Internet in 2013 just 1
billion of those will be the mobile
devices we're used to today and in the
future our array of connected devices
will in theory let us live lives that
are much more convenient and much more
personalized we can connect the real
world on the internet and you walk into
a retail shop and they know what sizes
you have they know what you like they
know what not to show you you will have
a better shopping experience not
everyone is convinced that every device
needs to be connected though or that all
those connections are coming any time
soon I think we're farther away than
people think I mean there are more smart
devices on the planet day that there are
humans but having them all connect
together and work on my behalf II know
people talk about hey I want my stuff
everywhere the refrigerator that's a
different story you know I might have to
work with the home automation people in
terms of how that connects it I think
we're closer than we've ever been I
think it's a journey and I think we're
part way down that journey
and it will continue to go forward so
it's not next year all of sudden magic
connecting the world in a seamless easy
and personal way won't be easy it
involves a lot of companies working
together radical new device and
interface designs and there will be
serious privacy and security hurdles but
the future is already here figuring out
what it looks like is our job today
so that's the post mobile future yes
there will be several phases to our
event today we're going to have sort of
a three-part discussion we'll look at
how devices will change how their
connections have to evolve and then what
entirely new categories are going to
emerge yeah that's really interesting
stuff against that as we look toward
really getting one more step further out
now to help us discover all those phases
we work our way through them we've
assembled what honestly maybe our most
interesting diverse panel for this event
let's bring our panel up now so you can
meet them starting with tech
entrepreneur and chairman of access TV
you know him welcome mark cuban you
don't mind going all the way to the end
from LG also a company needs no
introduction here at CES head of
marketing and go to marketing and go to
market operations please welcome James
Fishler welcome next up a woman with an
outstanding title the futurist for for
Cheryl Connelly Thank You Cheryl good of
you here and finally sprint senior vice
president of product development and
operations / redeem all right let's
settle in for a good deep dive on this
topic to kick us off panelists I'll had
your good comfortable chairs well mine
is I don't know about yours no look at
you do that that's what each of you to
give us your thoughts kind of a little
lightning round here of what you thought
about this topic was the most
interesting is we work with you over the
last few weeks bring you in here get
your minds working with ours on it what
about it most captured your imagination
mark start with you I mean the next big
thing to me is about personalized
medicine you know it's we're just at the
Embassy of it but just little things
like it sports where we're slowly able
to put heart rate monitors on the
players while they perform and new trait
hydrate them and give them nutrition in
response to what's going on in their
bodies we're able to prick their fingers
get some blood and analyze it and figure
out what nutrients they need and help
support them there so I think
personalized medicine to me is a big
game changer
you know your body becomes part of the
network of networks ah yeah not at all
where I expected you to go to be honest
it's really a very interesting angle on
it well thank you you expect me to be
dumb no you guys this is gonna be
awesome that way is gonna be that way
we're just getting started James your
turn I'm afraid to guess us I for me i
watch that video and so much of that is
already here on the floor and it's not
all futuristic a lot of the future is is
already here here at the show we
announced appliances that have voice
control from your smartphone when you're
not home start your washer remotely you
know use your robotic vacuum and have it
start cleaning your house again before
you get home take content and throw it
from your smartphone right to your TV
wireless wire is 3 so a lot of that
technology is already here I think it's
an evolution and I don't think we're
there at the end but I think we're a lot
further along than we have been in the
last 10 years Cheryl a futurist at Ford
you come at this from really a very
different sort of a point of view
because a lot of people still don't
think of cars as consumer electronics
yet here you are what's your take on
this topic so as a futurist I'll just
remind people that I cannot predict the
future right but what we do look is as
big picture trends social technological
economic environmental political and so
when I watch that video i don't i think
most people in the audience would say
they see more they see more connections
more information more in demand and
actually see less I think that all of
this hyper-connectivity means that we
are going to get less information less
bombarded with data will get exactly
what we need where we would need it and
when we need it and I think that's
really what the driver is is that it's
not about information it's about getting
the right information at the right time
and then freed how about you the most
interesting sort of component of this
especially as somebody who is in many
case you know hoping to provide the
connection that could power all of this
yeah I actually have a little bit of a
different point of view I want people to
have more connections that means they
can sell them more thing
good imagine the but I think that you
know the I mean look mobile technology
is probably the most pervasive
technology that's ever existed in the
history of man you know it's arguable
but I think you would say that we got
six billion people in the world and more
people have mobile phones that have
running water and electricity believe it
or not I don't exactly understand how
that works because I'm sure I you charge
your phone again I'm like the Gilligan's
Island thing at the bamboo bike yeah
exactly the generator but you know I
think the one thing you know that's you
know in our industry because we're in it
and a lot of people here are just now
getting exposed to help mobile
technology influences their industries
is that you know there has been this you
know concept for the last few years
called machine to machine it's not
necessarily about people being connected
to devices but it's about machines
talking to other machines and using the
cloud to to you know serve different
types of functions that you know
ubiquitously they don't have the
capability to do today and so I think
that's the big thing that I'm excited
about and you see a lot of that
technology here at the show whether its
TVs that are connected or cars that are
connected or to Mark's point health
monitors and health and things of that
nature I think that's the exciting part
is that the pervasiveness of the
technology we haven't even thought of
all the ways that we can use mobile
wireless today the problem is though
there's some bad things that go along
with it and they some downsides are that
there's a limit to the amount of
capacity and you know problems that you
know could exist problems back from all
these devices exactly it's definitely
going to talk about that a little more
first the machine to machine is a good
jumping off point for our first sort of
discussion topic which is obviously the
most tangible and most relevant in some
ways to the consumer electronic show
that's the devices
so far the post-pc revolution has
revolved around phones and tablets but
in the future who knows what devices
will communicate with each other and
what those devices will look like
recently we won't just have one two
three four screens around us will
actually have 10 20 30 40 things that we
have around us on us smaller things
lighter things closer to the body that
also have sensors but they won't be the
full purpose multi-purpose they won't do
a hundred things they'll do a few things
really really well we're device agnostic
so you know moment everything's mobile
mobile because frankly they're cool and
very easy to work with but in the future
you'll be talking to TV or mean and we
might even get the internet fridge maybe
but everything that's on internet
everything is connected by are they can
Dana gave you three systems everything
from the devices in your pocket to your
home appliances to your car to the scale
in your bathroom this scale can work
both in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so this is
an eye white curve for the last says
four years and and you see there is a
periodic variation during summer and
another half December first post-pc and
now post mobile let's imagine the
possibilities of the connected devices
of the future
so hard we're here we are at CES and it
feels like the consumer electronics
world has gotten a little boring all
we've been talking about is tablets and
smartphones and yet this year's CES it
feels like there are many more device
categories I was thrilled to see LG
finally bring like the washing machine
out of the closet and up onto stage and
the refrigerator's you know talk talk a
little bit maybe we'll start with you
James actually to talk a little bit
about device design and what hardware
since you guys are in so many businesses
could start to look like yeah I think
we're changing changing landscape no
doubt about it LG's designs are always
driven by consumer demand we really try
to look at everything through the lens
of the consumer our motto is life's good
we want to make customers lives better
and all of the product that we have here
at the show is about that we have a
technology called turbo wash which is
incredible technology but it's about
saving time it saves 20 minutes on every
laundry cycle you combine that we never
discussed laundry at the next big thing
first I'm traveling I really don't know
how to use it but how long are the
printer but imagine if that same washer
can send you a message and remind you on
your smartphone to turn over your
laundry right a common challenge that
everybody has or you're at the grocery
store and today this product is it
market you can check the contents of
your refrigerator your refrigerator can
make recommendations on recipes you can
set up profiles for members of your
family that may have an allergy or be
diabetic then take those same recipes
and send them to your oven right through
Wi-Fi and have your oven preheat and
again that the entire network you can do
that via touch you can do that via voice
all of that technology is is here today
mark do you get excited about connected
appliances or is there some other device
you wish was here at the show now I mean
I don't get excited about appliances at
all we gotta talk I'm starting to though
I really am sap LG anomaly or it's
happening like you do me like a friend's
life is good
you know the way I look at it with
consumer driven devices whether it's
appliances or others it's price first
functionality and price first and so all
these things that we're seeing that
we're starting to come down is because
certain CPUs would ever hit certain
price points Ram said you know certain
price points and so now you're in able
to enable that you're able to enable
them with intelligence but when you look
when you try to look forward if you take
out the cost constraints to just say
okay where's all this stuff going we're
still going you know cpu performance is
still going to accelerate it still gonna
get smaller is still going to get a lot
more interesting so you know all this
enabling I think is actually simple the
hard part is hitting costs where I think
it's going is that as CPUs continue to
get faster and faster and faster will
will network ourselves so we'll have in
our wallet somewhere a CPU that
communicates with whatever else our
sensors or whatever else we need to
gather for information and whatever type
of output we need you know Google's
doing a thing with classes you know you
could have something in your pocket
while your purse that is your you know
your central processor that communicates
with everything to communicate with
external devices so i think the real
concept is how small how fast can you
get processors and how efficient can you
make communications in your own little
network and then let those communicate
outside that's what we're going to see
in eight to ten years so that we're not
constrained by what the physical devices
are so it looks like you agree I agree
i'm completely on board with mark what
marketing because i don't think the
hardware is the interesting part i think
it's the user interface that really
matters i mean when you think about ces
this is my first CES visit and i was
taken aback by the range of categories
that are here it's it's not just the
mobile devices it is things like LG
automotive Ford's been here for seven
years I mean we've finally changed the
way that we go to market because we
think about the cars not just being
vehicle for transportation but something
that enables a lifestyle of constant
connectivity and when you move into that
space that means that not only will your
competitors in the landscape change but
the categories in which you compete
against change I mean Google is making a
car who would have thought but
in this environment of constant
connectivity I think it ultimately comes
down to not innovating just because you
can but what's in it for the consumer is
a convenient is it accessible is it
intuitive as I listened to I want a
vacuum that cleans my house before I get
home and I need a washer that doesn't
remind me to flip the dryer just dries
it after it's washed it you know network
so so i have no idea i'm talking about
there was a gift for each of you Marques
need his so looks like you're going to
get to the bridge this is interesting
because it kind of brings up the concept
of shouldn't we solve simple tasks and
needs first I guess what you're getting
at mark with the fact that it can be
cheap enough to do so I think some of
the early connected appliance visions
James what about five or six years we're
very grandiose the refrigerator is going
to know what's in the fridge know how to
order it go to safeway calm get the
order going have the recipe pulled up
based on what you've got tonight whoa
now you're talking about a dryer that
simply said the dryer is done go get the
clothes where they wrinkle you want to
preempt all those things you don't want
to solve them you want to preempt them
right so that that's I think a problem a
lot of companies get into they say this
is what we've been doing yeah let's
solve that problem in the simplest way
the least expensive the most efficient
the best design pop they're in their own
deal you know when you have a hammer
everything looks like a nail mm-hmm
right I'd rather say okay what kind of
clothes don't need washed you know you
yeah what what how do you preempt that
problem so that you don't have to spend
the time doing those things you know
that and I think again as we get more
power every you know every year we think
this is the most powerful it's going to
be but you look at phones there's single
tasking you know now you're starting to
see a multi task and that limits that
changed how we interface with everything
because you can only do one thing at
once basically the breeze of what s your
dice sorry well if we do start thinking
about what we need to do what we don't
need to do that seems to raise
irrelevant or at least a salient point
for you Fareed which is what devices
don't need to be connected right i mean
as the guy who's dealing with the
constraints do you ever look around and
think maybe all these devices don't need
to be online yeah your water bottle
doesn't actually have to yeah you know
we get I mean we get approached every
day by manufacturers that want to use
our distribution and our reach to or 56
million customers to you know put
devices in our stores and sometimes we
just have to
question what really is in alignment
with the wireless strategy versus one of
your devices we use sprint I have a
company called motion loft and what
motion life does it's got a little
sensor we put it on the outside of a
building so you let's say there's a big
commercial building in New York City and
they have space to lease down on the
bottom floor and it counts just counts
everything that goes by sends it over
this the sprint network back to a
central point and so we can watch the
number of people that are in any one
place where their sensors in real time
and now we're starting to add additional
sensors so they can test for carbon
dioxide they can test for moisture they
can test for any number of different
things all in real time and so you start
looking about devices it's not even the
device that matters the sensor is almost
irrelevant it's that information it's
almost we call it google analytics for
the real world this was many nodes as
possible as many get we're put them on
bridges so that the transit authorities
will know if there's you know this is a
busy intersect interchange right now and
it's snowing or whatever and you need to
get here first because there's a lot of
people there or here all of a sudden
there's a congregation than just one
part of town in San Francisco where
there shouldn't be a congregation let's
just make people aware of it you know
for who knows what's going on and this
is describing a vision of low-cost
devices as you're saying barely even
devices and a low bitrate bandwidth not
putting a lot of load on your spectrum
right so things that are easy to get
into to really build up that incredible
exponential is that of the data and
we're doing this now yeah I think marks
got a point there's there's something
about accessibility to data that I think
primarily drives a lot of these
applications but I do think there's a
lot of things that you start to question
you know you don't start to question the
innovation that's taking place but you
start to question what's the direct kind
of return on investment i think that the
one big thing that we're seeing from
most mobile devices in the phone because
it's most people's primary mechanism
what we're seeing is the evolution of
what's happened to the phone I mean you
know when you look at it when we were in
1g 2g world you know when data
throughput was really you know kind of
light and it was slow you know they
really kind of stopped a lot of the you
know real applications from you know
being invented and being pervasive India
the mark
place what you're seeing with with the
speeds now being at parity with desktop
speeds and what people are seeing in
their homes is that the combination of
that with all of the different sensors
that are within your phone for example
your phone has an accelerometer it has a
camera it can sense motion it knows
everything about you because it's with
you pretty much all times a day that
information is collected and I think
that information becomes valuable for
healthcare it becomes how valuable for
applications like gaming it you know
there's all kinds of things that you can
utilize that data for that you couldn't
in the past and I think it's the
combination of the sensors the software
the ability of the high speed networks
to transmit that information and i think
that there's there's also kind of this
idea this personal area network that for
a long time was a visions originally one
of the reasons Bluetooth was right you
know invented but it never really came
together I mean it's for a long time
Bluetooth was only used for Bluetooth
headsets well now we're actually seeing
people are using that phone as their
central processing unit and it's
connecting to things like you know
jawbone jambox speakerphones you know
and you know I can fuel bands and all
kinds of things they're gathering
information brushes connected to kids I
thought touch ups in you know to make
sure you brushed your teeth and the
track it and get rewards for it and
gamma phi we saw so much bluetooth in
the fitness and health we were impressed
by all the fitness devices that have
come out as a major category at this
show using networking from bluetooth to
Wi-Fi to 3G cellular and it does it sort
of gets to the point that the that the
head of design from nokia was making in
the video that you saw earlier which is
that that these devices now it is it
possible that they do too much that what
we really need is the information and
then a very simple kind of terminal
device that basically just accesses all
that information i was surprised by his
comments because it does seem like that
the the single purpose device is really
rendering obsolete you know if you look
around the room you won't see many
people wearing watches because watches
are single single function and so
there's still those i mean you know
aesthetically it's crashing the old and
still it's still fashion but in terms of
utility you'll be hard-pressed to find a
person under 30 who wears a watch
because they tell the time
through their phone unless it's
connected to some other device yeah
unless it's a good example of it but
something that so I think these devices
we want to carry fewer and fewer of them
you know we want we don't we don't have
the space to carry like all these
devices together so those that can
converge it into something simple and
easy and accessible well this happening
is all these devices are getting their
own api's which are they were becoming
platforms for other things like with
cars it's always amazed me you know I
can have a GPS and I can have a map but
I don't really have a programming
interface so i can write apps because I
spend so much time I can customize my
car to fit me yeah and for just open up
what yesterday well you started yet oh
Jesus right yeah just program just on
the dvds that you use to load the maps
right there should be a programming
interface to let me put ok here's uncle
Susie's aunt Susie's house Uncle Joe is
it could be you know so um but all these
opportunities because you spend so much
time the car but I think an API as we
get these devices the first step is
here's the device here's what it does
can we create a platform out of this
device once you make it a platform then
all the brainpower of everybody in the
community that uses it can make it
smarter and better and take it at
directions you never imagined ok now all
these devices were talking about some
real some imagined or some
conglomerations of real that need to
come together more none of them really
get very far unless they've got the kind
of connectivity that's going to support
them in a really transparent way so
we're not really thinking about the
connectivity very much it has to be easy
pervasive and affordable wireless
connections throughout these kinds of
categories let's take a look at some of
that
a world of devices and services that
offer a truly seamless digital life for
the first time won't get very far if
their wireless bandwidth and
connectivity don't progress as well it
was only about a decade ago that
investors were questioning wireless
carriers sanity as they spent billions
of dollars to build out broadband for
mobile devices after all wasn't calling
and texting good enough no one questions
that anymore now wireless especially 3g
and 4g cellular fuel smartphones tablets
connected cars connected TVs and new
classes of devices from the personal to
the industrial but there are bottlenecks
ahead a lot of that comes down to
spectrum the radio frequency space in
the air all around us it's kind of like
gold we sort of know how much there is
and we can't just go make more this is
why you see so many major telecom deals
successful and attempted a flood of new
users each using more and hungrier
devices means data plan caps could
become a real problem not just
theoretical over its charges could make
this new world seem less worry free and
the specter of meter usage instead of
flat rate creating a perception of much
higher costs we can only maximise the
connected future if we have ample simple
affordable connectivity how big are the
problems and how do we solve
help us breed your only hope yeah this
thing is right you know a lot of this is
on you baby girl new pontiff picked on
let it lay a little bit so I mean you
know it's definitely it look you know
the one thing we don't have the ability
to do is change the laws of physics and
unfortunately you know the Google's
working at me yeah google is probably
working on are you probably right but
they you know I think that you know the
radio frequencies in the spectrum that
exists in the United States the way it
it works today is it's auctioned out and
it's licensed to providers like sprint
and others in the country and I think
what happens is that you know you get
congestion in that that kind of thing
but like highway lanes there's certain
amount of highway lanes and once you
have a lot of vehicles on those highway
lanes they start to get congested and
that's what you see in the call world
when you're making calls you'd see drop
calls or you can see the ability not to
be able to call it a cell tower well the
same thing happens with data you know
when when you don't have access to those
lanes you have no ability to transmit
data or your you slow down the speed of
the data on those large pipes and so the
only way to solve that is either to
allow us to use more spectrum which is
hard to reallocate just based on the
fact that you know there's a lot of
different people in the spectrum map and
if you're to look at it's a gobble the
goop of different players from the US
government to TV broadcasters to yeah
you know wireless carriage and so it's
not as easy as just kind of saying let's
just you know open it up but I think it
requires a few things one is it requires
application developers to get smarter
about the applications and how they
react to situations when the networks
are congested so they can adapt you know
to today really you know most developers
don't think about the mobile the
environment the ones that are being
successful in their user experiences
they've optimize their experiences to to
kind of work in those congestion
environments or work environments where
they use very little data right when
they need to and I think that's one
thing the other thing is we just
continue to build out capacity and I
think 11 concept in our industry that's
kind of catching on is this thing called
small cells where today you know we go
out and build these big networks well in
the future what we're going to actually
see is that your
to be able to buy these little routers
think of them as little small cell sites
that you're going to just be able to
connect and your home and your
businesses and they it's a femto so
they're femtocells yeah and there's more
industrial versions of them that you can
kind of put on sides of buildings okay
these are not for customer premise yes
the thing is use some of them we would
deploy and the reason we can't continue
to deploy big networks as they start to
interfere with each other when we have
too many of them in a given area and
they actually create the negative effect
of actually causing more problems than
solving them and so when you have small
cells they don't tend to have as much
power at output and so they don't tend
to interfere in large areas but they do
tend to you know relieve the congestion
because they're using backhaul like you
know cable and DSL yeah where our big
cell sites require these big copper and
fiber drops to them which is very
inefficient so these small cell
technology we think millions of these
around the country will help relieve a
lot of this congestion but onto itself
there's no silver bullet solution it's
going to require a lot of show of hands
how many of you are carrying a 4G LTE
device at this point in history Wow well
and we are at CES this is a big number
it's obviously there's a very high
penetration compared to the general
population but what of this this theory
that I guess is the best way to put it
that we can reform 3g more quickly than
any of the previous whatever you call
those segments of spectrum the week and
basically start to shut it down and move
that spectrum to LTE faster because it
can do it all is that is LTE more of a
do at all what coding environment and an
RF environment that we can actually
congeal everything on it and get more
efficiency and more pipeline well it's
definitely happening lt's become the
global standard i mean everybody every
carrier is going to LT but it won't
solve the problem because even when you
reform the 3g spectrum to 4g we're
finding is when you go from 3g usage of
4g usage people's use it usage quadruple
some data so what happens is they go
from where they were using maybe a
hundred megabytes a month or two hundred
megabytes a month they go to using about
1.6 gigabytes a month on that same
device it's because the device app there
you know you get more data usage because
you have faster speeds and you want to
use it more right and so I think all
does is it increases the problem it
doesn't necessarily solve it James you
guys juggle a lot of radios in your
products what is your take on this we do
I think again customers drive the demand
right so they demanded more data faster
so 4G evolved but is it a national
problem or a regional problem right so
certainly walking the floor here hard to
get a 4g signal but you go to many other
markets not concentrated cities and it's
not the same problem everywhere so you
know I think the FCC is doing some good
work in condensing you know open
spectrum on broadcast and moving it over
to 4G but i don't know maybe
controversial say but is it really that
big of a problem everywhere or in
isolated place yeah i don't think it's
it's starting to become a problem today
across the board i think everybody will
admit to that i think that it's the that
when you look at the cisco information
on the amount of devices accessing the
network and the amount of usage it's
going to be a it's one of these problems
if we don't start solving now in four to
five years from now it becomes a very
chaotic situation new technologies
coming to reenable bandwidth on on
wireless yeah so we'll get another
quantum leap and the amount available
yeah there's definitely I mean there's
there's compression type technologies
and you know again just we just reuse it
there's Ryu sagiv it it's a very
complicated problem because it's not any
one thing that can solve it we've looked
at everything and every carrier is
deploying multiple different types of
solutions to try to solve the problem
but it's the it what scares us is the
billions of devices that you start
talking about to start using network and
there's other things you can do like the
personal area network where the devices
share a connection and they
intelligently kind of use the phone as
backhaul back to the network that's good
and the reason I the question is you
know what point do you cut the cord well
yeah because it does feel like 4G is the
thing to get us away from bandwidth caps
and wired why I mean I would love to
have two devices on a wired connection
and everything else I'm support in terms
you don't have wired broadband right all
right give you an example one percent of
our users generate thirty-three percent
of our traffic so there's one percent
that's like a lot of people here and
you're all doing that
so you're in the one-percent which is
okay but there's there's ten it tends to
be not the general public like you said
in populations because you kind of see
this kind of curve that takes place is
that it's not that everybody is using
all the data all the time it's just that
you sometimes also have people abuse the
networks right you know they're using
them as you know they're streaming you
know Oh access TV access TV all their
prep I've got my solution the worst
place yeah you're the worst customer
cost money it's data that I mean I i
always take issue with that I'm I was
happy that you didn't say data hog but
is it really abuse for us to use the
data that is available tues the
connection that's available in the data
i think when if we're the one percent
now we're the future ninety-nine percent
right I think we have a belief that you
know we're the only unlimited carrier
really you know truly unlimited carryin
look in the country and so we still
believe that when you pay us for that
unlimited usage you get to use it
unlimited but we want to also make sure
that you know we educate customers on
you know if you're using it and you're
using a hundred gigabytes a month you
know now we need to probably have a
discussion I probably talk yeah this
conversation know is that it seems to me
that we're discussing it in a vacuum or
a bubble Amy because you know we're
talking about the evolution of the
spectrum and 3G 4G LTE this is moving so
rapidly and when you pair it with a
durable good like a car or an appliance
you might render other parts of your
your life obsolete I mean I was just at
the hotel and I was trying to get
someone to print something off and they
said oh this is from we have outdated
software this came from you know another
an older newer version there's a
disconnect and I think consumers they're
hungry for speed but when it starts to
touch when this evolution of innovation
moved so rapidly and renders other parts
of the life that are constants
inconvenient you have you have attention
that's there and you wrote some
confidence in technology in general I
think those days are gone that the whole
you know 1980s they too fast innovation
leasable yeah or you know the the the
guys who are afraid of technology and
data you know those guys are my mother
happy I know
possible that those days are gone in
terms of adoption of Technology I think
though it is true that networking
specifically is still way too hard to me
that is the one part of the equation far
as I look at all of your connected
devices and I think God's sake like my
router freaks out if I add a tebow to it
you know it's so that sort of it is also
dancing at seventy-five percent of
people don't know how to turn on Wi-Fi
and use it on their phone right I mean
no matter what kinda Justin we are no
traitor we are not most of the general
public most of them don't know how to do
basic things like set up bluetooth setup
Wi-Fi in their phones this is not that
our customers are stupid it's just that
the technology to the point earlier it's
so complicated sometimes and there's so
much functionality in these phones
people just don't know how to use it we
haven't we haven't simplified the
process and so how much worse does that
get when you start to add in a car and
then a refrigerator and then whatever
else mark is working on so it changes
you I mean you have to have an open
source you have an open architecture so
the Ford builds our systems so that we
can upgrade them and pass out you know
deliver free software to our customers
so we can update as new technology hits
the market place but we're also
concerned about feature fatigue you know
people are very concerned about how they
spend their money and if you I buy
something based on its features but
actually get it home and realize that I
don't access most of them I somehow feel
like I've wasted some of my investment
that it wasn't good money spent and so
the features are intriguing but if they
don't make my life easier if they're not
accessible if they're not intuitive then
I feel a bit duped on the consumer side
of things yeah we were talking about it
earlier a lot of features I think aren't
explained properly I think not all
customers understand all features before
they buy him you look at the TV industry
back in the 90s p.i.p people would would
not buy a TV if it didn't have to tune
or p.i.p and less than five percent of
the people ever used it right so sold a
feature that really had no no usage
model so I think some of the ownership
is on manufacturers to make sure we're
putting features in the market that
consumers do get value at and do make
their life better but going back to the
spectrum I don't think it has to get
more complicated especially in the home
I think as more and more devices come on
on
at home manufacturers across different
brands categories and industries have to
work closer together we're working with
Cisco right now on some of their
prioritization work of your home network
right because not all your connected
devices need to be on pulling the data
at the same time so do you set up a
priority of when different devices where
point though you're making the point the
fact that you have to have prioritized
networking which is going to that means
if it screws up someone's going to have
to come in and put in the admin login
right and go to the router and reset
your priorities because you just updated
the software in your washing machine you
know and it goes to another point Molly
and I go back and forth all the time if
we can't even get our wireless networks
to work how's all this over-the-top
stuff going to impact TV right I've been
waiting for this to come up yeah I had
to you know you just don't you know if
you can't get your wireless network to
work we and we have talked about that at
the show that there have been there are
so many solutions for content delivery
there are new boxes announced here it
seems like every half hour and it still
is bare it still is very hard it still
is really confusing but isn't any
opportunity for entrepreneurs for for
manufacturers to make it simpler right
so like you said earlier right forget
about solving the problem today but
let's make it let's make it simpler from
the beginning so I I I disagree and say
that you know we can we can solve it and
it's an opportunity right and we can do
it together right and maybe it's an app
it's almost it's actually as if you read
our minds because that is our next topic
of discussion innovation and what comes
next we talked about today the immediate
future but the discussion really gets
interesting when you start looking ahead
to machine human interfaces to our
personal networks to the innovations
that come next and sort of blow apart
the categories that we're working with
today it's been called the post mobile
world the Internet of Things and the
connected future either way the trend
toward ubiquitously connected devices
could shake up the consumer electronics
world like nothing else before it right
now you can use a smartphone or a tablet
to control the temperature in your house
call a taxi that already knows your
location video chat with anyone anywhere
lock or unlock your door start your car
augment reality or
access nearly all the world's
information in seconds so what comes
next and in reality all of you are
cyborgs because you're not Terminator
and you're not Robocop you don't have to
have a brain implant to be a cyborg all
you need to do is have a symbiotic
interaction between you as a human and a
machine once you've connected your home
your car and your device's all this left
will be to connect yourself so the muse
is a force sensor brainwave headband
it's actually able to sense your brain
activity and give you feedback so that
you can play games directly with your
mind as well as improve your mental
abilities in the far future this is
going to be a tool that allows you to do
things like control the lighting in your
home or your automated phone system or
your car directly with your mind so the
long term future is actually allowing us
to interact with devices in the world
and really smart ways that are able to
support you because they know something
about you we're using like a far future
do you mean far far because we're
already in an exciting future we are
already in the future I love it I love
it but what else does the future hold
whether it's wearable tech smart home or
car automation or machine human
interfaces what will a connected future
look like and what are the opportunities
for innovation
okay sandbox time what do you want to
see we don't have right now Cheryl I
want to see things that are that
simplify streamline they give me back my
time I actually kind of intrigued in a
backdrop of this constant connectivity
about a retreat from technology you know
finding a sanctuary detoxing real
personal engagement there seems to be a
foot a lot of discussion about
authenticity and craftsmanship and I
think that's in response to a lot of
high-tech that's in the world but I said
odds because we do want constant
connectivity does make our life easier
it allows us to be more spontaneous
control our environment influence those
around us so I think those things are
are here to stay and I think that what
we have seen in recent years will look
like a turtle's pace compared to we're
about to embark on so can I read into
that comment that you feel over the last
few years as you and most of us have
been adopting smartphones and tablets
increasingly you feel like you're
spending more time playing with tech and
i'm not using playing vajura tively and
that may be the value equation is still
TBD in your mind I i think that the
value equation is there but i think that
we will reach a tipping point where
people will try to you know i think
they're great irony of these digital
devices that they were sold to us on the
premise that they were going to save us
time but they steal time because we're
constantly connected we don't have down
time we don't disengage i mean i don't
even consider myself that high and the
index of tech addict but I still check
my phone before I go to bed first thing
I do when I wake up and if i should
awake in the middle of the night i'm
still glancing a lot of okay what's on
my voicemail you know that is a lot it
is it is wrong with eating like you say
just getting the problem I don't do
meetings I don't do phone calls you
email me period in a story unless you're
going to write me a check then I'll meet
with you then we're going to be at peace
and Mark will be Vanna I get so much
more done and I can go to my phone right
now I was talking to somebody yesterday
about a deal i looked at in 2002 pulled
out my phone i had put it up through
imap into gmail right did a little
search oh yeah this was the email from
2002 took me two seconds it wasn't like
go look it up go find it you know or
ignore it I mean my life has been
dramatically simplified because it's
just
right there I can go wherever I was just
in the cayman islands with my kids
fortunately it's the hedge fund capital
world so the connectivity is good so I'm
in the boonies of the Caymans on the on
the beach playing with my kids I can
take a call know you know or take an
email rather no one knows where where
I'm at and donkey doesn't care but you
are the one percent of the one percent
of the one percent of the one percent I
mean you are experiencing is out there
Oh Bravo for you good political
positioning there there I actually think
that then the future luxury will be
afforded to those who can afford to
disconnect who can shut off the phone
who have an infrastructure a system in
place of safety net that says I don't
need to check my email I don't need to
know what you think those comments did
the same thing about cars they said the
same thing about anything that took you
from one one world to another you know I
one of my favorite lines is you don't
live in the world you were born into you
know just things evolve and we evolve
with them and we're always going to look
at the changes you're going through
right in that moment and say can I live
without them yeah I think there's some
social responsibility though I agree
with both points of view but I think
there is some social responsibility that
comes with some of the technology and we
don't tend to think about it but things
like I'll use a basic example everybody
can relate to distracted driving I mean
distracted driving is a place where I
can't say that being productive in my
car is a positive thing because you see
all the time how accidents happen from
this and it's actually it's becoming an
epidemic amongst teens and we as a
company as well as some of the other
carriers have realized that there's some
responsibility we have to educate people
on that because it's not just something
that you know you know the mobile
technology you can talk about the great
aspects of it you can look at you know
there's some responsibility I think we
all have where that's a bad use case of
something we don't want to have happen
and I think to Cheryl's point there are
some pieces of that I think also you
know we see enterprises where their
employees are so connected that they're
actually having to tell them to
unconnect at times because they're
feeling this kind of ongoing pressure i
mean i'm sure a lot of us you know it
there's some there's some psychological
and physiological type aspects I'll stop
there
yes text don't kill people people kill
people does it does it argue though back
to that point that it seemed like we
were about to get into earlier does it
argue for devices that do less is it
possible that the devices themselves do
too much that if the data collection is
more seamless that if the information
flow is more constant that if a device
is more simple more simply a terminal
into information that maybe it's less of
a distraction I my point when I said at
the beginning is that I think in the
future I see less I see less distraction
I see less noise I see less clutter I
think that the future that you're laying
out means that I have curated content
that's relevant to me that resonates
with me now and I think that's the
future I think right now we're in a
plate space where we're inundated with
information we have no ability to
trimmer what's accurate credible or
reliable and that is a challenge I mean
that's the reality of the internet today
and I think that what people want in the
future is a solution that helps them
navigate that so that is a time-saver so
that it is personalized or customized to
their needs so it's intuitive so it
learns our behavior it starts to respond
like if I pull out of my driveway why do
I have to hit the garage button for it
to close why can't my car just sense
that in closed automatically there's
behaviors that are easily anticipated
and the sensors and technology it seems
like what it should be there that's what
you has emotional know that too although
all kinds of stuff I sometimes feel like
since the personal mobile revolution I'm
getting this much more done a lot but
I'm actually spending this much more
time to get there there's an efficiency
there between those two absolutely but
it's a net additional use of my
resources and I don't know if we
accomplished something that we've been
talking about a little bit here which is
wait a minute did we ever get the
baseline of life to take less time and
effort or did we just make our lives
more productive more efficiently I'm
saying we're taking things out of our
work worlds and that's causing us to
work more and to try to learn more
efficiently you know you don't see
people who work behind cash register or
you're seeing fewer and fewer people who
work behind cash registers right we with
it's a bifurcated world you've got those
who deal with data which is
about where the opportunities are and
those who deal with physical objects and
if you if you have to deal with the
physical object of your job there's a
good chance you're not going to have a
job in a few years you know we're just
pulling we're sucking all the smarts out
of the day-to-day operations of retail
stores of anywhere we can to become more
efficient that because we're pulling the
data from one place to white-collar
workers let's call them whatever devices
they use it requires us to process more
information so I think to your point you
know there's a great book by nate silver
the signal on the noise right yeah we
have to learn how to process what signal
and then what's noise and that's one of
the skill sets that I think will acquire
will try to give to our kids as we get
older right how to separate it so you
not because the challenge isn't that you
have too much the challenge you just
don't know which is the good stuff which
is the best I think one of the biggest
advancements you're seeing is that you
know almost everybody's now used to be
artificial intelligence and machine
learning was just kind of a something
you'd find a few computer scientists
working on it you know computer science
departments around the country and they
they were never bothered now it's like
they're the most highly demanded people
that you can hire yeah I mean natural
language net machine language learning
and machine learning and you know
national language parsing and all of
these things that you see like Siri that
most people first kind of recognized or
Google now and things of that nature I
mean these are things where I think you
know you're going to see it help fill
the void in the gap it's the
interconnections of not just being
functional on your device because today
you checked your email you check your
calendar you go into Yelp you know you
go and you open up different application
service it's really kind of I think what
you're seeing is that the platform
providers are starting to make
investments in those areas because they
see that that is the future they want
people won't have seamless and
ubiquitous context to what they do not
just necessarily being functional so
ultimately is it personalization is that
where you know that's where the
innovation can be that's where the other
personalization is kind of like
convergence and all these other kind of
terms it's like I think it's not just
about personalizing things it's about
giving them context and I think in
mobile the great thing about your mobile
devices it's got you know we call it
mobile local and social right it's the
intersection the vendor
diagram with those three things it's
that I'm mobile and i know i'm at the
starbucks and i know that my friends
there and i helped connect this together
and then also i give you a discount
coupon because i know your you know your
your longtime starbucks customer and i
know what starbucks coffee you drink
every day because I you know seen you
order that over and over again it's like
things like that now it's probably a
little far-fetched I don't know people
want that level of personalization how
serious we only have like three minutes
left this is a big topic to jump in too
quickly but how serious do security and
privacy concerns become then when when
we're talking about exchanging so much
data so seamlessly and we've already
seen sort of troubles with seamless
sharing how how much more seriously do
we have to start taking that that's huge
I mean you know privacy you know cuz now
you have this ubiquity of information
especially in time a personalization and
sharing it for anyone look at all they
you know things are going on with google
and facebook i think that privacy
becomes a big issue and everybody has to
respect that but security is i think
this year most of the people that you
see who predict security threats they
say this will be probably the year that
we're going to see one of the largest
probably smartphone security threats
whether it's viral or malware that we've
started to see them in our industry we
track them on a daily weekly basis but
we're starting to see them progress more
because smartphones have become so BIC
with us and we're trying to now educate
people on protecting their phones with
antivirus software and malware
anti-malware software &amp;amp; Safe Browsing
software because we're seeing some of
the same threats that we saw in the
early computer days now starting to you
know show themselves in the smartphone
and then James says each new connected
device become a possible vector I mean
we all saw the story about the samsung
smart tvs being hacked maybe an entryway
into your home network yeah i think it's
something we have to be aware of i don't
i don't think it's I don't think it's an
epidemic today I think there's isolated
cases I think all technology makes that
happen right they or the opportunity for
that I mean the doom and gloom guy right
there was no it's just turn my coffee
today our bones are doing he's cranky
consumers though I think that this
balancing act on safety and security is
that if they can see a direct benefit
they are willing to sacrifice a little
bit of privacy but it has to be
transparent you have to be consistent
about how you plan to use information
where it's going to go what are the
possibilities and I think that the more
that conversation has had the more
prepared the marketplace is to
understand when a misstep takes place I
thought is worried about individual
privacy and security because if i wanted
to hack you I'll just break into your
mailbox or call your credit card company
pretend I'm your grandma right I mean
that you can get through the individual
stuff in the world we're in right now
I'm more concerned about the bigger
hacks that impact our national security
i I'm not as concerned about missiles as
I am as somebody from overseas coming in
and just messing with our whole you know
communications infrastructure because
you know you take out some cell phone
tower because it's the right places you
take out a network you know we got we
got problems and so to me that those are
the bigger issues the bigger have a big
impact on society issues although you
Mark talks about when it work talks
about one of my favorite wild card
scenarios that i ran across on a CIA
website so if someone were to detonate
an atomic bomb into the atmosphere it
would shut down all satellite
communication you know so you would all
of this connectivity that we rely upon
that is so essential to our day-to-day
health records access to Medicaid access
to financials all that's gone maybe
should called revolution about that yeah
well and actually it's funny because I
was without power recently for I don't
know 32 hours or some unbelievable and I
manifold and to me no I could check my
phone oh no she went to the starbuck
plugged in I'd oh yeah I drove around in
my car for like 30 minutes to charge my
phones no but but someone tweeted me if
we were if we were really going to talk
about the connection we probably should
have talked about power I mean we start
to be start to have a very serious
conversation about electricity being
absolutely essential to powering you
know obviously not just like lights in
life and what heat but everything that
we rely on so much the one thing this
stuff goes down the downer of a gun
don't think about this people don't
think about this really Vegas celebrate
that well there's something didn't even
make anything you think you're that show
is available on demand now so you can
get all caught up over the top no good
all right the man for
because it was on TV folks please help
me and Molly thank our guests as we wrap
up this 10th anniversary next big thing
Mark Cuban James fischler from LG Cheryl
Connelly futuristic Ford and for reeded
