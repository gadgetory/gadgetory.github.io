DX
120 ie in-ear headphones that retail for
115 dollars and 89 dollars respectively
hi I'm David Connelly and welcome to
another CNET video review of a pair of
headphones in this case it really is a
pair as these bear dynamics shares so
much in common
that doesn't seem worth doing two
separate video shoots for them in case
you've never heard of bear dynamic it's
a German headphone company that makes
some very good sounding headphones some
of which are very expensive the models
you see here represent the company's
attempt at serving up more mainstream
headphones at more affordable price
points and indeed both are up there with
the best in years we've heard in their
price range these two bear dynamic
sounds similar but there's a bit more
life in detail with the DX 160 ie sound
so he's naturally spent more time with
that model both come with seven
different sizes of silicon tips one pair
of comply tips and carrying cases the
more expensive DX 160 comes with a hard
carrying case while the DX 120 comes
with more of a pouch style case
unfortunately neither features a mic or
phone controls which is too bad the
cables are a little unusual the
headphones have two part flat cables the
Y top part termites in a 3.5 millimeter
plug and there's an extension cable the
Y cable is just 14 inches long where's
the extension adds another 35 inches
these guys feature black all-metal
earpieces with 10 millimeter drivers and
impedance is rated at 47 ohms comfort
and sound isolation were average for
this type of design pretty good but not
great the DX 160 IE delivers a lot of
bass but it's not thick or muddy
definition is excellent and this
headphone sound click with rock jazz
electronic and classical music mid rage
detailing is excellent but treble
clarity somewhat lacking the DX 120
meanwhile is a tad more laid-back and
that's a plus if you listen to a lot of
less-than-stellar mp3s and streaming
sources compared to another $100 in your
audio file favorite the hi-fi man re 400
that models a little bit more
but doesn't have as much base it's a
matter of taste which one you prefer but
bass FedEx should be quite happy with
the DX 160 though as with all in ears
the quality of that bass is dependent on
how tight a seal you can get I'm David
Conroy and those are the bear dynamic DX
160 ie &amp;amp; DX 120 ie a pair of bona fide
audiophile in your headphones for around
a hundred bucks thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
