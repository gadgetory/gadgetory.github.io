huge profits from their relatively small
investments heads turn in this case the
drama is even greater because people
around the world are making money off of
another obscure form of money Bitcoin
Bitcoin Bitcoin Bitcoin Bitcoin let's
start with what it is
bitcoin is a digital currency it's
completely intangible so unlike dollars
there aren't any bills or coins and
Bitcoin transactions happen digitally
anonymously and without the help of any
banks or middlemen you can already use
it to book hotels shop online in some
restaurants like Subway even accept
Bitcoin so you're probably wondering how
Bitcoin gets printed or how you could
send a Bitcoin without the help of a
bank for this you can think blockchain
technology let's talk about the
blockchain when you venmo your friends
there's a bank to oversee approve and
log that transaction
the bank acts like a middleman that
we've all entrusted to supervise our
money bing's can also charge you fees
freeze your account and they can also be
vulnerable to major data breaches that
just doesn't exist with Bitcoin instead
bitcoin uses blockchain technology it's
what allows us to cut out that middleman
and send money directly to each other so
instead of a bank monitoring every
transaction a network of computers are
verifying every transaction kind of like
the way thousands of people monitor any
given Wikipedia page to ensure its
accuracy back to the blockchain with
block chain every new transaction comes
in the form of a block that's
permanently linked to the one before it
and it's connected to the next one and
so on
so if a bad actor tried to tamper with
one of these blocks it could destroy the
entire chain and many computers on the
network
think about those Wikipedia editors
would notice that something went wrong
and here's where Bitcoin mining comes in
lots of computers are working to
maintain this network approve
transactions and hold the network
accountable without the help of a middle
like a bank it takes a lot of computing
energy to maintain this network of
transactions and records so the network
rewards the people to help keep it
running those are the Bitcoin miners so
when a computer helps maintain the
Bitcoin network it receives a Bitcoin in
return but there isn't an unlimited
supply of Bitcoin instead the Bitcoin
rule book states that there are just 21
million bitcoins a labelled and in part
it's that scarcity that drives the value
of Bitcoin it's easy to get caught up in
the excitement over Bitcoin but the real
innovation here is with blockchain
technology it can be used for so much
more than just verifying Bitcoin
transactions and other cryptocurrencies
think about how we could cut out
middlemen in many industries and use it
to verify health records legal documents
and private securities Bitcoin is really
just the beginning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
