Sumi das joining me is executive editor
for cnet Paul Sloane Paul thanks for
being with us so let's talk about
Facebook and privacy tooth to terms that
when they're mentioned in the same
sentence people pay attention or get
their knickers in a twist there was an
email that supposedly Facebook sent out
recently asking users to vote about
something not just privacy but other
stuff as well can you tell us about that
yeah yesterday voting began on a whole
series of proposed changes that facebook
wants to make to how it handles your
data back to some of your obscure
settings that most people will never
even understand or try to understand and
to whether they even continue to have
this voting process in the place in to
continue having it in the first place so
they've got this voting process and in
order for things to be voted up they
need to reach a sort of a critical
number of votes they need to get thirty
percent is that right right thirty
percent so when this all started in 2009
it came from some backlash about some
privacy issue facebook sort of became
this nation right they said we're going
to have this democracy and we're going
to if we make changes to how we govern
our site we're going to put it to the
people and so we'll put out a post and
say here's what we want to do you need
7,000 comments on it or so rough roughly
and then that will trigger a vote that
has to then clear have seven days to
vote which the period were in now and
then you have thirty percent of the full
Facebook population which is now a
billion plus users have to vote on it
that means 300 million people vote on
have to vote on this in order for it not
to happen and that means it will
definitely happen because that's not
going to happen 300 million people will
not turn out to vote it's highly
unlikely that 300 million people will
vote on this right yeah it's pretty much
not going to happen okay so it's a
foregone conclusion then that Facebook
is probably going to end up doing
whatever they want right okay so what
what are we talking about here by the
way if you are interested in voting you
should vote by December tens that
correct yes okay so if you are
interested in how to get the word out
lobby whenever you know look it up on
Google it's all over the place okay but
so what does that mean then
after December 10th when this is like we
voted down and Facebook starts doing
whatever they want are we going to see
some major changes in the way privacy as
him you know the privacy concerned at ax
the privacy concern on this one that has
led to some letters from various privacy
advocates is that they're going what
they want to do is start incorporating
and looking at your data from other
businesses don't sort of pull them all
together they call this unified data the
biggest one being Instagram which they
now own so right now they keep Instagram
data separate from data on you on your
other activity on Facebook they want to
put that all together bundle it up in a
nice be you know package and sell it to
advertisers not to sell it to
advertisers but use it to target ads and
use it to to you know make your to make
it make it richer and more valuable the
concern is that that that's just sort of
too much an invasion in privacy and that
there's risks if you get hacked on one
thing mate someone will know that much
more information about you so the
average user is this going to be a
noticeable change for them no okay the
average user is not going to see know
anything that's going on they're not
going to see any difference i mean this
is all really about facebook's ability
to do more with data so that it can be a
smarter advertising platform yeah and
that's what it's all about in the end
right for facebook and you know if you
don't like that don't use facebook yeah
that's what it comes to me he doesn't
cost to use it you've agreed to use it
if you agree to use it and share things
you know or you should know that that's
what they do they share your they use
your data to target you with ads in
their view hopefully ads that are
meaningful to you if you're a music fan
they want to show you ads of concerts
nearby that you might want to see I mean
you know does not all hateful stuff this
is how the media works I get a lot of
ads for shoes I don't know what that
