excited about is messengered last year
messenger was the fastest growing app in
the u.s. ahead of even Facebook which
was second messenger just passed nine
hundred million monthly actives and now
between messenger and whatsapp people
are sending about 60 billion messages a
day so to put that in perspective at its
peak global SMS volume was right around
20 billion messages a day so we're
processing about three times as many
messages as SMS ever did and these
services are still growing incredibly
quickly so now that messenger has scaled
we're starting to develop ecosystems
around it and the first thing we're
doing is exploring how you can all
communicate with businesses now you
probably interact with dozens of
businesses every day and some of them
are probably really meaningful to you
but I've never met anyone who likes
calling a business and no one wants to
have to install a new app for every
service or business that they want to
interact with so we think that there's
got to be a better way to do this we
think that you should just be able to
message a business and the same way
you'd message a friend you should get a
quick response and it shouldn't take
your full attention like a phone call
would and you shouldn't have to install
a new app so today we're launching
messenger platform so you can build BOTS
for messenger and it's a simple platform
it's powered by artificial intelligence
so you can build natural language
services to communicate directly with
people so let's take a look so CNN for
example is going to be able to send you
a daily digest of stories right into
messenger and the more you use it the
more personalized it'll get and if you
want to learn about a specific topic
like say the Supreme Court nomination or
the Zika virus you just send a message
and it'll send you that information or
take 1-800 flowers I love this one
now if you want to send a message flower
you don't have to install a new app or
into your credit card again you just
send a message and I bet that's not who
you thought those flowers were going to
I know someone who's sitting here today
who also thought that those were not who
those flowers were going to now I have
to say I love this one I find it pretty
ironic because now to order from 1-800
flowers you never have to call 1-800
flowers again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
