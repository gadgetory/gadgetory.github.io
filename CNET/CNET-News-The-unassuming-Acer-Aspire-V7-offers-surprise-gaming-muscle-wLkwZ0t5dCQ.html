a look at the Acer Aspire v7 now you may
look at this rather unassuming 14-inch
ultrabook and say it looks kind of drab
looks like it belongs maybe in an office
cubicle you would not be wrong it's got
a very kind of gray brushed metal look
black keys off that little black around
the screen bezel here kind of two-tone
nothing super exciting but I was pretty
impressed with what was under the hood
in this particular review unit we've got
an Intel Core i7 CPU it's got a big 1
terabyte hard drive it also has a small
SSD cache to it it's got a 1080p
touchscreen you know full 1920 by 1080
and most importantly it's got an NVIDIA
GeForce 750 M graphics card now that's
not a super high-end hardcore gamer
graphics card but you know what for
mainstream gaming it's pretty good and
about as good as you're gonna get in a
super slim Ultrabook style laptop like
this now that means this is a little bit
more expensive than maybe what you'd
expect to pay for something that's so
kind of plain looking this configuration
is I think 1199 but there are several
other pre-configured versions of the
aspire v7 that you can find my favorite
I was about $8.99 you knock the hard
drive down to five hundred gigs you
knock the CPU down to a core i5 but to
keep that Nvidia 750 graphics card and
you know what for playing games like
Skyrim or Bioshock as long as you play
it at medium settings you can keep the
resolution all the way up at 1920 by
1080 and it plays fairly well I still
think for 1,200 bucks and adds a little
bit of a budget feel I didn't love the
really shallow keyboard or the touchpad
but for gaming a feeling of small and
compact and slim you're not gonna do a
heck of a lot better than this I'm Dan
Ackerman and that is the Acer Aspire v7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
