features they want most in the iPhone 5
ever since we got our hands on the
iPhone 4 that was in 2010 but currently
at over 40,000 votes and with the iPhone
released probably just months away it
seems as good as time as any to count
down the top 5 most wanted features in
the iPhone 5 as decided by you starting
off at number 5 wireless charging Nikola
Tesla would be so proud I've always
dreamed of a day when volts of
electricity would rip through my house
and charge all my gadgets I'm not alone
wait oh you don't mean those inductive
charging things do you I guess that's
cool
but I'm more excited about number four a
revamped slimmer design we've been
living with this iPhone design for two
years now and it wasn't even that great
the first time remember antenna gate
remember when the Apple employee left
the prototype at the bar at people
didn't believe was real because it was
so ugly yeah it's time for an update
it's also time for the iPhone to be 4G
and I'm talking about LTE 4G not that
rinky-dink HSPA+ stuff the AT&amp;amp;T has been
passing off as 4G the iPhone is getting
smoked on data speed right now and it's
time for Apple to step up and that's why
4G is coming in at number three number
two is longer battery life let's face it
this thing has become an extension of
your brain at this point and when the
battery dies you can barely function
Apple can make this thing last longer
I think the collective anxiety of the
whole world will ratchet down just a
little now before we get to the number
one most requested iPhone 5 feature
let's acknowledge one of the rumored
features that CNET readers are furious
about a smaller connection port the
rumor mill is pretty confident the Apple
will finally cut off this vestigial tail
left over from the iPod and go with a
new smaller connection I could force you
to buy some new accessories and that
hurts
and finally the number one feature you
want from the iPhone 5 a bigger screen
compared to all the giant honking
Android phones out there right now the
iPhone 5s 3.5 inch screen is enough to
give you an inferiority complex for
something designed in the USA this is
downright unamerican
so there you go those are your top five
most requested features for the iPhone 5
or whatever Apple is gonna call it more
top 5s like these visit top 5 dot
