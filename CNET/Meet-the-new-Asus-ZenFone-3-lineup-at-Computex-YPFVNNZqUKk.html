I'm here in Taiwan to check out the
three news and phones from Asus now
what's new you asked I have good news
for one asus has stopped using plastic
in a zenfone line and these come in
aluminum and glass let's go check it out
shall we
on the left is the zenfone 3 and in the
middle is the powerful flagship is
zenfone 2 deluxe and finally on the
right the crazy big sample 300 true now
as a student review prices before hand
but we should have updated information
in our hands on below first up is the
mid-range zenfone 3 and it's the first
in the world will use Qualcomm
Snapdragon 625 octa-core processor and
it comes planning block now the phone
has a bright 5.5 inch full HD display a
fingerprint sensor as well as a 16
megapixel rear camera with 4x s optical
image stabilization polygons are
surprisingly good phone from su sets
easily on par and may even surpass other
mid-range devices if price right now if
the normal zenfone 2e impressive seems a
very deluxe will easily as done with
it's even better hardware like recent
flexure phones that spots the powerful
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 I will have up
to 6 gigabytes of RAM will not be curved
aluminum rear and camera wise is a 23
megapixel shooter that should help you
take great shots
is it a flagship killer though we'll
have to find out now Rafi
lastly DJ pon-3 ultra is one for the
entertainment addicts and the big six
point eight inch screen should be great
for video watching or playing games it
has a built-in 4k TV processor that will
make video panning smooth and has DTS
7.1 audio technology in the headphones
I'm still not a fan of the size I think
you look really silly answering phone
calls now asus has done a great job in
stepping out its game with these bold
beautiful new phones and they'll be
available very soon I can't wait to get
my hands oh hang on I won't wait
