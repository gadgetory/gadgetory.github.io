showing you guys the LG optimus 3d max
as you might have guessed the 3d max is
just like its 2011 predecessor the
Optimus 3d in that it lets you view
images and videos in 3d without the need
to wear those goofy 3d glasses using
what's called a parallax barrier which
lies over the 4.3 inch gorilla glass
display your left and right I've you two
different sets of pixels or images when
seen simultaneously it gives the image
you're looking at a sense of depth one
of the biggest complaints about this
technology is that it requires you to
look at the screen at just the right
angle in order to see images properly I
had to hold the phone about 12 to 16
inches away and I had to be held dead
center in front of my face if I tilted
or shifted the handset just a few
degrees the images would be all often
that get pretty nauseating especially
when playing games where general
movement is a given on the side of the
3d max is a shortcut 3d button which
gives you quick access to your 3d games
3d YouTube videos and the 3d camera the
2 5 megapixel camera lenses on the back
let you take pictures and record Full HD
1080p video in 2d but when you switch to
3d mode you can only say photo files
that are 3 megapixels big and record
only 720p HD video one other neat thing
about the 3d max is that it has an NFC
chip inside and comes packaged with
three LG tag plus stickers these
stickers allow you to activate certain
settings on your phone that you
customized for example whenever you go
to sleep you may want to put your phone
on vibrate dim your screen and have your
music turn off after 10 minutes of
playing once you set up those settings
using the LG tag plus feature you can
save it and then activate it whenever
you tap your sleep mode tag sticker
other than that the 3d max is an Android
Gingerbread device that's powered by a
1.2 gigahertz dual-core processor and a
15 20 milliamp per hour battery now the
3d max just launched in Europe about a
month ago and it is it available in the
US yet there's no word on the pricing or
the carrier but we're hoping it'll make
its way across the ocean soon again I'm
Lynn bringing you guys the LG optimus 3d
max</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
