iPhones iPods and iPads and you've
probably run into this problem someone
connects their new iPhone to your home
computer and loads up a few of their
favorite songs and accidentally ends up
with your embarrassing voice memos and
all of your contacts don't let this
happen to you
I'm Donnell Bell and today I'm going to
show you how to sync multiple eye
devices to one computer while
maintaining a degree of privacy the
first thing you need to know is that you
can avoid a lot of this mess by
wirelessly syncing your apps and music
and data using iCloud which is now baked
right into iOS it used to be that you
had to sync your iPhone to a computer
just to activate it but that's no longer
the case so if you can break the habit
of connecting up to your computer you're
going to be a lot better off my second
tip for avoiding this mess is to just
create multiple user accounts on your
Mac or PC you can have your iTunes your
husband or wife can have theirs and
everything is kept separate and tidy all
of that said if you really want to sync
more than one iPhone or iPad to a single
iTunes library here's how to do it now
here's my iTunes library filled with all
my media which my wife mostly hates but
let's say she's in a hurry and she
really wants to get this Bjork album
before heading out I'm going to connect
your iPhone watch it pop up in iTunes
here on the left click on it and you'll
see a panel of all the phone settings
the critical options here are the first
and the last we want to make sure that
this is not set up to automatically sync
when connected and then we want to
enable the ability to manually manage
music and videos after that we'll click
through on each of these other tabs just
to make sure that nothing else is set up
to sync no contacts no apps no Podcast
books or photos none of it
then hit apply to make these new
settings stick now if this is the first
time you tried syncing this device with
your iTunes library you might get a
warning that says the phone was
originally set up to be used with
another computer and that you're about
to erase this phone and sync it with
content from this library that's some
heavy language and if it scares you too
much you can try one of the other
techniques I mentioned earlier but since
what we're really
doing here is freeing this thing up to
sink medium annually and we check that
no other apps or info or other settings
are being synced to this phone I'm going
to take the leap alright now that that's
done finally I'm going to locate that
Bjork album my wife wants my iTunes
collection here and manually drag and
drop the songs on to the phone icon
now up at the top you can see that
they're copying right over when I'm all
done I can hit eject and check the phone
and I should see that the music I added
is right there in the music menu so
that's how to sync two phones on one
computer while still keeping things like
apps and contacts separate more iPhone
tips head over to how to see Netcom I'm
