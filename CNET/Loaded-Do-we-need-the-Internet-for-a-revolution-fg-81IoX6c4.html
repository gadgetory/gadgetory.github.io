Morris and it's time to get loaded sadly
the internet is still down in Egypt
after the last week of turmoil and
protest Google and Twitter have come up
with a way around the communication cut
they've launched speak to tweet it lets
anyone with a voice connection dial an
international phone number and speak
their tweet into the service google will
translate that to text and tweet it with
the hashtag egypt it is really
interesting to follow this hashtag
knowing that some of these tweets are
coming from behind an international
firewall but i will say this i know you
didn't ask me for this opinion but i'm
going to give it anyway despite the
internet being down this uprising is
unprecedented more people than ever have
come together in such unexpected ways
which makes me think that sometimes we
might overstate the power of digital
communications sure it's been
inconvenient this lack of communication
but it hasn't stopped what is
organically fueled by real life
community I think sometimes we forget
that we can be just as powerful offline
as we can be online moving on face book
certainly makes long flights go faster
the social network will be free to
access on seven major airlines during
domestic flights this means that if you
open your browser and go to Facebook on
these flights it's free if you want to
go somewhere else on the web you have to
pay for the gogo inflight internet
service but what if you want to click on
a link through facebook I don't know the
answer to that but I do know that this
promotion will be good for the month of
februari facebook also may be launching
a comment system this would mean that
you could use Facebook as the engine
behind the comments you want to leave on
a blog or a website google has something
similar that lets you use your google ID
to login to a blog comment but those
comments don't necessarily go on a
Google profile whereas i can imagine
facebook would integrate your comments
into your feed a new class action suit
claims that AT&amp;amp;T systematically
overstates the amount of data it bills
to iphone customers when you visit a
website it's unclear exactly how much
data you're using on your phone we kind
of have to trust a tease estimation well
some customers don't at all trust AT&amp;amp;T
they allege that 80 overstates the
number by anywhere from seven to
fourteen percent the consulting firm
representing this suit proved this by
buying a new phone turning off all email
push notifications and apps and left the
phone idle for ten days the account was
built for 2292 kilobytes over 35
transactions you gotta admit that looks
bad apple is not getting more lacks
about its appstore policies in fact just
the opposite the company is getting more
strict about what it allows in the App
Store and has told certain developers
like Sony that it can no longer sell
ebooks in their apps or give customers
access to purchases that they've made
outside the App Store Sony's EV tarap
was rejected which is inexplicable
because amazon's kindle has an e reader
app so does barnes &amp;amp; noble and borders
and several others Apple told Sony that
the in-app purchases must all go through
Apple in President Obama's State of the
Union address last week he specifically
mentioned Facebook as the kind of
innovation this country needs this week
the Obama administration launched
startup America a national campaign
aimed at promoting more entrepreneurship
just like this the foundation will be
run by AOL founder Steve Case and will
look to help fund good ideas in
technology startups that's your news of
the day I will be on vacation until the
end of next week so you will be in the
very good hands with Marc Lucia and Jeff
Bakalar until then if you want more
