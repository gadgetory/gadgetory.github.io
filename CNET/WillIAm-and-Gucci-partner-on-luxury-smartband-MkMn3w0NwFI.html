announced a partnership with Black Eyed
Peas will.i.am
we're here in Basel in Switzerland now
although they have announced a
partnership they haven't yet announced
an actual product will.i.am did show off
a prototype device on his wrist which he
says will have 3G and things like GPS so
we'll be able to work independently of a
phone
unlike the watches we've currently seen
from Android wear and of course at the
Apple watch sadly though that does mean
there's no time frame on when we can
expect the device to come the device did
look quite big on will.i.am wrist when
he was presenting on stage although of
course as a prototype the design could
change wildly before it goes on sale of
course with Gucci on board you can
imagine that it will be extremely
fashion orientated and of course
probably come with quite a high price
some things we do know about the watch
though is that it has a front-facing
camera it has GPS 3g it can control your
music and it will have a voice assistant
called a meter that's pretty much all we
know about the watch so far but we are
expecting to hear more about it in the
coming months so make sure to keep your
eye on cnet.com I'm Andrew Hoyle and I'm
here at Basel world talking to Gucci and
will.i.am</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
