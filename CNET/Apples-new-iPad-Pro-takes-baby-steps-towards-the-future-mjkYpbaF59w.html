earlier this year now there are new ipad
bros what's the difference here
well the iPad pro is Apple's premium
tablet and it just got an overdue
upgrade it's a super-powered tablet with
art and work extras it's a computer
replacement maybe it's a gradual step in
the direction of Apple's life beyond
MacBook whether or not you need one
depends on whether you're ready to let
an iPad be more than well an iPad the
10.5 inch iPad pro now sits in the
middle between the springs iPad which is
less expensive and the twelve point nine
inch iPad pro which also got an upgrade
the difference in screen size over the
9.7 pro last year which we loved isn't
huge but it makes a difference for art
photo apps movies or split-screen it can
be helpful keyboards both virtual and
real also gain a bit of finger space but
it feels more like a refresh than a full
revolution the new iPad is a brighter
faster variable refresh rate display
that Apple calls pro motion with more
pixels but the same pixel density as
other iPads but the 9.7 inch pro display
was already great owners of the new 12
point 9 inch version are going to see
the greatest improvement especially with
anti-reflective 'ti which the 9.7
already had abs if around and some
animation can fly most everyday apps
don't really use it a ton but apple says
the variable refresh rate helps battery
life pencil works mostly the same but a
bit faster honestly considering how good
it was before it may be hard for non
artists to appreciate the difference in
the near future what could really make
things change is iOS 11 which adds
multitasking full Universal cloud and
local file access a larger dock for apps
and immediate pencil note-taking but
it's not here yet that's coming in the
fall right now with iOS 10 the new pro
is better but older pro owners probably
don't need to upgrade now what it isn't
is really a full computer as far as a
laptop goes the iPad pro doesn't have
any new accessories that make it any
more laptop like Apple's smart keyboard
is the same and really
isn't lap friendly and of course there's
pencil but there's no trackpad for the
iPad and that means using it differently
than a MacBook or Windows PC iOS 11 may
help a lot but will it do everything
power users hope it will hard to tell
yet this is the best of the current
iPads and it's a great upgrade for a
longtime user I wrote my whole review on
this thing but I didn't do my edits on
it
