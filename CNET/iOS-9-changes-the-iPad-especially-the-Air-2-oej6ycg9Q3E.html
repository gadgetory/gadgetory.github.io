but it's actually running iOS 9 the iOS
9 public beta is available now and this
is the first time Apple has allowed a
public beta for its operating system if
you want to explore it you can it
actually adds a couple of features on
the iPad that have been long overdue and
are really exciting here are the top
ones you can actually multitask now but
you need an iPad air 2 in order to do
this it's called split view and it's a
lot like what you may have seen on
Samsung tablets you can do it on Windows
laptop so you can now do it on an iPad
you can put two apps side-by-side snap
them together and you can do two things
at once
it only works with a core set of Apple
apps at the moment but it'll eventually
be able to work with more apps there's
also something called slide over which
is a little different you can swipe from
the side and bring up a list of apps and
then you can tap to bring up that app
and quickly respond to a message or
check your email and then swipe right
back into the app you were in before
that's available on more iPad models
there's also a picture and picture again
you may have seen this on other tablets
but it pops out the video that you're
looking at and allows you to resize it
and move it around to a little window
while you're working on other things
really nice in case you're watching
something live I just want to keep up on
something at the same time
finally you can turn your keyboard into
a trackpad something I've been looking
for for years but it only works on the
on-screen keyboard you have to hold your
two fingers down and then suddenly the
cursor above can be moved around as you
move your two fingers
Apple has a new news app it works a lot
like other news apps that you may have
seen out there like Flipboard Apple's
does look nicely laid out doesn't work
with all new sources yet but you can
experiment with it and try looking at
the layout those are some of the key
features on iOS 9 for the iPad there are
a whole lot more including better
battery life and improved Siri you can
check out those and more on CNET
good luck exploring I'm Scott Steiner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
