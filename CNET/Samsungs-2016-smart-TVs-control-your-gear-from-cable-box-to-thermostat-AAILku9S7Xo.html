functions on their TVs mainly because
external devices like Roku and Apple TV
are much better but Samsung has added
two new features to its latest batch of
2016 models that do stuff no Roku or
Apple TV cam and unlike most smart TV
options these capabilities are actually
pretty compelling
the first is easier control of external
devices like cable boxes game consoles
and streamers plug the device into one
of the TV's HDMI inputs it will
automatically set up the TV's remote to
operate the device you will it access
the program guide DVR menus and other
functions using Samsung's TV remote the
coolest part is that it's all as easy as
plug-and-play no device codes or model
numbers to track down just plug in the
device and the TV does the rest samsung
says it has 90 percent of the cable
boxes covered now with DirecTV coming in
June and support for hundreds of other
devices including Roku and Apple TV
available right now
I can't wait to test the feature myself
if it works it might finally be able to
replace universal remote
the second big feature of all surround
smartthings which is one of seen its
favorite smart home eco systems and is
now owned by Samsung mid-range and
high-end Samsung sets for 2016 will be
able to act exactly like a smartthings
hub that means to be able to control
lights security cameras thermostats and
more right from the TV screen you can
even set up so-called routines for
example a motion detector that turns on
the lights opens the blinds and turns a
TV onto your favorite channel buyers of
the new TVs will get a coupon in the box
that entitles them to get a free smart
things extend dongle that plugs into the
back of the TV it's going to be
available in June that's a quick look at
two of the most exciting features on
Samsung's 2016 Smart TVs both will be
available in 7 8 &amp;amp; 9 series models stay
tuned for the full reviews I'm David
