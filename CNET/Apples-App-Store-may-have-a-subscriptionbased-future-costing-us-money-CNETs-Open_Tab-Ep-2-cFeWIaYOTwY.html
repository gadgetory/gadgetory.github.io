this is the show where we wrap up the
week some drinks and break down the tech
topics with you live right here on
facebook i'm jeff bakalar and with me is
the lovely and talented lauda martinez
from cnet espanol and last week's
bartender now allowed to breathe free
air this week's topic bringer we're
going to call you topic bringer senior
associate editor Joseph Kaminski what is
up sir hey how's everything great great
ok hold on you hold that thought Mike
Sorrentino is over in the control room
with Brian Van Gelder he's watching your
facebook comments and we'll be bringing
you into our conversation so if you want
to comment on what we're talking about
sending a little comment Mike's gonna
see it he's going to put it in the
speaker here we're going to talk about
it now it doesn't have to be just tech
it could be anything you want to talk
about your creepy mother-in-law yeah
we'll talk about her we'll get that
straightened out for you that's what
we're here for this is an open forum we
are ready to talk to you so make sure
you comment in the section below so
Joseph we heard that something going on
with Apple and Google and a new sort of
payment system it's freaking you out
let's get down to it so this week Apple
announced that they are going to start
well they currently charged thirty
percent for subscriptions to their app
store to developers um able to make that
correct so they plan on doing moving
forward if these developers can maintain
the subscribers for over a year period
they will then charge them 15%
thereafter so it's in their best
interest to maintain the subscribers for
a year it sounds like them you know like
the movie theater model you know how
that works we're like a movie comes out
the first couple of weeks the studio
gets all the money but then as time goes
by the money shifts and the theater gets
more of the money similar kind of thing
ever they charge less for popcorn at
that point yeah google also announced
something similar without the retention
rule they also are going to charge
fifteen percent but they haven't yet
stated what date that
take place Apple's is supposed to go
into effect jun 13 so your gears are
grinded what's what's the problem my
gears are Clark I'm all for the
developers making money my gears are
grinding because I don't want to get
stuck paying for a subscription for them
to make me the beta tester if you're
going to put out a product what does
this have to do with beta testing well
my whole point is if you're gonna put
out a product right like if you're going
to develop an app and I'm going to be
charged a monthly subscription for this
set appt right I wanted to perform as
advertised across all my devices I don't
want it to maybe work on my iPhone or
not my iPad or on my you know my family
but I don't think that applies to like
what they're trying to sell well i'm not
that i was there trying to sell but i
just don't know how it's like with this
incentive you can have people coming out
of the woodworks trying to manufacture
apps for subscription-based right and I
don't want poor quality I don't want the
quality of the app to suffer okay try to
get a monthly payment all right oh do
you do you have an opinion on this life
no yeah but I actually had a quest
younger my question was like if I
already paid for my from my app we're
talking about maybe angry birds as a
silly example I already pay for it or
didn't pay for it but I have it what
would happen then let's supposedly they
make this deal and now that they're
they're gonna let users pay maybe a
dollar a month to use it what happens
with the people that are already
downloaded okay people who have it
already are either grandfathered in or
they have some sort of grace period I
don't know because I haven't really as
far as I don't understand Apple hasn't
really said it right there was an
interview nice schiller saying a couple
of things to couples gonna video I am
too polite but I think one thing you you
can kind of say that's probably gonna
happen is an app that would maybe be
like five bucks up front maybe this is
like a dollar a month kind of thing
where you feel okay or like a 99-cent a
month sort of thing we're like you feel
okay leaving a dollar a month but maybe
that five buck you know the 599 699
upfront costs kind of scares people away
is we're right we don't even like if you
had to pay a dollar a month like you
feel sometimes like the month is ending
and then you have to use it it's not
weird it is weird well I don't know real
quick our control is telling you to
configure Mike a little bit know that
that also brings that also brings like
another point like I'm like app
developers that kullu and Netflix don't
really I don't think they'll have much
to worry about because I do I
continuously have them but like maybe
there's a certain app you may have for
like eight months and then you may
cancel a subscription and they maybe
three months later pick it up for like
another five months does Apple start you
all over again on the clock or do they
give you credit for that you still get
the fifteen percent because you've
exceeded a total of twelve months
there's a lot of gray areas it's just
not clear right now it's you know I just
I I don't if it's a good app I
definitely have no problem paying for I
mean especially if I can give my son a
nap to play with and he never asked to
ask me for in-app purchase again and
maybe also been eliminated a lot of the
advertisements yeah I'm curious to hear
what everyone watching on Facebook
things don't forget send in your
questions your comments whatever you
want to talk about we are happy to
address any concerns you may have I want
to talk about like the whole psychology
of like subscription-based sort of stuff
right because you know there's certain
things that I'm cool with giving money
to write every month like Netflix for
example five blocks were hey Jeff uh we
do have a couple comments with uh some
person was like so is this like Apple
music do you guys think that these
models will become more like all the
other subscriptions we get into yeah I
mean that's kind of like what I'm a
little mad at Apple music rain you're
mad at it well because I like like
everyone like well like everyone like
everyone else I had like a number of
original release songs in my my iphone
and right in my account and they've
gotten erased and redownloaded with the
remastered version fortunately for me I
have an older system with a lot of them
on there but now I gotta go dig them out
I gotta like rear it my CDs I mean I
gotta look for you gotta re rip your
seat welcome some of them like a some of
the tracks that's actually to put the
remastered version I like the original I
just wait something's nostalgia you like
I have CDs yes I have CDs you have five
CDs but like remastered is a better
master it doesn't take me back to that
moment when I first heard it you're a
crazy fan I will be crazy I just I want
that feeling you know it stop everybody
likes the original mac why do people
like vinyl they like that rewrites
you like vinyl go play gold I have I
know dude but I need to borrow one of
Justin's turntables a plug into my
computer look at me right now I'm
looking at you right now don't promise
me look at me and promise me you Don't
rear if all your CDs oh no no I'm just
my favorite certain tracks w gotta hold
out okay not really I amazon you know
thriller poorly come on I have a
thriller megamix ins watch out he's got
the Turner megabits that's who you know
I just wanted I mean there's a few
comments that maybe you guys should get
to them but i just wanted to point out
something i also know that one of the
changes coming yeah is it like the the
apps are going to be now listed a ranked
based on who pays for them which is an
interesting metrics you want to know
yeah but to me that's also kind of a
problem because i'm used to like going
to the app store and look for it for an
app that i want and then it gets a lot
of stars yeah as you live on the top
free tab yeah but now it's gonna be like
the Google pay searches and then I mean
I don't know again like you say people
have to make money I mean another
another thing that comes the question is
maybe now you might see a shift because
Google's is giving you fifteen percent
right now to take I'm sorry Google's
only taking fifteen percent right off
the bat once that starts maybe people
might not want to wait that whole year
period Apple you make people see people
just jump on the Google Play bandwagon
and start developing developing so
release actually that's one of one of
the comments are just just rode here's a
solution don't use a prop it sounds like
that's like subscription-based diamonds
are here to stay whether or not you want
them it is a frustrating for me it's
it's it's a little scary because it's
not something I necessarily want to get
in bed with you know that's not I like I
don't know there's certain apps that
I've paid for that I'm like totally
happy I pay for them I'm also curious
which apps will lend themselves to a
subscription model more so right like
your example with like a game like an
angry i wouldn't pay a dollar to be
plating maybe fifty cents a month well
that's a no i paid maybe once to
download it and took play with it in to
have it yeah and that's it if I want to
use it I you said you know I know it's
mine right no it's not like Netflix i
understand but that's different right
they are serving your new console to
their refreshing content all the time
for me there's new stuff in the game
well here's another
here's another factor in here what about
I feel like in an area where you're not
getting a good cell phone signal or
something all of a sudden it needs to
ping the server to authenticate that
you're actually still alive subscriber
right there are a lot of things a lot of
hangups a lot of things that I think
need to be worked out another concern of
mine at least is that if I'm going to
subscribe to multiple apps I don't want
like a dollar here a dollar there if
they can compile it into one bill maybe
monthly that mistake take that out the
way to look at a statement that says you
know I'm like who are these who are
these fingers so um that you know
depending on how clean that is and
they're gonna make it as easy as
possible so they say for you to spend
money I mean cuz I'm even I've even I
don't know I mean you don't use an iOS
device but I like an iPad but I mean
like I sometimes i'm on the ground and
I'm like trying to play a song that is
locally on my phone and sometimes it
hangs up because it's really thing Apple
music or whoever or whatever that is
soon so people could say no you're and I
have my offline it is offline so um
there's a lot of things going on in the
background that we're not always aware
of their show you guys over in the chat
we have on how people saying that a
little good if Google's about to do the
same thing is the concern you think
equal between both or is one scary than
the other I also we're going to call a
last call for comment so you have any
other questions or if things who wants
to bring up send them in now I think
Google's in a good position um they
they're coming out their aggressive
they're they're giving the developer
more incentive to develop for their
platform and and if in fact the
developer is making more money right off
the bat they can charge the end-user
less money for the subscription I mean
if you're paying 30 per se if the first
year Apple subscribers getting banged
out for thirty percent or should I say
Apple developers ignorant about thirty
percent they're gonna maybe try to make
up some revenue to continue adding new
features or our new value to their apps
like you know how we always you know not
handicapped an android version but wait
wait for that maybe that's not something
we're gonna kind of like how it used to
be back in the day with like Windows
apps for smack out look so much better
on a Windows machine until actually Mac
you know
yeah that's what I'm most curious to see
how it affects what apps look like and
what what kind of app can adopt the
subscription-based payment service
you're like I'm not paying like a dollar
so i can get the bluebird it's just
simply not going to be not only thing I
wanted to say is like maybe the good for
me as a user the good thing would be
that that's an incentive also for
developers to do less crappy apps like
if they if they have the incentive of
keeping me engaged for a full year so
they get more money then maybe they will
be serving me a better a better stuff
but like the meetings that little crash
or maybe we don't get this pop-up ads oh
no that well I definitely give it to the
advertisements and in our purchases that
would be great right I think yeah like
there should be a rule anything else
there's a guy there should be no pack
that cost ninety-nine dollars in any in
person no I know but listen I was
something to someone the other day and
we're talking about Netflix and I said
well you know what Netflix you don't get
ads because you're already happy and
willing to pay your monthly subscription
and then this person who happens to work
on netflix told me yeah don't be
surprised we get like attached no I'm
gonna add before Adam I'm going to be
I've been paying the extra two dollars
for a hulu with no commercials yeah that
is what came but cable started the idea
was it there was no gonna be any ads
right uh now you for like premium pretty
like AG no no it's what yes I think yeah
if you think Netflix is not gonna have
advertised on devil here I don't doubt
that well this is just just not not
after the show starts I'll I'll you know
I'll go get popcorn or whatever for the
ad at the beginning and i'll definitely
hit in nothing nothing and now i don't
want it i don't want anything in the
middle yeah alright that's the whole
point of it the immersive experience i'd
love that if that does it for all the
comments in our facebook live chat room
I think we're gonna have to call it this
has been great guys and Lori Oh louder
