can argue that they're more fun to play
than ever but the stories told by video
games pretty wack here are a few
examples of storytelling you can go on a
ride these games don't have the worst
stories in fact some of them are pretty
good but they all show some of the traps
that video games can fall into horizon
zero dawn is one of the best games I've
played in years but the story was a weak
link the post-apocalyptic world was
fascinating and full of mystery but the
characters within the world not so flash
halo was cool as an action hero but
fairly bland outside of that her story
was an unexceptional one about the
outsider that becomes the hero the side
characters are at best just there and
some feel like empty tropes like the
morally ambiguous Cylons who the game
tries way too hard to make feel
mysterious but I never told you the full
extent of my culpability 2013's Devil
May Cry reboot was awesome and the story
was good right until the end the
original game saw protagonist Dante and
his brother Virgil as deadly enemies but
in this game they're good buds and
worked together to defeat Mundus a demon
king their new buddy-buddy relationship
was a fresh take and totally believable
which made the plot twist at the end all
the more grown inducing yes free from
the demons the path is clear for us to
rule it really wasn't worth it just for
an actual boss fight what did you say
okay unpopular opinion out of the way
first I love the story in Kingdom Hearts
or at least I did it got super freaky
when it came to Kingdom Hearts dream
Drop Distance previous games in the
series had complicated stories but you
could follow them if you tried Kingdom
Hearts 3 TS is almost incomprehensible
as it introduces the always risky plot
element of time travel my future self
gave me a task to visit the splintered
versions of myself in many worlds a lot
of Japanese games get accused of being
too convoluted became the past 3d asset
is among the worst examples I've found
of a game that doesn't really even try
to make sense the Mass Effect games are
often touted as having some of the best
stories in the genre but I call foul on
that Mass Effect 2 was one of the many
games I picked up but couldn't really
get into in this case it wasn't
necessarily
about the story but more the
storytelling the game uses conversation
wheels to tell much of its story where
you choose what to ask characters in the
game you're encouraged to ask as much as
you can but since the dialogue isn't
written to be performed in any specific
order answers come out unnaturally long
and feel really tedious it's not just
Mass Effect that's guilty here as The
Witcher games and horizon zero dawn do
the same want to let me know how bad my
opinions are hit me up on Twitter or
