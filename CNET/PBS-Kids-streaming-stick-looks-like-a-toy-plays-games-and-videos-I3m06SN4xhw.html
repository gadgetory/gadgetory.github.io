and parents can both appreciate called
plug and play and it looks like a toy
car complete with a remote control
except this little car plugs into your
TV's HDMI jack and your kid will use the
remote to play games and watch videos on
the big screen
the version seen here is a green racecar
with a matching remote the PBS says
other car styles and colors will be
available yes the wheels actually work
and kids can roll it around but the plug
and play will spend most of its time
tucked behind your TV the package
includes a cable extender for tight fits
the clicker is super simple in size for
a child's hands since it uses bluetooth
that doesn't have to be aimed at the TV
kids we gave it to add no problem
figuring out the menus which is designed
to be fun and simple a big wheel lets
them play a variety of games and custom
designed apps all pre-loaded onto the
stick so they can be played offline
where there's no Wi-Fi road trip
adventure as a cooperative board game
kids and family members can play
together on a TV rail riders is a
procedurally generated train ride
scavenger hunt with dynamic scenery
sound box lets kids play composer with a
basic music maker while sing-along
features favorite song from PBS KIDS
shows although there's no mic so it's
not quite karaoke style and act the
stick to Wi-Fi and it works just like a
Roku Amazon fire or other streamer to
serve up the same full episodes and
clips of PBS Kids on demand shows from
Daniel Tiger to odd squad
exclusive to plug and play is also a
live TV feed of PBS kids 24/7 channel
just in case they've watched all those
videos already although is no App Store
and it can't play phone or tablet apps
PBS says plug and play will add more
games and software via updates over time
it cost 50 bucks and comes to Walmart
May 24th with other retailers coming in
September</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
