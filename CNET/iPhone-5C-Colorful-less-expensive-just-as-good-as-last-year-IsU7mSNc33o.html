colors I'm holding the most restrain one
white
there's also blue green yellow and pink
and they have a bright candy colored
lacquer type finish that's plastic and
where have we seen this before that's
right they were plastic back iPhones
before the iPhone 4 and the feel that
glossy plastic feel is pretty similar
not only can you pick which color you
want but they're also a bunch of cute
little rubber cases at Apple selling for
$29 each that have holes in them so you
can pop it in and create mix-and-match
colour options I mean it could be more
appealing for kids under the hood it's
really just an iPhone 5 so it's not some
sort of new kid phone experience or a
totally different iPhone experience it's
a new design for the exterior iOS 7 is
now pre-installed as it is with the
iPhone 5s so you're getting a pretty
different overhaul graphically for the
operating system but basically when you
boil it down the experience is pretty
similar there are a couple of additional
features like the free iTunes radio
streaming service airdrop which allows
you to share files locally with people
and you also have FaceTime audio calling
which sounds pretty good if you're on
Wi-Fi it sounds a lot better than making
regular phone calls via cellular now
some people worry in a bunch of phone
that there are gonna be some features
chapter stuff left out of the box at
least Apple's credit that has not
happened here in fact you get everything
you got last year with the iPhone 5
you've got the lightning cable the
charger the inline mic ear pod
headphones and plus no features have
been cut from the 5c in fact they've
added a couple again the FaceTime camera
is a bit better the battery life is a
bit better and the LTE worldwide
coverage is a bit better so you're not
gonna find anything missing from this
model how does the 5c compare to the
competition
well it's last year's hardware but the
iPhone 5 had pretty good hardware to
begin with
so a test out pretty well against that
budget tier of phones the base features
here why it's a good time to upgrade if
you're a budget shopper is because LTE
the fast browsing and the larger screen
which are probably the most appealing
features to a smartphone shopper are at
least on here they were missing in the
last model but you are lacking the
faster processor the better camera
and the fingerprint sensor that's in the
iPhone 5s so it's a nice time to go
budget but keep in mind there are a lot
of other phones out there that are
competing with the iPhone 5c it's a fun
phone and probably the best $90 dollar
iPhone that Apple hasn't made at least
we like the iPhone 5 before just one
year older now
Scott Stein and that's a quick look at
the iPhone 5c</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
