rumor has it the show that rounds up the
week's biggest tech rumors and you have
a chance to vote on what you think will
come true if you're watching on cnet now
I have no co-host this week because
everybody ditched me to attend Apple's
Worldwide Developers Conference and the
e3 gaming conference so let's just recap
the news from those two shows so WWDC
brought a set completely overhauled iOS
7 with airdrop and a new design just as
we predicted iTunes radio a new OS 10
called Mavericks new macbook airs and a
new Mac Pro that looks like a garbage
can but you know we didn't get any
mention of the iphone 5s i watch or
apple television set or a flying car on
the gaming front at e3 the microsoft
keynote gave us a november release date
for the xbox one and a four hundred
ninety nine dollar price tag what wasn't
mentioned was the whole used games
debacle although the company did have
stuff to say about it a few days before
e3 most notably that Microsoft will let
game publishers set the rules for
reselling games to retailers because hey
why keep all those emails from pissed
off gamers all to yourself right but my
favorite part of the whole event was
when they announced that they're finally
getting rid of stupid microsoft points i
don't think i've ever used a microsoft
point in my life but now that real
currency is involved instead my little
avatar person is getting a whole
makeover and a brand new wardrobe and
finally at a press conference on Monday
night we got to see the ps4 basically
it's a big black box sony also announced
that the ps4 won't have any used game
restrictions won't make you ping the
server every 24 hours like the Xbox one
it'll cost three hundred ninety nine
dollars and it will be out in time for
the holiday season Jack Tretton of Sony
said when a gamer buys a ps4 disk they
have the rights to use that disk they
can sell it to another person lend it to
a friend or keep it forever so take that
Microsoft booyah I can't wait to watch
how this plays out speaking of i watch
component suppliers seem to be ready for
iwatch production pointing to an inn
recently likely launched in the second
half of 2013 according to city analyst
Glenn young here's the thing about
analysts though they get paid to make
things up so take this one with a grain
of salt although recent news has
indicated that an iWatch is imminent
apple reportedly filed for an iWatch
trademark in russia the economic times
reported the apples been checking out
1.5 inch OLED screens and Bloomberg says
that the watch is slated to be rolled
out this year so based on all that
nothing we really know nothing next up
Samsung could introduce a 12.2 inch
version of the galaxy note tablet in the
second half of the year according to ET
news not to be confused with ET phone
home or entertainment tonight that's
still on right according to the Korean
websites industry sources the samsung
tablet will feature a 2560 by 1600 pixel
display and will come with an S Pen
Stylus although there's no outright
mention of a name we could assume it'll
be part of the note line if this rumor
pans out that means that there will be a
galaxy note a galaxy note 8 a galaxy
note 10 and a galaxy note 12 Samsung
loves giving you a million different
size options for the same product it
just loves it back to my favorite topic
gaming so Microsoft wants you to pay a
hundred dollars more for a system that
has restrictions and complications like
it's used game policy and having to be
connected to the Internet so after
Sony's announcement I think that
Microsoft will have to back off on the
xbox one and ease up on some of its
policies but what do you guys think will
Microsoft stand down will it hold its
ground don't forget to vote and leave a
comment and we'll check in with the cnet
council the cnet council is composed of
five editors who cast their votes
anonymously their opinions are not an
endorsement by cnet or CBS interactive
obviously because these are rumors folks
and the scenic counsels verdict is no
they outvoted me 322 that Microsoft will
not ease up on its super restrictive
policies that's our show everybody
please share your rumors at rumor has it
at cnet com or call us at 1 800 750 cnet
and tweet us and tune in next week for
more tech rumors
