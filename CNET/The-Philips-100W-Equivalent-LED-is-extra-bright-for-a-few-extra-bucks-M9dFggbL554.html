the Phillips 100 watt equivalent LED
this is a 19 watt LED that gives off a
stated sixteen hundred and eighty lumens
I say stated because Energy Star ranked
that light output at sixteen hundred and
twenty lumens and in our own testing lab
we found it to be down on that end of
the scale as well so that's still very
good anything 1600 lumens are up is very
good for 100 watt equivalent but still
maybe not quite as bright as Philips is
Thomas but here take a look for yourself
on the left he's got the cream 100 watt
replacement and then the middle of the
GE 100 watt replacement both of those
are 1600 lumens now if I turn this bulb
on on the right that's Philips that's
the 1680 lumen bulb that they're talking
about doesn't look dramatically brighter
than these two and you should be able to
notice a slight difference you should be
able to say that's the brighter of the
three bulbs if we're talking about the
eye test
I don't think Philips quite gets there
you'll find the philips LED on sale at
Home Depot for $22 that's one dollar
more than the GE LED and two dollars
more than you'll pay for the cree LED
given that i just don't see how i can
recommend it even though it is a pretty
good LED thanks for watching be sure to
