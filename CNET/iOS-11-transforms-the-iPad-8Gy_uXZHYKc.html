ipad does it turn it into a laptop well
not exactly but iOS 11s public beta is
here to download and it definitely adds
a lot to your iPad or iPad pro some of
its great other things take some getting
used to but keep in mind this is a beta
do not install on your main device or
make sure you backup everything first
that being said here's what you can do
pencil does more if you have one in an
iPad pro tap the iPad and you can take
notes instantly in notes or you could do
the same thing with a PDF you can mark
up anything now actually just by taking
a screenshot this will come in handy
sooner or later like so you could
already split-screen multitasking iPads
before but i OS 11 also adds a new dock
like a MacBook
keine you can fill it with over a dozen
apps plus a few that pop up based on
recent history or Siri recommendations
but swiping is different now you swipe
up to get the dock drag an app into
place and then swipe down on the app to
snap it into split view swipe up one
more time and now you have all the open
apps including ones in side-by-side mode
that you can swap between next to all
this is a new compact control center
pull of a completely redesigned layout
of quick access buttons that can be
reconfigured in settings in split view
there's also a new drag-and-drop feature
there works with pictures links and some
other things but it takes some getting
used to to figure out how to drive and a
third app can pop up on top of the other
two but still none of these can be
configured beyond a few preset modes in
iOS
there is a files app that's a place to
find all your files or create folders
for your documents is it useful hard to
tell because I'm not used to having a
place to access all my files on an iPad
but it's a lot easier to start
collecting documents on the go
finally the on-screen keyboard does have
flickable keys that can make entering
numbers and symbols easier this plus a
lot of other things watch our iOS 11
video on the iPhone 4 more all work on
the beta the iPads pencil benefits of
time for multitasking it could be great
but it also feels like a whole new set
of gestures to learn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
