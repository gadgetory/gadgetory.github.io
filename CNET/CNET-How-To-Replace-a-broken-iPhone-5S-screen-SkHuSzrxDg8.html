cracked and it's not under warranty
you can either live with it get a new
phone or as I'm going to show you fix it
before beginning the repair you'll need
to gather the necessary replacement
parts and the tools the iPhones front
panel and LCD are fused together so I
recommend buying them both as a single
unit now you'll find them anywhere from
$50 to $150 online just be sure that you
buy the right one for your phone and
read the reviews of the people who have
installed them not all replacement
screens are made to the same tolerances
as the original part I also suggest you
buy a replacement screen with the front
facing camera earpiece and sensor
assembly already attached the home
button however is another story very few
if any replacement screens come with the
5 s's fingerprint scanning home button
before installing the new screen you'll
need to transfer the button from your
old screen to the new one but we'll get
to that in a minute as for tools you'll
need a few thin prying tools tweezers a
Philips triple-zero screwdriver suction
cup and a special pentalobe screwdriver
for removing the phone's outer case
screws now I'll be replacing the panel
on an 18 t iPhone 5s but you can use the
same basic steps on phones from other
carriers and with the exception of the
steps relating to the home button on the
iPhone 5 and 5c lastly noted by
following these instructions you do so
at your own risk and remember to back up
the data on your phone
before starting with all the prep work
finished we'll start the repair by
ejecting the SIM card next remove the
two screws located along the bottom edge
and gently lift up on the front panel
using the suction cup and a prying tool
if necessary take care not to pull the
panel too far before completely removing
the panel we'll need to disconnect
several cables starting with the one for
the home button which is covered by a
small metal bracket to disconnect the
other cables we'll need to remove a
metal shield on the upper portion of the
motherboard finally we can detach the
panel's three remaining cables
and completely remove it before we can
install our new panel we need to
transfer the touch ID enabled home
button from the old panel to the new one
so first remove the single screw that
secures the buttons cable note the
position of the small contact under the
screw it will need to be in the same
position on the new panel next very
gently fold the cable down so we can
access the metal bracket underneath now
remove the two screws attached to the
bracket and the bracket itself finally
comes the most delicate part of the
process very very carefully pry the home
button cable away from the front panel
followed by the home button itself you
may need to apply a little heat to
soften the adhesive as you remove these
components you may also need to push up
on the button from the front of the
panel just be gentle and go slowly with
the home button removed we can place it
on our new panel reattach the bracket
and reposition the cable we are now
ready to install the new display so
reconnect the cables at the top of the
panel and replace the metal shield then
reconnect the home button and reposition
its metal bracket lastly press the new
panel onto the frame and secure it with
the two pentalobe screws as fixes go
this one isn't too tough but it does
take a lot of patience and attention to
detail for more handy tips and tutorials
