Superman on film this is Superman right
now it shouldn't be here are five ways
to make Superman so much better you
might even like him on film at number
five vibrate sure let's believe a world
were a man from outer space so happens
to look like a human being and has
nearly limitless powers due to the
Yellow Sun but are you telling me that
no one in the world has taken a clear
picture of Superman and figured out who
he is between facial recognition tech
and everyone having a camera in their
phone his secret identity should be
blown by now so let's use a trick used
by Superman in the comics that a certain
Scarlet speedster uses frequently on TV
vibrate slightly that would mean every
image of Superman is blurry that would
protect Clark and his family and
speaking of Clark number four make Clark
Kent distinctly different than Superman
in the current movie universe this is
Superman and this is Clark Kent each man
is the size of a brick wall the method
of handling the Clark Superman thing was
well explored by Christopher Reeve Clark
is so vanilla he does not stand out
Clark in the modern movies is kind of a
jerk to his boss which should get him
noticed a bit and number three smarten
up the current Superman in movies might
be the dumbest version ever I'm talking
about his lack of intelligence here he's
not the smartest character in comics but
he should be able to put together a few
thoughts at any given time that could
avoid all kinds of messes in Batman V
Superman dawn of justice spoiler
upcoming is there any reason he couldn't
have one of his peers used that
kryptonite spear instead of deciding to
do it himself that's just one instance
of super stupidity and number two cheer
up no one really trust Superman in the
movies why I don't know maybe smile more
how about talking more Superman is so
dour perhaps he'll be more cheery after
he comes back from the dead at number
one let him be good what does Superman
stand for what's his
rules great questions you would think
that two movies would establish what
exactly is at the core of Superman that
Captain America movies showed you you
can have a character who stands for
truth and justice without being
completely boring and if you think i
have a marvel bias I don't the 1970s
Superman film also managed to do the
same thing if the goal is to do the
storyline from injustice where Superman
becomes an evil dictator maybe the
audience would be more invested in him
if he was a true good guy before turning
evil no one watches this part so I just
like to say I was not a Superman fan
until I read the man of steel mini
series by john byrne it showed why the
character could be relevant and
interesting go read if you get a chance
anyway I'm I as actor I'll see you
