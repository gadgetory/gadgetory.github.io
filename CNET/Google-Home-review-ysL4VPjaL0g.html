it's Google's answer to the Amazon echo
it has the conversational Google
assistant built-in it's not that
expensive at 130 bucks versus 180 for
the echo it's a personal assistant that
can sync with your Google Calendar and
other Google services for personalized
updates it's an entertainment hub with a
built-in speaker and the ability to cast
to chromecast devices it's a smart home
controller that works with nest smart
things Philips you and if the hype is
real this is it and all you have to do
is say ok Google or hey Google and
unleash the power of Google home but now
it's time to put the hyper side we've
tested it so does it live up to the hype
does it beat the Amazon echo let's go
one category at a time since we're here
in the CNET smart home let's start with
smart home controls ok google turn on
the living room light sure turning the
living room table lamp on it works well
with smart home control Google also
responds more flexibly to language with
Alexa you have to get the words exactly
right
Google works really well as an
entertainment hub hey Google Play home
sweet home by motley crew on the
upstairs speakers
you can send music to any google cast
enabled speaker or a speaker with a
chromecast music streamer plugged in you
can also group speakers and play synched
music throughout your house you can even
control your TV if you have a chromecast
device but only YouTube for now hey
Google Play
CNET videos on the living room TV sure
playing
CNET videos from youtube on living room
Google's also good as a personal
assistant hey Google add air freshener
to my shopping list I'm almost out
other than disguising itself as an air
freshener Google home can check your
calendar for you wake you up in the
morning and give you a personalized
daily briefing and it responds to some
context in your questions quiz time you
ready hey Google who plays Katniss
Everdeen Katniss Everdeen was played by
Jennifer Lawrence hey Google what other
movies is she in her movies include
silver linings playbook joy and 25
others but the context has to stay
really simple hey Google who plays
Batman Batman was played by Ben Affleck
Christian Bale and others okay Google
who else sorry I don't know how to help
with that yet right now Google can call
you a cab but can't add things to your
to-do list or set a reminder it's a
qualified assistant but still has some
learning to do overall if you need a
smart home speaker right now I'll access
better but before you sacrifice me at
the altar of Google fanboys I'm not
actually calling Google home that I
really like it if you're invested in
Google at all
it's well worth of purchase and if
you're neutral it might be better than
the echo someday it's just not yet
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
