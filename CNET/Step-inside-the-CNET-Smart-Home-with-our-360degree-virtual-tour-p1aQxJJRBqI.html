look around we're in 360 degrees this is
a 5,800 square foot property in
Louisville Kentucky we're using it as a
living lab to test out today is
connected home tech now if you come on
inside I'll take you on a quick tour of
the place
all right so as you can see the smart
start right here at the front door with
this connected deadbolt I can unlock
that using my phone or I can set it to
lock automatically whenever I leave
we've also smartened up all the lights
in the house the smart switches and
smart bulbs if you look around the
living room here you'll see a bunch of
lamps I can turn them all on at once
just by saying Alexa turn on the living
room just like that the lights come on
that's the Amazon echo smart speaker
behind you controlling things I can talk
to that from across the room and it'll
hear me just fine it's a really
convenient way of controlling your smart
home guys now the kitchen is often the
heart of the home and here in the scene
that Smart Homes kitchen we've seen a
lot of gadgets that are geared towards
connected cooking for instance my scenic
colleague Andrew Gebhardt here is
whipping up a piece of salmon or two
pieces of salmon in a smart frying pan
yep this guy's called the pan
intelligent and it precisely measures
the temperature of the food and walks
you through the cooking process on your
phone which is really handy for me yeah
cuz it's safe to say you're not the
world's greatest chef no I'm not earlier
I actually tried to light this samsung
electric stove so it's safe to say I can
use the help
guide you're not burning this part home
down the centerpiece of our connected
kitchens got to be this samsung family
hub refrigerator though this is a nice
new model with an impressive 21 and a
half inch touchscreen it's basically
like a iPad pro on the front door here
all sorts of useful apps from things
like internet radio and your photos and
your calendars there's also these
cameras on the inside of the door when
you close the door they take a picture
of your food you can access that here on
the door or better yet on your phone to
check if you're out of ingredients
before you buy them at the store
you'll also find smart large appliances
here in the laundry room
this Cabrio washer dryer set from
whirlpool can track your energy usage
notify you on your phone when the load
is done or even sync up with the Nest
Learning Thermostat and speaking of the
Nest Learning Thermostat we've got one
installed here in the master bedroom it
syncs up with that fancy Haiku smart
ceiling fan that's spinning overhead the
two of them work together to cool more
effectively and efficiently it also
syncs up with alexa and right here on
the bedside table
I've got Amazon echo dot this is a
smaller version of that same Amazon echo
smart speaker from down
as just as smart it's not quite as loud
and if I turn it off mute watch the
thermostat and watch what happens when I
say Alexa set the bedroom thermostat to
74 you see the thermostat kicks right up
to 74 very convenient if you're lying in
bed one night and don't want to get up
to turn the heat up smart home tech can
be a good fit for a kid's room like this
one too if you take a look over at that
nest cam on the shelf that's a pretty
handy way to keep an eye on your child
or you could even use this Smart Sleep
Number mattress to keep an eye on their
sleep patterns or whether or not they're
actually in bed when they should be and
if your kid needs access to the lighting
you can set up some smart color-changing
bulbs with a smart switch like this one
and that way night lighting or pink
lighting whatever your kid likes is just
to tap away well that'll do it for our
tour of the CNET smart home you know
when we say this place is a living lab
it's exactly what we mean the smart home
is always evolving and changing there
are new devices and platforms and
configurations of gadgets for us to test
out and review we're working hard to
stay on top of it can give you the lay
of the land in the connected living
space so follow along with us at CENTCOM
slash smart dash home for all the latest
thanks for watching
