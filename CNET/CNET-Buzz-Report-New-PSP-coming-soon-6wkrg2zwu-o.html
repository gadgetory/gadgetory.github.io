buzz report the show about the tech news
that everybody's talking about this week
it's dvds in court and cool phones on
verizon but first it's the gadget of the
week the gadget of the week has us in
rumor land today word is that sony may
unveil a new playstation portable at e3
in june now the PSP is kind of an
underrated little guy in the handheld
gaming department and sony has recently
announced a lot of games for it and
hinted that a lot more are coming soon
so that plus all new hardware and then
new PSP which is rumored to be called
the PSP go could actually provide a
little bit of excitement at e3 am i
right oh yeah that booming laughter you
hear is coming from the Nintendo DSi
don't listen to him arrogant jerk and
now for the news a battle over DVD
backup is playing out in court this week
RealNetworks is squaring off against the
motion picture association of america
over the real DVD copying software
remember that cost thirty dollars lets
you make like to digital backups of your
dvds not even that desirable of course
but the movie industry lost its
ever-loving mind and instantly suit
RealNetworks says it's fair use to make
a digital copy of a DVD just like
ripping a CD the movie industry says
basically hell no they don't want you
backing up your movies because you're a
dirty thief and the first thing you'll
do is put it on the Pirate Bay no don't
try to say you won't they know you now
the case has major ramifications because
if realnetworks wins it could force the
movie industry to open up dvds for
copying and actually it would be a major
victory for the idea that you have the
right to do whatever you want with media
that you buy you know they are used and
I'm just saying real DVD better win
because I need to make a copy of you've
got mail I just cannot have my guests
spotting that DVD in my collection yeah
that needs to be digital also this week
rumors are swirling that the iPhone or
an iPhone like it could be headed to
verizon possibly as early as this summer
it sounds promising and hot on the heels
of those rumors come suggestions that
Microsoft is working on an iphone killer
with verizon some sort of
top secret windows mobile phone
codenamed pink Yeah right pink that's
the kind of badass Microsoft codename
that strikes fear into the hearts of
their enemies everywhere plus reports
suggest that Verizon might be working
with Google to bring an android phone to
its network if anything we can hope that
verizon is finally hearing me now
because I've been telling them for years
that they don't have any cool phones get
on the stick big V and now for a little
fun here at the buzz report and a new
segment celebrities top tech see now
that CBS bought us and everything we
occasionally get opportunities we didn't
have before like the chance to hobnob
with celebrities or at least to ask them
confusing questions about gadgets this
time we hit up the cast of CSI Miami I'm
not a techie get all I have an iphone
does that count for anything I checked
it's honestly my computer is so sad
because I got the computer and I
literally only like look at Perez Hilton
and check my email so I don't know not
very big hey I thought I was gonna like
throw it away when it said the memory
disk full and someone just like having
ago they just bring it a computer store
and then they put more memory in it
congratulations you have found the last
person on earth without email it's me
and perhaps a toddler or maybe one of
the octo mom's children that's it just
just us I believe that someday all of us
and every major company a show like CSI
Miami and network will all have a
content delivery network and it will all
be through subscribership it will all be
essentially a part of the phone company
and it's going to take on a really
interesting world you know it's pretty
cool
matrix I'm sure it was that you can put
these little chips and you know how to
do things you know like speak a language
or play an instrument or something like
that I would have a robot that would
just be like carry me around like master
blaster in the Mad Max movies and I
would sit on his back and he would shoot
lasers at people we're in the process at
lexicon were in the process of
developing that gadget and I I can't
give you the name of it because it's a
name that I think people are going to
know about but it's it's a piece of
technology that you carry with you that
plugs you into the internet and travels
with you and really simplifies what
you're interested in I have a record
player I mean that would be my
technology I can't live without I spin
vinyl well my phone I choose to never
leave home without without my iphone
pretty much there is a product that is
about to come on to the market called I
televised and I televised is a software
application how do I know this a
software application that you download
on your desktop and it can deliver you
content to your smartphone in high
definition um David I televises not a
gadget although say what you will about
the guy at least he's on message and
that's the buzz report for this week
everyone I'm Mollywood and thank you for
watching
