to look at your iMac I'm Dan Ackerman
and this is Apple's 21.5 inch iMac with
a 4k Retina display that's the most
obvious change to this year's the 21
inch iMac the physical design is
actually stay the same for the last
couple years
still very slim here on the side kind of
bows out gently in the back all the
components obviously behind the screen
but this is not exactly the same 4k is
let's say your 4k TV
that's a consumer version and it's
usually 38 40 pixels wide this is true
4k 4096 pixels wide more of a
professional format also telling us that
this is a system designed to appeal to
photo and film professionals it supports
a wider p3 color gamut as opposed to
regular RGB what that basically means is
there's a wider range of reds and greens
that the screen can display a blues are
actually already fairly maxed out a lot
of consumer equipment just is not going
to show you that you'll never really
notice unless you're very into very
high-end photography and professional
photo equipment or you're shooting you
know 4k video or super high-end fill one
of the coolest other upgrades to the
system is the new set of accessories you
can get with it by default it comes with
the keyboard and the mouse you can also
sub in the new trackpad although that
now cost extra used to be able to swap
them in for the same amount although
it's certainly much nicer you can see
why it would cost a little bit more
first up is a magic keyboard all the
accessories no longer use disposable
batteries are rechargeable you just plug
in a lightning cable and that recharge
of them and pairs them so you can see
there's no more kind of bulbous battery
compartment anymore key faces are a
little bit bigger although the actual
footprint of the keyboard is smaller the
mouse looks and feels pretty much
exactly the same there's some new rubber
runners on the bottom again rechargeable
and the big star here I think is the
Magic Trackpad 2 you can see it's much
much bigger than the original version
also no batteries so you lose that
cylindrical battery compartment
recharges via lightning and it adds
force touch which means you can click
and then click again even though you're
not actually clicking as a form of
haptic feedback just like forced touch
on the MacBook the MacBook Pro and even
the
iPhone and the Apple watch if you want
to give your current iMac a kind of
facelift without getting the new one you
can actually buy all these separately
and just add them to your current system
speaking of being current this guy moves
up one step in processes used to have
Intel's fourth generation quite serious
process is perfectly fine it's moving up
to the fifth generation however we're
already up to the sixth generation now
you can find those in the 27-inch
versions the 21 inch versions are still
a generation behind if you've got an
iMac from the last couple years it's
still fine you really don't have a
compelling reason to upgrade if you're
working with a lot of 4k video or super
high res photography and you're looking
for a great baseline system that's not
going to cost a fortune you can get the
4k screen starting at $14.99 I'm Dan
Ackerman and that is Apple's new 4k 21.5
inch iMac</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
