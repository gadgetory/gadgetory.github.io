appliances and this is the two hundred
and $99 instant pot smart that is a
pressure cooker rice cooker slow cooker
saute simmer basically everything that
you could ever want to do in your
kitchen all in one handy device this
thing also has bluetooth smarts and a
related app so you can check on the
status of your food or even start a
cooking cycle from the comfort of your
own couch here's the rundown I love this
thing it's expensive but it makes
excellent excellent food and it can do
so many different things I made pot
roast pulled pork yogurt creme brulee
rice quinoa so so many different things
and everything turned out as expected or
better
we haven't reviewed a lot of products
that compare directly to this but right
chris is testing something called the
time machine right now that is a rice
cooker it's not a smart rice cooker but
it can do a lot of the same things that
this one can - the smarts and the
pressure cooking function so if you're
looking for just a simple rice and grain
cooker I think the $70 time machine is a
smart choice but if you want something
that can replace a lot of devices in
your kitchen this is a really really
good product the one hang-up I have is
the price but you can find it for 250
bucks on amazon which is a pretty
significant price reduction so all in
all i think this is a really excellent
product if you live in a small apartment
with a small kitchen and you need to
optimize your space it is a really
really solid product that will make all
of your meals incredibly well thanks for
watching this review of the instant pod
smart i'm megan Willerton christina de
plan
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
