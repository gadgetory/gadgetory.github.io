checking out the LG volt on boost mobile
at $99 it's a pretty cheap way to get 4G
LTE connectivity without signing up for
a contract but you get what you pay for
and it's not very impressive the LG volt
is a 4.7 inch display but it also has a
960 x 540 pixel resolution that means
you want to be watching HD videos on
this thing the screen is otherwise fine
though off-axis viewing angles aren't
especially wide but colors look clear
and consistent even as I'm shipping the
phone around the 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
processor isn't going to win any awards
but it's right in line with the price
your run into trouble with more hard
winters of games but I've been
revisiting grand theft auto 3 and it
works fairly well here casual games work
fine too this is a boost mobile phone
which means you're going to have to wait
through a lot of pre-installed apps you
can get rid of most of them though
there's only eight gigs of storage but
pry up the back of the case and you'll
find the microSD card slot there's also
the removable battery we're still
running our battery tests but the Volt
has thus far made a fairly good showing
so that's the LG fault sure it isn't
especially impressive but you're getting
LTE connectivity and you don't have to
sign up for a contract all for just nine
to nine dollars it's a pretty good deal
you're going to want to head to seen it
to read my full review and see how it
stacks up to the rest of the budget
smartphones out there I'm Nate Ralph
