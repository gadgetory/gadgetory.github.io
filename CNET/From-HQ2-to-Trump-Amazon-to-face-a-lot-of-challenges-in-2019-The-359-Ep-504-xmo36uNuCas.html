I'm Joni Saltzman 2019 is shaping up to
be a challenging one for Amazon with
critics seemingly coming out of the
woodwork in New York City against its HQ
to project their Plus the company faces
potential troubles from President Trump
and its controversial facial recognition
software so Joan what I wanted to ask
you about this is do you think that
Amazon's really strong reputation with
this customers will continue to help
insulating it from some of these issues
I mean consumers have sort of bifurcated
their understanding of Amazon like I
feel like even like you know we were
chatting before this I'm a New Yorker
year jersey the reason is that some
people are annoyed with the HQ decision
to move here but even though I am one of
the people that's kind of annoyed by it
I still use Amazon constantly right so
as like a consume as a service I think
that people will continue to judge
Amazon as a service different than
Amazon as a company yeah I totally agree
I was at a council hearing the rain for
like three hours yesterday we're a bunch
of council members were beating up
Amazon about the HQ to process how they
were being cut out of it and that this
is going to be a state process they
didn't like the fact that Amazon was
going to get three billion dollars in
incentives for building one of the
council members I thought really
crystallized a lot of what we're talking
about really well and he specifically
said we we love you and we hate you and
it wasn't or or whatever it was like we
kind of feel the same two things about
Amazon at the exact same time so I was
kind of in the story that I wrote today
though I was kind of curious to see
people really like a lot of Google
services people use a lot of Google
services people really like Facebook -
there there's a reason why it's the
biggest social media company out there
so I was curious to see if with all this
tech backlash that was going on directed
of both of those companies whether
Amazon would start to face some of those
similar issues there there are like
a lot of those issues that have been
simmering with the company but at the
same time I really don't think that
they've been hit the same way as
Facebook and Google I don't know if you
agree with that yeah but I think that's
because most of the tech backlash we're
talking about it's mostly been centered
on Facebook really like its Facebook has
been the locus of all that animosity and
I think Google and YouTube are pulled
into that vortex because they have
services that are very similar like they
have raised user generated social based
things where are this abuse it's all
kind of is able to it's like a little
crackling fire it's all able to fuel
each other
Amazon isn't really operating in those
spaces and so it's been insulated in a
way yes but totally agree I think that
that doesn't mean that it the next tech
backlash of 2019 might be like right in
the sweet spot for Amazon yeah yeah yeah
and it might be related to facial
recognition software or might be related
to President Trump bringing up more
issues about postal service stuff I mean
there's a lot of areas there either way
next up Amazon is building its own HQ to
project in Austin Texas the company
today unveiled plans for a 1 billion
dollar campus that doesn't really sound
like that much for Apple frankly hey Ben
yeah I usually don't interrupt the
podcast like this but you said Amazon's
building in Texas oh my god I'm so sorry
I mean they're 2a companies but let's
start that segment over shall we
okay it would only be appropriate that
we screw up the last episode my mistake
I've been talking so much about Amazon
lately but thank you very much it's a
very it was a fair Freudian slip and it
did come back and say Apple later right
the opening line next Apple is building
its own HQ to project in Austin Texas
the company today unveiled plans for a 1
billion dollar campus there along with
new offices in Seattle San Diego Culver
City California as well as expanding
operations in Pittsburgh New York and
Boulder Colorado so my question for you
is should we go work for Amazon or Apple
oh my gosh come on why would we do that
but yeah I mean it's even though it's
fun to kind of compare it to an HQ idea
but it's really not I mean this is a
kind of different expansion of their
workforce then the whole like dog and
pony show around HQ - in addition to
this you know it's a lot the number of
people that they're gonna be bringing
jobs are gonna be bringing to Austin is
a lot smaller than either of them it's
thousands but you're right it's it's not
nearly as big as the two projects
they're sprinkling it around different
other places that touch on initiatives
that Apple is increasing so related to
that do you think Apple is likely to
face like similar criticism as Amazon
with HQ - no no I know and it's partly
because of everything that you said that
they're treating it completely
differently either way if you want to
read more about these stories
check them out on SEANET I'm Ben Fox
Ruben to any salesman thanks for
listening yeah no problem
like I said I hate to interrupt the
actual podcast but I had to say
something cuz I know that you you knew
what you meant but you slipped
yes yes anyways you're the wind beneath
my wings it's time as always to send in
questions and comments these these fine
folk ie are gonna try to floor them for
you right out the gate let's take one
from Timothy do is he's asking what
exactly is amazon's endgame one-stop
shopping one store to rule them all when
do monopoly issues come up into this
conversation yeah that's a that's a
great question monopoly issues of
something that's been raised a lot about
Amazon lately the important stats to
really pay attention to here are that
Amazon in the United States controls
about 50% of online shopping but it's
still a small player overall in retail
so in the world or in the in the world
online retail in the u.s. is only about
10% which makes a lot more sense when
you consider how much people you know
get gas and go to restaurants and they
still do shop
a lot at malls and local stores so 50%
is still a lot smaller than if you
looked at Google search dominance or
perhaps like Facebook's like ability to
really control a lot of social but I
think a lot of people are really
concerned about the fact that Amazon not
only has a really strong position in an
online retail but it's growing a lot
faster than a lot of its competitors
plus it's the biggest player in cloud
computing plus it's trying to grow in
healthcare robotics so I think a lot of
media so I think a lot of people are
really trying to like get a hold on ok
where is this company going and if we
don't slow down its process could it
become a monopoly I would argue that no
it's not a monopoly right now if you
look at the Hard figures but Timothy
definitely a really good question and
something that I think a lot more people
are raising these days about Amazon yeah
all right next questions coming in from
- actually is not a question that I
couldn't help myself with this one he's
kind of a comparing Amazon to Oprah
saying you get at HQ - you get an HQ - I
would like to see that introducing
headquarters in Austin Austin's the one
that gets the headline but there's like
six I was a little surprised too about
Austin but apparently Apple already has
6,000 employees in Austin and it's going
to be doubling that size so I remember
we wrote a story years ago together
about all the like Silicon Valley
wannabes yeah so in Austin was one of
the places that we highlighted along
with I think the Research Triangle
Denver Colorado is another one of these
so yeah Austin can definitely you know
kind of point to this and say like yeah
we are we are a tech player and this is
a big deal for them obviously yeah sure
so yeah yeah so Apple I beg to differ
Apple more Oprah less Amazon Oprah okay
also Oprah is making a show for Apple so
there you go
really Porsches huh interesting so enjoy
points out hey burger Larry you spent so
much effort coming up with your Apple
ihq to tweet that you ran out of steam
and that's why you screwed up your end
thank you very much for noticing that
tweet I was so proud of it and clearly
paid attention except for you sir enjoy
thank you sir enjoy tim's askin what's
the tax break between NYC and austin
which one actually gives more incentives
good question i don't know what the
austin tax break is big surprise the tax
break i can tell you for hq2 between New
York City and Virginia which is where
the other HQ project is going those are
significantly different so New York
State and New York City overall are
giving around three billion dollars
whereas in Virginia it's slightly it's
under a billion dollars it's about 750
million roughly so and I don't know why
that breakdown ended up happening or
whether Amazon wanted to go to Virginia
more than I wanted to come to New York
I'm not really sure there are a lot of
backroom conversations that happen there
resulted in kind of those differences
yeah we got a little bit of savagery
coming from the chat from our old friend
life improvements is working in Amazon
starting to get close to working at
Foxconn is Amazon gonna have to start
inserting suicide Nets yikes
oh yeah that's rough it's nowhere near
that it's nowhere near that bad it can't
be I mean it's bad right I mean there
there are a lot of well documented
stories about Amazon's treatment if it's
workhorse workforce Patang particularly
in the warehouses I've been to a lot of
those warehouses and I can tell you that
it's not something that I've seen
personally but then again you know I'm
there with PR they know that I'm coming
but all those warehouses are sparkling
clean a lot of them have been built only
in recent years but that doesn't change
the fact that I'm sure there are a lot
of people that work there that find some
of some of the treatment rather grueling
because it's a very fast-growing company
and especially during the holidays yeah
they expect people to move a lot of
packages so I can understand people's
concerns related to that totally not
trying to insinuate anything and we
all know what it can be like when the
workload gets too heavy and you can
never really project yourself in anyone
elses shoes on that one but that's just
the word that's kind of going around on
the streets these days so you got to
acknowledge it oh yeah
yes fully aware Matthew dad sure is
asking has President Trump said anything
about HQ - I don't know I haven't seen
any comments well he specifies how
considering that this is kind of in DC's
backyard and considering he's had more
than a few
complet let's call them conflicts with
Amazon in the past yeah they've mostly
been centered around the postal service
stuff Bezos is separate from Amazon
bezos's ownership of Washington The
Washington Post which is obviously a
newspaper that gets under Trump's skin
on more than one occasion but never I
don't think that he's really commented
on the hq2 elements of Amazon yeah it
might go to Trump's golden rule that if
you can't say something mean don't say
anything at all because
hq2 frankly fits very much in Trump's
sweet spot of America first and jobs
jobs jobs yeah this is a lot of jobs in
DC and also in New York you would expect
him to say something about this he's
certainly very much like pushed and been
a booster for a lot of other big
projects maybe the silence on it is kind
of telling in and of itself I would I
would totally agree with that so and
it's possible that he speaks up about it
at some point because it is a huge jobs
thing like this is 50,000 jobs a lot so
I didn't realize this until this morning
50,000 jobs between the two HQ
headquarters from Amazon 50,000 new jobs
Apple's entire US workforce is 90,000 so
like that's more than half of Apple's
entire US workforce is going to be added
by Amazon yes yes these numbers are
really really big there was really
nothing to sneeze at yeah and the Austin
like that billion-dollar campus in
Austin where Apple is going to be
growing by double that's 6,000 more jobs
in Austin like when you're talking about
to 25,000
employee locations this is these are
really really big projects and granted
they're both gonna develop over a decade
it's not like they're gonna hire
everybody starting next year so this is
something that's gonna go on for a long
time and that also relates to the fact
that as you know as I was at that
council meeting people were so annoyed
and mad about what was going on if
Amazon really does have plans to
continue moving forward with this
project in New York it's got to figure
out a way to create more buy-in in the
community good well yeah so devil's
advocate here is there any way for New
York to actually still back out of the
HQ to deal if that became a
consideration it's not for the record
but good day I believe so I spent a lot
of time reading the Memorandum of
Understanding like a week or two ago and
I remember that there is a like a 60-day
window I'm not 100% sure if that's a
60-day window specifically for both
parties or just one but in all
consideration yes there there there is
an opportunity to walk away from the
table at the moment they're still
hammering out specific legal paperwork
the Memorandum of Understanding is just
like a first step for that but Amazon
spent a whole year planning ahead for
this so I think they're they're pretty
much ended I think they spent most of
the year just like procrastinating and
then at the last minute they're like it
was like I have houses here let's make
it there that's that's actually that
sounds like that makes me like Amazon
executives a lot more than maybe I would
have because that sounds like something
that I did back in high school I got to
decide really really quickly but but
yeah my impression is is that they're
not gonna make a quick like radical
change at this point despite the fact
that they're facing a lot of negativity
in the New York market yeah so now's a
good time I think is any to go ahead and
call out what does everybody else think
about these these developments now we've
kind of touched on it jobs are good
there's no denying that could they have
been laid out better I think I see now
that Timothy is pointed out like what if
they put it somewhere like Albuquerque
somewhere else in maybe middle America
do you think that they could have
planted these into places that weren't
already so oversaturated perhaps is the
right word maybe it's not the right word
I mean let's start with you guys I mean
I know we've seen that there's already
protests cropping up in New York that
this could have been handled better the
incentives could have been handled
better well go ahead and feel free to
speculate I know you're gonna stay as
editorial as possible because as
unbiased as possible because that's your
job as news people but you know this
this is a weird situation because
there's there's such such great highs
and lows to both sides of these things
yeah what do you think it's for sure I
mean just considering New York versus
Virginia that kind of impact would be
much bigger in a place like Albuquerque
like adding its 2,500 to 25,000 25,000
employee headquarters in a place that's
not the biggest city in America it's
gonna make a bigger difference to every
other city in America no matter which
one you chose so maybe that's also a
reason why there's a more backlash
there's backlash in New York and there's
not really backlash to speak of in
Virginia's because it has more of an
outsized impact in a place like Virginia
than it does here I strongly agree with
you Joan yes yeah that's yeah for my
personal opinion I was hoping Newark
would get a shot at this but it's true
yes it would have an outsized impact in
Newark Newark in New York is basically
like Newark could really use yes as an
economic impact and the tech community
would still you know take New Jersey
Transit and like wouldn't be that far
away yeah so I think there was a lost
opportunity here and again this is this
is more my opinion but there was a lost
opportunity to create a lot of economic
development in a city that really could
use it Newark is a great example of that
but there are other cities that were
included in that top 20 that could have
been completely changed they could have
had a completely new trajectory due to
this massive project New York
their economic development team
obviously argues that New York
absolutely needs a project like this to
diversify their economy to ensure that
they're protected against a future
recession we need those jobs that's
everything that they said yesterday
however the this this could have had a
very different impact for another
community and I think that's what a lot
of people were hoping when they heard
about hq2
and that's why people were so deflated
when DC and New York City ended up
getting it because these were already
big top-tier winner cities to begin with
that's why everybody thought it was kind
of like a sham like okay you you strung
this along for a whole year and you just
pick two cities that were already like
it was a sham to begin with like that
was the other duckin sham but yeah if I
could if I could at least you know like
kind of like do my little swan song for
for newark here that was that that's at
least you know me me stating more of my
opinion about that but i think there's a
bit a bit unfortunate that amazon didn't
go in that direction however I do know
that from what Amazon said they were
very much looking for tech talent and no
matter what anybody has I think it
really just comes down to the basis and
where he wants to be like I think that
he's the one that gets to decide and
every CEO decides where they want to
live and DC was the obvious path for
that reason New York was a bit more of a
surprise yeah been that in that extent
everybody knew that DC was the
front-runner from the get-go it was
really quite enough yeah which of the
three DC beds were going to end up
getting it yeah I mean yeah I I think if
Amazon can do a better job of explaining
why they're taking the money and really
push the fact that these jobs are going
to help everybody in New York City as
opposed to just 1% yeah and maybe give
up on the helipad unless they really
there's no question they were trying to
justify the helipad at the at the
meeting yesterday and it's one of the
one of the council members were like do
you realize how tone-deaf that's yes
trained that like is the train that
people would take to get there like
literally shut down with no warning like
earlier this week like there are
hundreds of people packed you don't say
the station they're just like sorry it
doesn't work right now and there's no
what like for people mostly you guys I'm
sure don't live in New York there's no
other way to get around up there except
for that one train unless you take a bus
you don't say so so the idea of having a
helipad so like the helipad but then
also have a public helipad the nr train
people deserve to have like another
helipad next to that helipad there have
to work if you want to keep your ATLA
bad but anyway I'm so myself
so editorializing so not looking forward
to having this in my backyard like I
think it's that kind of yeah that's sort
of like 1% ish element of it is wide
general New York population is against
it the it's like the optics of one of
the most lucrative companies or not
lucrative sorry but one of the highest
value what our highest value companies
on the planet getting billions and
dollars in like breaks and tax breaks in
order to like pump in a bunch of other
well-paid employees which is great
because some of those well paid
employees would be people from the city
but a lot won't be you know what I mean
like I don't know this is and then like
building a hell of it it just seems like
such like profligate ostentatious
showing off of their wealth and
privilege I think that's what really
rubs people the wrong way
mm-hmm imagine if we could have seen the
impact on areas like Baltimore Detroit
Atlanta Salt Lake shouting out a few
these will bring like that it'll bring
like lots of great jobs but also there's
you have to consider there is the
possibility like Seattle isn't really
like super gung ho for Amazon given how
much Amazon has changed the City of
Seattle being such a powerful employer
there being such a powerful company
they're the biggest they're the biggest
employer in Seattle which is that's one
of the benefits for New York is is that
Amazon is going to be a major player in
New York but for a city this size Amazon
is not going to have nearly as much
influence as it does in
Seattle and that has been kind of like
the the blessing and the curse for
Seattle in that the city has benefited
enormously from Amazon and Amazon also
exerts a lot of control in the city
there's no there's no doubt that that's
happening because they they are the
biggest employer there they brought a
lot of other tech industry to the city
they've they've really revitalized the
city but there's a lot of difficulty
that's come with it that's why it's
called the prosperity bomb in Seattle is
that it comes with it you know
difficulty on the infrastructure or the
schools the roads higher rents
homelessness has been a problem in
Seattle so these are all issues that are
going to have to be addressed in New
York that granted already a lot of them
exist here and maybe you know
considerably worsened as this project
goes on so yeah it'll be something that
I'm sure we're gonna talk about on the
podcast for quite a while alright we're
almost running out of time here let's
take a couple more here's a really great
one from will wouldn't have caused some
gentrification if had been put into
underdeveloped areas that's something I
have not personally thought about myself
well that's exactly what's happening in
Queens like I mean not what is happening
but it is in they are at Long instead of
the area in Queens where HQ is going to
be isn't it's like you know it has a
housing project right next to it so it's
not the there's the idea of
gentrification notifications happening
all over New York without Amazon company
very Tring into coming into the city but
Long Island City I think is one of the
areas where all the places all the like
luxury condos that they open it's the
one place where people haven't been like
flocking to those luxury condos yes but
that's gonna be changing now what
there's gonna be highly paid workers
right congregated there yeah there's
there's an argument against
gentrification related to every single
one of the top 20 cities that were being
considered some more than others
obviously by there's there's a reason
why city leaders all were really
fighting for this project because they
saw the opportunity for increased tax
rolls for more jobs for more development
for their cities to become you know
major tech hubs
similar to Seattle or Silicon Valley so
you do have to balance in way some of
those issues against each other and
that's why when Amazon went and said it
was gonna go and develop HQ to the folks
were falling all over themselves the
city leaders at least were falling all
over themselves in hopes of getting that
project because they knew that it could
be a boon for their communities an
important thing that we do here is to
really talk about the balance of okay
those are the benefits and here are the
potential negatives as well and you know
that's why it was a good question anyway
to talk about some of that Tim's asking
when one town is dependent on one
company say ge in Detroit when that
company leaves the city it kind of turns
to a disaster so when Amazon hq2 leaves
will that have the same impact I don't
know if that's necessarily the case in
these circumstances because New York by
no me needs HQ to DC doesn't fully need
HQ to Seattle didn't need HQ one they
have other industries there that they do
rely on as well I think Seattle would be
very negatively impacted if Amazon were
to leave I don't think that's gonna
happen anytime soon so this is more of a
that's that's a pretty far-reaching
hypothetical in that hq2 they haven't
even laid down the first brick so it'll
it'll be a long time if hq2 gets built
filled out the city's end up starting to
really depend on them and then amazon
starts moving away to I don't know some
crazy hq3 project so um but yeah like I
I think the primary concern could be for
Seattle in that if Amazon decides to
start building a lot more in those two
other locations what does that mean for
Seattle and the hopes of development
there Sean's asking is Amazon getting
double the perks while shorting both
cities on taxes that is one potential
theory on that I mean they are getting a
lot of perks but the argument from
Amazon and city developers are that
they're they're gonna get a lot back in
tax rolls and investment from Amazon and
lastly before we wrap up the
verse Asian what is the timeline on this
again
it'll be about a decade for the total
development to come through for both
projects so Amazon is going to start
hiring in both locations starting next
year but it'll be a slow process and and
yeah it'll be it'll be about a full 10
years of me writing about this before
they get fully built out I feel like
Roger will conclude like droning on
about 5g before you stop stop stop
droning on about HQ - yeah it's possible
I think there's more longevity and in
that conversation I'd like to trade for
5g can I do that at this point from this
camera angle you can actually see a
little bit of Ben's soul leaving in his
solos intact
intact but like his social like metrics
maybe his like the the whatever metric
it is that this is a person you want to
talk to at a party that ranking guys
talk to me talk to burger Larry at a
party okay
all right we're out of time guys it's
been such a fun year we have done so
much we've moved the set we have ramped
up our output we've expanded the
audience you guys are amazing before we
call it a year do we have any closing
thoughts and what are you guys up to
over the holidays until we come back oh
my god I'm not going to my in-laws I'm
so excited about the show to drop that a
bomb I don't know I'm getting an air B&amp;amp;B
we're like they're gonna be 14 kids
there so that's gonna be super fun yeah
but I'm gonna be on vacation pretty soon
so that'll be nice well design yeah it's
been fun because you won't be able to
take another one for the next ten years
no no thanks everybody for all like the
great questions and comments really
appreciate it throughout the year all
the supportive and encouraging words and
the tweets and yeah yes absolutely and
we look forward to doing that a lot more
next year and we'll be coming back on
the CES stage starting next year which
will be a lot of fun and
January third fourth fifth I think I
don't know yeah but we're gonna be on
hiatus through the end of the year so
this is the last one for 2018 but thanks
for carrying us through episode 502
onward and upward to the next milestone
should I do the thing do the thing I'll
do the thing
alright the 359 is available on iTunes
tune in Feedburner Google Play is a
Google podcast the Amazon echo and of
course cnn.com thanks everybody for a
great year happy new years yeah and I
