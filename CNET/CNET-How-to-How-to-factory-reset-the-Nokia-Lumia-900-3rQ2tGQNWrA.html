how to a contributor and today we're
going to take a look at how to do a
factory reset on the lumia 900 now a
factory reset comes in handy when you're
selling the device on eBay or Craigslist
or perhaps yours
passing it down to a friend or a family
member and you want to make sure all of
your personal information is off the
device now that's important to know
doing a factory reset will erase all of
your information make sure you have the
device backed up or at least your
information backed up before you do this
alright so we're gonna go ahead and go
and view all the apps and we're going to
scroll down to settings now it's not
completely obvious where this is where
the factory reset button is hidden so
we're gonna find it in about and then if
you scroll all the way to the bottom
you'll see you reset your phone they'll
give you a warning asking you if you're
sure you want to reset it it'll ask you
one more time it's a serious warning do
you want to reset your phone all you do
is tap on yes all right so our device
has gone ahead and restarted all the
information has been wiped off of it
it's now at 100% factory settings just
like you received it from AT&amp;amp;T or Nokia
