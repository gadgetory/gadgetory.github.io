d7000 which I still think is one of the
best design nikon dslrs it should be
unsurprising that I really like this
models design in operation I enjoy
shooting with it it's a little bit
lighter than other full-frame bodies but
not a lot and it's constructed from a
magnesium alloy chassis covered in poly
carbonate it's got moderate Dustin
weather sealing the camera's exposure
and release mode dials both have locks
one in the center and one adjacent as
with canons design I don't really like
the lock button in the center as I find
it a little awkward to operate
single-handedly there are two user
setting slots on the mode dial that's
one way in which the d600 differs from
pro bodies which have a much more
sophisticated and complex set of custom
settings options I happen to like them
better on the mode dial but I also find
that three slots is my optimal number
also I'm not a big fan of the tiny top
record buttons that seem to be becoming
vogue and I'm a little disappointed that
you can't program one of the back
buttons for this function as with other
modern Nikon models there are two
programmable buttons on the right side
of the lens that I've become addicted to
the viewfinder is also really nice big
and bright with the useful overlay grid
that's in many of nikon's DSLRs although
it's missing desirable features like
built in Wi-Fi and GPS the d600 does
have a full complement of shooting
options unlike the 60 for instance it
has built-in flash and while I don't
recommend using on-camera flash it's
useful in a pinch and it enables in
camera wireless flash operation the
camera also gets props for dual SD card
slots in a headphone jack other features
that the 60 disappointingly lacks for
some people though the biggest advantage
that the d600 immediately offers over
the 60 is the ability to use all
variations of both DX as well as FX
lenses with the appropriate cropping
with one exception the d600 delivers
terrific photo quality it produces
relatively clean image data at low and
mid-range ISO sensitivities and it's got
smart jpg and noise reduction algorithm
I found the camera fast enough to handle
anything I through it it one minor
exception is the processing of raw plus
jpg shots which occasionally held me up
on reviewing images right after shooting
relatively inexpensive smartly designed
fast and with generally excellent photo
quality the nikon d600 makes a
compelling case for upgrading to a
full-frame camera I'm Laurie grinning
and this is the nikon d60</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
