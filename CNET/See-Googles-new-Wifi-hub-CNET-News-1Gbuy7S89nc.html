Wi-Fi designed to support the new ways
we use Wi-Fi first it's an expandable
system to give you much better coverage
unlike a single central router Google
one of multiple Google Wi-Fi points work
together to do a much better job of
delivering fast throughput to every
corner of the home it's modular so you
can get the right fit for your home's
shape and size simply add Wi-Fi points
to expand coverage we've also designed
the hardware to be visually subtle and
fit in anywhere in the home without
compromising aesthetics on top of great
coverage we've built a feature set
called Network Assist that will that's
it that will actively manage and
optimize your network behind the scenes
so you don't have to figure out how to
adjust your router network assist keeps
your signal strong even as you roam
throughout the house by intelligently
transitioning you to the best Wi-Fi
point and placing you on the right Wi-Fi
channel to avoid congestion for those
times when you do want control of your
Wi-Fi network we make it easy through a
companion app so at my house for example
it's sometimes difficult to get my
teenage daughters to pause YouTube or
Netflix on their computers and come to
the dinner table
well Google Wi-Fi lets you manage the
Wi-Fi access of your kids you know if
dinner's on the table you don't have to
shut down the router just go to the app
and simply press pause on their devices
for some quality family time Google
Wi-Fi is going to be available in it for
pre-orders in November and it's going to
ship in early December Google Wi-Fi is
going to retail for a hundred and twenty
nine dollars for single pack and for
larger homes we're offering a three pack
for $299 we believe that Google Wi-Fi is
going to make a big and immediate
improvement in Internet connectivity in
your home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
