have another soul state drive to show
you this is the sandisk extreme now
that's not much extra about this solar
state drive except it's made of aluminum
casing is fresh study and Karen eyes now
this dry support SATA 3 so over here you
can see it has a standard SATA port it
also work with SATA 2 and SATA basically
any si2 application that normal hard
drive are used with now the big
difference between solid state drive
including this one with hard drives the
fact that it will help improve the
performance of computer a great deal
especially butum and Wickham alright
alright that's good question Kelly
normally people take my word for it but
you know what I'll show you I happen to
have a laptop here and it's not a slow
laptop right on a regular hard drive and
it's it is in the sleep mode so let's
see how fast it works up there you go
not too bad but it's not too fast either
so if you log in you can see that right
now the windows experience index is
showing that the primary hard disk it's
reading is at 5.9 and now let's see how
it changed this changed when I replace
the hard drive way with the sandisk and
by the way before this I has only make a
mirror image of this hard drive on this
sandy so the sand is exactly the same
data as the hard drive and now let's see
how fat it wakes up there you go so now
you can see that the primary hard disk
subscore is 7.7 which is very high for
asteroid drive now this dry come in
three capacity 120 gig to 40 gig and for
80 gigs that cause one eighty dollars
318 dollars
and seven ninety-nine dollars
respectively now that translate to about
1.3 one prank dollar per gig very good
price compared to other SSD once again
my name is domo and this has been the
first look at the sandisk extreme
solid-state drive and by the way let me
know through my twitter or facebook if
you want me to do a movie to SSD how to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
