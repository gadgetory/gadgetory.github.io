Joanie Schlossman
5g is right around the corner the
Qualcomm may give us the first look at
what will really be like the company is
holding its Snapdragon tech summit in
Maui of all places tomorrow and we're
expecting to see live 5g network
demonstrations and devices that will
actually be capable of running on them
ahead of that Verizon Samsung announced
today they are they're planning to
launch a 5g smartphone in the first half
of next year so what do we actually know
almost nothing has become a common thing
with these five g device announcements
they basically say we're gonna have a 5g
thing we can't tell you what it's called
how much it cost specs are but it'll be
it'll will be available in the first
half of next year so the kind of
interesting thing about it is that no
really no really 5g is coming yes
exactly the fact that like we've been
talking about this as a thing that might
be happening for Tod three three years
four years at this point that it's
actually gonna happen in the next few
months is is I guess exciting enough
exciting for people like Roger it's
extremely exciting for people like Roger
because I've been writing about this for
a long time and I'm really eager to see
this in the field
it'll be just saying our own shower tip
can and Jessica's ol core will be out at
the Snapdragon text summit
they'll be they'll be checking out this
stuff so we'll get first impressions
from them this week all right so let's
talk about VR Joan you went to Los
Angeles to check out this crazy
experience based on a Charles Dickens
Christmas carol right what what was that
like it was really cool so it's a new
wave in virtual reality trying to get
people to make virtual reality that
people actually want to go see where you
combine a headset with a site-specific
performance that includes a live actor
that moves around you and motion capture
suit so you don't see the live actor you
see them in the headset as an avatar as
different characters but they can talk
to you with their own voice they can
touch you you can touch them you
actually interact with a real human
and so yeah this one was based on a
Christmas carol is definitely a lot
scarier than Mickey Christmas Carol
BBG and i were talking about earlier it
takes in a very like true to the dickens
creepy fashion and i got to go behind
the scenes and check out the motion
capture technology which was fun when
watching this video it's basically it's
a one-on-one experience right to you and
an actor and that's it right yeah it's
about 20 minutes there's an actor that
you see that's in Victorian costume as
you kind of like put on the she's the
one that helps you put on the headset in
a way that gets you sort of like in the
mindset of while you're gonna be going
yeah yeah and they do a lot of really
like the technology is really cool but
they also do a lot of simple things like
they have they have walls that disappear
so where you there was a wall before in
your headset there it can disappear um
physically - in addition to being in
your headset and this is definitely sort
of a next level or step-up from those
basic VR experiences we've we've all
tried and this is compared to what's
come before it's still it like that
they're hacking it together stage the
technologies combining all these
different elements the technology still
is at a point where there's a lot
farther it can go as a technology gets
better and what was it like wearing
those motion capture suits it was fun
it's really comfortable it's like really
a bodysuit so it's like a you know it's
like doesn't cramp or anything like that
but it's it's you look funny like you
have like little balls and it's just
really it makes they say every time so
if it's on a motion capture suit the
first thing they do is wave yeah wave
and I did cartwheels because I can
actually still do a cartwheel I was like
do you not like plugged in or tied into
no it's also that the room is surrounded
by cameras okay they the mark the balls
are the little markers and you pick up
the markers visually oh nice so did you
like to see yourself in VR afterwards
yeah well they didn't have a chance to
do a full there are two elements of the
motion capture there's the body motion
capture and then the facial stuff just
takes a long time yeah yeah old a
profile for yourself so I just did the
body stuff so I got to see a little
avatar myself that looks like a little
like doll like a little nice alright for
a full-coverage chickens on CNN I'm
Roger Jane I'm Joanie Sasa thanks for
listening
and thanks for joining us for the
recording of the audio podcast you can
subscribe using the links below in the
description and right now go ahead and
start sending in questions and comments
I know a lot of people are curious about
this VR theater which actually seems
like a decent use of VR finally
something that's enhanced something that
is unique and different and powerful
more than just like Oh or this time
we're gonna play doom but it's in your
face or whatever and I mean a lot of
cool yeah a lot of what I've seen has
been like you know here's what it's like
to be at the Olympic Village right you
saw I look around and then that's it and
after you know two minutes of the all
right let's what's next so you know fact
that there's an interactive level to it
that it's it's one on one it's a little
intimate that's yeah there's a live
person who is adjusting the performance
on the fly that's yeah that's nice yeah
it's also like what you know the fact
that like you're saying like the only
you know VR stuff that I've seen is sort
of thing like most of the really cool VR
things that I've seen I'm lucky because
I go to film festival right you get to
see the best VR that's out there and so
when people are like VR s lame it's over
it's done the hype and I'm like well you
haven't had a chance to see the coolest
iterations
it's hardly begun what's that I say it's
hardly begun yeah I think what we've
seen so far has been so preliminary that
that has been underwhelming yeah the
true potential hasn't been unlocked but
this is a step in the right direction
and this is something where you know
they hope to it's in LA and you can get
a ticket for it and they're hoping to
expand it to other cities too so it's
something that they're hoping to make
more accessible not just for people to
go to film festivals I'm curious in the
opening there they had a guy like
touching your shoulder and talking to
you what character was that he plays all
the virtual reality characters so she
lays what's the name of the sorry the
name of the business partner of Scrooge
Jacob Marley Marley yes Jacob Marley the
ghost of Christmas past present and
future
oh yeah we don't see Tiny Tim we do see
some there are some characters that
aren't abot our bass that are
pre-programmed that are really creepy
but not like him he doesn't show up
that's pretty cool I want to hear more
about it but right now sir enjoys asking
what headset was that actually being oh
good question that was it was a rift
they used an oculus rift and like I said
you know I mentioned before that it's
something where they have to hack
together different elements you know the
people that made it are very experienced
in the film world and so they were very
expert on the motion capture thing
bringing in the VR thing but that's like
an instance where it's a rift and so it
has to be connected to a computer but
you're walking around a space a 360
degrees small space and so like when the
quest comes out that could make it
easier
the oculus quest which is one of those
like all-in-one you don't have the core
that that links you to oh yeah that
could make this sort of thing even more
accessible for people to put on but to
answer question yet was with a rift and
they had it set up so that the tether
the cord tether connected to a sort of
rig on the ceiling that would that's
adjustable that can move back and forth
and side to side so as I walked around
the space the core I could feel the cord
sort of tugging here and there but in
addition to the actor that's in the
space with you in the motion capture
suit there's a scene partner who is also
in the room that I never see or interact
with are really here and she is the one
who she has a tablet that fires off
specific events in the experience on cue
so if it takes so like at the beginning
the actor asks you specific questions
that you have to answer and if the
person who's responding answers very
quickly all those questions then she can
cue it right then but if that person
who's in the experience you know if I
took a really long time and I got into a
diatribe answering these questions she
can she also in addition to the firing
off the events in the experience she
also makes sure that you don't get
tangled up in the court or the court
doesn't get stuck there and she's the
one that's moving the walls so that they
can disappear and yeah so there's like
this whole thing this whole production
that's happening you don't ever see it
it's kind of no I definitely the fact
that this isn't it's not like a standard
performance like every performance is
basically different based on your
reactions so the actor said that like
it's funny
the director said that there's three
categories that they've categories
different participants as runners
sleepers and performers because people
tend to like fall into those three
buckets but the actor did say like
they'd ask these three questions at the
beginning three or three or four and the
purpose of that is to understand kind of
how comfortable you are in this
situation if like that way he can
because he can't see your eyes they're
in a headset he can't really gauge it's
hard to gauge just from body language
alone like if you're kind of freaked out
being in here if you don't like being
told which one were you I was a runner
and what does a runner does runner is
somebody who they're in the headset they
get into the space and the whole like
crew is kind of like waiting to see like
what this person is like and then all of
a sudden she's like runner like me like
I'm like oh I'm gonna go over there and
so I'm like see anything so I'll send
them in the other corner when maybe they
needed me over in that corner gotcha
yeah sounds disorienting I think I'd be
a runner to people that are into like
games yeah really runners people that
are used to like the idea of there being
like objectives in VR you know like
wanna like touch everything right people
that are like into acting you know
people in in LA there's a higher
proportion of those are what are the
performers that when the actor starts
talking to them they're like make up a
character example - yeah and then
sleepers they said are people that
mostly stay to themselves and one spot
and allow themselves to be shepherded
through a little more possibly they also
said that those are the people that tend
to have the most emotional reaction
because they're the ones that are really
kind of taking it in and experiencing a
real way rather in like a playful like
that's a game sort of way fascinating
yeah I want to farm out a question to
you guys and to the chat what do you
want to see become immersive VR theater
is there a particular experience or
maybe an intellectual property that you
think should come next after the
Christmas Christmas Carol I would be
curious to see what people would love to
see themselves like inserted into that
sounded weird you know what I mean but
yeah what do you think would be a good
vr experience now that we're actually
seeing it getting used and more than
just like a playstation kind of play
form I mean a no-brainer would be Star
Wars for me yeah batter Monty Python
actually like Holy Grail
yeah inserting in the Holy Grail would
be awesome I mean I've got coconuts back
here I can help they're not the same
brand their personal effects full
effects too to make it real yeah I know
I always dreamed of being mauled by a
bunny - sidebar Flying Circus is now on
Netflix just FYI oh there you go
thank you for that PSA alright let's go
ahead and take questions from the chat
coming right out the gate Matthew dad
sure is qualcomm expected to release
anything exciting and speaking of
Qualcomm are there any snapdragon 3,100
based wearables yet ooh I don't know but
the second one yet although I think that
LG one that came out was suppose with
the w7 I think don't quote me I'm not
sure in terms of what's expected at this
event and we're gonna get the next
flagship Snapdragon processor they've
already announced the 5g modem the ex 50
that's that's what every phone will need
to have to be able to tap into 5g you'll
probably get to see more stuff on the
terribly named always on pcs those are
the laptops that they announced last
year that Snapdragon powered pcs
partnership with Microsoft you'll
probably see a bit more of that this
week but there's gonna be a lot of
talking about 5g a lot of talk from the
partners pretty good not just Qualcomm
but folks like Verizon and Samsung and
others talking about how some of this
stuff is gonna look like in the first
half sir enjoys coming out is telling us
he he wants to see Ghostbusters in VR
that's actually already happens - enjoy
did you have that VR I'm pulling up that
video right now a side bar I'm still
playing ghostbusters world and I'm doing
awesome
Joe Dunmore says transformers in VR
would mean chill oh yeah with like but
which transformers like actual scale
size giant robots transforming around
you but like yeah
the good kind or the baked I think we
have to be the good kind they're already
moving even the studios moved away from
the bay kind
yeah alright let's take a quick peek at
this ghostbusters VR experience
Jeff took part in a couple years ago
this was actually here in New York and
this actually I wanted to get to and I
couldn't make it in time before they had
to close it you know to talk but talk
about the idea of transformers in VR
that's one example where the VR makes
something possible that would be
impossible otherwise because for you in
a physical space
the VR scale can be like as depending on
your computing power infinite so you can
have practical effects that give you
like you can have Rush's of wind that
make you feel like a hundred and ninety
foot tall like transformer is moving
past you and it looks like in there you
are but you don't need to actually have
a space that's a hundred and ninety feet
taller however tall transformers are
that's drifting into like for what is it
4d theater that we see floating around
out there and yeah like the forty movies
that they have yeah yeah I saw Star Wars
in 40 once upon a time and it was mixed
reaction from me well it wasn't yeah
what are the 40 effects is it just wind
or is there like smell or does it though
its potential for kind of any of the
above
specifically I saw rogue one so like the
chairs are constantly in motion which I
found actually kind of distracting and
annoying yeah especially when you're
trying to snack so it's like the crawl
comes up or like like the text would
come up and your chair leans back you
know it's like I don't need that it's
like you're one person walking on the
hallway leans around the corner your
chair leans like that's a little much
but all the enhanced particle effects in
the air and they like wind blowing
through that was great to an extent the
water effects were cool but rogue one
takes place in rainstorm and on the
beach way and I'm gonna tell you right
spray water on you oh I was drenched by
the time I got it yeah it was yeah that
that I was not a fan of and it's still
like an air-conditioned cold theater so
you're just kind of uncomfortable by the
yeah that doesn't that's not right but
that's me all over the technology still
work flawlessly I was just kind of
personally annoyed by some of the
effects of it but it's hey it's what I
signed up for right yeah but it's also
like it speaks a little bit to being
overzealous with a technology when it's
like if it doesn't serve the story then
it's not good you said well I just don't
want to get what I mean sounds terrible
it's growing pains though
yeah for sure bad idea until you try it
a couple more VR claims would we leave
off transformers MCU anything MCU that's
a no-brainer yeah that's a game ECMA
says Call of Duty VR that could be fun
tech slackers has matrix in VR like that
one right on the nose I mean yeah very
meta storm king says how about a Star
Trek experience in VR a lot of material
to mine from that franchise I feel like
they're kind of they're just be working
on there was that Star Trek experience
we're like you worked on a console with
like other people yeah you were on this
bit you're on a starship and he each had
to like do like one task or something it
was really kind of dumb but there was a
Star Trek experience again I think it's
a good example of like VR done wrong cuz
it was sort of like you get the you know
you can move around you see the inside
of the starship and I think you have
like a console where you do one thing
you've got to coordinate with three
other people or alike I don't know the
ship crashes or something I don't even
know but yeah that's great that sounds
like a really fun experience where
you're like so immerse that you think
you're going to die on a ship let's go
back to 5ge
Chris Wesley says I feel like it's too
soon for 5g right now it would be nice
if they get everything that is buggy
with it fixed before rolling it out like
they did with 4G he's right don't count
on it
tell me I'm wrong there no they're
definitely rushing to get 5g out and
it's gonna be that transition is gonna
be pretty Rocky the first couple of
years I mean you may not even have 5g in
your neighborhood so in terms of getting
the bugs out of it I mean the only way
to get the bugs out is to launch this
thing and to kind of fix it on the go
they've had you know a couple years of
trials but they're fairly limited but to
really kind of stamp out some of the the
big like reception issues or coverage
issues you need to have more coverage to
see what where things break down and how
you actually could fix it so that's why
I'm in favor of like pushing forward
because that's the only way we can get
this stuff and get it working I think
you're right in this case as much as I
like to see them work although the bugs
as well yeah the only way to get a true
petri dish test that's more than just a
controlled like
concentration group that that won't be
enough they really need to see this
thing in the battlefield this is how how
wrong things can go so I mean we're
gonna have to weather it so Qualcomm is
testing out they're gonna throw up these
5g networks these test networks for for
folks to try out they're gonna be like
perfect optimal condition imagine you
know Qualcomm and Samsung and all these
companies are wheeling in there 5g demos
they're gonna work perfectly and but
that's not how it's gonna work in the
real world the only way to get that kind
of real-world experience and track
record is to deploy these things and
have people serve as guinea pigs as a
bit is there for a bit
no you need to actually have it fail to
find out where that fail points gonna be
yeah exactly
here's one from tech slacker this is
this is interesting I knew nothing about
this I've read somewhere that hundreds
of birds are falling dead during a 5g
testing trial in the Netherlands is
there any such harmful environmental
concerns with 5g as compared to 4G I've
not seen this report so I can't really
comment about birds but I you know the
the spectrum the radio frequency is much
higher than your standard cellular
network there hasn't been anything to
concretely prove that it's there's a
health risk there so it's hard for me to
really say I and it's I'm yeah you know
I don't know wanna go there I don't
wanna go near the dead bird thing I
wasn't either because yeah speculate at
all because I haven't read the report
good because there are plenty of sited
resources and a simple Google search but
if you check out Snopes
did 5g cellular network test cause
hundreds of birds to die false that
happened back in November there was a
medical conspiracy blog health not News
reported quote-unquote that is seemingly
disturbing story about headlines of
hundreds of birds and then of course
went to Facebook because that's where
everything that's wrong lands and then
yeah I'll try to link this in the
description of the show if anyone wants
to dig up but it's easy enough to turn
up on on Google it looks like that's
that's a bogus claim but hey nothing
wrong with being concerned no folks
express concerns about just having more
cell towers in your neighborhood and
that's that's gonna happen that's
thing like and and you know people are
adverse to having them near their homes
and 5g will bring these cell towers
closer to your home so definitely
concern all right we got just about
enough time for one maybe two more
questions before we call today when can
we expect the earliest phones with the
new Snapdragon chips Oh Snapdragon chips
pry would be willing to bet Samsung with
the Galaxy S ten is probably gonna be
the first phone I think it'll be kind of
a race you'll see some phones get
announced that may be ahead of Samsung
but I think in terms of like a phone
you'll be able to hold in your hands
it'll probably be Samsung first all
right and here's the last one for the
day coming in from our buddy sir enjoy
Qualcomm is fighting on multiple
frontiers while doing their normal
business the 5g race clashes against
Apple war against Intel to introduce
Snapdragon chips to PC laptops great
their success ooh
I I won't give it a number of great I'll
just say it's all kind of working
progress at this point the Apple thing
is and it can go either way at this
point I think they've they're I think
they're sitting in a better position
that Intel when you give them the fact
that you know they haven't been in pcs
they're trying to get into the PC
business it's probably gonna take them a
while but it's it's all kind of new
growth there they're definitely at the
forefront of 5g I mean there's a reason
why President Trump killed the Broadcom
Qualcomm deal it's because his
administration has a weird fixation with
5g and wants to maintain US leadership
there and Qualcomm is more than the big
leaders in 5g and so I would say their
core business still has some real
challenges so that's why you're hearing
so much about all these different areas
they're trying to get into because they
want to distract you from the fact that
the phone business is slowing down and
and their core business is sort of you
know it's not hit a rut but it's
definitely the growth there is not what
it used to be
lofty question before we walk out the
door would you say that 5g is kind of
like our generation space race whoo yeah
much lesser degree yeah between 5g and
AI I think those are two like critical
technology races that
that we'll see from country to country I
think you know China is up there they
want to be ahead and 5g they've got a
big company in Huawei kind of pushing
the 5 G's standards between I think 5g
and AI those are two areas where I think
countries are being fairly competitive
with each other like getting there first
interesting that's kind of that's a one
to keep an eye on I think we are out of
time thanks everybody for joining us we
are going to wrap it up here and we'll
see you back here again tomorrow for
another episode of 3:59 Roger yeah your
vision is available on iTunes tune in
feedburner stitcher google play music
google podcast the amazon echo of course
cnet.com we'll see y'all tomorrow
