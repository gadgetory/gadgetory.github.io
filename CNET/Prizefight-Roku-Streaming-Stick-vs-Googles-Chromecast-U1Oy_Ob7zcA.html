I'm Brian Tong and this is a Throwdown
showdown between two first-time
contenders it's a prize five foot out
between Roku streaming stick and
Google's chromecast our judges for this
fight are executive editor John
bad-to-the-bone falcone senior associate
editor Matthew the Big Show Muscovy AK
and myself really big Tom we'll take
each round score and average them out to
the nearest tenth of a point the final
prize fight score will be an average of
all rounds using the same system let's
get this party started
round one is designed Roku and Google
bring the simplest and sweetest design
for media streaming it's a stick now the
chromecast is black Roku's is purple and
they'll both probably hide behind your
TV set powered by a USB port or a
plug-in adapter I told you it was simple
we're calling this a tie at a perfect
five points next round is reader
interface and navigation the biggest
difference right out of the box is that
the Roku includes a remote control but
you won't find Roku's headphone jack on
this one Roku interface is still the
best in its class with a UI that's
simple and easily organized and using
its remote to navigate is easier
compared to the chromecast that has no
real interface but relies on apps on
your smartphone tablet or your computer
to throw content to the TV it's actually
quicker if you're just using a single
app like YouTube and jumping through
videos but for other apps splitting time
between two screens the play pause and
fast-forward can be a hassle and takes
you out of that living room experience
so that's really a personal preference
and let's not forget about Roku's
universal search that allows you to type
in a title actor or director and shows
you where you can watch that content
across all its apps Roku beats Google in
search well in the living room now the
Roku streaming stick gets another
perfect 5 and the chromecast gets a 4
after averaging two rounds Roku has a
perfect score and Google trails by half
a point next round is features in
content content will always be king and
this comes down to the deep library of
over 1200 apps that Roku seems to get
before anyone else
now Google's chromecast has added most
of the must-have apps like Netflix HBO
Go and Hulu for video and Pandora for
music streaming but if you have all your
media content through the Google Play
Store it makes sense to stick with the
chromecast but it can't compete when it
comes to sports music services internet
video like my favorite websites see net
and the ocean of content that Roku has
one way chromecast addresses this is
with their mirroring feature that is
nice but it doesn't work quite as well
as advertised and it can be a clunky
experience now Roku doesn't have any
kind of mirroring whatsoever but it
brings the ability to watch TV from the
Slingbox app on your phone to your big
screen on your TV and if you have a
sling box this is a must-have chromecast
has opened up its SDK so it's only
really a matter of time for us to see
more content from partners like Vudu and
they've even done creative things like
this photo wall app but our judges all
agree
Roku gets another perfect five and
Google gets before next round is
performing both of these streaming
sticks pump out 1080p video and they
look great and yes the marryin feature
on chromecast still feels a little beta
but the biggest issue we found was the
extremely long boot up times for the
Netflix and YouTube apps on the Roku now
in our scene at tests it took Netflix 32
seconds to launch the app on the Roku
stick in only 10 seconds with the
chromecast the YouTube app took 30
seconds to launch on the Roku and only
eight seconds on the chromecast and sure
these are first world problems and the
chromecast has the luxury of using your
smartphone or tablet to load the app but
these are also real-world results the
chromecast can hold its head high with
this round with a perfect 5
get school so after averaging four
rounds Roku still has the lead the final
round that decides it all is about the
Roku streaming stick is 50 dollars and
that's a perfect price with a remote
control and every streaming service you
can think of the chromecast brings an
even sweeter price point at $35 if
you're okay with using your smartphone
or tablet as a remote which most of you
are now all it really needs is more app
support to make this the ultimate value
both of these are great deals but we're
giving the Roku the edge because of the
entire experience you're getting at that
price the stick gets another perfect
five and the chromecast gets a 4.3
so let's average out all five rounds and
this is a battle that really has plenty
more fight left
but Roku dominated throughout with four
perfect rounds taking this street fight
4.8 to 4.3 and is your prize buy it
winner
I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching I'll
catch you guys next time for another
prize fight whatever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
