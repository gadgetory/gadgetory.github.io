and the samsung galaxy s6 has been
officially announced but it's not out on
the market just yet so we're going to do
something here for the first time it's a
prize fight battle of the specs between
samsung galaxy s6 and apple's iphone 6
plus i like to call it the battle of the
specs is so let's start off with the
tale of the tape it's their weight and
dimensions say goodbye to plastic the
new galaxy s6 design brings an all-new
Gorilla Glass 4 front and back with a
metal frame yes that's right glass and
metal its dimensions and millimeters are
a height of 100 43.4 a width of 70.5 and
it's the thinner of the two phones at
6.8 now the iphone 6 plus brings it's
all metal back and all glass front with
a bigger body and a height of 150 8.1
millimeters a width of 77.8 and it's
thicker at 7.1 let's get to the screens
now and the galaxy s6 brings a 5.1 inch
AMOLED display with a higher resolution
compared to its previous generation at
2560 x 1440 and again best apple with a
top-notch 577 pixels per inch the iphone
6 plus brings its larger 5.5 inch retina
display at a lower 1920 x 1080
resolution with only 401 pixels prints
yikes
the odds of features the galaxy s6
dreams a 64-bit Samsung Exynos octa core
processor that's coming to all markets
an apple rings are 64 bit a8 chip inside
but there's really no way we can
benchmark these at this moment but
features is really where Samsung has
made some of its biggest changes not
only are they going all glass and metal
the Essex will no longer have a micro SD
card slot it's all built in storage with
32 64 and 128 gig options even bigger
their battery is embedded into the
design it's no longer user replaceable
and it also supports wireless charging
for all standards with up to a half
charge in half an hour their fingerprint
scanner has been upgraded as well it's
no longer a swipe that was very
inconsistent you can just rest your
finger on it now mobile payments will
not be available on launch and Samsung
will be rolling this out in summer
thanks to their acquisition of lupe now
the iphone six-plus has always had an
embedded battery and internal storage at
16 64 and 128 gigs touch ID is hands
down the best performing fingerprint
scanner on the market right now and
we've already seen the early initial
success with Apple pay and competitors
are scrambling to get into that space
now the galaxy s6 comes with a 25 50
milli ampere hour battery dropping from
the 2800 in the g5 the iphone 6 plus
brings a larger 29 15 milli ampere hour
battery thanks to its larger form factor
the final comparison point in this
battle the specs is the camera now the
iphone 6 plus may not have the most
megapixels with 8 on its rear camera but
still brings arguably the best pictures
with its autofocus with focus pixels
tech optical image stabilization true
tone flash with its f 2.2 aperture and
shooting modes galore but it's 1080p
video lags behind the competition now
the galaxy s6 isn't playing around with
a 16 megapixel rear camera with optical
image stabilization it shoots 4k video
there's a new auto HDR feature and even
better and f 1.9 aperture these are
impressive stats we know all about their
endless shooting modes as well it will
have to wait until we see the actual
picture results Samsung's front
facing camera brings a 5 megapixel
shooter and a wide angle for selfies
compared to apples 1.2 megapixel camera
we all know carriers will announce their
own pricing and launch dates for the
galaxy s6 but look for a global push
beginning in court or two of this year
so there you go we've stacked up the
major stats for you to consider in yes a
phone is always more than just the specs
it's about the OS its performance and
the ecosystem you prefer but other than
its battery life the galaxy s6 has made
significant improvements across the
board and is your winner in our prize
fight battle of the specs is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
