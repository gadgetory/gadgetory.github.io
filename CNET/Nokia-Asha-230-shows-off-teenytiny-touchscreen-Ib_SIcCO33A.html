Mobile World Congress 2014 taking a look
at this tiny thing it's the Nokia Asha
230 now if you're used to high-flying
cutting-edge smart phones then this
thing could be a bit of a shock to the
system because it's absolutely tiny and
it's very basic but the upside there is
that it's extremely cheap this thing is
only going to cost 45 euros so if you've
never used a smartphone this could be
the perfect introduction or it could
make a new backup phone let's talk about
the hardware this is a 2.8 inch screen
it doesn't have a very high resolution
the icons of the text is looking a
little bit fuzzy but again bear in mind
the price if you spin it around on the
back there's a 1.3 megapixel camera
don't expect to take any prize-winning
photos with that but in mind to a good
job of capturing the moment unlike lots
of very cheap smartphones it's not
running Android but Nokia has taken care
to put a couple of software treats on
here for instance you get access to
Microsoft's onedrive cloud storage so
you can put all your photos online and
you also get this rather neat app called
Asha motion now what this does is lets
you create some pretty designs using the
phone's accelerometers that you can then
save as a wallpaper nokia says it's
going on sale immediately around the
world do you think this could be your
first smartphone let me know and check
