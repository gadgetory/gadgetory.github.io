even though smartphones tend to be the
go-to camera for most people there is
still a wide selection of cameras for
those who want to get a little more out
of their photos it all starts with
point-and-shoot cameras these are slim
basic cameras that shoot better than a
smartphone but can still fit in your
pocket cameras like the canon sx60
usually sport a 10 times zoom and are
pretty good at capturing photos of
fast-moving kids and sports you'll
rarely spend more than 250 dollars on
these models if it's any higher than
that consider stepping up to the next
category here you have compact zooms
mega zooms and high performance compact
cameras these will range you anywhere
from three hundred and fifty to one
thousand dollars depending on the
feature set and the size compact mega
zooms like the Canon Powershot SX 280
usually sport a longer lens and they
give you more control over manual
functions like exposure and even white
balance they easily beat the image
quality of a point-and-shoot camera then
you have you mega zooms at that point
forget about fitting anything into your
pocket these cameras it's somewhere
between point-and-shoots and DSLRs as
far as image quality goes cameras like
the Panasonic fz200 are great when you
want to get close-up shots from
nosebleed seats that's their primary use
other than that the photo quality is
pretty close to a point-and-shoot
cameras enthusiast compacts like the
Sony rx100 2 don't have a great zoom but
their image quality easily beats any
mega zoom a bigger sensor means higher
quality photos and things to their more
advanced lenses you get more of that
blurry background or bouquet effect as
it's called and even with all that tech
and enthusiasts compact will still fit
in your pocket
some models like the sony alpha 6000
even have interchangeable lenses so you
can replace the lens with a macro lens
and get beautiful food photos that gets
you a little bit closer to a DSLR
without having to carry around a camera
bag now for the photography enthusiast
who wants professional looking photos
there are DSLRs digital SLRs are fast
they sport big sensors for crisp photos
and you get all the manual functions you
want you can certainly pick one up and
start using it but for the newbie
there's definitely a learning curve
what's great is that once you outgrow
the stock lens on your DSLR you can
replace it with a new one and feel like
you have an entirely new camera once you
decide what kind of camera you want it's
time to dig into the specs a little more
but don't be distracted by megapixels
and zoom those numbers don't really mean
much the first thing you want to look
for is the type of lens the camera has
wide-angle lenses are great for
landscapes and group shots
whereas telephoto lenses are great for
portraits and sports pay especially
close attention to the aperture this is
what allows your camera to perform well
in low light plus it gives you that
blurry background or bouquet effect that
we talked about the bottom line the
lower the number like 2.8 or 3.5 the
better and finally look out for extras
these aren't necessary but they can be
helpful for instance there's GPS for
geo-tagging your photos when you're on
vacation and even Wi-Fi so you can
upload your photos without ever
connecting your camera to the computer
