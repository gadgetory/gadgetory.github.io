a cutesy piece of retro stick in the
Pixar style that wasn't a bad car but
was just too much of a wink after a few
years but now with the newest Beatle VW
has dropped the word new from New Beetle
and grown up its lines quite a bit we
end up with a more macho cutesy car I'm
not sure the world is better for that or
not let's find out as we drive the 2013
VW Beetle Cabriolet seventies edition
and check the tip now that's what we had
a 70s edition I figured we'd find a bag
of grass in the glove box on a Hotel
California 8-track in the - wrong on
both counts
instead 70s edition - Volkswagen means
this toffee brown color no other choice
and these wheels which don't
controversies to me at all a nice set of
gold BDS RS would do that
now inside you noticed beetles got very
good materials all around the cabin
color-keyed - plate here that's a nod to
the past to the metallic - they had in
the early days and you also find we've
got this synthetic leather that I think
only the Germans can get right they call
this v-tex the Mercedes folks call
theirs mb-tex it's particularly good in
the convertible because it's very
durable but it's got a nice leather feel
we've seen this head unit before the
interface is an unmitigated disaster you
rotate through choices or you can touch
the screen and reading what's on and
what's not I can't figure it out however
your sources are basically all there
am/fm you got your optical disk up here
satellite radio for three months then
it's your problem
aux jacks over here SD card slot no hard
drive luckily no itunes tagging with HD
radio bluetooth streaming audio as you
can see good metatags support at least
with my Android phone and while you do
have navigation standard on this 70s
Edition it's me small screen again the
interface makes it a real disaster and
what I'd like to use voice command to
enter the address to not have to use
that the voice only works for the
Bluetooth calling and even when you do
that the voice command doesn't give you
any prompts on the screen for what you
could say so you're endlessly saying
help or memorizing commands fail fail
fail now hits one got in this car before
me and he came back all glowing about
the fender audio telling me how great it
sounds I figure he's back into the peach
whiskey cuz I've never heard one of
these fender rig sounds really very good
at all he was right this one sounds
great for some reason it does two things
really well first of all it takes crap
sources like streaming Bluetooth fills
in the gaps well and makes them sound
good that's quite a trick secondly it's
loud enough and clean enough to overcome
road noise with the top down without
kind of getting out of shape being
screechie harsh or tube AC and that's at
the flat tone settings so I was very
impressed the only thing I don't like
about the sound system is this stupid
little thing over here you can do let's
see white blue
red colored light on those rings around
the speakers that's like a page out of
the Scion playbook here's my play call
pass now the beetle is a Cabrio in top
nomenclature that means a soft top that
folds kind of untidily on the back of
the rear of the car and never submerges
and has no cover over it it's not a
spider it's not a retractable some would
even say it's not a true convertible now
if you don't like the untidy look of the
top one it's down VW has been good
enough to take up most of the trunk with
the world's biggest chunky as tonneau
cover I can't believe this thing really
you put it up here and you snap it in
around the top and the back and the
sides my guess is you'll use it exactly
three times once the day you bring the
car home to show it off once the day you
go on that first nice summer road trip
and once the day you decide you're sick
of this thing and throw it in the garage
now here in the engine bay there is
really nothing in common with the old
beetles the engines in the front not the
back it's water cool not air-cooled and
it makes a nice sound when you step on
it instead of standing like a canary
farting two and a half liter sidesaddle
inline five it's a real mainstay VW
motor they put these in Jenna's all day
long front-wheel drive as I mentioned
the numbers are very normal because the
technology is real normal no turbo no
direct injections none of that bill
fancy stuff 170 horse 177 foot-pounds of
torque gets this car to 60 in about
eight seconds it weighs about 3,200
pounds not terribly heavy by today's
standards and 21 27 mpg is fine you'd
like it to hit 30 wouldn't you but it
doesn't
the first thing I'm struck by on this
beetle is that the ride quality is very
good I recall the one before not being
quite as delightful in that respect and
the power from this engine is responsive
there's not a ton of it as you can tell
from the numbers but it comes on rather
quickly in a nice linear fashion because
there's not a lot of trickery going on
here I like that occasionally the car
will get stuck into higher gear as just
about all modern cars do and you'll get
a moment of flat-footed miss but for the
most part in this sport mode it just
works and it's a well done sport mode
when you're in here it's not too
high-strung and yet it does wake the car
up some sport modes are just too frantic
you can also go to the gate like I
showed you you can shift in the
Tiptronic mode I didn't find I needed
zoom sport mode nailed it now if you
want a big gripe about the inside of
this car here's where it is if you look
back behind me you might see it there is
really poor visibility out to the right
and the back where you often look to do
your lane change it's because you've got
high headrest back there that big old
Cabrio top is piled up behind you and
that is really hard to deal with I'd
rather do a lane change in a Guyardo
than in this guy
unfortunately there's no blind spot tech
available in this Beetle nor is there a
rear camera so that all conspires to
make for kind of a tricky car to
maneuver just
keep going forward all-in-all a fun
little driver on a nice day it's a great
car on a crappy day the exceptional
thick quality of the roof also makes it
a nice car
okay let's price our beetle Cabrio 70s
Edition real simple story it's 29 for
period there are no options at least
nothing CNET style that's the head unit
that's the audio system everything is
what it is it's part of a very tight 70s
package you got to like this color by
the way because there's no changing it
either it's a real nice driving car it's
not a sports car per se but it's got
good handling and I was surprised how
much I liked it to be honest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
