show floor at Computex 2015 you may know
the name Synology for its network
attached storage solutions but they've
actually taken a bit of a jump and done
their first router an actual networking
device it's called the RT 1900 a C and
as the name suggests it is AC compliant
and does get up to one point nine
gigabits per second at maximum speed its
dual band 2.4 and 5 gigahertz and can
support three multiple in multiple out
connections but the big change is the
interface Synology has brought it's
really cleverly designed interfaces from
its nails solutions to the router
allowing an incredible level of
granularity in terms of device
connectivity monitoring usage blocking
devices for usage for certain times and
parental controls and because the router
also has an SD card and a USB three you
can access storage solutions directly
from it and the interface is set up to
make that as easy as possible it's a
really nice move from Synology seems to
fit in really quite well with their
overall ethos and I have to say the
interface is better than any router I've
actually used in the past the facts
analogy's router has been so well
received it's already picked up a golden
award here at Computex I'm Nick Healy
