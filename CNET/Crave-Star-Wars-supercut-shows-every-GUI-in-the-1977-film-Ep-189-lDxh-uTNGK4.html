here's what's happening this week on me
that's Craig a solar-powered plane will
embark on a flight around the world in a
few months and you can tag along for the
trip the Solar Impulse 2 airplane will
begin its journey on march first taking
off from Abu Dhabi in the United Arab
Emirates and it's scheduled to return in
late july or early august 2015 the Solar
Impulse 2 team claims that the plane
will be able to fly continuously for
five days and nights without fuel the
plane weighs two thousand three hundred
kilograms or five thousand seventy
pounds the aircraft has 17,000 248 solar
cells across its 230 6-foot wingspan
along the fuselage and the tail of the
plane these cells collect up to 340
kilowatts per day from the Sun and
distribute the power to for 17.5
horsepower electric motors while
simultaneously charging 633 kilograms of
lithium polymer batteries so that the
plane can fly during the night the trip
will take several months to complete and
is estimated at around 500 flight hours
the pilot seat doubles as a reclining
bed to the plane to remain in the air
while the pilot sleeps and it triples as
a toilet because pit stops will not be
an option occasionally for four to five
days at a time you can follow the planes
history-making journey starting march
first on the Solar Impulse website at
Solar Impulse calm and in some quick hit
crave news George Lucas says that Disney
was not interested in his ideas for Star
Wars Episode 7 in a recent interview
with cinema blend in fact they didn't
want to really do those according to mr.
Lucas so they made up their own the ones
that I sold the Disney and everything
they can up to the decision that they
didn't really want to do though so they
made it their own so it's not it's not
the ones that I originally wrote I hope
does he knows what they're doing
speaking of guys who may not know what
they are doing like crashing drones full
of drugs The Associated Press reported
that the Tijuana police department
announced that they found a drone crash
near the San Ysidro border crossing
which was carrying three kilos of
methamphetamine police believe the drone
is a DJ I spread wings s900 which can
fly autonomously making it more
difficult for law enforcement to track
down the responsible party it's a whole
new bird is evil calm creator and user
experience Directorate Electronic Arts
visceral Studios Dino Ignacio known for
his work on the graphic user interface
design in the dead space video game
series has put together this supercut of
every user interface in the movie star
wars episode for a new hope a lot of the
