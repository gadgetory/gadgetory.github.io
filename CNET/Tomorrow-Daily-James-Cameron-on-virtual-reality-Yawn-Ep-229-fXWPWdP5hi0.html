gets to throw a very special pitch we're
going to take a field trip also a book
that's going to help you filter water in
third world countries and James Cameron
thinks VR stupid thanks Cameron thanks a
lot tomorrow daily
fruity citizen to the internet welcome
tomorrow daily the best geek talk show
in the known universe I'm Ashley scallop
that's Hill nauman your back welcome
back hi you know yeah I am I feel like I
was here yesterday but I wasn't and it
like who's super bizarre cuz i sent my
identical twin in to host the show and
she just like pretended to be we have
enough footage of you now that we just
edited you in actually was just yeah it
was just like audio and we synced it you
Siri twin for pickup series where yeah
that was super easy pretty impressed you
have to pay anybody it was amazing it
was great please don't tell our boss
that all right let's have headlines I'm
so glad we're starting out with this one
okay so we are everyone everyone has
their kind of different opinions about
it whether or not it's gonna be huge we
don't know but everyone's excited about
it except for James freaking Cameron
okay because there was a wall street
journal event okay we're gonna reel back
there was a wall street journal event in
which James Cameron had a chance to
speak and he said about VR there seems
to be a lot of excitement around
something that to me is a yawn frankly
well those are fighting words you see
there James Cameron thy gates before we
crack into this before we crack into how
we feel about him saying okay because we
could be happily could be mad if you
can't tell he says that there hasn't
really been a VR app that has really
impressed him it's been more like you
just kind of look around in an
environment if you want to move through
a virtual reality it's called a video
game oh it's been around forever she's
James Cameron the VR industry needs some
cream for that sick burn yeah I mean
seriously there are video games in VR
James Cameron that's true so the the
rift creator uh Palmer lucky lucky lucky
is it lucky yeah okay it looks like
lucky he's not convinced though he he
says he is incorrect of course he would
say that of course all you have to do is
try virtual reality to understand that
goes beyond anything you can do even on
a 3d television and a 3d movie screen
James Cameron he didn't add the head of
the James Cameron yeah so so there you
go I mean I can understand what James
Cameron saying but
yeah I don't know if you know anything
about the way that he made a avatar but
he created this new technology in which
they basically made the entire setting
and then he had this movable camera
where he could walk though I don't know
if this is footage of it but he could
walk through the environment and use
this virtual screen to like take
different shots test so yeah so he was
going around yeah they're basically
doing that in this shot I was actually
at this event I think yes I was at this
event um Wow or this is a ricas the same
place they filmed it or whatever same
kind of thing well yeah they move around
see there's the screen I thought I guess
that's not screen anyway the point is he
was using virtual reality it's good yeah
like our maybe I guess it was a are
maybe he thinks AR is the bigger
potential of the two maybe that's what
he's getting at cuz I mean obviously
like he is very technologically savvy he
hido for the Titanic like I mean he's
really involved in new technology and
he's brought a lot of new technology to
film and film making so for me it's like
it's very interesting that he is not
interested in BR yeah I I think it's
remember when we so many times when we
talk about VR we always say like you
have to try it you have to really see it
and it's got to be the right thing to
like spark your imagination because the
thing is is if I threw on a video game
for my mom like she wouldn't be
interested but if I gave my mom like a
virtual tour of like Fiji like she could
go and see our like the message James
James reefs in Australia yes she would
be stoked yeah like she would be so
jacked about that be like I get it and
so maybe it's just there's not a
specific thing yet that he's seen like
he said that's really like opened his
imagination about VR maybe he thinks
that they are maybe things as they are
listen James you have a lot of cool tech
and you get to do a lot of crazy things
in a virtual and augmented reality space
okay most people do not have that most
people have like a flat screen or
anything like they don't get to look
around at a virtual space and work in
high tech stuff so I think that's what
you're missing you're not impressed
because we haven't one catching on in
yeah maybe that's it come on man these
meetings also see me kind of like an old
man and not letting people want to do
that but that's not
we want to know what you guys think so
that's our hashtag of the day our
hashtag is TD yawn well well picked
thank you nicely done pity on and don't
take our opinion for it we want to know
does James Cameron have a point does he
have a point are because he fanboying
too much or is he right is it kind of
beyond what would you what would you
point at what would you do to convince
him like you if your art if you think
they are is cool what would you do to
convince like what's the thing either
that you've seen or that should exist
that would convince james camera yeah
how's oh you know what I think it would
be what avatar and virtual reality being
able to watch the movie and hang out
like in like Avatar to like doing it
entirely in VR right so we know they
won't have any VR rides or anything at
the the new animal kingdom avatar land
that there but we are out of my pipe
James Cameron says what James Cameron
cuz James Cameron is James Cameron
that's very true very true but I like
your point a lot about he is so immersed
in the the most cutting-edge technology
that maybe it's not as impressive to him
I think that's actually a really good
salen point yeah it was really so can i
show an old person like a phone and
they're like whoa it was like no this is
i have like a generation behind they
have one that just came out six months
ago yeah and it but they were just blown
away by no I get that so they go let us
know TD yawn yawn James Cameron yawning
man he basically was like yeah PR miss
all right-thinking billionaires I gotta
tell you about this this is really cool
I saw this and thought it was actually
pretty brilliant um so a lot of people
in the world don't have access to clean
water and one person who is a Carnegie
Mellon University postdoc her name's
Theresa Deng kovitch she's been thinking
a lot about that and so she came up with
this really brilliant idea called the
drinking book this is called the
drinking book and go on pages you see
her like sifting through these things
it's an actual book and the pages can be
torn out and used to filter water to
99.9 percent purity oh wow it's so cool
like I love this idea the okay so each
page has
two filters you can tear out a filter
you insert it into a holder that comes
with the book and then you pour dirty
water through it and it filters it out
and they were saying that like there's
still some levels of silver of nitrates
and other trace amounts of stuff but
it's well below what the standards are
for the World Health Organization and
the in like EPA standards it's well well
well below that so here you go slide
this in a custom filter box and pour
water through again the book comes with
this filter box and then there's your
drinkable water there you have it like
isn't that incredible okay so and
there's information about having safe
drinking water in the book printed onto
these pages filters so potentially for
people that don't speak English well you
can like educate people about what their
what they would do with the book like
and they can print in different
languages and it's this is amazing to me
this is absolutely incredible should
they have each filter can clean 100
litres of water before being unusable so
hypothetically one book would last a
person about four years Oh which is
amazing it comes in the box that's the
filter box pretty cool it was field
tested in South Africa Ghana Haiti and
Kenya and it had again ninety-nine point
nine percent purity when filtering water
that had high bacteria concentrations
from recently dumped raw sewage
ninety-nine point nine percent dirty
pretty amazing she wants to do more
study she wants keep refining the book
um it's a I just think it's a really
cool idea and honestly good for you yeah
that's pretty cool so Teresa jankovic is
she getting it out there is it just a
concept now now she's it's out in field
testing she she's bringing it to country
I think she's gonna try really hard to
kind of ramp up manufacturing it I'm
sure if we could make more of them
quickly then would be a little easier to
get them out to more countries but she
is field testing them so they are out
there and and people seem to respond
very well to them so good good for you
yeah I really would have liked it if she
had like printed on like schoolbooks so
that not only do they get this filter
but they have likened they're likely the
kids are like learning and also they
have to read really fast because they're
thirsty yeah and they're like ah why do
you drink and then you wait through my
pipe making fun I'm just saying like
and then I get water they get a bonus
out of it says well she does have like
all of the pages have facts about clean
water like how like how to use the book
like it's all in there like basically
it's the book is also the instruction
manual which is pretty amazing I'm so
good for you imagine if the Martian was
printed on that like the Martian he
makes water in the book like creates
water see so much science yay okay so
last last thing but certainly not least
do you have your permission slip for the
field trip we're about to take my dog
ate it okay that's fine I'll forge your
mom's signature there is a little girl
she's five years old her name is hailey
Dawson she is a huge Baltimore Orioles
fan who also happens to have what is
called Poland syndrome which I didn't
I've never heard of this syndrome but
apparently it causes kids to be born
with abnormal or missing abdominal
muscles on like one side of their body
but it can also debilitate their hands
and so she has a hand issue like a
deformity or an abnormality that allows
her to not really use it very well so
her parents turn to the University of
Nevada Las Vegas and they said hey could
you help us make prosthetics we've
talked about it they're expensive
they're really expensive and of course
she's growing she's a little girl so
she's gonna need more as she gets older
they said sure no problem engineering
departments on it we got it and recently
they made I believe this is her third
one it is it has a Baltimore Orioles
logo on it and she threw out the first
pitch with that hand that 3d printed
hand added Baltimore Orioles game whoa
and i love it back so she's got it on
its on her right arm and they're gonna
hand her the ball and she's gonna throw
this is her favorite player oh they're
absolute favorite baltimore oriole and
she's super cute and her parents were
really excited about first of all the
idea that you know i think they said the
first one she grew out of the second one
I think broke after the mom was trying
to restring one of the one of the
fingers and then they so they printed
our new one and now they're working on a
fourth one and they're gonna keep
improving the hand every single time
they give her one but it's a myoelectric
prosthetic socio my god give her the
ball give
already I know this video takes a little
while to get there brother sucks yeah
well that might be just maybe it's the
ball boy so now there we go this
hand is able to grip and there she goes
Oh threw out the first pitch yeah cutest
thing ever I love that technology is
being used to like help people and again
that's our favorite well your and a bird
is creepy very terrifying yeah now she's
gonna have nightmares oh great so there
you go I thought that was the best way
to end this week's headlines with a
really nice feel-good story about people
helping other people yeah I'll be good
alright guys we are gonna take a quick
break but before we go we have to tell
you what cnet and GameSpot are playing
right now so this is play this we'll be
right back all week I have been playing
poly bridge because in a former life I
was possibly an engineer or a mad
building psychopath you'll see that it's
been over 10 years since and the first
game at the flash game it's been over
seven years since then plus came out and
plus plus now on ps4 you're a ninja you
collect gold you go in the door done so
I have been playing everybody's gone to
the rapture it is a walk them up or lump
I have been playing rare replay lately
is 30 games for xbox one from rare eel
developer that made perfect dark banjo
kazooie battletoads which I just played
for the first time because of this
collection
it's amazing because in addition to
constructing useful things for the world
I can also build hideous monsters that
also help cards in across the river it's
about this town that's completely empty
everyone's gone and you don't know why
and you need to figure out why they're
all gone presuming from the name of the
title they've been raptured but that's
not exactly the case they're having a
lot of fun with it but a lot of the
games kind of don't hold up as well and
you might expect others still do but
yeah oh no we're having a good time with
it I really like the story I think it's
a really great tale of like love and
science and mysticism and I really like
the way the game is nonlinear and lets
you unravel it at your own pace and sort
of figure it out for yourself so it
takes both boxes of me creating and me
destroying
welcome back to the show we've returned
it's a thursday kale is looking very
charming we got your get your wink on
it's a Thursday which means it's time to
tell you about stuff we like I mean we
do that all week but now it's really
important this is into it can I go first
I'm pretty excited well I already said
mine did you yeah well during that
little break thing oh okay all right
yeah good all right so this is called
it's an app it's called VHS camcorder
and it makes your video recording look
like you are literally recording an old
VHS tape even if you turn it it gets all
that steps oh my god i want to get that
right now yeah it's grace is way better
than mine today so it's like god it's
cold it's called VHS camcorder does it
cost money no oh sorry I'm sorry yes it
does i'm sorry it's four bucks way time
and i'll buy them right here watch watch
this so if you're if the old the old
video footage like it even looks like
it's zooming in on an old camera so
there's my stupid face but it's so cool
and you can set the date so like you can
have it say 1987 and there's a in the
menu you can spoof the recording date
here's some footage that Anthony
domanico from cnet like he recorded this
as test footage um you can do black and
white for a video you can do like a
found footage movies chuckling short
 a whore a found footage was the
first thing I thought of when I saw this
app I'm like oh my gosh I want to do a
little short that's found footage from
the 80s i just bought you get it ok cool
I don't know what I'm doing this weekend
now I do yeah I'll put all this stuff is
gonna be great I was thinking about that
but snapchat like it's cuz it'll take
your video filter and crop it or no it
has both widescreen and 43 so we're
three close to swear so you as long as
you're okay like I think it actually has
um like there's there should be enough
space to give you a fully square with
still the time stamp the date and time
stamp on so you could you technically
you could make Instagram video for this
but I love it it's like so weird and
just I love AV apps I got photo apps and
video apps like I download them all the
time so I saw this got very excited and
man I just got it i'm gonna make 80s
videos
my life all my life yeah that's great I
love both of ours are camera-based oh
okay what are you so mine is also and
i'm way behind the times on this one but
I've been into light painting there's
this week because I actually did a DIY
with another company so to about light
painting how to do and I just like we
were just we had a new idea every single
time but if you don't know what light
painting is it's basically a long
exposure photo that you take or you move
light around and it creates crazy shapes
and it basically looks like magic and
and people have been doing this forever
this is not new but there's not by far
everything hasn't been done before yeah
so like I did one where I was facing a
wall and it made it look like I was
peeing on the wall um I did one where I
stood in one place and I made it look
like I was the flash cuz i had like
streaks Oh running behind me um yeah
it's just a fun thing to goof around
with like if you have if you think you
haven't done this with your camera yet
it's just fun to mess around with and
you can do this with your cell phone
yeah as long as you can find a way to
like steady your phone so yeah it's it's
just a it's just a fun thing to goof
around with if you've got some free time
and you're in the dark and what's gonna
light that up some sort of light yeah
and you can create lit it's a very DIY
thing and you can like I said create
really interesting like Facebook photos
or cover photos and yeah just a fun
thing that I hadn't tried out until this
week again it's nothing new but the new
for you it's a blast yeah that's cool no
I dig that and I feel like if you
haven't tried it light painting like
kill said it's pretty easy and their
apps on Android and iOS that allow you
to you can get slow shutter app so you
can do like long exposure I've got some
slow shutter actually that's what I have
to yeah I do that for like
astrophotography for like stars and
stuff um but yeah so that's where into
let us know what you're into in the
comments way we're dying to know we're
being about you I want to see if you
make any of the camcorder yeah send us
your kids your your VHS camcorder
footage or send us your light you're
like photos sensual I photos um alright
guys let's talk about you it's time for
your user feedback
yesterday we asked already use TD 20 22
say what they wanted to see at the tokyo
olympics opening ceremonies yeah preston
some pretty good ones by the way they
say Tupac no sadly um Jeb but you know
honestly he's in hiding so he's probably
doesn't hang out in a place of Internet
she probably doesn't watch the show he's
actually hiding he's actually producer
Logan yeah I don't know if you guys show
don't tell anybody but Prue slogan is
actually to pakka disguise um so right
is that right he does say that all the
time that is to park at first it's a
hundred percent to buck alright so we
asked you guys see 2020 and deric ruttan
said I want a Japanese robot that will
give me a front-row seat into every
Olympic venue wait what oh yeah I like
they has this robot going for him like
saving him a chair like it's like oh I
just saved my seat I'm asleep for ok
cool i like that i like his emojis
though yeah gives all the different
olympic sports i was amazing you should
enter the olympic games for emojis there
probably will be an emoji olympics oh
man uh and then Neil wrote and said have
mario and sonic race Usain Bolt see
who's fastest i'm guessing mr. bolt i
love that it's like augmented reality
races with characters from video games
there would be soul mates I'll be more
into it to see sonic get like destroyed
and then be like depressed sand like
loses his scholarship behind the behind
the music yeah see him addict to smash
Usain Bolt added to smash brothers that
would be amazing gets dark real fast
it's yeah gets so dark and then Michael
wrote in and said flying toasters so
that the sky can be turned into a giant
screen saver an extent in the the flying
toasters dancer I love that really well
done why can't we have flying toasters
just in general just around I kind of
like I still do this day like I still
want once we get really inexpensive
foldable screens I'm dying to have a
whole wall but that is like a screen
that I can just program i do like flying
toasters or just color whatever it is
that I feel like that day I can just
like look it up and just put it up on
the wall they have that I thought you
bought one well it's not about that
picture frames yeah that's just canvas
but like no I'm talking about i got
Holt like wallpaper like you could
literally connect them in like roles oh
yeah and then like make your whole wall
a screen that you can program it you can
just put like like just active video on
it or Never but like these billig nudes
yeah put up your nudes whatever yeah
kels takes a lot of those I'm sorry
hahaha these sense of Tamia bruiser love
with the new testament yeah like
strangers like I mean I don't know
what's going on there in the chi yeah in
the comments leave your phone number

fancy photos no please please on all
accounts don't do that um so we gotta
talk did you just wink at everybody
Thursday what up so my favorite all
right we got to talk about our very last
piece to user feedback was our phone
talker for the day hi that was maybe my
favorite moment of all time on the show
um alright Leo wrote in he's not a lion
not a real live lion um so calm down
Lions can't use phones yet he sent in
this photo he says there's a whole nice
story with this is an amazing picture by
the way hello I took this beautiful
photo of my iphone 5s want a camping
trip in a group in northern Utah we

got out of my tent I chose to take a
shot hope you enjoy using this photo
