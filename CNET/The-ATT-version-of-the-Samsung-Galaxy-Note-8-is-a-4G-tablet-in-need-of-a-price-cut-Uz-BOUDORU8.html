Note 8 was released earlier this year
and now AT&amp;amp;T has picked up this cellular
model for US release however unlike the
foreign version you still won't be able
to use it as a phone the AMT version of
the note 8 is physically the same as a
Wi-Fi version it has the same light
comfortable design and S Pen Stylus is
just as capable check out the first up
video for the Wi-Fi only version of the
note 8 for more details on just what
those capabilities are the interface has
all the shortcuts and the huge
collection of software features you'd
expect like reading mode multi window
and smart stay where display turns off
but the camera doesn't detect your eyes
you can also get data usage info
straight from the settings menu and set
mobile data limit 4G coverage in San
Francisco was about typical for AT&amp;amp;T
which is to say usually fine spotty in
certain areas and downright non-existent
in others download speeds were fast as
long as the signal was strong your
mileage of course will vary depending on
where you live performances on par with
the Wi-Fi only version with a really
colorful sharp screen smooth navigation
performance great 2d games performance
and fine 3d games performance my biggest
issue with the Wi-Fi only version that
Note 8 was its price that continues to
be a concern here the AT&amp;amp;T version of
the note 8 cost $500 for 16 gigabytes of
storage off contract that's about $100
more than you Wi-Fi own version if you
sign up for two-year contract you can
get one for $400 the same price as the
Wi-Fi only version not exactly what I'd
refer to as a deal however everything
that made the note 8 such a good tablet
the first time around is still here just
even more expensive now for more
information check out my full review at
cnet.com I'm Eric Franklin and this has
been a first look at AT&amp;amp;T version of the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8
