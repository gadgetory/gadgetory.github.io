with me that's it i'm chadwick boseman I
am an artist people call me an actor I
wouldn't necessarily call myself an
actor I will call myself an artist when
you initially hear that they're doing
that the Black Panther movie I think
it's like huh really is that gonna work
who's gonna go see it I wasn't sure if
it was the right time it was just the
challenge that I needed and I knew it I
have to do this I love that he thinks
about other people everybody has sort of
heard the line it's hard for a good man
to be king you know as much as he's a
superhero he's he's like The Godfather
you know I'm saying it's him learning
what it means to take on the throne
that's the journey tell me something
what do you dove this is utopia it's a
place where spirituality and science do
not war with each other obviously on
this planet were battling with that the
idea that what Conner was so advanced
was something that was always there but
I think the development of Sheree is
like that character it gives it an
identity that's something that the movie
is fine I think people are gonna really
really love her she's the Tony Stark in
the movie it's a Charlie is
technologically sound but she's the
person in control of that and she in our
cabinet you know she's the Minister of
Technology
what's been surprising today I haven't
met one person was like man I want to go
see the Black Panther movie I hope the
movie can live up to that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
