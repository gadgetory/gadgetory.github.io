today in a residential garden in
Louisville Kentucky taking a look at the
Eden Garden sensor you place the Eden
Garden sensor into the soil near your
plants from there it connects to your
home's Wi-Fi network and sends you
information on soil moisture nutrition
temperature humidity and ambient light
it uses that information to help you
care for your garden and it's specific
plants and you can check on its readings
via its iOS or Android app excited about
this plant sensor for a long time it was
designed by yves behar sperm fuse
project and it looks beautiful as a
whole the hardware of this thing does
really well it's very sturdy it was
aiming to be the perfect plant sensor
and as far as the device itself and the
readings it's hitting close to that mark
we tested it over the course of two
weeks in a potted plant against a
calibrated meter and over the course of
that time the readings matched up with
our own very well so the hardware here
is pretty darn good
unfortunately the software is really not
you know when the app is working at its
best it's buzzing
sometimes it's unresponsive other times
it's straight up freezes text overlaps
buttons it's always slow even steady
images on the screen will jump around
giving it a really unprofessional
unfinished feel and unfortunately those
are just the annoyances on the surface
go deeper than that and you see that the
plant database that's in here doesn't
actually really inform the data it's
giving you or the recommendations that
it's populating to try and help you take
care of your plants go ahead and add
your garden specific plants to Eton's
app based garden but it won't actually
have any effect on the thresholds in
uses to send you care based
recommendations at other times the app
crashed on me completely apparently my
case was an isolated case and doesn't
happen often but I added a specific
plant that apparently caused a glitch in
the system and I couldn't get the app to
do any of this
eva's checked all the right boxes here
the Wi-Fi signal means you can check
everything remotely and it measures more
criteria than the other smart plant
sensors I've tested so it's still
showing a lot of promise for the future
it's just not ready for the present for
more be sure to check out my full review
