Apple buy for everything good and bad
inside the world of Apple the big news
this week the all-new 12-inch MacBooks
are here the new skylake processors
bring a 15 to 18 percent faster CPU
performance and dis write speeds are up
80 to 90 percent as well
the 41 watt hour battery gives you an
extra hour battery life for roughly 10
hours total but some of the drawbacks
includes still using a 480p FaceTime
camera and no Thunderbolt 3 or ddr4 Ram
with an entry-level price starting at
$12.99 they could have at least given us
one of those three omissions it still
keeps the same form factor so it won't
be able to out thin the HP Spectre that
we showed off to you last week but the
good news the previous generation 12
inch macbook refurbished starts at 929
which is a steal if you're just using
this for email word processing and
YouTube like most people are but the
bigger story line of me is that by
announcing these now instead of waiting
for WWDC I'm really hoping for a huge
focus and really some surprises with the
next-gen MacBook Pros I'll write rumors
for the new MacBook Pros and claims will
see a lot slimmer form factor and a
report from digit I'm supports that they
say the new MacBooks will feature an
all-new hinge design created by metal
injection molding that will allow the
laptop to be much slimmer and will be
supplied by Amphenol Amphenol currently
makes components for this company named
Microsoft that has this ultra-thin
device called the surface pro that also
features a special hinge part now WWDC
is officially set for June the 13th to
the 17th in San Francisco after Siri let
the news leak before Apple even made the
official announcement Apple will be
holding the same WWDC ticket lottery as
last year so you have until Friday the
22nd to register for your chance to go
but if you aren't a religious Apple buy
viewer and you're watching this on
Saturday and it's too late for you now
I'm sorry but that's a bad apple
on you now even check out their homepage
with a little bit of code it says hello
WWDC hi alright one thing that Apple
hasn't announced but I'm sure we'll see
at the keynote is that Mac OS 10 will be
changed to Mac OS or you know maybe they
could just class it up by calling it
Bacchus
it was written that way on their
environmental report page but has since
been changed since rumor sites started
talking about buckles alright we've
heard these rumblings before but fast
company reports Apple is secretly
pursuing original programming deals to
establish itself as a player it's
reported to be seeking deals with Triple
A List talent to create a full roster of
shows and put it on par with Netflix and
Amazon and others now Apple held private
invite-only events at last year's
Sundance Film Festival and is looking to
talent and Studios in Los Angeles for
original show ideas but they're gonna
have to play catch-up after Netflix
announced it was spending already six
billion dollars on content for just 2016
in the iPhone rumor of the week KGI
Securities analyst Ming Chi quo keeps
his name in the news this time by
claiming the rumor of 2017 iPhone that
is expected to bring AMOLED displays
produced by Samsung will switch to a non
aluminum casing and return to the iPhone
4s like all glass body
to allow for an all-new form factor
design that same glass casing that
shattered all the time and galaxy s7
owners are now feeling that same 4s pain
and you all know how much I dearly love
my iPad pro wallpaper reports Johnny
Ives design team helped create a
one-of-a-kind iPad pro that's been
anodized with a bright yellow dye a
smart cover made from blue French
leather and an Apple pencil covered by
orange Italian leather
it will be auctioned off as part of a
fundraiser for the London Design Museum
with an estimate of ten to fifteen
thousand pounds or around 14 to 21
thousand US dollars
unfortunately no reports confirm if it
will include the faster USBC charger or
USB see the lightning cable which you'll
most likely have to pay extra for to
charge it just like I did all right
that's going to do it for this week's
show you can always email us at the
Apple
CNET calm or tweet me at Brian Tong
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
you all next time for another bite of
the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
