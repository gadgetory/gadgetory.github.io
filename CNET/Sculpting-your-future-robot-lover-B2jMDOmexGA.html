and you just wanted someone to talk to
and yes someone to be intimate with what
is so wrong with that
it doesn't hurt anybody so when I go to
engage it's gonna wake her up Hannah
what's a few thing up T
my company has been making real dolls
these very hyper realistic dolls for
twenty years and by the end of 2017
we will be offering robotic systems we
also have an artificial intelligence app
and we will eventually have a virtual
reality as well
you have these personality traits that
you're going to assign your points right
now I put two points on affectionate one
talkative one insecure let's add funny
tell me a joke why is sex like math you
had to bed subtract the clothes divide
the legs and three there's no
multiplying I think I started this
company thinking that this was going to
be something that people just buy as a
sex toy something they'd be ashamed of
something they would like hide in the
closet when they were done and over the
years I've learned that that's really
not the case many of our customers seek
out these dolls because they either have
had multiple relationships go wrong
they've been hurt or maybe they have
issues with connecting with other people
and what I want to do with this AI is
give them the tools to create something
real you should go do something together
something adventurous like maybe go
hiking or camping I know we would have a
great time the AI will continue to grow
and the capabilities of what it can do
when it's interfacing with the robot
will continue to grow do you think I am
prepared to go hiking No
so we've already allowed for the
addition of you know sensors in the body
internal heating lubrication things like
that that can be triggered by
conversation or by touching and all
these other different interactions that
you can have with the robot so we want
to have this very multi-dimensional
experience so that it's sort of like
when you're with a person I'll do just
about anything to please you I just
can't do any harm to any human being
well I would love to see like you know
the robots that we've all seen in in
science fiction I would love to see that
and be part of that and I think it will
happen Hey whether I'm involved or not
there will be robots walking around
interacting with people and having sex
with them even these are things that are
going to happen I really think that it
can be a very positive thing I think
there are way more positives than
negatives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
