for over 15 years and it served us so
well but as we look at it alongside its
younger brethren something sticks out we
realize that there's a name that would
be so much clearer and so much more
elegant and so we're making it so the
name of the world's most advanced
desktop operating system is now Mac OS
today when you first approached your mac
to use it the experience is something
like this you open it up you're
confronted with a password field and you
type and then maybe miss type and then
retype your password and then you're in
and using your Mac but you know for many
of us we already have a device securely
authenticated to our wrists that already
knows who we are and could tell our mac
and so then when we opened our Mac it
could be a little bit more like this and
we're in it's that simple the next
continuity feature in mac OS sierra is
universal clipboard now
Wow gasps so
but I know copy and paste is so
fundamental to the way that we use our
max for so many years now but what if
when you're on even your iPhone and you
found some text and you just went to
copy it that when you then went to your
Mac well you could just paste it right
in and now you can with images video
everything completely automatic we're
bringing Apple pay to the web so now
when you're shopping online you'll have
a pay with Apple pay button available to
you when you click it a sheet comes down
actually prompts you to securely
authenticate your purchase using
continuity right on your iPhone with
touch ID this year I'd like to take the
unusual step of letting this feature
introduced itself hi it's me it sure is
great to be on the Mac how about a demo
that's right siri coming to the map</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
