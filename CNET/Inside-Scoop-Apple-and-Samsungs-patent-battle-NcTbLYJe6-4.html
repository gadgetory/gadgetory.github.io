here with Josh Lowen sin' staff writer
also at C net and Josh we are talking
Apple versus Samsung the trial is about
to start
give us the trial in a nutshell what are
we talking about here so this is really
Apple and Samsung fighting for market
supremacy Apple is basically saying
Samsung you ripped off our stuff and
Samsung is saying well you couldn't have
had the iPhone in the iPad without our
technology so these two are really going
head-to-head to Duke it out in court
this comes down to patents that's what
we're talking about yeah a lot of it's
just about the technology Samsung is
arguing it they really created some of
the wireless technology that goes into
Apple's products and Apple is saying
well you know your products couldn't
really looked like they do or been able
to be used like they do without our
technology and some examples of that
might be the pinch-to-zoom
for example that you see on iPhones and
iPads they're claiming that Samsung
ripped off some of that those design
details right and that really all comes
back to Google's Android operating
system which is what these products were
on Apple went over after HTC they went
after Motorola they're going after other
companies besides Samsung but it's
really kind of the biggest face to face
in terms of the phones they're attacking
what is potential consequence of this
trial I mean say say Apple wins what
happens to all of those Samsung products
and we're talking dozens of Samsung
products that supposedly use this
technology right so in the case of this
matter it's really all about getting
Samsung's
stuff off the shelves Apple wants to
keep it from being on sale and they also
kind of want to make Samsung change
their products to be more friendly and
not infringe on their patents at the
same token Samsung wants to keep Apple
stuff off the shelves too or at least
get some sort of royalty payment what's
probably gonna happen so that they're
gonna shake hands and make a side deal
and settle and just City you can use our
pens we can use yours everybody gets a
little bit of money right because at
some point I know some patent experts
have said it's really hard to stake your
claim on this technology that is really
just the evolution of where the
technology has been I mean is there any
ownership to that it is but it's also a
really deep rabbit hole to go into I
mean when you start talking about things
like interface elements you go back to
these kind of computing concepts of the
70s and
so it can really kind of stretch out so
we don't really know if that's gonna
happen with this trial yet but there's a
lot of potential
so right now impact a consumer is not a
whole lot I mean if you own your current
Samsung phone you're gonna be fine with
it
but as far as that next model you may
not see it on store shelves yeah that's
that's kind of what makes this case
interesting is we don't really know
what's gonna come out of it in terms of
change you know if Apple really gets in
a position where they can make Samsung
changes products that would be a big win
for them but it also would changed the
course of devices to come a lot riding
on this run and it'll be interesting to
follow over the next couple of months
Thank You Josh yeah Josh lonesome staff
