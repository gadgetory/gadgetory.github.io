at CES and I'm talking to Brian lamb the
founder of swivel swivel makes this
incredible sort of robot camera tell us
what it does well it's a personal
cameraman in a mobile accessory what it
does it makes it very easy for you to
video yourself without the camera person
there and what we found is that the
camera person makes people nervous when
they're on camera right these are
flubbing lines or if they're swinging a
golf club they missed the ball so this
gives them a way to capture video
without the normal emotions associated
with it and show me I mean what are the
features how does it work yep so it's
got a panning functionality that
constantly moving basically you can
forget about it and it follows you
around you can also frame yourself
vertically so you can see that if you're
short or tall you can get your video
this brings remote controls so record
start/stop still pictures as well as
audio so it brings a microphone so
totally cool what's the use case who
needs it biggest response we got was
youtubers on you know doing daily vlogs
putting out content a regular basis but
then we got a huge response from people
in education real estate people doing
video chat on a regular basis
particularly multitasking if you're
making dinner you want a video chat now
you just throw this on you walk around
the kitchen and now you can actually
have a nice conversation in video chat
there's a lot of really cool mainstream
uses for it when is it available and how
much does it cost we're available in the
next couple months and it's a hundred
fifty nine dollars you can reserve one
on our site right now and when we first
ship of course we'll be starting to take
credit cards at that point thanks so
much thank you I'm Paul Sloan with seen
it here at CES
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
