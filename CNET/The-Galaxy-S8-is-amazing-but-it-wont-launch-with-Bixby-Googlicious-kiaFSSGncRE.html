google issues for all the Google you
could think of let's get to the show and
Samsung needs a win with their next
phone and according to reports
pre-orders for the galaxy s eight are
higher than expected now the on have
news reports Samsung's president of
mobile communications says pre-orders
have been stronger than the company
expected with seven hundred twenty
thousand units pre-ordered ingest the
first seven days in South Korea alone
now us stats are currently unknown but
analysts are predicting South Korean
sales to jump over 1 million units
before the phone officially goes on sale
on April the 21st so it shouldn't
surprise any of us that Samsung is
working on the galaxy SI active for AT&amp;amp;T
now pointing to sammobile the s8 active
is codenamed cruiser and the variant
will most likely be an ATT exclusive
we'll see how this changes the design to
be more durable like the active line
it's expected to bring a larger battery
for increased endurance but the specs of
the phone should pretty much remain the
same now one big fail with the galaxy s
8 Samsung's bixby voice assistant won't
be ready for the phones lunch and
according to a statement from Samsung
Bixby's voice search functionality won't
be ready until later this spring you
know it's just one of its brand new
flagship features alongside its all-new
design come on son and yes I don't have
my sign with me right now so i use my
stunt double don't instead now there
were even people who are able to remap
the galaxy s eights dedicated bixby
button to launch google now instead you
can see it here but samsung be like nah
and has blocked the remapping of the Big
C button on the s8 with an over-the-air
update so your voice feature isn't even
making it to launch and you won't let
people use that button for something
else since it will be completely useless
until vicks me releases and that's if
someone even wants to use BIC speed come
on son and there's another stunt double
it's Jason even better now the Android
seven-point 1.2 update finished rolling
out to Android devices last week but
users in google forms are claiming it's
broken the fingerprint sensor for google
pixel and nexus phone owners attempts to
delete pre-existing fingerprints and
starting from scratch haven't worked to
fix it some people are reporting that
the option to use the fingerprint to
unlock your phone has also disappeared
from the settings
you and yeah that's a bad Google or
Google because lots of you want a bad
apple equivalent when Google messes up
so for now it's Boogle unless you have
something better and a fix should
hopefully be coming in the next week or
so but until then you'll have to use
your pass code which is so 2014 alright
Google's photos has officially added a
video stabilization feature that helps
smooth out your own videos and the proof
is in the pudding look at this
comparison by reddit user Daniel damn
Daniel it's pretty amazing what it can
do after you shot the video the app goes
through the clip frame by frame to make
its Corrections and this is just
flat-out impressive so check it out and
new FCC filings have revealed that
Google is working on a new google Wi-Fi
already even if the original one was
just released back in december of last
year now it will still be a dual-band
Wi-Fi router with mesh networking
capabilities and the images show it will
be slightly oval in shape compared to
the original circle-shaped base it will
also have two Ethernet ports and one for
power now rumors have pointed to the
next Google home having mesh Wi-Fi
networking capabilities as a combination
with its smart speaker but this looks to
be there next standalone Wi-Fi router
and finally YouTube has dropped its
10,000 subscriber requirement for mobile
live streaming and has now changed that
to 1,000 subscribers back in February
they made the live streaming straight
from your phone or tablet in the YouTube
app available when it first rolled out
the service of the chopped Ian that
really was a lot of server issues but
I'm willing to give it another chance
because we all deserve a second chance
in life all right that's going to do it
for this week you can email me at Google
it's just at cnet com or tweet me at
brian Tong thanks what you're watching
it we'll catch y'all next time for some
more of that Google Isha's
