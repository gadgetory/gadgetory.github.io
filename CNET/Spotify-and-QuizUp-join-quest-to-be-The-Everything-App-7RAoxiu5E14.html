to be your every app I'm Bridget Carey
this is your cnet update Spotify has
made a name for itself as a music app
you can stream some pre-made playlists
or craft your own mix and if you pay ten
dollars a month you can even pick and
choose the songs you want to hear on
demand on the go but now Spotify is
becoming a video app featuring clips of
news and entertainment programming
Spotify is just the latest app to push
video on users and there are a few
reasons for that for one there's more
money to be made with video
advertisements compared to audio ads and
to Spotify just wants to get you sucked
into its app for a longer stretch of
your day Spotify even said it wants to
be a 24-7 app that you never close where
you can also watch exclusive clips
Spotify is just the latest app on the
quest to be your everything app you see
it in facebook obviously with the
network pushing more video and news and
you see it in snapchat as it features
more video entertainment but adding more
places to watch video isn't something
the world needs it's not solving a
consumer problem frankly there are too
many choices for where to watch videos
but Spotify is hoping extra features
help it stand apart from competing
services Apple is expecting to reveal
something similar to Spotify very soon
but the most unique part of Spotify
update has nothing to do with video if
you're listening while on a jog the app
is able to play music that matches the
speed of your run the phone's
accelerometer is tracking your steps and
plays music with a beat that matches
your stride even app games are not
immune to the temptations of becoming
the everything app the trivia game
quizup has updated to become a social
network quizup launched in 2013
encouraging you to challenge friends and
strangers around the world but now it
wants you to stay after the game to chat
and connect with others that share your
same interests it even has something
like a news feed for you to post photos
also you can spend more time of your
life for looking at your phone and
writing comments to people you don't
know and YouTube is hoping to become a
big
your destination for the video game
community YouTube added the ability to
stream live video at 60 frames per
second that makes it a better platform
for gamers to share their video game
footage in real time the high frame
rates are important for gaming streams
and right now the most popular
destination for sharing footage is
twitch that's owned by amazon so if you
wonder who googles biggest competitor is
just look to amazon it may not have that
everything app but the everything store
is a powerful rival when it comes to
search that's your tech news update be

goodness from our studios in New York
