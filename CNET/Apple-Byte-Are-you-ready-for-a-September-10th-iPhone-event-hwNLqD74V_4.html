welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
let's get to the show and the big news
of the week comes from all things D
reports their sources have told them and
really it's Apple who's told them that
Apple will unveil their next iPhone at a
special event on sep tember the 10 now
the iphone is seen its global share
dropped with heavy competition from
samsung and other android phones so
we'll see if they target the mid-range
market with the rumored iphone 5c and
what will the next gen iphone really
have in store for us so now that you
know the date Circle it on your calendar
it's probably a good time to get your
phone ready to sell on ebay like right
now now in iphone news it's believed the
iphone 5s will end up using a convex
home button that's made out of sapphire
to make space for the rumored
fingerprint sensor according to KGI
analyst ming-chi kuo this would be a
change since the home button has been
concave curving in words in the past but
the new rumors imply that it will curve
outwards or slightly bulge I said bold
sapphire is very resilient to scratches
it's also very pretty and the thinking
is it will also protect the fingerprint
sensor that's embedded inside now
website nowhere else fr showed off a new
part this week that they claim is the
rear panel of the iPhone 5s it shows a
few internal design tweaks with
different screw placement along the back
of the device but also shows a different
metal spacer cushion that supports the
rumoured revamped home button as well
and Japanese blog Macotakara is chiming
in and is reporting that the iPhone 5s
is camera will remain at eight
megapixels but will feature a wider F 2
point 0 aperture that captures more
light while taking pictures and
conflicts most reports that claim a 12
megapixel camera is coming now they're
also sticking with earlier claims that
the iphone 5s will be available in black
white and a gold color option and
several photo leaks have previously
shown iphone 5s parse described as a
gold or champagne color can you say all
gold everything
don't believe me yeah go the left in my
jacket o gold all up in my turban whoa
Bloomberg jumping in on the iPad rumor
mills with the report that iPads will
come in a separate key note from the
iphone which has happened the past two
years so there's no big surprise there
they say the same things we've talked
about a 9.7 inch iPad that's thinner and
takes design cues from the ipad mini
with a thinner bezel but for some reason
we do happen to see the ipad at this
year September event with the iphone i
would expect something big real big in
october from apple all right there were
a lot of leaked images so let's get
through the iphone parts that i saw this
week online first up you want buttons
we've got buttons rumored colored volume
buttons for the iphone 5c in red or blue
now what about the top of the strip of
the iphone 5s rear shell that shows a
hole big enough to support the rumored
dual LED flash you got it and if the
iphone 5c comes in colors let's check it
out in yellow from sunny Dixon's blog
awesome ok I'm done with that let's get
to the quick bites and the iCloud beta
pains recently got a makeover with new
icons for mail contacts calendars and
more and overall design cues from iOS 7
in those apps now the iwork apps for
iCloud are still using the previous
icons also plants vs zombies 2 is coming
out on the App Store and should be there
by the time you're watching this more
zombies more plants but we'll see how
their free-to-play model works for this
version of the game and how that all
works out and in international news the
Korean government has initiated the
Korean Steve Jobs project that's what
they're calling it and it's a project
designed to foster creativity and
passion into young students studying
software development and not dancing a
Gangnam style whooping cottenham star
